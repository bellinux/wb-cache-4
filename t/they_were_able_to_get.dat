5|$|Ralphie V {{took the}} field with the {{football}} team {{for the first time}} at the spring game on April 19, 2008. In her pre-game run Ralphie ran perfectly, but slipped out of her harness at the very start of the halftime run, bumping, but not trampling, one handler and shedding all but one of her other handlers. Zeb Kopasz was the only handler to hold on to her. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her under control on the far 25-yard line and return her to her trailer.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} time since their 15–1 season of 1998 that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> 40+ points in {{back-to-back}} games.|$|E
25|$|On February 28, 1999, 15 {{people were}} {{stranded}} on a ride {{for a few}} minutes before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off. No serious injuries were reported, although six people complained of dizziness and neck pain.|$|E
50|$|Another success <b>was</b> that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{meet with}} {{hundreds}} of other international female delegates. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> network and get their message heard internationally.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{break down}} polymers, lysosomes {{are capable of}} fusing with other organelles & digesting large structures or cellular debris; through cooperation with phagosomes, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> conduct autophagy, clearing out damaged structures. Similarly, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> break-down virus particles or bacteria in phagocytosis of macrophages.|$|R
30|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> notice, realise and {{understand}} the system.|$|R
25|$|Religion {{was of a}} {{personal}} matter to the recruits. A minister of sorts was usually on site for services. For Jewish girls, it was custom that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to their barracks by sundown on Sabbath and holidays; a rabbi would be made available if possible.|$|E
25|$|The second block matches {{took place}} on January 29 and again started with a battle royal to {{determine}} the order of matches.The match included El Sagrado, Ray Mendoza Jr., Stuka Jr.La Máscara, Rush, Sangre Azteca, Toscano and Valiente with Ray Mendoza Jr. and Stuka Jr. being the last two men in the ring. In the first round El Sagrado and Shocker defeated Rey Bucanero and Valiente, taking {{full advantage of the}} fact that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along without problems.|$|E
25|$|Flyer's {{career was}} almost ended at midnight on 14 June 1892, by a fire which started {{when she was}} taking on wood for fuel at the Commercial Dock in Seattle. Within five minutes the fire had swept through the vessel. The fireboat Snoqualmie and all {{available}} units of the Seattle fire department, under Chief Gardner Kellogg, responded to the fire. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the fire under control before serious damage was done to the hull or machinery. However, all of the vessel's upper works were destroyed. Flyer was quickly rebuilt and returned to service {{by the end of}} the summer of 1892. She made four daily round-trips between Seattle and Tacoma.|$|E
50|$|As a result, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> grow up {{with their}} own people, and learn {{traditional}} law and language, management practices of their country and how to live off the land. Recently, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> successfully claim continuous ownership of traditional lands, and retain custody of some land at Gno-Coom (Saxby Waterhole).|$|R
6000|$|And again, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> absolve {{and make}} a human {{creature}} free and [...] loose from all his sins, if in case he repenteth and believeth in [...] Christ; and on the contrary, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> detain all his sina, if [...] he doth not repent and believeth not in Christ.|$|R
50|$|Questions {{have been}} raised over how the militants <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> attack a {{settlement}} so close to army headquarters in Maiduguri, how <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> have likely driven past roads patrolled by soldiers and vigilantes unhindered and how <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> attack the village for several hours before the army intervened and drove them out.|$|R
25|$|Swanson invited Will Hays {{for lunch}} and {{summarized}} the plot, naming the author and the sticking points. According to Swanson, Hays made a verbal promise {{that he would have}} no problem with the making of such a film. Swanson set about getting the rights to the play by having Schenck pretend to buy it in the name of United Artists, never to be used. Thus <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the story rights for $60,000 instead of the original $100,000. When news broke as to just what was intended with the play, the three authors threatened to sue. Swanson later contacted Maugham requesting that he write an original story that served as a sequel. The sequel would involve following what became of Sadie in Australia. Maugham agreed to write a new story (for $100,000) but a sequel was never made.|$|E
25|$|The band's {{first tour}} was in {{supporting}} The Red Chord across the United Kingdom. As with other early tours, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> this slot by tricking venue promoters. Kean and Oliver's mother Carol Sykes were {{the de facto}} managers of the band at this time, a role they continued to occupy right up until 2008. For The Red Chord support, Kean emailed promoters and pretended they were opening {{on all of the}} dates, when in reality they were supposed to only play at their local show. This led them to being booked for the whole tour. In another case, Sykes created an e-mail account in the name of Johnny Truant vocalist Oliver Mitchell, which he used to contact a promoter requesting Bring Me the Horizon on their tour. Their live performances in their early history were fueled by alcohol consumption where the band would get so drunk they would vomit on stage and would damage their own equipment.|$|E
25|$|During the {{campaign}} in February 1816, Ochterlony {{decided to take a}} very infrequently used pass through the mountains. The failure {{there would have been a}} disaster for British. But the successful passage would allow Birith to directly emerge and attack the Nepalese's rear. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O’Hollorah followed the river Bagmati to reach Hariharpur Gadhi. Some of the heads of villagers were bribed for sensitive information about the defensive positions in the area of Hariharpur Gadhi. The information seriously compromised the Nepalese defences. Secret routes would have given the enemy advantage even if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> only a battalion through. But the British were able to advance with more than a brigade’s strength. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O’Hollorah launched their attack from two different directions on 29 February. The Nepalese troops were eventually driven back from Hariharpur Gadhi after a big battle. Kaji Ranjore Singh Thapa withdrew to Sindhuli Gadhi to link up with Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa. The British troops did not approach Sindhuli Gadhi and fell back to Makawanpur by the end of March 1815 AD.|$|E

25|$|Ledley {{scored in}} the first match of the 2006–07 season, the opener in a 2–1 win over Barnsley. He then scored several weeks later, as Cardiff City beat fellow {{promotion}} contenders Birmingham City, 2–0, to move top of the table. At this match Cardiff City had a full stadium, 20,000 fans, {{for the first time}} in over 45 years. This signalled their growing momentum in the league and the belief within the club that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> promoted. Ledley was identified as one of the key players in Cardiff City's team, his pace on the left wing being vital to their tenacious style of play. On 25 September, Ledley scored in a 3–0 win over Southend United to confirm Cardiff's status as early season favourites. Cardiff entered the FA Cup at the third round and drew Tottenham Hotspur. The match ended 0–0 but Ledley had an excellent chance to put Cardiff City in the lead after 55 miuntes, he got on the end of a cross but hit his shot just over the bar. The match went to a replay and Tottenham Hotspur won 4–0 at White Hart Lane on 17 January. On 2 February Ledley suffered a hamstring injury in a 2–0 win over Barnsley. At the end of the season he picked up the Football League goal of the season award for his strike against Barnsley.|$|E
500|$|The three {{leaders of}} the {{movement}} were all aristocrats, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the support of their family and friends {{as well as the}} King. In Pope's view [...] "this close link between the monks and the nobles is ultimately {{the most important factor in}} the success of the reform". Wormald agrees, stating that aristocratic support for monastic reform was more important for its success than royal or papal sponsorship. The aristocracy did not confine their support to reformed foundations, but continued to donate to unreformed ones.|$|E
500|$|On September 29, 1998, Slipknot left Des Moines, Iowa for Indigo Ranch Studios in Malibu, California, {{anxious to}} record an album {{after a long}} wait to be signed. They {{released}} this demo to prospective labels and producers; the track [...] "Spit It Out" [...] was {{the main focus of}} the demo and, with help from their manager Sophia John, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a copy of the eponymous demo to Ross Robinson. The band wanted him to work with them on their debut album and after meeting with the band Robinson signed them to his own label, I Am, but later helped sign them to Roadrunner Records.|$|E
50|$|Together with Betaproteobacteria such as Thiomonas intermedia, Halothiobacillus species play an {{important}} role in global carbon and sulfur cycles. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> depend entirely on inorganic compounds (CO2 and reduced sulfur) for their carbon and energy needs. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> promote corrosion of concrete, acidification of mine tailings, and bioleaching of low-grade ores.|$|R
50|$|S-10 {{had hoped}} to {{retrieve}} a Micrometeorite Collector from the ATDA, though this failed after <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unable to dock with it. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> image it though during their close approaches. Instead <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> recover the collector from the Gemini spacecraft (S-12). D-12 also failed as it was an investigation of controlling the AMU.|$|R

500|$|The first Street & Smith {{issue was}} dated October 1933; until the third issue, in December 1933, the {{editorial}} team was not named on the masthead. [...] Street & Smith {{had an excellent}} distribution network, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Astoundings circulation up to an estimated 50,000 {{by the middle of}} 1934. [...] The two main rival science-fiction magazines of the day, Wonder Stories and Amazing Stories, each had a circulation about half that. [...] Astounding was the leading science-fiction magazine by the end of 1934, and it was also the largest, at 160 pages, and the cheapest, at 20 cents. [...] Street & Smith's rates of one cent per word (sometimes more) on acceptance were not as high as the rates paid by Bates for the Clayton Astounding, but they were still better than those of the other magazines.|$|E
500|$|In September 2006, Jumper {{was filmed}} at various {{locations}} in Peterborough, Ontario and principal photography began in Toronto in October. In December 2006, Liman {{negotiated with the}} Rome Film Commission for rare access to film for three days in the Colosseum. The scene in the Colosseum was originally written for the Pantheon, at which exterior shots were also filmed. The crew was required to keep equipment off the ground by using harnesses and {{had to rely on}} natural light for filming. Filming took place for 45 minutes in the morning and in the evening so as not to disturb the public touring the amphitheater throughout the day. In order to maximize the short period for filming, four steadicams were set up to ensure time was not wasted in reloading the camera. A visual effects supervisor explained how visual effects were needed for various aspects after filming: [...] "There were three kinds of shots: there were shots where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> most of what they needed in the Collosseum itself; and then there were shots on a set that needed extensions beyond the limits of the set; and then there were shots where we needed to create the Coliseum basically from scratch." [...] After filming in Rome, scenes were filmed in Toronto during December 2006 to January 2007 and wrapped at the Canadian location on January 19. On January 26 in Toronto, 56-year-old David Ritchie, a set dresser, was fatally struck by frozen debris while dismantling an outdoor set in wintry conditions. Another worker was injured and was sent to a hospital with serious head and shoulder injuries. After Toronto, the cast and crew traveled to Tokyo to film scenes. One scene required over 30 shoots as the scene could only be filmed in between traffic light changes. As a result of director Liman insisting Christensen perform his own stunts, the actor injured his hand, split open his ear, and developed a hyperdilated pupil that required hospital care while filming various scenes. In February 2007, the next filming site was set up at Gallup Park in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Sixty students from the nearby Huron High School were cast as extras for the film. Since additional filming was required of the area, twenty other students were used for a day of filming in September. Altogether, filming took place in 20 cities in 14 countries.|$|E

2500|$|Romney {{ordered his}} {{engineering}} department {{to develop an}} in-house V8 as soon as possible. The engineering department hired David Potter, a former Kaiser Motors engineer, to help develop the engine. Potter had previously worked on a V8 design for Kaiser, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the all new V8 into production in less than 18 months. [...] This was an exceptional engineering feat considering this is before electronic computers, and engineers of the day used slide rules for the many calculations.|$|E
2500|$|Taihos {{original}} design specified installation of two catapults on her forward bow for power-assisted take-offs. However, as the Imperial Japanese Navy had not developed a workable catapult for carrier decks {{by the time}} of Taihos construction, these were eventually deleted from the requirements. The IJN instead opted to use rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG) when necessary. This consisted of two solid-propellant (cordite) rockets attached to either side of a plane's fuselage. Generating [...] of thrust for three seconds, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an aircraft airborne in a much shorter distance than normally required.|$|E
2500|$|About midnight, {{the police}} stormed 1395 Lakeview Road. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> inside, but a locked and barricaded door {{prevented}} them from reaching the second floor. Police also say they saw a body lying on the kitchen floor. Shortly afterward, the house caught fire. The cause of the fire was never determined, and the Cleveland Fire Department did not fight the blaze since it was believed firefighters would come under attack. Police observers later said they heard the names [...] "Omar" [...] and [...] "Ali" [...] shouted from within the home. 1391 Lakeview Road also caught fire, and both homes burned to the ground.|$|E
