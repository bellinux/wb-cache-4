25|$|Then, {{during a}} storm, the camp catches fire. Jayfeather, Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Squirrelflight are trapped. Squirrelflight makes {{it through the}} flames and drags a stick through {{in an attempt to}} save her kits, but needs some help. Ashfur leaps in and drags it all the way through. Just as Lionblaze leaps on, though, Ashfur blocks the way. Squirrelflight begs him to let them through, but Ashfur tells her and the other three that he never forgave her after she left him for Brambleclaw. He said that he will now kill her kits in another attempt to hurt her. Squirrelflight then reveals a crucial secret: that he cannot hurt her <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>because</b> they are not her kits. She {{explains}} how she kept the secret from Brambleclaw and the whole of ThunderClan. Ashfur lets them live, but he threatens to tell her secret, and she is shocked that Ashfur would betray her like this. Knowing this, Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze realize they are not the Three since they are not the kin of Firestar.|$|E

And that's why I decided to name my tour <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>because</b> I think that if we all have a little mongoose inside that can defeat the hatred and the resentment and the prejudice of everyday, we can probably win the battle." ...|$|E
500|$|The Fox Network {{executives}} {{had wanted}} the season premiere to be [...] "Homer Goes to College" [...] {{because it was}} an Animal House parody. However, the writers felt that [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] would be a better episode because of George Harrison's involvement. During the episode, Homer sings [...] "I am so smart! S-M-R-T... I mean S-M-A-R-T!" [...] while he lights his high school diploma (and the house) on fire. During the recording session, Dan Castellaneta was singing the song and accidentally misspelled [...] "smart". The writers decided that it was much funnier <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>because</b> it seemed like something Homer Simpson would do, so they left the joke in. The song has since become a fan favorite.|$|E

500|$|Sorensen {{also felt}} {{that it would be}} strange to see Declan played by Mullally, saying: [...] "Of course it will be strange to see someone playing the part that I started and {{basically}} created, it's been my life. It's not just being Declan at the studio, I get 'Declan' on the street, at restaurants, everywhere. Declan is me so to hand it over is difficult." [...] He also felt humble that viewers thought the character would not be the same played by another actor, adding: [...] "I'm very humbled {{that a lot of people}} think that – I can understand why fans would feel <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>because</b> I starred as Declan for the past three years and that's all anyone knows." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} using entirely analogue equipment until post-mastering. Grohl {{said it was}} done <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>because</b> he felt digital recording {{was getting out of}} control: [...] "when I listen to music these days, and I hear Pro Tools and drums that sound like a machine- it kinda sucks the life out of music." [...] According to Grohl, the analog strategy would make the record [...] "sound rawer and somewhat imperfect", something which guitarist Chris Shiflett agreed was beneficial, declaring that [...] "rock n'roll is about flaws and imperfections". Bassist Nate Mendel added that [...] "we grew up making records on tape, which has a certain sound, certain limitations", and drummer Taylor Hawkins said that the digital recording in contemporary rock n' roll lead to an artificial sound : [...] "they kinda played it and then how someone else manipulated it in a computer, to make them sound a certain way." [...] Hawkins believed an analog project would help the band reclaim its artistic freedom.|$|E

"Towards {{the end of}} last season, where I {{said the}} best is yet to come, I {{strongly}} felt <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>because</b> towards {{the end of last}} season we closed out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a little bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E

500|$|Code: Veronica {{producer}} Shinji Mikami said [...] "Claire {{became a}} lot tougher than I Imagined. I thought she should look the same, but the game director made her <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>because</b> she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, she could handle any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did we look back and say, 'Oh, I guess they are both girls.' Which is good, because it means we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What we settled on is the idea that you have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E
500|$|She {{acknowledges}} the struggles for equality that women riders in earlier generations {{had to face}} were greater than her own, but notes that women jockeys still [...] "fight a battle." [...] In her early career, she simply tried to [...] "blend in" [...] with the male riders, but nonetheless encountered some owners and trainers who refused to hire a female jockey. She later said, [...] "I was very conscious when I raced against their horses—and when I beat them." [...] Napravnik has encountered harassment from male jockeys on the track when other riders would deliberately bump her or pen in her horse from all sides. [...] In a 2013 interview with 60 Minutes, Napravnik said that she has heard hecklers at the track yell at her to [...] "go home and have a baby," [...] or [...] "go home {{and stay in the}} kitchen." [...] She repeatedly has chosen to make her mark on the track instead of getting into post-race fights. [...] Trainer Larry Jones, having witnessed other jockeys deliberately bumping into her on the track, commented, [...] "Don't do Rosie <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> <b>because</b> she will run over you. The girl has no fear." ...|$|E
500|$|Ann Hodgman of Entertainment Weekly was {{negative}} in her review and dismissed the episode for feeling [...] "like a plateful of warmed-up leftovers." [...] Hodgman criticized the writers' decision to devoting {{too much of}} the episode to the Mary Alice storyline rather than focusing on the other characters. She wrote that Rex's death did not come as a surprise, noting: [...] "Just as a TV or movie cop is inevitably shot after he announces that he's about to retire, we know it's over for Rex the minute Bree rests her head on his feeble chest and promises him he'll make it." [...] Hodgman stated that her interest in the Gabrielle and Carlos storyline was ruined by John telling Carlos about the affair rather than Carlos discovering it himself. She also declared that the Lynette storyline was [...] "wrapped up almost as perfunctorily, or maybe it only seems <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>because</b> it's long been so obvious that they were heading toward one of those folktales where the husband and wife switch places." [...] Hodgman concluded by saying the fates of Susan and Mike are predictable, as the characters are too important to be killed off. In 2009, TV Guide ranked the episode #55 on its list of [...] "100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time". The Futon Critic ranked the episode as the 19th best television episode of 2005, calling it [...] "note-perfect." ...|$|E
50|$|To stage a {{whole scene}} in one shot {{is no longer}} common. Director Steven Soderbergh claims:That kind of staging is a lost art, which is too bad.

500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>because</b> I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E
500|$|Writing for the New York Daily News, Mary Talbot said {{listening}} to Dreaming of You was [...] "akin to sifting through a dead woman's scrapbook" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "disparate jottings and snapshots some artful, some light, all weighted with nostalgia". Talbot said the album showcases [...] "Selena's past and outlines {{what could have been}} her future", and because of the singer's death, the story is incomplete. She called the English offerings [...] "sturdy, generic pop numbers" [...] that would be favored among her Tejano following [...] "but there aren't enough of them to prove her strength or breadth as an English-language artist". Talbot said Selena was skillful in crisscrossing [...] "traditional Mexican music with a contemporary American pop sensibility, and that skill doesn't figure with these songs". Towards the end of her review, Talbot said Dreaming of You is [...] "the effervescent pop of her generation". Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News said the album [...] "doesn't deliver", writing that Selena was [...] "revamped to sound like one of pop radio's many generic female vocalist" [...] and that her English recordings lack [...] "the bubbly, effervescent personality, the chica-del-barrio charm" [...] found on her Tejano songs. Tarradell said the English songs were [...] "tepid imitations of Amy Grant and Abdul". Peter Watrous of The New York Times called Dreaming of You [...] "a collection of leftovers" [...] and said the Spanish-language songs [...] "sound better" [...] than Selena's English ones. Watrous said the producers did not ameliorate Selena's English-language tracks and gave their all. He further wrote that [...] "the music is faceless commerce" [...] but that Selena recorded them [...] "so well on the album" [...] that it suggested [...] "she had a good chance of success, working lush ballads in an anonymous pop style that Disney has mastered". Rock music contributor Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant described Dreaming of You as [...] "a package that hints at the overall talent and immense potential of the young star". Catlin said her English-language works were lacking [...] "technical heroics that have defined [...] in the '90s." [...] but states the singer [...] "is understandably assured" [...] on her Spanish offerings. He said Selena was [...] "low key" [...] and that the material seemed <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>because</b> she had only recorded four English-language tracks before her death.|$|E

50|$|The {{first date}} between Rocky and Adrian, in which Rocky bribes a janitor {{to allow them}} to skate after closing hours in a deserted ice skating rink, was shot <b>that</b> <b>way</b> only <b>because</b> of {{budgetary}} pressures.

60|$|She {{went out}} by the front door, going <b>that</b> <b>way</b> not <b>because</b> {{she wanted to go}} to Hickleybrow (her goal was Cheasing Eyebright, where her married {{daughter}} resided), but because the back door was impassable on account of the canary creeper that had been growing so furiously ever since she upset the can of food near its roots.

2500|$|Tebbit {{was portrayed}} as a sinister, leather-clad bovverboy beating up fellow cabinet members and keeping order in Margaret Thatcher's cabinet, by the satirical TV puppet show, Spitting Image. The Professor of English at University College London, John Mullan, has written: [...] "In Spitting Image and {{probably}} the middle-class imagination, Norman Tebbit was given an Essex drag on his vowels which he hardly possessed.

2500|$|The TRI 60 {{engine was}} {{developed}} in the 1970s to meet the need for a small, inexpensive, reliable, and expendable jet engine for use in cruise missiles and other small unmanned air vehicles.

The first generation of engines, the [...] "tri-axial" [...] engines, were named <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>because</b> they featured only three simple compressor sections.

2500|$|Coal-tar {{creosote}} is {{the most}} widely used wood treatment today; both industrially, processed into wood using pressure methods such as [...] "full-cell process" [...] or [...] "empty-cell process", and more commonly applied to wood through brushing. In addition to toxicity to fungi, insects, and marine borers, it serves as a natural water repellant. It's commonly used to preserve and waterproof cross ties, pilings, telephone poles, power line poles, marine pilings, and fence posts. Although suitable for use in preserving the structural timbers of buildings, it is not generally used <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>because</b> it is difficult to apply.

2500|$|In Grant's {{earliest}} {{script for}} the character, Anarky {{was designed to}} be far more vicious, and to have killed his first victim. Dennis O'Neil, then editor of Detective Comics, requested that Grant [...] "tone down" [...] the script, as he felt Anarky becoming a murderer {{at such a young age}} was morally reprehensible. Grant consented to the request and the script was rewritten. In a 2004 interview, Grant explained the motivation behind this early decision. [...] "I wanted to play it <b>that</b> <b>way</b> <b>because</b> it created incredible tension in Anarky himself.
