5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt <b>truck,</b> <b>is</b> found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Bond's stolen <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> intercepted {{along its}} escape route by a SPECTRE helicopter, but 007 destroys the attacking {{aircraft}} by shooting its co-pilot with his sniper rifle, causing {{the man to}} drop a live hand grenade in the cockpit. Thus, Bond and Romanova make it to Grant's escape boat on the Dalmatian coast and steal that, too, only to be pursued by Morzeny, who leads a squadron of SPECTRE powerboats. Bond, however, escapes by dumping his own powerboat's fuel drums overboard and detonating them with a Very flare to engulf all the chase boats {{in a sea of}} flames.|$|E

50|$|Downhill longboarders usually use Reverse Kingpin Trucks (RKP), whereas skateboarders use Traditional Kingpin Trucks. RKP trucks tend to hold {{traction}} {{better and}} {{are easier to}} handle at speed, whereas TKP <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> more suited for tricks, bowl skating and usually sport a lower ride height. Other forms of <b>trucks</b> have <b>been</b> seen in downhill but remain on the sidelines. These would include torsion trucks (seismic) and CAM trucks (Other Planet). Downhill <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> separated into two further categories: Cast and Precision. Cast <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> the economical choice {{as well as the}} most common, although Precision <b>Trucks</b> <b>are</b> becoming more common. Cast <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> usually a gravity cast aluminum with a solid steel axle that is non-removable. Due to the casting process cast trucks have 'slop' which is caused by small gaps in between parts. This causes small shifts and movements at speed and results in slightly diminished control. Cast <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> also prone to warping slightly, causing uneven contact pressure on the wheels. Precision trucks can counter these limitations at a much higher price tag, although not all brands achieve this equally. Precision <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> milled out of Aluminum billet and usually house two separate axles.|$|R
50|$|Several {{types of}} non {{centralized}} sanitation systems {{are served by}} vacuum <b>trucks.</b> They <b>are</b> used to empty septage from cesspits, septic tanks, pit latrines and communal latrines, for street cleanup, for sewer clean out, and for individual septic systems. The <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> used in the cleaning of sanitary sewer pumping stations. Vacuum <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> used to empty portable toilets. In commercial aviation, vacuum <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> used to collect waste from airplane toilets.|$|R
5|$|Clark, Chloe, and Pete {{arrive at}} the dance, and say their goodbyes to Whitney before he leaves for training. The weather begins to deteriorate, and a storm picks up, as Lana takes Whitney to the bus stop. Jonathan (John Schneider) and Martha (Annette O'Toole) decide {{to head to the}} storm cellar to seek cover from the storm, and they {{discover}} Nixon just as the octagonal disk activates the ship. Nixon attempts to escape with the videotape, and Jonathan chases out into the storm after him. The ship levitates off the ground and flies out of the storm cellar. Lana says goodbye to Whitney and drives home. On her way, storm winds force her off the road, right next to three tornadoes that have touched down. The students at the dance are alerted to the tornados that have been sighted, and Clark races off to make sure Lana is all right. The three tornadoes merge into one large tornado and move in Lana's direction. Clark arrives just as Lana, in the <b>truck,</b> <b>is</b> sucked into the tornado's vortex; Clark speeds into the tornado to rescue her.|$|E

5|$|Dexter {{receives}} a voice message from his foster sister Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), {{a police officer}} in the vice department and, Dexter believes, the only person who loves him. Debra says she is at a crime scene and wants him to be there, because she needs his help. Dexter arrives and Debra, undercover as a prostitute, informs him that another hooker has been killed, the third in five months. Dexter inspects the victim and is shocked to learn that the chopped up corpse is bloodless. Dexter leaves, awed by the killer's technique, and says that {{due to the lack of}} blood he can't help out. At the police station, Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes (Erik King), who hates Dexter and suspects he is hiding something. Dexter suggests that it was a crime of passion, rather than the bad drug deal Doakes believes it to be. Dexter surveils Jamie Jaworski, a murderer who escaped justice due to a faulty warrant, and breaks into his home to find proof of his crime. Once he confirms that Jaworski is guilty, Dexter meets with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), a domestic violence victim. Because of her violent past with her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, and Dexter secretly feels comfortable with the lack of intimacy. Rita has two young children, Astor and Cody, whom Dexter genuinely feels for. While on a date with Rita, Dexter finds another crime scene in which the victim has been cut into pieces with no traces of blood; this time, however, the head is missing. Dexter theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold, explaining the absence of blood. Dexter further suggests that a stolen refrigerated <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> being used for the murders. Dexter allows Debra to pitch the theory, but their superior officer, Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), who dislikes Debra, dismisses it.|$|E
