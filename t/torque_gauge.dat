40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the loss of}} applied torque (detorque) values in cast and pre-machined abutments for external hex abutment/implant interface of single implant-supported prostheses subjected to mechanical cycling. METHODS: Ten metal crowns were fabricated using two types of UCLA abutments: cast and pre-machined with metal base in NiCrTi alloy and tightened to regular external hex implants with a titanium alloy screw, with an insertion torque of 32 N. cm, measured with a digital <b>torque</b> <b>gauge.</b> Samples were embedded with autopolymerizing acrylic resin in a stainless steel cylindrical matrix, and positioned in an electromechanical machine. Dynamic oblique loading of 120 N was applied during 5 x 10 (5) cycles. Then, each sample {{was removed from the}} resin and detorque values were measured using the same digital <b>torque</b> <b>gauge.</b> The difference of the initial (torque) and final (detorque) measurement was registered and the results were expressed as percentage of initial torque. The results of torque loss were expressed as percentage of the initial torque and subjected to statistical analysis by the Student's t-test (p< 0. 05) for comparisons between the test groups. RESULTS: Statistical analysis demonstrated that mechanical cycling reduced the torque of abutments without significant difference between cast or pre-machined UCLA abutments (p= 0. 908).

Study design: Twelve implants were initially selected and their physico-chemical characteristics were evaluated by means of energy-dispersive X-rays (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, 24 implants ? 12 measuring 8 mm and 12 measuring 10 mm in length ? were implanted in 6 Beagle dogs. Twelve implants were removed after a recovery period of 6 weeks, followed by removal of the remaining 12 implants after 12 weeks, using a <b>torque</b> calibrator (<b>Gauge</b> Tonichi® model BGT 150 CN-S) with a force registry range of 0 - 150 Ncm. Results: EDS analysis of the surface chemical composition only revealed the presence of titanium in the etched surfaces. In {{the same way as}} with the surfaces of other dental implants, XPS analysis revealed traces of other elements present in the surface, fundamentally carbon. Following dual acid etching, the surface showed the roughness resulting from acid action, with a morphology that proved to be quite homogeneous. The roughness values obtained exceeded 1 µm. The mean removal torque values after 6 weeks were 79. 7 Ncm for the 8 mm implants and 115 Ncm for the 10 mm implants. After 12 weeks, these values increased to 101. 2 Ncm and 139. 7 Ncm, respectively. Conclusions: Hydrofluoric and nitric acid etching affords optimum surface characteristics comparable to those of other surfaces.

40|$|PURPOSE: In practice, {{the surgeon}} {{must rely on}} screw {{position}} (insertion depth) and tactile feedback from the screwdriver (insertion <b>torque)</b> to <b>gauge</b> compression. In this study, we identified the relationship between interfragmentary compression and these 2 factors. METHODS: The Acutrak Standard, Acutrak Mini, Synthes 3. 0, and Herbert-Whipple implants were tested using a polyurethane foam scaphoid model. A specialized testing jig simultaneously measured compression force, insertion torque, and insertion depth at half-screw-turn intervals until failure occurred. RESULTS: The peak compression occurs at an insertion depth of 2 ̆ 2123. 1 mm, 2 ̆ 2122. 8 mm, 0. 9 mm, and 1. 5 mm for the Acutrak Mini, Acutrak Standard, Herbert-Whipple, and Synthes screws respectively (insertion depth is positive when the screw is proud above the bone and negative when buried). The compression and insertion torque {{at a depth of}} 2 ̆ 2122 mm were found to be 113 1 18 N and 0. 348 1 0. 052 Nm for the Acutrak Standard, 104 1 15 N and 0. 175 1 0. 008 Nm for the Acutrak Mini, 78 1 9 N and 0. 245 1 0. 006 Nm for the Herbert-Whipple, and 67 1 2 N, 0. 233 1 0. 010 Nm for the Synthes headless compression screws. CONCLUSIONS: All 4 screws generated a sizable amount of compression (> 60 N) over a wide range of insertion depths. The compression at the commonly recommended insertion depth of 2 ̆ 2122 mm was not significantly different between screws; thus, implant selection should not be based on compression profile alone. Conically shaped screws (Acutrak) generated their peak compression when they were fully buried in the foam whereas the shanked screws (Synthes and Herbert-Whipple) reached peak compression before they were fully inserted. Because insertion torque correlated poorly with compression, surgeons should avoid using tactile judgment of torque as a proxy for compression. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Knowledge of the insertion profile may improve our understanding of the implants, provide a better basis for comparing screws, and enable the surgeon to optimize compression.

Often not all the conditions are known under which these highly-efficient turbomachines have to operate. This case study deals with a four-stage three-pinion integrally geared centrifugal compressor. It was designed for an air separation plant in Germany to produce nitrogen and oxygen for an adjacent steel works. The compressor was driven via a standard gear-tooth coupling with a 1500 mm (59 inch) spacer shaft by an induction motor with speed of 1490 rpm and power of 4000 Kw (5400 hp).

40|$|Abstract — The unique {{performance}} {{features of}} harmonic drives, such as highs gear ratios and high torque capacities in a compact geometry, justify their widespread industrial application especially in many electrically actuated robot manipulators. In many robotic control strategies {{it is assumed}} that the actuator is acting as a torque source, and in order to implement such algorithms it is necessary to accurately measure the transmitted torque by the harmonic drive. In this paper a built-in torque sensor for harmonic drive systems is developed and examined in detail, in which strain-gauges are directly mounted on the harmonic drive flexspline. To minimize sensing inaccuracy, four Rosette strain gauges are used employing an accurate positioning method. To cancel the torque ripples, the oscillation observed on the measured torque and caused mainly by gear teeth meshing, Kalman filter estimation is used. A simple fourth order harmonic oscillator proved to accurately model the torque ripples. Moreover, the error model is extended to incorporate any misalignment torque. By on line implementation of the Kalman filter, {{it has been shown that}} this method is a fast and accurate way to filter torque ripples and misalignment torque. Hence, the intelligent built-in torque sensor is a viable and economical way to measure the harmonic drive transmitted torque and to employ that for torque feedback strategies.

40|$|Yield mapping may form an {{important}} part of an in-field site-specific crop production system, both for the spatial analysis of production efficiency and for the determination of spatially optimized application rates for fertilizer and sowing of seed. The objective of the work reported here, was to apply the principle of yield mapping to whole crop harvesting corn silage. The yield measurement is based on the continuous recording of the material flowrate through harvesting machine, the machine driving speed and the machine location in the field. For the flowrate measurement, the shaft of the material blower and the drive shaft of the base unit powering the cutterhead, feedrolls and front attachement, were instrumented with strain <b>gauge</b> <b>torque</b> transducers. Within the calibration range, the signals of these sensors showed a linear relationship to the flowrate. The harvester was also equipped with a speed radar and a data acquisition system based on a personal computer. The location tracking of the machine was done by integrating the machine speed and manual recording of the machine path in the field.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the potential of}} the osteoconductive material β-tricalcium phosphate to promote bone healing when coated on a titanium alloy screw implanted in the mandibular tooth socket of a healthy rat. Forty-eight 9 -week-old male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: the Blast group, which received blast-treated screws; the βTCP group, which received β-tricalcium phosphate-coated screws; and the Control group, which received mechanically polished screws. Mandibles were removed at 3 or 9 weeks after screw implantation. Screw removal torques were measured using a handheld <b>torque</b> <b>gauge</b> and compared. At both 3 and 9 weeks after implantation, the screw removal torques were significantly greater in the βTCP group than in the Blast and Control groups (p< 0. 05).

These results suggest that a β-tricalcium phosphate coating on screws accelerates osseous healing around the screw and increases the retentive capacity of the screw. A β-tricalcium phosphate-coated implant fitted into the tooth socket immediately after extraction may therefore provide a favorable environment for early loading of implants...|$|E

Emphasis is on process improvements to the mixing, melting and de-volatilization of base resins, fillers, pigments, fire retardants and other additives in the :finishing'' stage of high value added engineering polymer materials. While GE Plastics materials were used for experimental studies throughout the program, the concepts and principles are broadly applicable to other manufacturers materials.

40|$|Strength {{of lower}} {{extremity}} muscles {{is an important}} determinant of mobility-based functional activities. Loss of strength with age produces functional limitation in {{activities of daily living}} such as rising from a chair or stair negotiation. However, there is limited information on the effect of age-related changes on the torque-producing ability of muscles through their ranges of joint motion. To investigate the effect of ageing on the torque-producing ability of lower extremity muscles in a large sample of older adults in three age groups. Eighty-two volunteers participated in this study and were divided into six groups according to their chronological age (60 s, 70 s and 80 s and above) and gender (male, female). Isometric muscle strength was measured at the knee and hip joints at three positions through the joint range using a custom-built strain <b>gauge</b> <b>torque</b> dynamometer and a purpose built plinth. The peak torque of major muscle groups of the knee and hip joints decreased with increasing age at all the three joint positions at which strength was tested. The 80 -year-olds had 20 % lower strength compared to the 60 -year-olds. Age-related decrease in muscle strength was significant when comparing 80 -year-olds with the 60 -year-olds (p < 0. 05). Strength loss was noted to be higher at the inner (muscle is shortened from mid-position) and outer (muscle is lengthened from mid-position) ranges of muscle action when compared with the mid-range position (mid-position). Gender-based differences were significant for all the strength tests (p < 0. 05). Strength decreased with increasing age at all the positions within joint range of motion for knee and hip joints. However, the percentage loss of muscle strength was different at different positions in the joint range. Our findings suggest that muscle strength was more preserved in the middle range of muscle function compared to the inner and outer range of muscle action. In older people, lower extremity muscles might be required to produce higher moments in joint positions that are not within the optimum mid-position for muscle action...|$|R

It has recently been observed that in implants with screw-retained abutments, various phenomena, such as screw 4 loosening and fracture, rotation and fracture of the abutment with bacterial penetration into the internal chambers of the implants have occurred {{as a result of}} maladaptatation at the implant-abutment interface. At the level of this region, a small space known as a microgap is described, and is a relevant factor in remodeling of the crestal bone and peri-implant soft tissue health in the long term.

This was immediately followed by the placement of (1) ml of deionized water. Next, the tubes were hermetically closed and placed on a table with a microtube holder and stored for 24 hours, without agitation. Afterwards they were agitated for 10 minutes on an agitating table making uniform movements and from then on, a small quantity of water began to be collected from each microtube, where in turn these samples were analyzed by absorbance method of photometry, spectrophotometry, in which they showed the extravasation of the Evans blue dye solution in the implant system used. From the beginning of sample collection at the time of (24 hours) until the condition on the third day or at seventy-two hours, the three systems showed no statistically significant alterations. From the fourth day, or at the time of 96 h., in the Morse Cone Group system, statistically significant differences were revealed between Group EH and IH. The results were tabulated and the ANOVA statistical test for two criteria and the Tukey test were applied for comparison among all the groups, with a level of significance of p< 0. 05. The results of the twenty-four-hour (24); forty-eight (48), seventy-two hour tests (72), there were no statistically significant differences, whereas in the period of ninety-six (96) and one hundred and forty-four (144) hours, showed the Evans blue dye solution extravasation from the MC system to be greater with statistical significance than in Groups EH and IH. It was therefore concluded that there was extravasation in the three systems in the initial condition. At the time of 96 there was greater extravasation from the MC system, which was perpetuated up to the end of the experiment, showing it to differ statistically in comparison with the EH and IH systems...|$|R
40|$|Although {{a number}} of {{manufacturers}} are marketing disposable prophylaxis angles, no literature exists regarding the mechanical efficacy and efficiency of these products. It was {{the purpose of this}} in vitro evaluation to compare and evaluate five brands of commercially available disposable prophylaxis angles for vibration, noise, heat rise, and torque. Random samples of each brand of disposable prophylaxis angle were utilized. Vibration was measured with a height gauge and running motor; noise was measured with a sound meter and heat rise was measured from 68 °F on the head and body of the disposable prophylaxis angles, and torque required to destroy the gear was measured with a <b>torque</b> <b>gauge.</b> Means, standards deviations, standard errors, and coefficients of variation were computed for each of the variables tested. Results revealed that four of the brands tested (in alphabetical order) perform reliably when considering vibration, noise, heat rise, and torque: Denticator, Teledyne Getz, and Young Dental. The Ash/Dentsply had significant heat rise in the head and body. Both the Ash/Dentsply and Brahler disposable prophylaxis angles demonstrated significant vibration...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates flows {{around a}} free surface {{piercing}} cylinder with Froude number F< 0. 5 and Reynolds number around Re = 50, 000. The {{aim of this}} work is {{to gain a better}} understanding of the flow behaviour in environmental systems such as fishways. The advances are based upon experimental and numerical results. Several flow discharges and slopes are tested to obtain both subcritical and supercritical flows. The drag force exerted on the cylinder is measured with the help of a <b>torque</b> <b>gauge</b> while the velocity field is obtained using particle velocimetry. For the numerical part, two URANS turbulence models are tested, the k-w SST and the RNG k-e models using the OpenFOAM software suite for subcritical cases, and then compared with the corresponding experimental results. With fishways applications in mind, the changes in drag coefficient Cd versus Froude number and water depth are studied and experimental correlations proposed. We conclude that the most suitable URANS turbulence model for reproducing this kind of flow is the k-w SST model...|$|E
30|$|Balfour and O’Brien {{tested the}} {{following}} three kinds of implants for maximum anti-rotational stability: external hexagon-type 0.7 mm-diameter CP-Ti implants, internal octagon-type 0.6 mm-diameter Ti- 6 Al- 4 V implants, and internal hexagon-type 1.7 mm-diameter Ti- 6 Al- 4 V implants and abutments [16]. Testing comprised rigidly fixing a calibrated <b>torque</b> <b>gauge</b> to the abutment sleeve and applying torque until failure of the components was apparent. The torques necessary to separate the single-tooth abutments from the implants were 8.7  in.-lb (98.3  N[*]·[*]cm) for the external hexagon-type, 3.3  in.-lb (37.3  N[*]·[*]cm) for the internal octagon-type, and 10.0 in.-lb (192.1  N[*]·[*]cm) for the internal hexagon-type. In the internal octagon and internal hexagon designs, failure {{was limited to the}} abutment connections. The Balfour and O’Brien result differed from those reported in this study (4.3 and 3.8 mm diameters, 87 and 70  N[*]·[*]cm, respectively). The results from this study confirmed that the torsional strengths were different depending on the connection dimensions as reported by Balfour and O’Brien. CAMLOG implants (5 and 6 mm diameter) achieved higher torsional strength than 4.3, 3.8, and 3.3 mm diameter. This resulted from a combination of increased implant diameter and thickness of the implant walls.|$|E
40|$|The maximum {{preload torque}} of implant {{prosthetic}} retaining screws from four manufacturers and of two alloy types was measured to determine one index of interchangeability of intersystem components. Materials and Methods : Implant prosthetic retaining screws from four manufacturers (3 i Implant Innovations Inc, West Palm Beach, FL; Impla-Med Inc, Sunrise, FL; Nobelpharma USA Inc, Chicago, IL; and Implant Support Systems Inc, Irvine, CA) and of two metal types (gold and titanium) were investigated using an in vitro simulation model. Five screws {{of each type}} were tightened down against a gold cylinder using a Tohnichi BTG- 6 <b>torque</b> <b>gauge</b> (Tohnichi American Corporation, Northbrook, IL) until fracture occurred. Results : The 3 i Implant Innovations gold and the Nobelpharma gold were not significantly different. The 3 i Implant Innovations titanium and the Impla-Med gold were able to withstand less preload torque than the 3 i Implant Innovations gold and the Nobelpharma gold. The Implant Support Systems titanium was able to withstand significantly more preload torque {{than all of the}} other screws. Conclusions : Interchanging implant prosthetic retaining screws could introduce new and unknown variables that may affect the long-term survival of implant fixtures and/or the implant prostheses...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to evaluate, using a biomechanical test, the force needed to remove {{implants}} with surface modification by laser (Nd:YAG) in comparison with implants with machined surfaces. Twenty-four rabbits received one implant with each surface treatment in the tibia, machined surface (MS) and laser-modified surface (LMS). After 4, 8 and 12 weeks of healing, the removal torque was measured by a <b>torque</b> <b>gauge.</b> The surfaces studied were analyzed according to their topography, chemical composition and roughness. The average removal torque in each period was 23. 28, 24. 0 and 33. 85 Ncm for MS, and 33. 0, 39. 87 and 54. 57 Ncm for LMS, respectively. The difference between the surfaces in all periods of evaluation was statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Surface characterization showed that a deep and regular topography was provided by the laser conditioning, with a great quantity of oxygen ions when compared to the MS. The surface micro-topography analysis showed a statistical difference (p < 0. 01) between the roughness of the LMS (R a = 1. 38 ± 0. 23 μm) when compared to that of the MS (R a = 0. 33 ± 0. 06 μm). Based on these results, it was possible to conclude that the LMS implants' physical-chemical properties increased bone-implant interaction when compared to the MS implants. © 2009 Sociedade Brasileira de Pesquisa Odontológica...|$|E
