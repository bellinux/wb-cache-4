5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made {{and the smell of}} the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> large common starling roosts in central London.|$|E
5|$|The {{night before}} the start of the operations, the Soviet night bombers {{attacked}} the German divisional headquarters and artillery positions <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> German command and control. The bombers also attacked German airfields and communication centres <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> flow of reinforcements. Operation Iskra began at 9:30 on January 12, when the two Soviet fronts began their artillery preparation, which lasted for 2 hours 20 minutes on the western side and 1 hour 45 minutes on the eastern side of the bottleneck. The Soviet attack started five minutes before the artillery preparation finished with a Katyusha barrage, to fully exploit its effects.|$|E
5|$|From {{the middle}} of 1861, Định's Gò Công guerrillas focused on three objectives: <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> newly created French bureaucracy, to disrupt their {{military}} outposts and <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> transport of rice to Cholon, the main commercial hub of southern Vietnam. The first major attack against the French administration in the area targeted the Gò Công district office on June 22, 1861. At 05:00, 600 rebels {{under the command of}} Do Dinh Thoai stormed the military post in the town, engaging the French troops in hand-to-hand combat with lances, bayonets, knives and bamboo sticks. The French were surprised by the attack, losing one soldier and having 100 wounded. By the time reinforcements and naval cover had arrived from Mỹ Tho, Định's men had fled. Thoai—who had been the district chief until the French invasion—was among the 14 killed.|$|E

50|$|One {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>the</b> harvest was <b>to</b> ravage {{the countryside}} by uprooting trees, burning houses and crops and killing all {{who were not}} safe behind {{the walls of the}} city. Ravaging the countryside cost much effort and was also dependent on the season because green crops do not burn as well as those nearer to harvest which are more dry.|$|R
5|$|Men {{who felt}} {{compelled}} to protest the restrictions of the conscription law attempted <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> program {{through the use of}} various techniques, including the initiation of work slowdowns and labor strikes.

However, the director of the campaign Raja Petra Kamarudin subsequently announced the event would be left untouched.|$|E
5|$|SM U-17 was {{constructed}} in Germany and shipped by rail to Pola where she was assembled and launched on 21 April 1915 and commissioned on 6 October. U-17 sank an Italian destroyer in July 1916 {{as part of an}} effort <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> Otranto Barrage but sank no other ships during the war. The boat survived the war and was delivered to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Dover Strait that {{occurred}} on 26–27 October 1916 was a naval {{battle of the}} First World War between Great Britain and the German Empire. Two and a half flotillas of German torpedo boats from the Flanders Flotilla launched a raid into the Dover Strait in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> Dover Barrage and destroy whatever Allied shipping {{could be found in}} the strait.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} vehicle and {{equipment}} camouflage differs from personal camouflage {{in that the}} primary threat is aerial reconnaissance.

5|$|Another push against Bosanski Brod was {{launched}} on 27 September. The advance initially had moderate success, until 4 October when the VRS rebalanced its forces, changing the {{sector of the}} bridgehead against which the 1st Krajina Corps was concentrated. The move managed <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> HVO and HV defences and the VRS achieved a breakthrough, capturing Bosanski Brod on 6 October. In response, the HV and the HVO withdrew their troops and equipment in an orderly fashion, and the bridge spanning the Sava between the town and Slavonski Brod was demolished on 7 October.|$|E

Bond and Honey escape from the island, killing No and blowing up his lair in the process.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{a series}} of Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands took place between November 1944 and January 1945. These raids {{targeted}} United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bases and sought <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> bombing of Japan by B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers operating from the islands. The Japanese lost 37 aircraft during this operation, but destroyed 11 B-29s and damaged a further 43. Preparations were also made for commando raids on the bases in early and mid-1945 but these did not go ahead.|$|E

5|$|Further {{attacks were}} {{conducted}} against Saipan during late November {{in an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> American offensive. On November24, Marianas-based B-29s conducted their first raid against Japan, bombing targets in and around Tokyo. Three days later the Japanese mounted two raids against their bases. During {{the early hours of}} November27, two G4Ms flying from Iwo Jima struck Isley Field from low altitude and escaped after destroying one B-29 and damaging eleven others. This attack came as a surprise to the Americans, and construction lights were still on at Isley {{at the start of the}} raid.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> process of inflammation in the body. The research program {{focused on the}} underlying causes of inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials in the areas of sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E

30|$|Indeed, {{when two}} actors have a {{relationship}} to each other that forms a bridge, <b>disrupting</b> <b>the</b> {{relationship between the two}} actors may be seen as <b>the</b> key <b>to</b> <b>disrupting</b> <b>the</b> network. Through this lens, the removal of relationships as a by-product of removing actors can be viewed as the essential act in disrupting a network via node removal. Furthermore, when the focus is on network fragmentation, deleting a particular actor might seem significant due to an increase in subcomponents. In contrast, an edge that serves as a local bridge may be more important to overall network communication efficiency, even though its deletion may not create any new subcomponents.|$|R
5|$|In 64 BCE, the {{military}} expedition of the Roman general Pompey {{put an end}} to the anarchy prevailing in the Seleucid Empire, and Phoenicia became part of the Roman world. But Roman civil wars continued <b>to</b> <b>disrupt</b> <b>the</b> region until 31 BCE, after which, with the reign of Augustus, the pax romana extended over the area. The pax romana favored international trade, and local industries in silversmithing, glass, textiles and ceramics developed.|$|E
