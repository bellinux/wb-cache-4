25|$|There is {{also the}} {{extremely}} rare p-p IV branch. Other even-rarer reactions may occur. The rate of these reactions is very low due to very small cross-sections, or {{because the number of}} reacting particles is so low that any reactions <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> are statistically insignificant. This is partly why no mass-5 or mass-8 elements are seen. While the reactions that would produce them, such as a proton + helium-4 producing lithium-5, or two helium-4 nuclei coming together to form beryllium-8, may actually happen, these elements are not detected because there are no stable isotopes of atomic masses 5 or 8; the resulting products immediately decay into their initial reactants.|$|E

Harukazu Saito, chief of staff at the Air Self-Defense Force, stated, [...] "We can respond more quickly to an unpredictable situation <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> to our fighters if they are made domestically than in the case of foreign-made fighters, and we can operate domestically made fighters more smoothly." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{advent of}} the Italian [...] "Catenaccio" [...] (bolt) system came soon after, and was a more {{defensive}} variation on the Brazilians' 4–2–4 system. Two forwards were withdrawn to leave just two up front, and an extra midfielder was added to bolster the midfield. However, the major tactical innovation with this formation was the floating sweeper, often referred to in Italian as a [...] "libero", or [...] "free man". While the four main defenders would have the task of strict man-marking the opposition forwards, the libero would act as a sponge, mopping up any attacks <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> {{to get through the}} tight defence. Franz Beckenbauer of Bayern Munich gave the position a more attacking role and played a major part as captain of the West Germany national side that won the World Cup in 1974 and came third in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the Police Association, which {{represents}} both senior officers and {{rank and file}} members of the Northern Ireland police, went to court to try to block {{the release of the}} O'Loan report. The Association stated that, [...] "The ombudsman's report and associated decisions constitute a misuse of her statutory powers, responsibilities and functions." [...] The group later dropped its efforts. RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan called the report [...] "grossly unfair" [...] and [...] "an erroneous conclusion reached in advance and then a desperate attempt to find anything <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>happen</b> to fit in with that." [...] Other senior police officers also disputed the report's findings. Flanagan issued a 190-page counter-report in response, and has also stated that he has considered taking legal action. He argued that the multiple warnings were given by the RIRA to cause confusion and lead to a greater loss of life. Assistant Chief Constables Alan McQuillan and Sam Kincaid sent affidavits giving information that supported the report.|$|E
