5|$|In June 2007, vocalist Adam Lazzara said Taking Back Sunday were {{preparing}} to write the follow-up album to Louder Now (2006). In July, bassist Matthew Rubano mentioned that {{the other members of}} the band were in the process of writing individually in separate locations: Rubano in Manhattan, Lazzara in Texas, guitarist Fred Mascherino in Jersey, drummer Mark O'Connell on Long Island and guitarist Eddie Reyes in Ohio. From late July to early September, the band participated in the 2007 Projekt Revolution tour. During the tour, they brought along a mobile recording studio and demoed material, and continued writing for <b>their</b> <b>next</b> album. Plans to do serious writing, as well as record <b>their</b> <b>next</b> album towards the end of the year, were in place.|$|E

5|$|In {{their annual}} rivalry game, Alabama {{defeated}} the Mississippi State Bulldogs 20–7 at Starkville despite having four turnovers. Alabama won the coin toss and elected {{to receive the}} ball to start the game. They then scored on a 33-yard Cade Foster field goal for an early 3–0 lead. Both teams then traded punts for <b>their</b> <b>next</b> six combined possessions before the Bulldogs missed a 23-yard field goal midway through the second quarter. On the Alabama drive that ensued, the Crimson Tide had their first of four turnovers on a Taveze Calhoun interception of an AJ McCarron pass. Alabama rebounded on <b>their</b> <b>next</b> possession with an 18-yard touchdown pass from McCarron to Brian Vogler that made the halftime score 10–0.|$|E

5|$|Picked {{by many to}} lose {{a first-round}} match-up against Old Dominion, Butler {{advanced}} on a last-second tip-in by Howard. Howard was also clutch in <b>their</b> <b>next</b> game, hitting a free throw with a less than one second remaining to beat Pitt in a dramatic finish. Shelvin Mack scored 30 points in the win. Butler won <b>their</b> <b>next</b> game when they defeated Wisconsin. On March 26, 2011, the Bulldogs beat Florida 74–71 in overtime to earn back-to-back trips to the Final Four. On April 2, Butler beat fellow Cinderella team VCU 70–62 {{to make it to}} a second consecutive national championship game. For the second consecutive year, the Bulldogs fell in the national championship game, this time to Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|The Giants hired Jim Fassel {{to replace}} Reeves before the 1997 season. Fassel {{had been the}} {{offensive}} coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals and Denver Broncos. After an opening day win against Philadelphia the Giants lost <b>their</b> <b>next</b> three games, including close losses to the Baltimore Ravens and St. Louis Rams. The Giants then won <b>their</b> <b>next</b> five games in a row. One of Fassel's biggest decisions during this streak was to replace Brown with second year quarterback Danny Kanell. The Giants won <b>their</b> <b>next</b> five game in a row to finish the season at 10–5–1, and win the NFC Eastern Division {{for the first time}} since 1990. In the first round, the Giants struggled in the fourth quarter, and the Vikings kicked a late field goal to defeat them, 23–22. After the 1997 season, Young, who as GM had helped build New York into a championship club in the 1980s, left the team to take a job in the NFL front office. He was replaced by Ernie Accorsi, a well-respected, veteran General Manager who had successful stints building the Baltimore Colts and Cleveland Browns.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{started the}} second half of the season with a 2–2–1 record. In <b>their</b> <b>next</b> game, against the Winnipeg Jets, the Capitals lost a two-goal lead late in the game, {{eventually}} losing in a shootout. The loss knocked the Capitals out of first place in their division and they dropped from third to ninth in the conference. Washington lost <b>their</b> <b>next</b> two games before defeating the Southeast Division-leading Florida Panthers 2–1. The game marked goaltender Tomas Vokoun's first game in Florida after leaving the team as a free agent in the off-season. With the win, Washington moved two points behind the Panthers. Despite being close, however, Washington could not build any momentum, later losing <b>their</b> <b>next</b> three games before closing out the month of February on a three-game win streak.|$|E
5|$|After Kansas {{failed to}} convert a shot on <b>their</b> <b>next</b> possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball {{around the perimeter of}} the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with <b>their</b> <b>next</b> possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|E

5|$|After a {{scoreless}} first quarter, Alabama took a 3–0 lead {{early in}} the second quarter on a 25-yard Cade Foster field goal. On <b>their</b> <b>next</b> possession, the Crimson Tide scored their first touchdown on a two-play drive that saw a 42-yard Kevin Norwood reception and a one-yard Drake touchdown run for a 10–0 lead. Alabama then extended their lead to 24–0 at halftime after touchdown runs of 24-yards from Yeldon and one-yard from Drake on their final two possessions of the half.|$|E

However, after these successes, Suppé's later operettas proved less popular with audiences, and, according to the musicologist Andrew Lamb, were also of lower quality.|$|E

Defeats at home to Middlesbrough and away to Watford left the club {{on the brink of a}} return to England's third tier, and that was confirmed in <b>their</b> <b>next</b> game. Newcastle United won 2–0 at Home Park to secure the Championship title, and relegated the home side at the same time. The club finished 23rd in the league table after defeat by bottom club Peterborough United on the final day of the season, eight points adrift of safety. Jamie Mackie finished as the club's top scorer with eight goals in all competitions, and captain Carl Fletcher was voted Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{struggled}} {{to regain the}} same level of consistency shown earlier in the season; {{in the space of a}} month they fell five points behind leaders Chelsea, who went on to win the league.
