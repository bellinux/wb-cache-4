5|$|Ideas {{about the}} nature of law in general were {{beginning}} to change. In 1716, the Septennial Act was passed, which had a number of consequences. First, it showed that Parliament no longer considered its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the <b>Triennial</b> Act (1694) (enacted {{less than a quarter of}} a century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.|$|E

Sullivan became the {{conductor of the}} Leeds festival beginning in 1880 and conducted the performance. The Carl Rosa Opera Company staged the cantata as an opera in 1898.|$|E

Music was {{specially}} composed, conducted or performed by Mendelssohn, Gounod, Sullivan, Dvořák, Bantock and Edward Elgar, who wrote {{four of his}} most famous choral pieces for Birmingham. Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius had its début performance there in 1900. Composers born in the city include Albert William Ketèlbey and Andrew Glover.|$|E
5|$|The <b>triennial</b> Labor {{conference held}} in December 2011 saw Gillard {{successfully}} negotiate an amendment on same-sex marriage {{to see the}} party introduce a conscience vote to parliament through a private member's bill, rather than a binding vote. Despite Gillard, who had previously stated her personal objection to same-sex marriage, the motion passed narrowly by 208 votes to 184. In February 2012, two bills to allow same-sex marriage in Australia were introduced in the 43rd Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In {{these years}} Sargent tackled a wide repertoire, {{recording}} much of it, {{but he was}} particularly noted for performances of choral pieces. He promoted British music, as he would throughout his career, conducting Handel's Messiah performed with large choruses and orchestras; and the premières of At the Boar's Head (1925) by Holst; Hugh the Drover (1924) and Sir John in Love (1929) by Vaughan Williams; and Walton's cantata Belshazzar's Feast (at the Leeds <b>Triennial</b> Festival of 1931). To popularise classical music, Sargent conducted many concerts for young people including the Robert Mayer Concerts for Children from 1924 to 1939.|$|E

5|$|The new {{parliament}} passed {{a set of}} measures known as the Provisions of Oxford, which Henry swore to uphold. These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons, which then {{had the power to}} appoint England's justiciar, chancellor and treasurer, and which would be monitored through <b>triennial</b> parliaments. Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform, intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King's officials and the major barons. More radical measures were passed by the new council the next year, {{in the form of the}} Provisions of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|While {{still an}} undergraduate, Stanford was {{appointed}} organist of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1882, aged 29, {{he was one}} of the founding professors of the Royal College of Music, where he taught composition for the rest of his life. From 1887 he was also Professor of Music at Cambridge. As a teacher, Stanford was sceptical about modernism, and based his instruction chiefly on classical principles as exemplified in the music of Brahms. Among his pupils were rising composers whose fame went on to surpass his own, such as Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams. As a conductor, Stanford held posts with the Bach Choir and the Leeds <b>triennial</b> music festival.|$|E

50|$|The {{worldwide}} {{enthusiasm for}} art biennials, <b>triennials</b> and other -ennial events rose during the 1990’s and is continuing whereas {{this kind of}} exhibition format {{is not a new}} trend. Indeed, the Venice Biennale was founded in 1895, followed in 1896 by Carnegie International, the Bienal de São Paulo in 1951, Kassel’s Documenta in 1955 and the Biennale of Sydney in 1973, just to name the firsts, mostly driven by capitalist-philanthropic spirit.|$|R

The greatest collection of his paintings is at Museum of Naïve and Marginal Art (MNMA), Jagodina, Serbia.|$|R
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{abundant}} sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds primarily on small bony fishes, but also takes cephalopods and crustaceans. In turn, it often falls prey to larger sharks and possibly marine mammals. In common {{with other members of}} its family, this species is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection. Females give birth to one to eight young either during a defined breeding season or throughout the year, depending on location. The reproductive cycle is usually annual, but may be biennial or <b>triennial.</b> Large numbers of milk sharks are caught by artisanal and commercial fisheries in many countries for meat, fins, and fishmeal. Despite this, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as being of Least Concern, because its wide distribution and relatively high productivity seemingly allow present levels of exploitation to be sustained.|$|E
5|$|The AFM's {{national}} representative body is the <b>triennial</b> General Business Meeting. Its main function is {{the election of}} the national officers: president, deputy president, general secretary and general treasurer. The four national officers always represent the significant ethnic groups within the church. Each local assembly is entitled to send a pastor and a delegate as voting members. Additional voting members are members of the National Leadership Forum, members of standing committees, one additional member representing each church department and one additional representative of the church's theological training institutions. Before 2000, the General Business Meeting was known as the Workers Council, met annually, and possessed greater power. After the adoption of the new constitution, most of the body's power was transferred to the National Leadership Forum.|$|E
5|$|The Long Parliament proved just as {{difficult}} for Charles as had the Short Parliament. It assembled on 3 November 1640 and quickly began proceedings to impeach the king's leading counsellors of high treason. Strafford {{was taken into}} custody on 10 November; Laud was impeached on 18 December; John Finch, now Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, was impeached the following day, and he consequently fled to the Hague with Charles's permission on 21 December. To prevent the king from dissolving it at will, Parliament passed the <b>Triennial</b> Act, which required Parliament to be summoned at least once every three years, and permitted the Lord Keeper and 12 peers to summon Parliament if the king failed to do so. The Act was coupled with a subsidy bill, and so to secure the latter, Charles grudgingly granted royal assent in February 1641.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, Sullivan, ageing and unwell, {{resigned}} as {{conductor of the}} Leeds <b>triennial</b> music festival, a post which he had held since 1880. He believed that Stanford's motive for accepting the conductorship of the Leeds Philharmonic Society the previous year was to position himself {{to take over the}} festival. Stanford later felt obliged to write to The Times, denying that he had been party to a conspiracy to oust Sullivan. Sullivan was by then thought to be a dull conductor of other composers' music, and although Stanford's work as a conductor was not without its critics, he was appointed in Sullivan's place. He remained in charge until 1910. His compositions for the festival included Songs of the Sea (1904), Stabat Mater (1907) and Songs of the Fleet (1910). New works by other composers presented at Leeds during Stanford's years in charge included pieces by Parry, Mackenzie, and seven of Stanford's former pupils. The best-known new work from Stanford's time is probably Vaughan Williams's A Sea Symphony, premiered in 1910.|$|E

5000|$|Biennale (...) , Italian for [...] "biennial" [...] or [...] "every other year", is {{any event}} that happens every two years. It is most {{commonly}} used within the art world to describe large-scale international contemporary art exhibitions. As such the term was popularised by Venice Biennale, which was first held in 1895. The phrase has since been used for other artistic events, such as the [...] "Biennale de Paris", or even as a portmanteau as with Berlinale (for the Berlin International Film Festival) and Viennale (for Vienna's international film festival). [...] "Biennale" [...] is therefore used as a general term for other recurrent international events (such as <b>triennials,</b> Documenta, Skulptur Projekte Münster).|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the Echigo-Tsumari Art <b>Triennial's</b> {{occupation}} of former elementary schools {{in the area of}} Tokamachi. This contemporary art festival was launched in 2000 in an attempt to revive interest in this remote part of Japan. Through on-site observations, surveys, and interviews, this study rst reviews the overall situation of closed educational facilities in the region. Then, a case-by-case description of the festival's involvement was researched. It was discovered that the festival holds a prominent position in providing new uses for such unused facilities in the region. However, depending on the model of usage agreement, various degrees of occupation can be distinguished. Variations of activity timing, program, spatial occupation, and involved stakeholders, allowed the authors to theorize on the capacity of each model to bring change into these localities, and the region.

40|$|The {{opening of}} Brisbane’s new Gallery of Modern Art in December 2006 {{reflects}} the substantial {{growth of the}} Queensland Art Gallery (QAG) in both size and status {{over the last two}} decades. The Gallery has been recognised nationally and internationally for its leading role in the presentation of the Asia-Pacific <b>Triennials</b> of Contemporary Art, and its significant collection of art from the region will hold a prominent place in the expanded institution. Twenty years ago, however, the Gallery seemed an unlikely candidate to concentrate on such work, so what are the reasons for this dramatic change? This paper examines how QAG’s decision to focus on the geo-cultural category of ‘Asia-Pacific’ art created a distinctive grouping which enabled the Gallery to distinguish itself from other institutions. It also considers the implications for artists in being represented within this curatorial classification...|$|R
