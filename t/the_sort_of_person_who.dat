500|$|He talked {{openly in}} the music press about his problems, telling the NME: [...] "When I cut myself I feel so much better. All {{the little things that}} might have been {{annoying}} me seem so trivial because I'm concentrating on the pain", and [...] "I'm <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> wakes {{up in the morning and}} needs to pour a bottle down my throat".|$|E
500|$|British and European psychiatrists {{assessing}} the documents on psychiatric abuse released by Bukovsky characterized him in 1971: [...] "The {{information we have}} about [...] suggests that he is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> might be embarrassing to authorities in any country because he seems unwilling to compromise for convenience and personal comfort, and believes in saying what he thinks in situations which he clearly knows could endanger him. But such people often have much to contribute, and deserve considerable respect." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{weight of}} information, and its {{constant}} repetition, made an apparently strong case against Driberg, and former friends such as Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, {{became convinced that}} he had indeed betrayed his country. Other friends and colleagues were more sceptical. According to ex-Labour MP Reginald Paget, not even the security services were [...] "lunatic enough to recruit a man like Driberg", who was famously indiscreet and could never keep a secret. Mitrokhin's [...] "blackmail" [...] story is questioned by historian Jeff Sharlet, {{on the grounds that}} by the 1950s and 1960s Driberg's homosexuality had been an open secret in British political circles for many years; he frequently boasted of his [...] "rough trade" [...] conquests to his colleagues. The journalist A. N. Wilson quotes Churchill commenting years before that [...] "Tom Driberg is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> gives sodomy a bad name".|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club critic Hayden Childs {{was more}} negative, giving the episode a C− rating and criticizing the two plots {{and the lack}} of good jokes. He wrote that while there was [...] "some comic potential" [...] in the premise, the writers failed to deliver funny material. Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the back at work. Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer {{may not be the best}} character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story. Yes, that is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> would stab someone in the back for their own gain, but yes, Homer also had it coming. Where is the joke?" ...|$|E
500|$|Grissom {{announced}} his retirement just as evidence comes to light that The Dick and Jane Killer, a serial killer from the 1990s currently serving two life sentences, did not act alone, and that his accomplice had begun killing again. Rather than leave {{in the middle of}} a case, Grissom stayed on to help solve it, and ultimately proved instrumental in saving the life of a woman who would have been the killer's latest victim. The case closed, Grissom, having already had a series of one-on-one farewells with his co-workers, silently left the crime lab and departed for Costa Rica for a reunion with fiancée Sara Sidle, an allusion perhaps to his comments in a [...] episode that when he left, people would not throw a party for him because he was not <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> people would get deeply involved with. He also says to Warrick in season two ("Ellie") that when he left there would not be a cake in the break room—he would just pick up and leave.|$|E
500|$|While waiting outside, {{the police}} {{questioned}} Bamber, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, {{he told them}} about the phone call from his father, and that it sounded as though someone had cut off the call. He said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have [...] "gone berserk with a gun", the police said he replied: [...] "I don't really know. She is a nutter. She's been having treatment." [...] The police asked why Nevill would have called Bamber and not the police. Bamber replied that his father was <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> might want to keep things within the family. He said that he (Bamber) had called the police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect how long the police would take to respond. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site [...] "would be able to stand him a Porsche" [...] soon.|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned to}} Gregory for prompting, and {{he managed to}} say, [...] "I don't believe he was quite <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> to--And yet he might--he was in trouble--" ...|$|R

500|$|... "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the classic episodes of South Park. Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News described Mr. Hankey himself as [...] "the most outrageous character yet on TV's most outrageous show". Charlie Patton of The Florida Times-Union said the episode was [...] "crude, nasty, irreverent and generally offensive—also extremely funny". He also said of the Mr. Hankey character, [...] "If you're <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> didn't care for that scene in Trainspotting where the Ewan McGregor character dove down the toilet and into the sewer in pursuit of his lost suppository, the whole Mr. Hankey subplot is going to be deeply disturbing." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said, [...] "Technically, the Christmas episode might well be the show's best effort, artistically, because it tackles the PC-ification of Christmas head-on, and also has an interesting psychological subtext: does the hero actually see Mr. Hankey, or does he have some serious psychological problems?" [...] Diane Werts of Newsday said of the episode, [...] "It's gross. It's yucky. It's probably offensive. It's also possibly the funniest holiday episode anybody's airing this year." [...] Werts particularly praised the song [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas". Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, author of Taking South Park Seriously, said, [...] "This episode arguably pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable, both for Christmas specials and television in general, farther than any previous one." [...] Weinstock said this was particularly true of the episode's fake live-action commercial.|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} this fallacy could be [...] "My {{opponent}} for office just received an endorsement from the Puppy Haters Association. Is that <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> {{you would want to}} vote for?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Heh-cha-cha!" [...] coughed Dr. Kennicott. She stopped. She {{remembered that}} he was <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> chewed tobacco.

6000|$|... "A woman," [...] he said, [...] "who {{is fond of}} a man is apt to {{have her}} {{judgment}} a little warped. The Duchess is a woman of fine perceptions and sound judgment. But she is attracted by Lawrence Mannering. She admires him. He is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> appeals to her imagination. These feelings might easily become, if they have not already developed into, something else. And I tell you again that I do not believe your story would stop her from marrying him." ...|$|E
60|$|And, of course, {{there is}} no decent-minded person {{nowadays}} but wants {{to put an end}} to that ugly blot upon our civilisation, the publication of whatever is most spicy and painful in divorce court proceedings. It is an outrage which falls even more heavily on the innocent than on the guilty, and which has deterred hundreds of shy and delicate-minded people from seeking legal remedies for nearly intolerable wrongs. <b>The</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> goes willingly to the divorce court to-day is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> would love a screaming quarrel in a crowded street. The emotional breach of the marriage bond is as private an affair as its consummation, and it would be nearly as righteous to subject young couples about to marry to a blustering cross-examination by some underbred bully of a barrister upon their motives, and then to publish whatever chance phrases in their answers appeared to be amusing in the press, as it is to publish contemporary divorce proceedings. The thing is a nastiness, a stream of social contagion and an extreme cruelty, and there can be no doubt that whatever other result this British Royal Commission may have, there at least will be many sweeping alterations.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, as to that," [...] he said, [...] "and {{if we are}} {{to judge}} only by what we read in the papers, they are curious, without a doubt. But I am not supposing for one moment that you fellows at Scotland Yard don't know more than you've let on to the newspapers. You keep your discoveries out of the Press over here, and a good job, too, but you wouldn't persuade me that you haven't some very {{distinct}} theory as to how that crime was worked, and <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> did it.

6000|$|Do you not {{understand}} me yet? Then {{think what you}} would have thought of St. Peter, if, instead of saying, 'Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord,' St. Peter had said, 'Stay with me, for I am a holy man, O Lord. I am just <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> deserves the honour of thy company; and my boat, poor though it is, more fit for thee than the palace of a king.' Would St. Peter have seemed to you then wiser or more foolish, better or worse, than he does now, when in his confused honest humility, he begs the Lord to go away and leave him? And do you not feel that a man is (as a great poet says) 'displeasing alike to God and to the enemies of God,' when he comes boldly to the throne of grace, not to find grace and mercy, because he feels that he needs them: but to boast of God's grace, and make God's mercy to him an excuse for looking down upon his fellow- creatures; and worships, like the Pharisee, in self-conceit and pride, thanking God that he is not as other men are? ...|$|E

There are a great many things for {{them to think about}} when they marry a second time: their children, their positions, and all that. I believe that if a man and his wife discussed it, which they would not be likely to do, they would be very apt to be of the same mind in regard to <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> ought to come in as number two. For my part, I do not wonder at all that so many women have cast their eyes on Margaret Temple as a person they would like to have take their places when they are gone. For one thing, you know they would not be jealous of her; this is very important. Then, they would be as certain as anything can be certain in this world that their children, if they had any, as well as their husbands, would be in most excellent hands. Often, when I have been thinking about her, I have called Margaret Temple the Vice-consort; but I have never told any one this. Please remember.' ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. Pembroke {{handed it}} over, and was {{introduced}} by Hugh. He looked at Honora, and his glance somehow betokened {{that he was in}} the habit of looking only once. He had apparently made up his mind about her before he saw her. But he looked again, evidently finding her at variance with a preconceived idea, and this time she flushed a little under his stare, and she got the impression that Mr. Pembroke was a man from whom few secrets of a certain kind were hid. She felt that he had seized, at a second glance, a situation that she had succeeded in hiding from the women. He was surprised, but cynically so. He was <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> had probably possessed at Harvard the knowledge of the world of a Tammany politician; he had long ago written his book--such as it was--and closed it: or, rather, he had worked out his system at a precocious age, and it had lasted him ever since. He had decided that undergraduate life, freed from undergraduate restrictions, was a good thing. And he did not, even in these days, object to breaking something valuable occasionally.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was an {{excellent}} hint; but instead of retreating the girl continued to advance, followed by her long-faced brother in his knickerbocker suit, {{in which he had}} been singing comic songs for the entertainment of a joyless proletariat. She advanced not as if she had failed to understand--the word 'police' has an unmistakable sound--but rather as if she could not help herself. She did not advance with the free gait and expanding presence of a distinguished amateur anarchist amongst poor, struggling professionals, but with slightly raised shoulders, and her elbows pressed close to her body, as if trying to shrink within herself. Her eyes were fixed immovably upon Sevrin. Sevrin the man, I fancy; not Sevrin the anarchist. But she advanced. And that was natural. For all their assumption of independence, girls of that class are used to the feeling of being specially protected, as, in fact, they are. This feeling accounts for nine tenths of their audacious gestures. Her face had gone completely colourless. Ghastly. Fancy having it brought home to her so brutally that she was <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> must run away from the police! I believe she was pale with indignation, mostly, though there was, of course, also the concern for her intact personality, a vague dread of some sort of rudeness. And, naturally, she turned to a man, to the man on whom she had a claim of fascination and homage--the man who could not conceivably fail her at any juncture." ...|$|E
60|$|For Arick {{is really}} {{what you call a}} savage, though a savage is a very {{different}} sort of a person, and very much nicer than he is made to appear in little books. He is {{the kind of person that}} everybody smiles to, or makes faces at, or gives a smack as he goes by; the sort of person that all the girls on the plantation give the best seat to and help first, and love to decorate with flowers and ribbons, and yet all the while are laughing at him; <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> likes best to play with Austin, and whom Austin, perhaps (when he is allowed), likes best to play with. He is all grins and giggles and little steps out of dances, and little droll ways to attract people's attention and set them laughing. And yet, when you come to look at him closely, you will find that his body is all covered with scars! This happened when he was a child. There was war, as is the way in these wild islands, between his village and the next, much as if there were war in London between one street and another; and all the children ran about playing in the middle of the trouble, and, I dare say, took no more notice of the war than you children in London do of a general election. But sometimes, at general elections, English children may get run over by processions in the street; and it chanced that as little Arick was running about in the Bush, and very busy about his playing, he ran into the midst of the warriors on the other side. These speared him with a poisoned spear; and his own people, when they had found him, in order to cure him of the poison scored him with knives that were probably made of fish-bone.|$|E
