40|$|Abstract — Internet Protocol (IP) <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> is the {{enabling}} technology to control Internet crime. In this paper, {{we present a}} novel and practical IP <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> system called Flexible Deterministic Packet Marking (FDPM) which provides a defense system {{with the ability to}} find out the real sources of attacking packets that traverse through the network. While a number of other <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> schemes exist, FDPM provides innovative features such as to trace the source of IP packets and can obtain better tracing capability than others. In particular, FDPM adopts a flexible mark length strategy to make it compatible to different network environments; it also adaptively changes its marking rate according to the load of the participating router by a flexible flow-based marking scheme. Evaluations on both simulation and real system implementation demonstrate that FDPM requires a moderately small number of packets to complete the <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> process; add little additional load to routers and can trace a large number of sources in one <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> process. Key words—IP <b>trace</b> <b>back,</b> routers, security, and FDPMand performance evaluation. I...|$|R
40|$|Background: Travel from {{countries}} where {{viral haemorrhagic fevers}} (VHF) are endemic has increased significantly over the past decades. In several reported VHF events on airplanes, passenger <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> was initiated but {{the scale of the}} <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> differed considerably. The absence of guidance documents to help the decision on necessity and scale of the <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> contributed to this variation. This article outlines the recommendations of an expert panel on Lassa fever, Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fever to the wider scientific community in order to advise the relevant stakeholders in the decision and scale of a possible passenger <b>trace</b> <b>back.</b> Method: The evidence was collected through review of published literature and through the views of an expert panel. The guidance was agreed by consensus. Results: Only a few events of VHF cases during air travel are reported in literature, with no documented infection in followed up contacts, so that no evidence of transmission of VHF during air travel exists to date. Based on this and the expert opinion, it was recommended that passenger <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> was undertaken only if: the index case had symptoms during the flight; the flight was within 21 days after detection of the event; and for Lassa fever if exposure of body fluid has been reported. The <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> should only be done after confirmation of the index case. Passengers and crew with direct contact, seat neighbours (+/− 1 seat), crew and cleaning personal of the section of the index case {{should be included in the}} <b>trace</b> <b>back.</b> Conclusion: No evidence has been found for the transmission of VHF in airplanes. This information should be taken into account, when a <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> decision has to be taken, because such a measure produces an enormous work load. The procedure suggested by the expert group can guide decisions made in future events, where a patient with suspected VHF infection travelled on a plane. However, the actual decision on start and scale of a <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> always lies in the hands of the responsible people taking all relevant information into account...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} concern over the volume of attacks from international sources towards government and military networks. The next generation wars would all involve computers and network tools, rather than fighter planes and nuclear bombs. Our proposal is a range based intrusion detection system with a <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> scheme to survive against these next generation odds. The proposed system would use a biometric authentication scheme for data transmission internally within the network and the usual Intrusion Detection Scheme for data transmission with outside networks like internet. This biometric authentication also alleviates the problem that an outsider cannot enter the network by pretending to be an insider with spoofed IP address. In case an attack occurs, we use an Autonomous System level IP <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> to <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> the attack to its source. The advantages of our proposed system are: 1. The possibility of an attack from {{inside and outside the}} system is meager because the system has facilities to authenticate transmissions within the network and to detect malicious data from outside the network. 2. In case an attack occurs, the <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> scheme would <b>trace</b> <b>back</b> the attack to the source, thus enabling ‘punish the guilt’...|$|R
