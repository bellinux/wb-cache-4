50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{named as}} Jhongjun Pi or Minong <b>Lake.</b> In 1956, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> renamed to Zhongzheng <b>Lake</b> since <b>the</b> visit of Chiang Kai-shek, and in August 2016, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> renamed to Meinong Lake.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} <b>the</b> 1980s {{and the main}} basin of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} a Button Grass swamp prior to inundation.|$|R
5|$|The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) {{began the}} $1.9 billion {{construction}} project in 1995. Filling of the lake, {{by way of}} the Colorado River Aqueduct, began in 1999 and was completed in 2003. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> currently served by the Inland Feeder.|$|E
5|$|The lake has {{a maximum}} depth of 17feet (5.3m). <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> often {{reported}} to be deeper, but bathymetric surveys by the Royal Park in 2010 revealed {{the design of the}} lake.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} the {{approximate}} geographic centre of the city, and is the centrepiece of the capital in accordance with Griffin's original designs. Numerous important institutions, such as the National Gallery, National Museum, National Library, Australian National University and the High Court were built on its shores, and Parliament House is a short distance away. Its surrounds, consisting mainly of parklands, are popular with recreational users, particularly in the warmer months. Though swimming in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> uncommon, it is used {{for a wide variety}} of other activities, such as rowing, fishing, and sailing.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> called Three Mile <b>Lake.</b> During <b>the</b> 1920s, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> renamed <b>Lake</b> Angelus by Mrs. Sollace B. Collidge.|$|R
5|$|In {{its early}} years, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> used for boating, canoeing, curling, and ice skating. By 1899, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> used {{by up to}} 3,000 skaters on weekdays and 10,000 on weekends. The ice-skating house, shared with the golf course, was added in 1902.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> {{popular as}} a visitor {{attraction}} and a summer resort. Fisheries and the harvesting {{of food and}} fodder plants are also important on Dal. Weeds from the lake are extracted and converted into compost for the gardens. It {{also serves as a}} flood lung of the Jhelum River. Swimming, boating, snow skiing (particularly when <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> frozen during the severe winter), and canoeing are amongst some of the water sports activities practised on the lake.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> first {{referred}} to as Cranberry Lake by HBC governor George Simpson {{as he made his}} way toward Athabasca Pass in 1824. In 1863, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> called Buffalo Dung Lake by Overlanders in search of gold. It was in 1872 that <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> given its present name, as suggested by George Grant. He named it after the nearby pass.|$|R
25|$|Prior {{to human}} development, Flushing Meadows was {{originally}} a tidal marsh, with Flushing Creek receiving south-flowing waters from the tides of Flushing Bay. Although <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> <b>were</b> built as freshwater lakes and dammed to mitigate tidal effects, flooding continues to effect <b>the</b> park. <b>The</b> <b>lakes</b> <b>are</b> also highly eutrophic, due to nutrients such as phosphorus {{from the former}} marshland seeping into the water, leading {{to the death of}} fish in <b>the</b> <b>lakes.</b> <b>The</b> regular tidal action that would filter <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> <b>is</b> prevented by <b>the</b> dam. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> <b>are</b> subject to pollution and storm runoff from the nearby highways, via pipes which feed into <b>the</b> <b>lakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} 1989, when the stream was dammed {{to prevent the}} floods in the {{drainage}} bassin of the Topčiderska reka. A proper road to <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> built in <b>the</b> spring of 2010. In 1999, during the NATO bombing of Serbia, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> drained, its bed was cleaned, and then refilled. Unconfirmed stories claimed that the reason was an unexploded NATO bomb which fell into <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2012 Aberdeenshire Council {{gave the}} go-ahead for the present owner's planned {{restoration}} work on the temple and bridges, which he hoped would enhance existing facilities at nearby Drinnies Wood surrounding the Observatory, White Cow Woods and Aden Country Park. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> used regularly by local fishermen, and a fishing club with about 120 members was established in 2011. The rest of the estate is seldom used by local residents, {{many of whom are}} completely unaware of it.|$|E
5|$|Chew Valley Lake Sailing Club has a sailing area, {{approximately}} 1.9miles (3km) long, for dinghy sailing. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} two areas: a restricted summer area which is available during the fishing season (mid-March to mid-October), and the full area {{which can be used}} throughout the winter and on Sunday afternoons. The sailing area is marked out by lines of small white buoys. Racing marks are red buoys with flags, although large inflatable marks are used of open events.|$|E
5|$|Entry to the {{protected}} area, including <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> <b>is</b> {{controlled by the}} Australian government. Permits are strictly issued only for specific scientific {{research in the field}} of paleontology, paleoclimate, geology, geomorphology, glaciology, biology and limnology. Visits for educational or cultural reasons, which are mandatory within a defined management plan, are also permitted. Any such visit must not cause harm to the ecological or scientific values of the area.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> {{built on}} top of the Las Vegas Wash, which {{continues}} to flow under <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> in two 96 in diameter pipes.

50|$|By June 1933, 110,000 tons of silt {{had been}} pumped, {{allowing}} 4.8 hectares {{of land to}} be reclaimed. Much of the fringing vegetation was removed and replaced with lawns. The southern shore of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> developed with a kiosk, bathing sheds, boat house and a T-shaped jetty. A swim-through on <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> held {{as part of the}} celebrations, as well as a canoe race involving Leederville, Wembley and Mount Hawthorn Boy Scouts and a series of bonfires. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> used extensively for picnicking, yachting, swimming and fishing.

5000|$|<b>The</b> Gippsland <b>Lakes</b> <b>are</b> {{a network}} of lakes, marshes and lagoons in east Gippsland, Victoria, Australia {{covering}} an area of about 354 km2. [...] The largest of <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> <b>are</b> <b>Lake</b> Wellington (Gunai language: Murla), Lake King and <b>Lake</b> Victoria. <b>The</b> <b>lakes</b> <b>are</b> collectively fed by the Avon, Thomson, Latrobe, Mitchell, Nicholson and Tambo rivers.|$|R
5|$|Generally, powerboat use on <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> not permitted. Permits are {{available}} {{for the use of}} powered boats on the lake for use in rescue, training, commercial purposes or special interest (such as historic steam powered boats). Molonglo Reach, an area of the Molonglo River just before it enters the east basin is set aside for water skiing. Ten powerboats may be used in this limited area.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake (also {{known as}} Harvey Lake or Harvey's Lake) {{is a natural}} lake in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. It has a surface area of {{approximately}} 621.5 acres, or nearly a square mile. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> situated entirely within the borough of Harveys Lake. By volume, {{it is the largest}} natural lake in Pennsylvania, and by surface area, is the second-largest lake. It is a glacial lake surrounded by hills and is the source of Harveys Creek, a tributary of the Susquehanna River. The lake has a stone masonry dam. The lake's watershed has an area of approximately 3600 acres. The majority of the watershed is forested, but there is some developed land as well. Nearly all of the developed land is close to the lake itself, and <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> surrounded entirely by a paved road.|$|E
5|$|Lake Tauca is one {{of several}} ancient lakes which formed in the Altiplano. Other known lakes are Lake Escara, Ouki, Salinas, Lake Minchin, Inca Huasi and Sajsi, in {{addition}} to several water-level rises of Lake Titicaca. The identity of these lakes is controversial; Sajsi is often considered part of Lake Tauca, and <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> frequently divided into an earlier (Ticaña) and a later (Coipasa) phase.|$|E
50|$|Bird life at <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> {{abundant}} before <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> dredged in 1973. Since then it {{has been}} reduced but has a stable population of mute swan, mallard, reed bunting, and common moorhen.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> first {{mentioned}} in ancient scriptures {{such as the}} Skanda Purana, the Padma Purana and the Ain-i-Akbari. The first European to visit <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> a British officer, J.E. Alexander, in 1823.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> {{a popular}} venue for boating until the 1970s, with a jetty and boat hire facilities. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> totally emptied in 2007 for the {{extensive}} renovation work {{and all of}} the fish (which included specimen weights of carp, tench, roach, pike and golden orf) were caught with large nets and sent to various locations across the UK. Following its restoration, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> refilled in 2010. Turtles have also <b>been</b> spotted in <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mono Lake {{itself has}} {{its own set of}} activities, {{including}} walking tours among towers of tufa, boat tours of the lake, and birdwatching opportunities. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> too salty to support any fish, but fishing is possible in streams that feed Mono Lake. Additional activities include hiking around and on the craters and domes, and mountain biking outside of the Scenic Area boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Nagin Lake, though {{sometimes}} referred to as a separate lake, is actually part of Dal, being linked through a causeway which permits only bikers and walkers to enter the lake precincts. The caseway carries the water supply pipeline to the Srinagar city in the east. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> bounded by the Shankaracharya hill (Takht-e-Suleiman) on the south and Hari Parbat on the west and is located {{at the foot of the}} Zabarwan hills. Willow and poplar trees flank the edges of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{surrounds}} Lake Phelps, North Carolina's {{second largest}} natural made lake. The lake, on a peninsula between Albemarle Sound and the Pamlico River, {{is one of}} a series of Carolina bay lakes that stretch from New Jersey to Florida along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Exactly how the lakes were formed remains a mystery. What is known is that Lake Phelps is not fed by any stream, but relies entirely upon rain and springs to maintain its water level. Since <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> not fed by a stream that could carry pollutants from nearby farms and factories, the water is very clean. Lake Phelps is five miles (8km) across, with an average depth of just 4.5feet (1.5m). <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> thought to be more than 38,000 years old.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Salt Valley <b>Lakes</b> <b>is</b> {{a system}} of more than twenty lakes in Lancaster County, Nebraska.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> {{named to}} honor {{a pair of}} {{brothers}} named Murray who prospected on <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> <b>The</b> name <b>was</b> officially adopted in 1941 ...|$|R
5000|$|Peña Blanca <b>Lake</b> <b>is</b> a {{reservoir}} in Arizona, United States, located 18 mi northwest of Nogales. The facilities are {{maintained by the}} Coronado National Forest division of the USDA Forest Service. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> created in 1957 by the Arizona Game and Fish Department. In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> closed to clean mercury contamination within the sediment, thought to be from old mines in the area. [...] <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> reopened in August 2009. In 2013, an Arizona Department of Environmental Quality report showed that mercury levels {{were similar to those}} before <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> drained and dredged. One potential cause for the high mercury could be naturally occurring mercury seeping through the faults or a spring in <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> though these claims are still under investigation.|$|R
