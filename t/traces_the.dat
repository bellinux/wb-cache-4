A degree of crossbreeding with Flatcoat or Chesapeake Bay retrievers was also documented in the early 20th century, prior to recognition. Chocolate Labradors were also well established in the early 20th century at the kennels of the Earl of Feversham, and Lady Ward of Chiltonfoliat.|$|E

5|$|Mahjong: The Dutch {{journalist}} and writer Jelte Rep {{writes that the}} gambling game of mahjong (Traditional Chinese: 麻將; Pinyin: májiàng), which employs a set of over a hundred tiles, was first invented in 1846 by Zhen Yumen, a Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) diplomatic official from Ningbo. However, Rep <b>traces</b> <b>the</b> origins of the game to a card game of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) which used thirty-two wood or ivory pieces {{in the shape of}} cards. This evolved into the forty-card game of madiao (馬吊) during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), which had four suits of cards instead of the three found in modern mahjong.|$|E
5|$|The {{emotional}} {{story is}} inspired by Maxim Gorky's sentimental novel Mother, which is considered the first socialist realist novel, and a story that Han was familiar with. Myers <b>traces</b> <b>the</b> story's foundation back to anti-Christian stories in rural colonial Korea {{as well as in}} fascist Japan. The metaphor of the villain as a beast, too, is more readily associated with wartime Japanese propaganda than socialist realism. It had, however, featured in the works of early Soviet writers as whose work Han knew, as well as in textual genres not bound by the official socialist realist dogma, such as journalism.|$|E
