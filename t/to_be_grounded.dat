5|$|The trial unit from NOHAB was {{delivered}} on 17 September 1954. The first test runs in scheduled service {{were on the}} Nordland Line between Trondheim and Mo i Rana in October. There were no technical faults until 22 December, when a grounding error caused the locomotive <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> until 17 January. In March the unit {{was sent back to}} NOHAB and went on a marketing tour that would eventually reach Ankara, Turkey in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Combat trials {{began in}} mid-September 1944 and were {{generally}} very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory {{service in the}} La-5FN. One cause was the lower position of the engine air intakes in the wing roots of the La-7 which caused the engine to ingest sand and dust. One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October which caused the fighter <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> until the cause {{was determined to be}} a defect in the wing spar.|$|E

25|$|During concert pieces, timpani {{were often}} {{grounded}} momentarily, using a ti-pod leg system. Eventually around 1981, timpani and mallet instruments were allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> in the front, {{paving the way}} to the modern day front ensemble. For a few years, corps still marched timpani. Some corps took advantage of the new rule, and grounded their timpani. However, some corps couldn't afford a new set of concert timpani, so they just grounded their marching timpani.|$|E

25|$|The flight {{began moving}} from Cairns to Bougainville in late October 1944, with its main party {{arriving}} {{on the island}} on 14 December 1944. Some operational flying was conducted in December, but all of No. 17 AOP Flight's aircraft had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> on the 31st of the month as their fabric airframes had been damaged by the tropical conditions. The necessary repairs included replacing some of the Austers fabric sections and perspex windows, but the process of shipping these items to Bougainville proved slow. As a result, the unit was inactive until the first aircraft to be repaired returned to service on 1 February 1945. A detachment of No. 17 AOP Flight was established on 14 February at Cape Hoskins {{on the island of}} New Britain to support the Australian Army units engaged there; this detachment comprised two officers and eight airmen, and was subsequently equipped with de Havilland Tiger Moth aircraft.|$|E

On 4 October, Duke of York and Anson covered a force of Allied cruisers and destroyers and the American carrier [...] under Operation Leader, which raided German shipping off Norway. The attack resulted in the sinking of four German merchant ships and damage to seven others, which forced many of them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grounded.</b>|$|E
500|$|In September 1959, Khrushchev {{visited the}} US While the test ban {{was not a}} focus on conversations, a {{positive}} meeting with Eisenhower at Camp David eventually led Tsarapkin to propose a technical working group in November 1959 that would consider the issues of on-site inspections and seismic decoupling in the [...] "spirit of Camp David." [...] Within the working group, Soviet delegates allowed for the timing of on-site inspections <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grounded</b> in seismic data, but insisted on conditions that were seen as excessively strict. The Soviets also recognized the theory behind decoupling, but dismissed its practical applications. The working group closed in December with no progress and significant hostility. Eisenhower issued a statement blaming [...] "the recent unwillingness of the politically guided Soviet experts to give serious scientific consideration {{to the effectiveness of}} seismic techniques for the detection of underground nuclear explosions." [...] Eisenhower simultaneously declared that the US would not be held to its testing moratorium when it expired on 31 December 1959, though pledged to not test if Geneva talks progressed. The Soviet Union followed by reiterating its decision to not test as long as Western states did not test.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] (GEC) is used {{to connect}} the system {{grounded}} ("neutral") conductor, or the equipment to a grounding electrode, or a point on the grounding electrode system. This is called [...] "system grounding" [...] and most electrical systems are required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grounded.</b> The U.S. NEC and the UK's BS 7671 list systems that are required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>grounded.</b> [...] According to the NEC, the purpose of connecting an electrical system to the physical ground (earth) is to limit the voltage imposed by lightning events and contact with higher voltage lines, and also for voltage stabilizion. In the past, water supply pipes were used as grounding electrodes, but due to {{the increased use of}} plastic pipes, which are poor conductors, the use of an actual grounding electrode is required.
