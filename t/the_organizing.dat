50|$|On 23 April 1908 Congress {{created the}} Medical Reserve Corps, the {{official}} predecessor of the Army Reserve. After World War I, under the National Defense Act of 1920, Congress reorganized the U.S. land forces by authorizing a Regular Army, a National Guard, and an Organized Reserve (Officers Reserve Corps and Enlisted Reserve Corps) of unrestricted size, which {{later became the}} Army Reserve. This organization provided a peacetime pool of trained Reserve officers and enlisted men for use in war. <b>The</b> <b>Organized</b> Reserve included <b>the</b> Officers Reserve Corps, Enlisted Reserve Corps, and Reserve Officers' Training Corps. <b>The</b> <b>Organized</b> Reserves were redesignated 25 March 1948 as <b>the</b> <b>Organized</b> Reserve Corps.

5|$|On July 19, 1848, {{the morning}} of the first day of convention, <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> {{committee}} arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before ten o'clock on a hot, sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors locked—an overlooked detail. Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an open window so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen to play down the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> body {{considered}} rescheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution levels were too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary person. A higher level of pollution in the air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as asthma.|$|E
5|$|The Calgary {{games were}} at the time {{one of the most}} {{expensive}} Olympics ever held, but <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> committee turned record television and sponsorship revenue into a net surplus that was used to maintain the facilities built for the Olympics and develop the Calgary region into the heart of Canada's elite winter sports program. The five purpose-built venues continue to be used in their original functions, and have helped the country develop into one of the top nations in Winter Olympic competition; Canada more than quintupled the five medals it won in Calgary at the 2010 games, the next Winter Olympics hosted on Canadian soil in Vancouver.|$|E

5|$|The Malo Polje area of Igman has {{traditionally}} been used for recreational cross-country skiing. During Sarajevo's Olympic bid, the two ski jumps were proposed as separate venues.

The area plan for the jumps were presented by <b>the</b> <b>Organizing</b> Committee's executive board on 30 April 1979 and was passed by Sarajevo City Council in September 1979.

5|$|The new {{university}} {{was created by}} law on December 28, 1962, but effective functioning begun in 1966. Before that, only the School of Medicine functioned.

The first lecture in the newly created University of Campinas took place on May 20 of the same year. By 1965, <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> commission for the new university started looking for a location for a new campus.|$|E
5|$|Unusually {{for winter}} sports, {{bobsleigh}} {{has never been}} popular in Norway. The country had not sent an Olympic team until the 1948 Winter Olympics {{and there were no}} previous bobsleigh tracks in Norway when Oslo was awarded the 1952 Winter Olympics. Two Swiss civil engineers, Heinz Cattani and Emil Ingold, were the main technical consultants {{for the development of the}} venue. The steep terrain made construction excessively expensive, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> committee deciding to build a temporary track, without permanent concrete and stone curves. Instead, a new track was constructed each year using snow: the overhangs were built by hand, the tracks were leveled and the structure sprayed with ice until it was hard.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, one of {{the main}} tasks of the Đinđić's {{government}} was the suppression of <b>the</b> <b>organized</b> crime.

5|$|White-and-red flags {{were first}} waved during a {{patriotic}} demonstration on May 3, 1916 in Warsaw. <b>The</b> <b>organizing</b> committee advised participants about the correct {{alignment of the}} colors, that is with the white stripe above the red one. Still, many demonstrators brought flags with the red stripe on top. On August 1, 1919, almost a year after Poland regained independence in November 1918, the Sejm officially introduced a white-and-red bicolor as the Polish national flag. In order to avoid confusion with the white-and-red maritime signal flag used internationally by harbor pilots and tugboats, the same act of Sejm introduced {{a variant of the}} flag with the coat of arms in the white stripe for use as a civil ensign and by Polish diplomats and consuls abroad.|$|E
5|$|With Boise State's {{decision}} to decline the Humanitarian Bowl invitation, <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> committee looked to Nevada.

The Wolf Pack's schedule included losses against then sixth-ranked Missouri, ninth-ranked Boise State, and 12th-ranked Texas Tech. Nevada finished the regular season ranked second nationally in rushing offense and fifth in total offense. The Wolf Pack possessed two 1,000-yard rushers: dual-threat quarterback Colin Kaepernick and running back Vai Taua. Kaepernick also threw for more than 2,000yards.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, it was {{announced}} that a contest would determine the mascot of the games. Children under the age of 16 had until March 8, 2013 to submit their ideas. 4,000 ideas and drawings were submitted to <b>the</b> <b>organizing</b> committee during this time frame. In April 2013, a shortlist of six mascot designs (which were produced by professional graphic designers, with the sketches by the children as models) were released, including a raccoon, beaver, moose, two pixie creature twins, porcupine and an owl. The final six were selected based on originality, how well they represent Canadian culture and the branding of the Games, and the appeal they had amongst adults and children. On April 22, 2013, the general public was allowed to vote for the mascot they felt was the best. Voting was open until May 5, 2013.|$|E
