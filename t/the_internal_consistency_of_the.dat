On {{the subject of the}} Jewish text, B.

Levy also writes that [...] "Despite the popular, pious-sounding assumption that the Torah text is letter-perfect, frequent and extensive discussions by highly respected rabbinic leaders demonstrate that they, in some measure similar to modern scholars, were concerned about its true textual state; some of them even tried to clarify known textual doubts and to eliminate many troublesome inconsistencies." [...] However, the modern writer Joshua Golding states that even though it contains inconsistencies, this [...] "does not imply that God did not reveal the Torah".|$|E

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} nature of spatial representations used in locomotion. Participants learned the layout of several objects and then pointed to the objects while blindfolded in 3 conditions: before turning (baseline), after turning to a new heading (updating), and after disorientation (disorientation). <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> pointing in <b>the</b> disorientation condition was relatively high and equivalent {{to that in the}} baseline and updating conditions, when the layout had salient intrinsic axes and the participants learned the locations of the objects on the periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> layout. <b>The</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> pointing was disrupted by disorientation when participants learned the locations of objects while standing amid them and the layout did not have salient intrinsic axes.

40|$|Background & Objective : Assessing students’ {{grades in}} their courses and in {{national}} comprehensive exams may {{help us in}} the assessment of educational status of different departments indirectly. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> medical students’ scores in Kerman University of Medical Sciences was assessed. Methods : In a historical cohort study, students’ grades and other information for entrance years between 1995 and 2003 were extracted from the central admission office and 10 indicators for educational achievement were defined for each student. Having used Cronbach's alpha and linear regression, we checked <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> scores. Also, we used factorial analysis and related graphs (Dendrogram) to evaluate the <b>consistency</b> between factors <b>of</b> students’ educational achievement. Results : Females were more successful in all series of students except for national comprehensive exams. Although <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> in males’ scores was more than females’, males’ scores in specific courses of basic sciences were more related to the scores of their basic sciences comprehensive exams. In addition, <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> in males’ scores was more than females’ especially in clinical courses. Higher age at entering university could cause a decrease in educational success. Students’ grades in various courses had slight consistency with national comprehensive exams. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> scores during clerkship and internship were significantly lower than the other phases. Conclusion : Lower <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> scores in clinical courses may imply lower validity of these scores. Unlike higher educational success in females, it seems that stability in males’ scores was greater in most indicators.

50|$|All Thread-shared non-concurrent Maps {{and other}} {{collections}} {{need to use}} some form of explicit locking such as native synchronization {{in order to prevent}} concurrent modification, or else there must be a way to prove from the program logic that concurrent modification cannot occur.

Also, concurrent modification by one Thread with read access by another Thread or Threads will sometimes give unpredictable results to the reader, although the Map's internal consistency will not be destroyed. Using external program logic to prevent concurrent modification increases code complexity and creates an unpredictable risk of errors in existing and future code, although it enables non-concurrent Collections to be used. However, either locks or program logic cannot coordinate external threads which may come in contact with the Collection.|$|E
