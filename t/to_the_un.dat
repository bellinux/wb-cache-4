5|$|A very {{frequently}} discussed change <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> structure {{is to change}} the permanent membership of the UN Security Council, which reflects the power structure of the world as it was in 1945.

5|$|As a {{delegate}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.N.</b> General Assembly in 1968, Cooper strongly denounced the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to reach a ceasefire, peacekeepers escorted Tshombe {{to the front lines}} where he was forced to agree that his own forces were attacking UN {{positions}} without provocation. He ordered his troops to cease firing but was ignored. Radio intercepts revealed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> that General Norbert Moke, the commander of the Katangese Gendarmerie, had ordered the Katangese Air Force to bomb the Élisabethville airport on the night of 29 December. With the failure to enact a ceasefire, Lieutenant General Dewan Prem Chand of India convinced Thant to authorise a strong, decisive offensive to pre-emptively eliminate Katangese forces. This brought relief to some of the UN peacekeepers, mindful that they now had justification to act forcefully against Katanga. Determined to avoid civilian casualties and widespread destruction, the secretary-general sent a wire <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> Force Commander in the Congo to explain that napalm was to be prohibited from use in combat. Early on 28 December for unknown reasons, Tshombe quietly departed Élisabethville.|$|E

50|$|The game {{takes place}} in the year 2053 when space travel between Earth and Mars is made {{possible}} thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN's</b> goal <b>to</b> conduct space travel. But with the presence of a mysterious terrorist group called Neo Kleit preparing <b>to</b> oppose <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN's</b> attempt <b>to</b> expand on space travel, a UN-established counter-terrorist unit called Shadow Sword is called in by the International Cosmic Security System or I-COSS <b>to</b> eliminate <b>the</b> group and protect the space development program and civilians {{with the help of a}} high-tech computer surveillance system called Project Surveillance.|$|R
5|$|Schwartzberg's {{weighted}} voting formula {{takes into account}} population (the democratic/demographic principle), contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> budget (the economic principle), and share of the total membership. The idea of weighting countries' votes according to their financial contribution to the organization is not unprecedented, as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other Bretton Woods institutions use this method.|$|E
5|$|The UN {{obey the}} Noblemaire principle, which is binding on any {{organization}} that belongs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> system. This principle calls for salaries that will draw and keep citizens of countries where salaries are highest, and {{also calls for}} equal pay for {{work of equal value}} independent of the employee's nationality. Staff salaries are subject to an internal tax that is administered by the UN organizations.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} also {{stipulates that}} if the OPCW Director-General determined {{there had been a}} delay in implementation of the decision, the matter should be discussed within 24 hours, when it should be decided whether the matter should be submitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> Security Council.|$|E

40|$|National {{courts have}} long {{understood}} <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>to</b> have absolute immunity from their jurisdiction, based upon provisions in <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> Charter and <b>the</b> Convention on Privileges and Immunities of <b>the</b> <b>UN.</b> While state immunity {{has evolved over}} recent decades, allowing restrictive immunity that distinguishes between acts jure imperii and those jure gestionis, questions have arisen as to whether that doctrine applies to international organizations and, specifically, <b>the</b> <b>UN.</b> <b>The</b> counterbalance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN’s</b> absolute immunity is the requirement that it provide alternative mechanisms for resolving disputes. This raises concerns about accountability and internal review. Case law from various courts demonstrates an increasing willingness to attempt to challenge absolute immunity {{on the basis that}} <b>the</b> bar <b>to</b> jurisdiction violates claimants’ rights to access a court and to a remedy. In all of those cases, individuals’ ability to access alternative mechanisms for dispute resolution has been used to show that their rights have been realized. Recent events concerning the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti may lead to a challenge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN’s</b> absolute immunity. <b>The</b> <b>UN</b> has deemed those claims to be ‘not receivable’, which denies the claimants their rights to access a court and to a remedy. In October 2013, lawyers for the Haiti cholera victims filed a class action in the Southern District of New York, seeking <b>to</b> challenge <b>the</b> <b>UN’s</b> immunity by bringing the Organization before a national court. This article explores whether the events in Haiti may provide the first successful, human rights-based challenge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN’s</b> absolute immunity...|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> attack, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> {{questioned}} {{why it took}} Afghan {{police and}} NATO forces {{more than an hour}} to respond and come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN's</b> aid.

5|$|The main {{normative}} {{instrument for}} reforming the UN development {{system is the}} Quadrennial comprehensive policy review (QCPR). Following an assessment of progress, this General Assembly resolution which designs and gives mandates <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> system to better address reform objectives is negotiated every four years. The most recent QCPR was adopted in December 2012.|$|E
5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility. This {{is difficult because}} it requires ratification by two-thirds of UN members, including all five {{permanent members of the}} Security Council. There have been only five amendments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> Charter since 1945, and none of them were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E
50|$|He {{was posted}} to Kosovo to fight {{corruption}} but in 2007 he witnessed misconduct involving UN officials {{and a local}} utility company. He later reportedly uncovered evidence that two senior UN officials had received bribes for awarding a contract for {{the building of a}} coal fired power plant and mine. After complaining <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN's</b> oversight office his job was effectively abolished and he was investigated for misconduct. Wasserstrom then went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN's</b> Ethics Office where it was eventually ruled that he was maltreated but that this did not count as retaliation against a whistleblower.|$|R
50|$|On 16 September, Mehmet Ferden Çarıkçı, Turkey's {{permanent}} representative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.N.'s</b> Geneva office, harshly criticized <b>the</b> <b>U.N.'s</b> report on Thursday {{which does not}} refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PKK as a terrorist organization, although the group is recognized as a terrorist organization by many countries including the U.S., the EU, NATO and Turkey.|$|R

5|$|As he {{attempted}} to withdraw with the wounded soldier, Bleak was confronted by two more Chinese. Putting down the wounded soldier, Bleak reportedly surprised the Chinese soldiers by charging them and smashing their heads together {{with such force that}} he may have fractured the skulls of {{one or both of the}} assailants before pushing them out of his way. Eventually, all 20 men of the patrol returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> lines, but a third of them were wounded. Bleak was credited with saving the patrol, both by promptly treating the wounded and by aggressively attacking and killing or neutralizing five Chinese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, the North Korean {{government}} became more aggressive, and skirmishes between {{troops of the}} North and South became common. UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and prevent it from escalating. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal. For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> denying the legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country.|$|E
5|$|Brazil {{has been}} elected ten times to the Security Council.

Roosevelt lobbied for Brazil to be included on the Security Council, but the UK and the Soviet Union refused.|$|E
