The KC-767 Advanced <b>Tanker</b> is derived from studies for a longer-range cargo version of the 767-200ER, and features a fly-by-wire refueling boom, a remote vision refueling system, and a 767-400ER-based flight deck with LCD screens and head-up displays.

It was a good year across all segments of the <b>tanker</b> market segments, but {{not as good as}} 2004 and 2005. Amidst high oil prices, geopolitical tension, and fears of disruptions to the oil supply, growing demand was the main driving force in the <b>tanker</b> shipping market for the year. As demand grew moderately in the United States and Western Europe, expanding economies such as China fueled exponential growth in demand. Despite these strengths, each of the five <b>tanker</b> freight indices dropped during 2006.

50|$|The {{attacks on}} oil <b>tankers</b> continued. Both Iran and Iraq carried {{frequent}} attacks {{during the first}} four months of the year. Iran was effectively waging a naval guerilla war with its IRGC navy speedboats, while Iraq attacked with its aircraft. In 1987, Kuwait asked to reflag its <b>tankers</b> to the US flag. They did so in March, and the US navy began Operation Earnest Will to escort the <b>tankers.</b> The result of Earnest Will would be that while oil <b>tankers</b> shipping Iraqi/Kuwaiti oil were protected, Iranian <b>tankers,</b> and neutral <b>tankers</b> shipping to Iran would be unprotected, resulting in both losses for Iran and the undermining of its trade with foreign countries, damaging Iran's economy further. Iran also deployed Silkworm missiles to attack some ships, but only a few were actually fired. Both the US and Iran jockeyed for influence in the Gulf. To discourage the US from escorting <b>tankers,</b> Iran secretly mined some areas in the Gulf. The US began to escort the reflagged <b>tankers,</b> but one of them was damaged by a mine while under escort. While being a public-relations victory for Iran, the US increased its reflagging efforts. While Iran mined the Persian Gulf, their speedboat attacks were reduced, primarily attacking unflagged <b>tankers</b> shipping in the area.|$|R
