5|$|Although {{the exact}} details are unknown, in April738 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat {{captured}} Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and burned two of Copán's patron deities. Six days later Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was decapitated in Quiriguá. This coup {{does not seem}} to have physically affected either Copán or Quiriguá; there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute. All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. It has been suggested that Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was attempting to attack another site to secure captives for sacrifice in order to dedicate the new ballcourt when he was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.|$|E
5|$|In 738 the {{interlinked}} {{fortunes of}} Quiriguá and Copán took a stunning change of direction when K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat, reigning lord of Quiriguá, captured the powerful, but elderly 13th king of Copán, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who had installed {{him on his}} throne in 725. This coup {{does not seem to}} have affected either Copán or Quiriguá physically, there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute. Quiriguá seems rather to have gained its independence and the control of important trade routes. An inscription at Quiriguá, although difficult to interpret, suggests that the capture took place on 27 April 738, when Quiriguá seized and burned the wooden images of Copán's patron deities. All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. In the Classic Period the statues of Maya deities often were carried into battle on palanquins, facilitating their capture in the event of defeat. It has been suggested that the king of Copán was attempting to attack another site in order to secure captives for sacrifice, and was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors.|$|E
5|$|To repair Zulf's {{damage to}} the Bastion, the Kid starts {{collecting}} Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion had the ability <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with the Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys {{the remnants of the}} Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion.|$|E

25|$|Hitler is {{also the}} main 'protagonist' in the German dark satire novel Er ist wieder da ("Look Who's Back") by Timur Vermes, {{published}} in 2012. Hitler is shown <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> reawaken, alive again, in Berlin of 2011 and, since no one believes him to really be Hitler, becomes popular on YouTube as a Hitler impersonator.|$|E
25|$|These two {{approaches}} could be reconciled by acknowledging {{the tension between}} an agent's interests as an individual and {{as a member of}} various groups, and seeking <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> optimize among all of these interests. For example, it may be meaningful to speak of an action as being good for someone as an individual, but bad for them as a citizen of their town.|$|E
25|$|Early Buddhist monks did {{not doubt}} the {{existence}} of kami but saw them as inferior to their buddhas. Hindu deities had had the same reception: They were thought of as non-illuminated and prisoners of saṃsāra. Buddhist claims of superiority, however, encountered resistance; monks tried to overcome it by deliberately integrating kami in their system. Japanese Buddhists themselves wanted <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> give the kami equal status. Several strategies to do this were developed and employed, {{and one of them}} was the honji suijaku theory.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though he}} {{produced}} a number of pocket timekeepers, from around 1772-1778, Arnold was still experimenting with different types of compensation balance and methods of balance spring adjustment. The most difficult problem to surmount was the problem of making an effective and continuously adjustable temperature compensation device. For technical reasons, the temperature compensation for the balance spring had <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> {{be incorporated into the}} balance itself and not act on the balance spring directly as had been done previously by Arnold and others.|$|E
25|$|After Finn {{watched his}} girlfriend, Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco) and Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny) fight, {{he has a}} strange dream that gives him a sense of pleasure; however, he {{is not able to}} finish it before he wakes up. Upon awakening, he realizes that the Cosmic Owl (voiced by M. Emmet Walsh) was in the vision, which Jake interprets to mean that the reverie was a prophetic dream. Jake urges Finn <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> finish the dream. Finn, therefore, gets Flame Princess and Ice King to fight once more, but this time Ice King nearly defeats Flame Princess. That night, Finn has a similar dream, only this time, he imagines Ice King {{blasting}} him with ice.|$|E
25|$|There was a rumor of {{one final}} act to survive {{conducted}} by the USBA. The idea to turn Merl Mennenga, {{the founder of the}} ABA <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> force Mr. Anderson and Mr. Vargas to sell back the ABA and then to sell the ABA to the USBA which would then close down the ABA under the Chapter VII bankruptcy law with the USBA inheriting the tracks ABA's then current leadership. If true, perhaps they were thinking about the precedent of Walt Ehnart, the former President of the ABA and by then the Vice President of the USBA that they could have turned Mennenga. However unlikely it would have been, nothing came of it.|$|E

25|$|During the Pre-Hispanic {{period the}} early Filipinos had already {{believed}} in {{a concept of}} life after death. This belief in an afterlife prompted the Filipinos to create burial customs and beliefs <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> honor the dead through rituals. Due to different cultures from {{different part of the}} Philippines many different burial practices have also emerged from the different tribes. For example, The Manobos had to bury their dead in trees, the Ifugaos had to seat their corpse on a chari before it was brought to a cave and buried elsewhere. These funeral practices and cultural beliefs are myths created by these indigenous people to try make sense of the world that they are living in as a way to compensate for their lack of understanding.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{emission}} and absorption of photons seemed {{to demand that}} the conservation of energy will hold at best on average. If a wave containing exactly one photon passes over some atoms, {{and one of them}} absorbs it, that atom needs to tell the others that they can't absorb the photon anymore. But if the atoms are far apart, any signal cannot reach the other atoms in time, and they might end up absorbing the same photon anyway and dissipating the energy to the environment. When the signal reached them, the other atoms would have <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> recall that energy. This paradox led Bohr, Kramers and Slater to abandon exact conservation of energy. Heisenberg's formalism, when extended to include the electromagnetic field, was obviously going to sidestep this problem, a hint that the interpretation of the theory will involve wavefunction collapse.|$|E
25|$|In May 2008 SNMM {{revealed}} that some time between October 2007 and April 2008 the Dalarö wreck site had been disturbed. Some items {{had been removed}} while others had been disturbed or damaged. Among the objects that have disappeared so far is the wooden frame of a pistol that was located on the weather deck. The ship is monitored by the coast guard, and the residents of Dalarö have been notified {{to be wary of}} attempts to plunder the wreck. As of 2009, objects recorded by archaeologists have disappeared and the wreck has been disturbed and to some extent damaged. Known wreck sites in the Baltic are inevitably plundered, and there have been public appeals <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> protect the Dalarö wreck. Though illegal, there is little preventing individuals from performing private covert diving operations in order to bring up objects from the ship in order to sell them on the black market.|$|E

25|$|One of her co-workers, Yutaka Uchikoshi, {{cares for}} Minami and visits her shanty when she misses work {{because her mother}} is sick. He later gives her a pair of sandals made by his mother and a handkerchief, but {{when he tries to}} kiss her, she has a {{flashback}} where she sees the victims of the bombing where they now stand and pushes him away. She runs off, still reliving the horrors of the attack, including finding her little sister's blackened body and watching her older sister die of radiation poisoning two months later. The next day at the office, she apologizes to Uchikoshi, saying she wants <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> put the past behind her. She spends the day exhausted, however, and the next day becomes bedridden from the long-term effects of radiation poisoning. As Minami's condition worsens, she is visited by Uchikoshi and other co-workers, and dies just as her brother and aunt arrive.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Lehigh Gorge State Park is tied into the {{development}} of anthracite coal mining, which was once {{the center of the}} high-tech economy of northeastern Pennsylvania in its day. It is also tied into the early-to-middle period of the United State's Canal Era and the rapid development of pragmatic railroading technologies and consequent accelerated growth and use of railroadsall contributing factors in the Pennsylvanian and North American Industrial Revolution. By the 1790s deforestation of the American East, like it had in Britain a century earlier, was making the search for alternative fuels urgent and with England's experience of coal many were willing to invest in ventures <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> mine and ship Anthracite east to the Delaware River where it could be barged to the cities of the east coast of the United States. England's technological lead was obvious and its extensive canal system was given much credit for the success of Britain's industries and its emergence as the sole world power {{at the end of the}} Seven Years' War.|$|E
25|$|The team first {{considered}} {{spinning the}} radar dish around a vertical axis and then angling the dish {{up and down}} a few degrees with each complete circuit. The vertical motion could be smoothed out by moving continually rather than in steps, producing a helix pattern. However, this helical-scan solution had two disadvantages; one was that the dish spent half of its time pointed backwards, limiting the amount of energy broadcast forward, and the other was that it required the microwave energy <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> be sent to the antenna through a rotating feed. At a 25 October all-hands meeting attended by Dee, Hodgkin and members of the GEC group at GEC's labs, {{the decision was made to}} proceed with the helical-scan solution in spite of these issues. GEC solved the problem of having the signal turned off half the time by using two dishes mounted back-to-back and switching the output of the magnetron to the one facing forward at that instant. They initially suggested that the system would be available by December 1940, but as work progressed it became clear that it would take much longer.|$|E

25|$|Jade visits her bed-ridden {{father in}} the Emerald City, and offers to use her {{abilities}} to help him walk again. Alan declines his daughter's offer, reasoning that if the Starheart were to once again take over his body, it {{could result in the}} deaths of everyone in the city. Eclipso attacks the city, which results in Jesse Quick having to get Alan to safety. After taking over Jade, Eclipso has the power of the starheart then defeats and possesses the Justice League's reserve roster, and then badly injures the angel Zauriel. With the Justice League outnumbered, Eclipso then reveals his ultimate goal is <b>to</b> <b>somehow</b> kill God. Eclipso then tortures Zauriel, causing his screams {{to attract the attention of}} the new Spectre, Crispus Allen, who he kills, absorbing the Spectre's powers upon his demise. With his newfound abilities, Eclipso reveals that God relies on the collective love of humanity in order to stay alive, and that by destroying the Earth, Eclipso will ultimately kill God once and for all. Just as the members of the JLA prepare to wage a counterattack, Eclipso destroys the moon, apparently dooming all life on Earth. With the moon destroyed, Eclipso then seemingly kills Donna Troy, the physically strongest remaining member of the Justice League. However, it is ultimately revealed that Donna's death was an illusion conjured by Saint Walker, who used his blue power ring to temporarily trap Eclipso in a state of euphoria. After the Atom and Starman break Eclipso's link to his brainwashed slaves, the combined heroes attack Eclipso together, defeating him. In the aftermath it is discovered that Jade and Obsidian can now be within proximity of each other again and their father has control of the Starheart again.|$|E
