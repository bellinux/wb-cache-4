5|$|In the manga series Pokémon Adventures, Team Rocket creates Mewtwo, {{but some}} of his DNA is placed inside of the Gym leader Blaine. Because of the DNA that they share, the two are unable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> for very long without {{becoming}} ill.

5|$|Like Crazy is a 2011 American romantic drama film {{directed}} by Drake Doremus and starring Anton Yelchin, Felicity Jones and Jennifer Lawrence. Written by Doremus and Ben York Jones, the film {{tells the story}} of Anna (Felicity Jones), a British exchange student who falls in love with an American student, Jacob (Yelchin), only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from him when she is denied re-entry into the United States after staying in the country longer than her student visa allows.|$|E

Electric stop actions can be controlled at the console by stop knobs, by pivoted tilting tablets, or rocker tabs. These are simple switches, like wall switches for room lights.

5|$|Before the vote, {{there were}} {{calls for the}} bills <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> at the Diet. Waseda University {{professor}} Norihiro Kato stated that Kimigayo is a separate issue {{more complex than the}} Hinomaru flag. Attempts to designate only the Hinomaru as the national flag by the DPJ and other parties during the vote of the bill were rejected by the Diet. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 22, 1999, by a 403 to 86 vote. The legislation was sent to the House of Councilors on July 28 and was passed on August 9. It was enacted into law on August 13.|$|E
5|$|However, out at {{the site}} of the accident, it was {{discovered}} that the bags of cement had solidified and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> before the BX could be raised and the salvage could not be completed before freeze-up. In the spring of 1920, the salvage work was completed and at a cost of $40,000 the BX was raised and patched sufficiently to get her back to Fort George. The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers that one would push another upriver through a canyon. That it could be accomplished was a fitting testament to the craftsmanship of Alexander Watson Jr and the skill of Captain Browne and Captain Bucey.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, trees produce {{wood with}} a wavy grain, greatly {{increasing}} the value for decorative veneers. The wood is a medium weight for a hardwood, weighing 630kg per cubic metre. It {{is a traditional}} wood for use in making the backs, necks and scrolls of violins. The wood is often marketed as rippled sycamore. Whistles {{can be made from}} straight twigs when the rising sap allows the bark <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated,</b> and these, and sycamore branches, are used in customs associated with early May in Cornwall. The wood is used for fuel, being easy to saw and to split with an axe, producing a hot flame and good embers when burnt.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 dive season {{concentrated}} on raising the ship's steam engine and condenser. Hull plates {{had to be}} removed to access the engine compartment and both the engine and the condenser had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from the ship, the surrounding wreckage and each other. A Mini Rover ROV was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff above water. The engine was raised on 16 July and the condenser three days later by the crane barge Wotan. Saturation diving was evaluated by the Navy that dive season on Monitor and proved to be very successful, allowing divers to maximize their time on the bottom. The surface-supplied divers evaluated the use of heliox due to the depth of the wreck. It also proved to be successful once the dive tables were adjusted.|$|E
5|$|The Navy Department {{conducted}} an international design competition for Texas {{and the winner}} was the Naval Construction & Armaments Co. of Barrow-in-Furness, England. The winning design placed Texass forward turret {{on the port side}} and her aft turret to starboard. The need for cross-deck fire caused the superstructure <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between the sections of the superstructure. This significantly limited the gun's ability to fire to the opposite beam as the superstructure still restricted each gun's arc of fire. Furthermore, neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired, as demonstrated during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba when her starboard deck was damaged.|$|E

5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an {{apparition}} of the murdered Banquo, along with eight of his descendants. The scene carries deep significance: King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, was believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from Banquo by nine generations. What Shakespeare writes here thus amounts to a strong support of James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's day, a very real fulfilment of the witches' prophecy to Banquo that his sons would take the throne. This apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce's staunchly Church of England {{mother and}} grandfather, alarmed at these nonconformist {{influences}} {{and at his}} leanings towards evangelicalism, brought the 12-year-old boy back to Hull in 1771. Wilberforce was heartbroken <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from his aunt and uncle. His family opposed a return to Hull Grammar School because the headmaster had become a Methodist; Wilberforce therefore continued his education at nearby Pocklington School from 1771 to 1776. Influenced by Methodist scruples, he initially resisted Hull's lively social life, but as his religious fervour diminished, he embraced theatre-going, attended balls and played cards.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of running blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades {{within a few months}} before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double blade and T44 single blade classes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.|$|E

5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez {{has been slow to}} join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an out. Before the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E
5|$|Ben Arfa {{made his}} league debut {{on the opening}} day of the season in a 4–4 draw with Rennes. He scored his first goal for Les Marseillais in that match. He {{continued}} in form scoring six times in his first 11 matches. However, his reputation for controversy continued to haunt him when he was involved in another dispute, this time with the Cameroon international Modeste M'bami during a warm up session ahead of the club's UEFA Champions League match against Liverpool. The two had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> by Ronald Zubar. Controversy arose again following Marseille's 4–2 loss to Le Classique rivals Paris-Saint Germain. He drew the ire of manager Eric Gerets after his refusal to leave the bench to warm up. Ben Arfa later said he was injured much to the chagrin of Gerets, but later apologized for the incident to the media and Gerets himself. Upon his return to the squad, Ben Arfa responded by scoring a goal and providing the assists on both the other goals in a 3–1 victory over Saint-Étienne.|$|E
5|$|Following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, {{led by the}} Free Officers Movement of Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser, {{in which}} the Egyptian monarchy was overthrown, the {{university}} began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> from the mosque. A number of properties that surrounded the mosque were acquired and demolished to provide space for a modern campus by 1955. The mosque itself would no longer serve as a school, and the college was officially designated a university in 1961. The 1961 law separated the dual roles of the educational institution and the religious institution which made judgments heeded throughout the Muslim world. The law also created secular departments within al-Azhar, such as colleges of medicine, engineering, and economics, furthering the efforts at modernization first seen following the French occupation. The reforms of the curriculum {{have led to a}} massive {{growth in the number of}} Egyptian students attending al-Azhar run schools, specifically youths attending primary and secondary schools within the al-Azhar system. The number of students reported to attend al-Azhar primary and secondary schools increased from under 90,000 in 1970 to 300,000 in the early in 1980s, up to nearly one million in the early 1990s, and exceeding 1.3 million students in 2001.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1990s, Nordreisa Municipal Council {{attempted}} {{to change the}} airport's name from Sørkjosen to Nordreisa. They {{argued that it was}} necessary to use the Nordreisa name to market the region as a tourist destination. The application was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, who stated that airports were required by regulation to be named after a settlement rather than a municipality. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. This required the terminal to be slightly rebuilt; while it previously had a common departure and arrivals hall, it had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> into two areas. The municipality therefore decided to transfer the ownership of the ground handling service to the three employees. Avinor carried out a major upgrade to the runway safety area and landing lights in 2008 and 2009. The investments cost NOK40 million. The expansion of the safety area resulted in part of the lot of Birkelund Sawmill being expropriated.|$|E
5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>separated.</b> An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E
