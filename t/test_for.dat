5|$|Potassium tetraiodomercurate(II), K2HgI4, is {{also known}} as Nessler's reagent. It is often used as a {{sensitive}} spot <b>test</b> <b>for</b> ammonia. Similarly, Cu2HgI4 is used as a precipitating reagent to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> alkaloids. The iodide and iodate anions are often used for quantitative volumetric analysis, for example in iodometry and the iodine clock reaction (in which iodine also serves as a <b>test</b> <b>for</b> starch, forming a dark blue complex), and aqueous alkaline iodine solution is used in the iodoform <b>test</b> <b>for</b> methyl ketones.

5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest <b>test</b> <b>for</b> all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform <b>test</b> <b>for</b> all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest <b>test</b> <b>for</b> mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the <b>test</b> <b>for</b> standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Court's decision in Schmerber, many legal scholars feared the ruling {{would be used to}} limit civil liberties. Other scholars, including Nita A.

Because the Court's ruling in Schmerber prohibited the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some commentators argue that the decision was responsible for the proliferation of breathalyzers to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> alcohol and urine analyses to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> controlled substances in criminal investigations.|$|E

Robust <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> stuck-open faults in FETs belonging to these classes are constructed from any stuck-at test set by carefully constructing initialization vectors.

5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug <b>test</b> <b>for</b> sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., selegiline), over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and selegiline, among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug <b>test</b> <b>for</b> approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E
5|$|An old {{qualitative}} <b>test</b> <b>for</b> {{the presence}} of the alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin with some of the dibromoalkane also produced.

5|$|Cadets have a rank {{structure}} {{similar to}} the United States Air Force enlisted and officer grades, excluding those of general officers. A cadet starts as a cadet airman basic, and is promoted {{as he or she}} completes each achievement. Unlike the regular armed forces, where it is possible to enter as either directly as a commissioned following completion of some form of officer training (service academy, college ROTC, or OCS/OTS, etc.), or enlist and eventually advance to non-commissioned officer or petty officer status, a CAP cadet must be promoted through every CAP cadet enlisted grade in order to achieve the rank of CAP cadet second lieutenant. To complete an achievement, a cadet must pass a physical fitness test as well as two written tests, one for leadership and one for aerospace education. The only exceptions to this rule are the promotions to cadet airman and cadet staff sergeant, which have no aerospace <b>test.</b> <b>For</b> some achievements, an additional test of drill proficiency is required. In the new promotion system, effective as of 2010, there is a drill <b>test</b> <b>for</b> all CAP cadet enlisted grades.|$|E
