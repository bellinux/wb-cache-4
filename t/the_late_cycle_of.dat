This article examines how lessons from early protection crises led the UN missions in the DRC to develop a series of innovative tools for a better peacekeeping response based on improved civil-military coordination and enhanced communication with the local population. It analyzes how the need to mitigate {{the negative impact of}} joint UN-Congolese military operations led to a progressive shift from a largely UN-centric and troop-intensive approach to physical protection to a greater focus on the Congolese security forces. As the UN peacekeeping understanding of the protection of civilians – and its concomitant bureaucracy – continues to expand, peacekeeping strategies should refocus on strengthening national protection capacities through security sector reform. This article concludes that the 2012 crisis in DRC could serve as a trigger for such a shift, aimed at building legitimate institutions and encouraging the host government to shoulder its primary responsibility to protect its citizens.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of spectrophotometric observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symbiotic binary Z And from 2006 to 2010. We estimate {{the temperature of the}} hot component of Z And to be ≈ 150000 - 170000 K at minimum brightness, decreasing to ≈ 90000 K at the brightness maximum. Our estimate of the electron density in the gaseous nebula is N_e= 10 ^ 10 - 10 ^ 12 cm^- 3 in the region of formation of lines of neutral helium and 10 ^ 6 - 10 ^ 7 cm^- 3 in the region of formation of the [OIII] and [NeIII] nebular lines. A trend for the gas density derived from helium lines to increase and the gas density derived from [OIII] and [NeIII] lines to simultaneously decrease with increasing brightness of the system was observed. Our estimates show that the ratios of the theoretical and observed fluxes in the [OIII] and [NeIII] lines agree best when the O/Ne ratio is similar to its value for planetary nebulae. The model spectral energy distribution showed that, in addition to a cool component and gaseous nebula, a relatively cool pseudophotosphere (5250 - 11 500 K) is present in the system. The simultaneous presence of a relatively cool pseudophotosphere and high-ionization spectral lines is probably related to a disk-like structure of the pseudophotosphere. The pseudophotosphere formed very rapidly, over several weeks, during a period of increasing brightness of Z And. We infer that in 2009, as in 2006, the activity of the system was accompanied by a collimated bipolar ejection of matter. In contrast to the situation in 2006, the jets were detected even before the system reached its maximum brightness. Moreover, components with velocities close to 1200 km/s disappeared at the maximum, while those with velocities close to 1800 km/s appeared.

40|$|Enhancing parental {{involvement}} {{is a major}} concern for policymakers in education in many countries. Literature review has exposed strong connections between {{parental involvement}}s in school activities and student outcomes (also achievements). For exploring the association between parental involvement in school activities and student reading achievement, we used data from <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS 2011) conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). The study assesses reading literacy at Grade 4 using representative samples of students in the participating education systems. PIRLS also collects extensive, internationally comparable information on the background characteristics of the students, their parents, teachers and the schools where they study. We conducted the analyses utilizing information on parental involvement in school activities (as reported by school principals), parental level of education (as reported by parents), and student reading achievement (PIRLS achievement scores). We used data from 54 of 56 education systems that included all relevant data needed for the analyses. Regarding that, this paper seeks to answer two questions. First, is there a relationship between parental involvement in school activities and student reading achievement in the education systems participating in PIRLS 2011 ? Given that both parental involvement and student achievement are often influenced by the family socio-economic context, the second question is whether parental involvement is associated with the level of parental education within each of the analysed education systems? This paper presents evidence demonstrating that within most of the 54 education systems we analysed, parental involvement in school activities is positively associated with student performance in PIRLS 2011. That is to say, students enrolled in schools with higher parental involvement tend to have higher reading achievement. It also shows that the level of parental involvement in school is positively associated with the level of parental education. Thus, parents with lower education levels are likely to participate less in school and vice versa. The conclusions suggest that the promotion of parental involvement may be an effective strategy for increasing reading achievement, and policies in this direction are particularly relevant for schools with students whose parents have lower levels of education...|$|R

40|$|Transactivator C protein of {{bacteriophage}} Mu activates the mom gene of the phage by {{an unusual}} mechanism. DNA binding by C to its site results in unwinding {{of the neighboring}} sequences, realigning the out-of-phase promoter elements to facilitate RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding. High level stimulation of a C-independent constitutive promoter mutant (where RNAP is already bound) by the transactivator suggested an additional mechanism of transcription activation at a step after RNAP recruitment. In this study, we have investigated the various steps of promoter-polymerase interactions during transcription initiation by using both the promoter mutant and a positive control (pc) mutant of C protein. The transactivator does not influence formation of the open complex or its stability after facilitating the RNAP binding. However, at a subsequent step, the protein exerts an important role, enhancing the promoter clearance by increasing the productive RNAP·promoter complex. The pc mutant of the transactivator C is compromised at this step, supporting the additional downstream role for C in mom transcription activation.

Recently, it was observed that the intron was not removed from some of the b-tubulin transcripts in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> life <b>cycle</b> stages cultured in vitro. Although normally spliced b-tubulin mRNA was detected in all parasite intracellular stages by RT-PCR (e. g. HCT- 8 or Caco- 2 cells infected with C. parvum for 12 – 72 h), at 48 – 72 h post-infection unprocessed b-tubulin transcripts containing intact introns started to appear in parasite mRNA within infected host cells. The intron-containing transcripts could be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using an intron-specific probe. The intron-containing b-tubulin transcripts appeared unique to the in vitro-cultured C. parvum, since they were not detected in parasite-infected calves at 72 h. As yet, it is unclear whether <b>the</b> <b>late</b> life <b>cycle</b> stages <b>of</b> C. parvum are partially deficient in intron-splicing or the intron-splicing processes have merely slowed, both of which would allow the detection of intron-containing transcripts. Another possible explanation is that the decay in transcript processing might simply be due to the onset of parasite death. Nonetheless, the appearance of intron-containing transcripts coincides with the arrest of C. parvum development in vitro. This unusual observation prompts speculation that the abnormal intron-splicing of b-tubulin transcripts may be one of the factors preventing complete development of this parasite in vitro. Furthermore, the presence of both processed and unprocessed introns in b-tubulin transcripts in vitro may provide a venue for studying overall mechanisms for intron-splicing in this parasite...|$|R

The first chapter analyses of the role of expectations of future fundamentals in the housing market and their macroeconomic implications. News represent the component of expectations that proves to be correct in the future. Noise constitutes the component of expectations that does not materialize in the future. I find that fundamentals in the housing market are aligned with the real economy and that news shocks are the dominant driver of the housing market in the long run. However, the bulk of fluctuations in housing prices at high-medium frequencies is generated by noise. Notably, <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> housing <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2000 s is entirely driven by expectations unrelated with fundamentals. The second chapter, jointly written with Alejandro Vicondoa, develops a novel methodology, called Bridge Proxy-SVAR, to study the relationship between time series sampled at different frequencies. Instead of using a joint system, we rely on two systems at different frequencies and bridge them through an instrumental variable approach. We carry out identification at the highest available frequency and study the responses of the macroeconomic aggregates in a second stage. Our analytical, simulation and empirical results show that the Bridge Proxy-SVAR significantly mitigates temporal aggregation biases and it is particularly appealing to study the financial spillovers to the real economy. In fact, in the third chapter, jointly written with Alejandro Vicondoa, we provide novel evidence on the large macroeconomic spillovers from changes in the liquidity of bonds. In particular, we analyze Italian sovereigns and find that liquidity shocks, orthogonal to changes in default risk, generate strong recessionary effect. Liquidity and default risk affect the real economy through different channels. By analyzing survey data, we find that liquidity shocks, differently from spikes in yields, do no lead to an increase in the rate requested by banks for loans. On the other hand, banks make their deadlines tighter and reduce the amount available for loan because they report problems with the liquidity and asset position. [...] 1.

Initially, from the 1950 s through to the 1970 s, the superpowers competed for influence through educational, economic and technical development projects. They used their international development aid as a strategic tool to penetrate the country’s political elite circles to create a space for their political and strategic influence. The nature of development aid then changed {{to a series of}} proxy military conflicts throughout the 1980 s, which also changed the fate of Afghanistan from that of a developing to that of a conflict country. The current US occupation of Afghanistan (October 2001 -present) is <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> in <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> conflict and rivalry between the US and Russia in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Against this background, this article presents an analysis of how (i) the US and Russia create a context and a situation in which they develop, advance, and implement their political and military discourses and strategic concepts, intending to influence each other’s areas of strategic interests; (ii) the different components of conflicts and violence are interconnected with one another; and (iii) their rivalry for strategic influence in Afghanistan and the broader region of Central Asia triggered a <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> conflict and a series of continuing proxy wars in Afghanistan. This article applies Johan Galtung’s theories of conflicts as the broader theoretical framework. The developed framework combines Galtung’s three theories of conflict, namely the ABC triangle of conflict, triangle of violence and triangle of peace strategy (Galtung, 1967, 1996). The findings of this article demonstrate that both the US and Russia fight each other in Afghanistan {{as well as in the}} wider Central Asia region by supporting and maintaining their satellite countries and periphery elites in power and negotiate each other’s spheres of strategic influence on that basis. This article demonstrates that while this approach provides political leverage and strategic gains in the short and medium period, there are significant losses for both parties. While Afghanistan suffers from the continuing political game, the war in Afghanistan is also making a lasting impact on both the US and Russia as well as all other regional powers that are directly and indirectly involved in this conflict...|$|R

Flower abscission induced independently by shade and gibberellic acid (GAc) sprays was monitored in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) growing under a soilless greenhouse system during two seasonal growing conditions, in an early and <b>late</b> production <b>cycle.</b> Physiological and metabolic changes triggered by {{each of the two}} distinct stimuli were determined. Environmental conditions exerted a significant effect on fruit set as showed by the higher natural drop rate recorded in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> production <b>cycle</b> with respect to the early cycle. Shade and GAc treatments increased the percentage of flower drop compared to the control, and at a similar degree, during <b>the</b> <b>late</b> production <b>cycle.</b> <b>The</b> reduction <b>of</b> leaf gas exchanges under shade conditions was not observed in GAc treated vines. The metabolic profile assessed in samples collected during <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>cycle</b> differently affected primary and secondary metabolisms and showed that most of the treatment-resulting variations occurred in opposite trends in inflorescences unbalanced in either hormonal or energy deficit abscission-inducing signals. Particularly concerning carbohydrates metabolism, sucrose, glucose, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolites and intermediates of the raffinose family oligosaccharides pathway were lower in shaded and higher in GAc samples. Altered oxidative stress remediation mechanisms and indolacetic acid (IAA) concentration were identified as abscission signatures common to both stimuli. According to the global analysis performed, we report that grape flower abscission mechanisms triggered by GAc application and C-starvation are not based on the same metabolic pathways...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The Paleocene-lower Eocene {{volcanic}} {{rocks of}} the southern Oregon Coast Range Roseburg Formation are the oldest remnant eruptive sequence of an oceanic islandseamount province which is presently exposed along a north-south lineament that stretches from Vancouver, B. C. into southwestern Oregon. This seamount terrane {{is thought to have}} formed on the Farallon plate and, been subsequently accreted into its present position along the Oregon and Washington coast during subduction of this oceanic plate beneath the North American Plate during the early Tertiary The Roseburg volcanic sequence is composed of a basal submarine tholeiitic section which grades upward into a subaerially erupted sequence of highly undersaturated alkalic basalts. Fields studies show that the morphological evolution of eruptive styles within the volcanic pile (i. e. sequences of pillowed and massive flows, pyroclastic beccias and hyaloclastite deposits, subareal flows, and erosional surfaces) closely follow successive stages of growth observed at present day oceanic islands such as Hawaii. The regional distribution of basalt types reveal a progressive increase in differentiation from exposures of tholeiitic basalts in the south to exposures of alkalic basalts in the north, and demonstrate a coherencey in the geochemical evolution between basalts which cropout on the east and west side of an intervening Eocene basin. The Roseburg basaltic sequence displays the greatest amount of chemical diversity yet reported for the early Tertiary volcanic centers which compise the Oregon-Washington Coast Range province. The tholeiitic basalts have trace element compositions which are typical of E-type MORB and tholeiites from hotspot generated oceanic islands. The alkalic suite is highly enriched in incompatible element constituents typically found in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> stage eruptive <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> oceanic island volcanism. The generation of these two basaltic suites are related to a common mantle source composition which has undergone variable degrees of partial at different depths. Differentiation of the tholeiitic basalts results from uniform degrees of partial melting, whereas compositional variations in the alkalic basalts can be explained only by variable degrees of partial melting at deeper depths in the mantle. Fractional crystalization {{does not seem to be}} an important control on the differentiation of these two basaltic suites. In contrast, compositional variations of basalts from other volcanic centers in the Oregon-Washington Coast Range province indicate a more dominate control of differentiation by fractional crystalization. The trace element variations in the province is related to varying influences of mid-ocean ridge spreading and hotspot volcanism. The trace element data reported here does not support models for the generation of these seamount volcanoes by marginal basin spreading possibly caused by the highly oblique subduction of the Farallon plate during this time. The regional geochemical variations exhibited by basalts from different volcanic centers in the Oregon-Washington Coast Range province is shown to be geographically controlled rather than time dependent. Generally, the available data shows a decrease in the highly incompatible trace element constituents from the southern end of the Coast Range (Roseburg basalts) to the northern volcanic centers (Metchosin and Crescent Fm. basalts). This geochemical trend is thought to be caused by a declining influence of hotspot-type volcanism on the magma compositions of basalts erupted in the northern regions of the Coast Range and/or the increasing influence of spreading ridge magmatic activity in that area...|$|R
