First, users must specify the beginning (time 1) and end time (time 2) for the <b>temporal</b> <b>extent</b> of the simulation and must identify a time step for the simulation. The model also needs the image that depicts the two land categories (e.g. category 1= undeveloped and category 2=developed) at time and a projected quantity of the two categories at time 2. GeoMod also needs a suitability map, which shows the transition suitability of each pixel. The higher values in the suitability map, the more suitable the pixel is for transition the gain of category 2. If the user does not have a suitability map, GeoMod can create one using one or more driver images. A driver image is a categorical image that indicates the distribution of a variable that is believed to influence the change of the land-cover categories.|$|E
5000|$|Nimtz {{and others}} argue that an {{analysis}} of signal shape and frequency spectrum has evidenced that a superluminal signal velocity has been measured and that tunneling is {{the one and only}} observed violation of special relativity. However - in contradiction to their opponents - they explicitly point out that this does not lead to a violation of primitive causality: Due to the <b>temporal</b> <b>extent</b> of any kind of signal it is impossible to transport information into the past. After all they claim that tunneling can generally be explained with virtual photons, the strange particles introduced by Richard Feynman and shown for evanescent modes by Ali and by Cargnilia and Mandel. In that sense it is common to calculate the imaginary tunneling wave number with the Helmholtz and the Schrödinger equations as Günter Nimtz did in and Herbert Winful did in [...] However, Nimtz highlights that eventually the final tunneling time was always obtained by the Wigner phase time approach. In and Günter Nimtz outlines that such evanescent modes only exist in the classically forbidden region of energy. As a consequence they cannot be explained by classical physics nor by special relativity postulates: A negative energy of evanescent modes follows from the imaginary wave number, i.e. from the imaginary refractive index according to the Maxwell relation [...] for electromagnetic and elastic fields. In his latest publication Günter Nimtz again explicitly points out that tunneling indeed confronts special relativity and that any other statement must be considered incorrect.|$|E

40|$|One {{important}} aspect of scientific data management is metadata management. Metadata is broadly defined as information about data (e. g., content, source, processing applied, precision). One kind of metadata which needs special attention is the data derivation information, i. e., how data are generated.

Compared to calculations with the standard Wilson action on this size lattices we observe a drastic reduction of the cut-off dependence of bulk thermodynamic observables at high temperatures.

For this ratio as well as bulk thermodynamic observables tadpole improvement does, however, not provide any significant further improvement over tree level improvement.
