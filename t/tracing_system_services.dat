The concept was tested for around 2 months with 2 <b>tracing</b> <b>systems</b> from different <b>service</b> providers, with volunteering transport companies using these systems and with the participation of competent authorities in 3 Member States with a substantial share in the international animal transport.

We propose an innovative framework of engineering representation and reasoning methods for developing these complex systems: the Flow-Service-Quality (FSQ) Framework. In dynamic network information systems with constantly varying function and usage, work flows and their corresponding <b>traces</b> of <b>system</b> <b>services</b> act as stable foundations for functional and non-functional (quality attribute) specification, design, and operational control.

40|$|Reducibility between {{different}} cryptographic primitives {{is a fundamental}} problem in modern cryptography. As one of the primitives, traitor <b>tracing</b> <b>systems</b> help content distributors recover the identities of users that collaborated in the pirate construction by tracing pirate decryp-tion boxes. We present the first negative result on designing efficient traitor <b>tracing</b> <b>systems</b> via black-box constructions from symmetric cryptographic primitives, e. g. one-way functions. More specifically, we {{show that there is}} no secure traitor tracing scheme in the random oracle model, such that `k · ` 2 c ≥ Ω̃(n), where `k is the length of user key, `c is the length of ciphertext and n is the number of users, under the assumption that the scheme does not access the oracle to generate user keys. To our best knowledge, almost all the practical (non-artificial) crypto-graphic schemes (not limited to traitor <b>tracing</b> <b>systems)</b> via black-box constructions satisfy this assumption. Thus, our negative results indicate that most of the standard black-box reductions in cryptography cannot help construct a more efficient traitor <b>tracing</b> <b>system.</b> We prove our results by extending the connection between traitor <b>tracing</b> <b>systems</b> and dif-ferentially private database sanitizers to the setting with random oracle access. After that, we prove the lower bound for traitor tracing schemes by constructing a differentially private sanitizer that only queries the random oracle polynomially many times. In order to reduce the query complexity of the sanitizer, we prove a large deviation bound for decision forests, which might be of independent interest. ...|$|R

This new, comprehensive regulatory framework emphasizes the need of an adequate <b>tracing</b> <b>system.</b> Unique identifiers, such as the transgene genome junction region or a specific rearrangement within the transgene DNA, should {{form the basis of}} such a <b>tracing</b> <b>system.</b> In this study, we describe the development of event-specific <b>tracing</b> <b>systems</b> for transgenic maize lines Bt 11, Bt 176, and GA 21 and for canola event GT 73. Molecular characterization of the transgene loci enabled us to clone an event-specific sequence into a plasmid vector, {{to be used as a}} marker, and to develop line-specific primers. Primer specificity was tested through qualitative PCRs and dissociation curve analysis in SYBR Green I real-time PCRs. The primers were then combined with event-specific TaqMan probes in quantitative real-time PCRs. Calibration curves were set up both with genomic DNA samples and the newly synthesized plasmid DNA markers. It is shown that cloned plasmid GMO target sequences are perfectly suitable as unique identifiers and quantitative calibrators. Together with an event-specific primer pair and a highly specific TaqMan probe, the plasmid markers form crucial components of a unique and straighforward <b>tracing</b> <b>system</b> for Bt 11, Bt 176, and GA 21 maize and GT 73 canola events.

40|$|In Tracking and <b>Tracing</b> <b>systems,</b> {{attributes}} of objects (such as location, time, status and temperature) are recorded as these objects move through a supply chain. In closed, dedicated systems, the attributes to record and store are determined at design time. However, in open Tracking and <b>Tracing</b> <b>systems,</b> the attributes {{are not known}} beforehand, as the type of objects and the set of stakeholders may evolve over time. Many supply chains require open Tracking and <b>Tracing</b> <b>systems.</b> The participants in the supply chain are individual companies, spread over many countries. Their trading relations change constantly. Usually they participate in multiple supply chains. E. g., a company producing chemicals may serve the chemical industry, the food industry and the textile industry at the same time. Transport companies carry goods for multiple industry sectors. Yet, they {{play a role in}} the traceability of all goods they produce or carry. Open tracking and <b>Tracing</b> <b>systems</b> are not dedicated for a certain type of product or object nor for a specific industry sector. They simply record the location, time and other {{attributes of}} the identified objects, and store that information in the data store of the object owner, based on the identification (e. g. RFID) tag. What attributes are to be stored is determined by stakeholders, such as (end) users of the object. In some cases (e. g. food) legislation prescribes what to record. An open Tracking and <b>Tracing</b> <b>system</b> therefore needs to be able to dynamically handle the set of attributes to be recorded and stored. In this chapter, a method is presented that enables components of Tracking and <b>Tracing</b> <b>systems</b> to negotiate at run time what attributes may be stored for a particular object type. Components may include scanning equipment, data stores and query clients. Attributes may be of any data type, including time, location, status, temperature and ownership. Apart from simple attributes, associations between objects may be recorded and stored, e. g. when an object is packed in another object, loaded in a truck or container or assembled to be a new object. The method makes use of findings in ontology engineering and of type theory. New types are based on existing types, with some restrictions. Both the range of values of a type and its meta‐attributes (such as cardinality) may be restricted to define a new type. Programmatically, concepts of co‐ and contra variance are used to make the method implementable. The method was developed in two European funded research projects: TraSer and ADVANCE. In TraSer, a truly open and extensible Tracking and <b>Tracing</b> <b>system</b> was developed (TraSer project consortium, 2006; Monostori et al., 2009).
