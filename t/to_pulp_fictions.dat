2500|$|The {{combination}} of visuals and music with {{the setting of}} the criminal underworld has drawn comparisons <b>to</b> <b>Pulp</b> <b>Fiction</b> and the films of Quentin Tarantino, that had spawned a certain type of [...] "90s indie cinema" [...] which [...] "strove to dazzle the viewer with self-conscious cleverness and empty shock tactics". This impacted the shooting style of the film, which features [...] "wildly imaginative" [...] and [...] "downright hallucinatory" [...] visual imagery, achieved through a mix of [...] "a handheld, hurtling camera", jump cuts, zoom shots, freeze frames and wide angles.

Artists like Mel Hunter had extensive training in scientific and technical illustration, and a broad knowledge of space technologies.

[...] Some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than <b>to</b> <b>Pulp</b> <b>Fiction</b> itself. While not panning the film, Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic felt that [...] "the way that [...] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. <b>Pulp</b> <b>Fiction</b> nourishes, abets, cultural slumming." [...] Responding to comparisons between Tarantino's film and the work of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, especially his first, most famous feature, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The fact that <b>Pulp</b> <b>Fiction</b> is garnering more extravagant raves than Breathless ever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful— namely, the ones we already have and don't wish to expand." [...] Observing in the National Review that [...] "o film arrives with more advance hype", John Simon was unswayed: [...] "titillation cures neither hollowness nor shallowness".|$|R

"' Srirupa Prasad, 'Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History' Inherent in colonialism was the idea of self-legitimation, the most powerful tool of which was the colonizer's claim to bring the fruits of progress and modernity to the subject people. In colonial logic, people who were different because they were inferior had to be made similar - and hence equal - by civilizing them. However, once this equality had been attained, the very basis for colonial rule would vanish. 'Colonialism as Civilizing Mission' explores British colonial ideology at work in South Asia. Ranging from studies on sport and national education, <b>to</b> <b>pulp</b> <b>fiction</b> <b>to</b> infanticide, to psychiatric therapy and religion, these essays on the various forms, expressions and consequences of the British 'civilizing mission' in South Asia shed light on a topic that even today continues to be an important factor in South Asian politics...|$|R

Black <b>pulp</b> <b>fiction</b> was originally published in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s; it consisted of paperback novels about tough male characters navigating the pitfalls of urban life. These novels appealed mainly to inner-city readers who felt left out of civil rights' and Black Power's promises of social equality. Despite the historic achievements of the civil rights movement, entrenched structural inequalities led to America's ghettos becoming sites of concentrated poverty, rampant unemployment, and violent crime. While mainstream society seemed to {{turn a blind eye to}} how these problems were destroying inner-city communities, readers turned <b>to</b> black <b>pulp</b> <b>fiction</b> for the imaginative resources that would help them reflect on their social reality. In black <b>pulp</b> <b>fiction,</b> readers found confirmation that America was not on the path toward extending equal opportunities to its most vulnerable citizens, or that {{the rise of}} Black Power signaled a change in their fortunes.
