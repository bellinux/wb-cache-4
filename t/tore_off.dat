5|$|After the 1997 season, the Tigers traded Nevin and catcher Matt Walbeck to the Anaheim Angels, where Collins was manager, {{for minor}} league player Nick Skuse. After {{an injury to}} {{starting}} catcher Todd Greene, Collins gave Nevin the opportunity {{to compete for the}} starting job with Walbeck. Nevin, by then well known for his volatile temper, <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> his jersey while arguing balls and strike calls with the home plate umpire in a 1998 game.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{remained}} far from land, the waves triggered by Liza {{were able to}} reach California, where they combined with high tide, threatening beachfront homes that had weakened foundations after a previous tide. The hurricane was responsible for sweeping hundreds of Labor Day swimmers out into the ocean in Zuma Beach and Newport Beach, {{all of whom were}} saved by lifeguards. The waves also <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> a group of sundecks estimated at $5,000(1968USD) near Laguna Beach.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 1963, a B-52E of the 6th Bomb Wing from Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico, {{crashed in}} snow-covered {{mountains}} in northern New Mexico after turbulence <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> the vertical fin. The ECM operator and tail gunner were killed {{but at least}} three crew (pilot, radio operator and one other crew member) survived. Three Lockheed T-33 Shooting Stars and, later, three Douglas C-54 Skymaster transports, circled the area trying to locate survivors; the pilots reported that they saw two other survivors after the first man walked to safety.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} in Mumbai, two motorcycle-borne MNS {{supporters}} hurled bottles at Amitabh Bachchan's bungalow at Juhu. A group of MNS workers barged inside the booking office of the Grant Road railway station, damaged the booking office windows and <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> posters of a newly released Bhojpuri film put up there. Party workers resorted to stone throwing {{in some parts of}} Kandivli, a North-Mumbai suburb that has a sizeable North Indian lower middle-class population. In the Central-Mumbai suburb of Bandra, a clash ensued when MNS workers tried to plant party flags at an open market dominated by North Indians.|$|E
5|$|Trent Milton {{was born}} in Newcastle, New South Wales, on 4 May 1972. He {{currently}} lives in Lake Cathie, New South Wales. On 5 March 2011, a motorcycle accident {{on the way home}} from work in Port Macquarie <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> his right leg. It also led to a brain injury. Doctors considered amputating both his arms – his right arm hung by a thread – but managed to save both, which they fastened back together with steel plates. He suffered post-traumatic amnesia, and spent a year in recovery.|$|E
5|$|With such a heavy {{disparity}} in armament between the smack's 3pounder and the submarine's 88mm deck gun the engagement was short lived, the submarine firing eight shots before the Nelson could get {{within range of}} her opponent. The fourth shot fired by the U-boat holed the smack, and the seventh <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> both of Crisp's legs from underneath him. Calling for the confidential papers to be thrown overboard, Crisp dictated a message to be sent by the boat's four carrier pigeons: like many small ships of the era, the Nelson did not possess a radio set.|$|E

5|$|He {{claimed his}} {{first of two}} aerial {{victories}} in the Battle of France on 20May 1940. Ostermann had been entrusted with leading a Rotte, an element of two aircraft, with Unteroffizier (non-commissioned officer) Fritz Marcks as his wingman. The Schwarm (flight) led by Oberleutnant (Senior Lieutenant or First Lieutenant) Günther Scholz engaged eight French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406's fighters near Amiens with Ostermann, Marcks and Scholz claiming one each. His second aerial victory was achieved over a Curtiss Hawk-75 on 26May 1940. In a head on firing pass two 20mm shells <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> {{large parts of the}} aircraft's tail fin, which then collided with Osterrmann's starboard wing. The French pilot was observed to bail out with Ostermann managing to make a safe landing.|$|E
5|$|At SummerSlam, the Hardy Boyz were {{defeated}} in the first ever TLC match for the Tag Team Championship, which Edge and Christian won, and in which the Dudley Boyz also competed. At Unforgiven, however, the Hardy Boyz defeated Edge and Christian in a steel cage match to win the Tag Team Championship for a second time. They re-lost the title to Edge and Christian (who were dressed as Los Conquistadores) at No Mercy, but they won the titles back the next night on Raw for a third time. During the match, the Hardy Boyz were dressed as Los Conquistadores, but <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> their masks after the match, revealing themselves. The team lost the title {{less than a month}} later to Right to Censor (Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather) on the November 6 episode of Raw Is War, when Edge and Christian came out and assaulted the Hardyz, allowing Right to Censor to pick up the win and the title.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{earned a}} spot in the 2007 Money in the Bank ladder match by {{defeating}} Sabu in an Extreme Rules match in a February episode of ECW on Sci Fi. At WrestleMania 23, Kennedy won the Money in the Bank ladder match, giving him the right to challenge any World Champion in WWE at any date up until WrestleMania XXIV. Kennedy announced on the April 30 episode of Raw that he would be cashing in his Money in the Bank championship opportunity at WrestleMania 24. On the May 7 episode of Raw, Kennedy, however, lost his Money in the Bank opportunity to Edge, losing mere moments after being struck with a monitor before the match began. Because of the injury Kennedy sustained during his match with Edge, it was revealed that his right triceps muscle <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> the bone and he would be out for a minimum of five to seven months. The injury, however, was not as serious, as the triceps tendon did not tear off the bone but was, in fact, a massive hematoma.|$|E

5|$|The Mega Powers {{took the}} early {{advantage}} over DiBiase, but after Hogan attacked André {{on the ring}} apron, the Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After several minutes and several advantage changes, all four began brawling, with DiBiase and André getting the upper hand and throwing both Hogan and Savage from the ring. At this point, Elizabeth jumped on the ring apron and began arguing with Ventura. With DiBiase and André pleading with Ventura to take drastic measures to get Elizabeth off the ring, she eventually <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> her skirt and threw it into DiBiase's face. In the ensuing chaos, Hogan and Savage recovered and mounted a comeback, which saw André knocked {{out of the ring}} and DiBiase take both the Mega Powers' finishing moves -- Savage's flying elbow and Hogan's legdrop -- before taking the pinfall loss. While counting the pinfall, Ventura stopped counting at two and hesitated until Savage pushed Ventura's hand to the mat to complete the three count.|$|E
5|$|High waters enveloped wharves, and {{neighboring}} stores collapsed or were washed away, with rice and cotton {{falling into the}} water. A breakwater near South Bay disintegrated and a nearby home's chimney toppled, resulting in one death. Homes were inundated, and residents along South Bay consequently fled their dwellings. The hurricane's storm surge also permeated locations along then-new East Bay Street, as well as buildings on Lamboll and Water streets; Meeting Street sank below -high flood waters. High winds, meanwhile, <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> roofs, dislodged trees, and toppled fences. To the north of Charleston, at Sullivan's Island, the storm rendered 15to 20houses uninhabitable; although the island was mostly inundated, many residences were saved, encircled by dunes, and several men rescued women and children. Overall, only one death was recorded on the island. The Pee Dee and Black rivers gradually rose throughout the day, eventually spilling their banks. Meanwhile, at Georgetown, high tides flooded wharves and submerged streets and businesses, destroying corn, salt, and other goods. Turtles and fish were killed, and at the Sampit River, two individuals drowned attempting to cross. A rice harvest equivalent to ten thousand barrels was ruined by high tides and torrential rain within the vicinity of Georgetown. Damage in the city reached $1,000,000 (1804USD), and overall, the 1804hurricane was responsible for more than 500deaths in the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Offshore impacts were significant; on 30January, {{the yacht}} Darkie washed ashore at South Brook Island, its crew of four surviving. Throughout Queensland, the cyclone {{isolated}} small towns, cut off telephone service, inflicted severe damage to crops, and generated widespread flooding. Between Cairns and Ingham, Winifred obliterated structures, toppled power lines, uprooted trees, wrecked 1000homes, and damaged hundreds of others. Service of the Sunlander between Gordonvale and Babinda was interrupted after tracks were inundated, and travelers {{were forced to}} travel by bus instead. At the latter city, approximately 500homes suffered significant damage, and at Innisfail, 200residences were destroyed. Several individuals were recovered safely from wreckage of a building collapse in each city. At Babinda, sixteen other structures were wrecked, with the cyclone unroofing an additional 50houses and flattening 40sheds. Five individuals were badly injured, two of them impaled by flying glass and other debris. Officials noted that the cyclone <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> the police station door and unroofed a Uniting Church. Helicopter reconnaissance indicated severe damage to sugarcane and banana crops {{as well as a}} critical electrical power tower, with considerable damage observed in the town proper.|$|E

5|$|One {{shrimp boat}} was {{initially}} reported missing and the tug Myra White transmitted a distress signal as its engines failed near an oil rig off of Galveston. High winds shattered glass windows at Port Arthur, Texas City, and Galveston, while schools {{were shut down}} in Galveston, Lamarque, Texas City, Alvin, and most of Galveston and Jefferson counties. Despite a brief power outage at Lamarque, electricity was quickly restored after the storm. Powerful gusts downed branches, electrical poles, and <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> shingles in Port Arthur and Galveston, but damage was minimal at High Island, where Cindy made landfall. The U.S. Coast Guard responded to four requests for assistance at Galveston, and nine vessels attempted to seek refuge at Port Arthur; the Coast Guard eventually permitted six to enter, {{and the other three}} apparently traveled to Galveston. Meanwhile, to the northwest, the port of Houston was closed {{for the duration of the}} storm. Trucks and boats were dispatched by civil defense officials in Jefferson County after declaring a state of emergency following numerous requests for assistance by residents of flooded homes. Two children, initially unaccounted for, were later found safe under a bridge abutment.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} left Hastings—{{approximately}} 15 minutes' flying {{time from the}} West Side Boys' camp—at approximately 06:15. Downstream from the villages—approximately 15 minutes' flying time, {{just out of the}} West Side Boys' visual and hearing range, the helicopters went into a holding pattern to allow the SAS observation teams time to get into position to prevent the West Side Boys from attacking any of the captives before the extraction teams were on the ground. Once the observation teams were in position, the helicopters proceeded up the line of Rokel Creek, the Chinooks flying low enough that the downdraft <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> the corrugated iron roofs of several huts in the villages, including the roof of the building in which the Royal Irish were being held. As the helicopters approached, the SAS observation team at Gberi Bana engaged West Side Boys {{in the vicinity of the}} captives to prevent any gang members from attempting to kill them before the area was secured. Upon their arrival, the two Lynx attack helicopters strafed the villages to make the landing zones as safe as possible for the Chinooks and destroy the heavy weapons that had been identified by the SAS observation teams.|$|E
5|$|Prior to landfall, twelve provinces, {{including}} some in Luzon, {{were placed on}} typhoon alert. Upon moving through the central Philippines, Typhoon Lee affected {{some of the same}} areas devastated by Typhoon Irma earlier that month, which was considered the strongest storm to affect the island since 1970. Lee knocked out communications and left many coconut-producing areas isolated. Railway services to and from Manila was suspended. Even though nine domestic flights were canceled, the Manila International Airport remained open throughout the passage of the typhoon. Across Manila, some flooding was reported and high winds <b>tore</b> <b>off</b> some Christmas decorations in hotels along the bay. The Sorsogon Province was one of the hardest hit areas by the typhoon; 20casualties happened there because of flooding. In the coastal region of Legaspi, home to a large volcano, 150houses were demolished due to storm surge, 25 of which were swept out at sea. Telephone lines were also cut off for four days in the city. Storm surge was also noted in coastal towns in the Sorsogon, Masbate, and Albay provinces. In the latter, three villages were damaged. Just south of the capital city of Manila, in the coastal town of Calapan on Mindoro Island, 5,600 houses were damaged, and 20,000persons or 85% of the town's residents were left without a home. Two fatalities were reported in the city. In the fishing village of San Fernando on Masbate Island, 50thatched huts were flattened. Elsewhere, four people were killed and three others injured in Naujan, where 86 homes were either damaged or destroyed.|$|E
