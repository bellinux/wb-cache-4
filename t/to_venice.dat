5|$|In 1476, {{during the}} time of Leonardo's {{association}} with Verrocchio's workshop, the Portinari Altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes arrived in Florence, bringing from Northern Europe new painterly techniques that were to profoundly affect Leonardo, Ghirlandaio, Perugino and others.

5|$|Strange travels <b>to</b> <b>Venice</b> {{and meets}} Flora Greysteel. They become fond {{of each other}} and Strange's friends believe he may marry again. However, after experimenting with {{dangerous}} magic that threatens his sanity to gain access to Faerie, he discovers that Arabella is alive and being held captive in Lost Hope. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair curses him with Eternal Night, an eerie darkness that engulfs him and follows him wherever he goes. Thereafter, Strange's strenuous efforts to rescue Arabella take their toll, and his letters to his friends appear crazed. At Strange's request, Flora moves with her family to Padua and secludes herself within her home, along with a mirror given to her by Strange. Drawlight is sent by Lascelles and Norrell <b>to</b> <b>Venice</b> {{to find out more about}} Strange's activities and Strange uses his magic to bring Drawlight before him.

5|$|The large centre canvas has {{not been}} {{positively}} identified. However both Koch and Campbell believe that a damaged Crucifixion, now in the Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, was probably the centrepiece. Its size (181×153.5cm) is exactly double that of the four wing panels. Campbell believes that the altarpiece was painted on commission for export, most likely <b>to</b> <b>Venice.</b> The altarpiece was probably broken up as large religious works {{had fallen out of}} fashion by the 17th century, and would have had more value as single panels.|$|E

In December 1099, at Rhodes, the Venetian fleet intercepted enemy ships and sank them.|$|R

5|$|When Pietro Cornaro died in 1388, Maria, {{unable to}} defend her possessions, sold them <b>to</b> <b>Venice</b> on 12 December in {{exchange}} for an annual subsidy of 700 ducats. Before the Venetians could arrive {{to take over the}} two towns, however, the Byzantine Despot of the Morea Theodore I Palaiologos, and his ally and father-in-law Nerio I Acciaioli seized them with the aid of an Ottoman army under Evrenos. Although the Venetians were quickly able to oust Nerio from Nauplia, Argos, Kiveri and Thermisi remained in Theodore's hands until 11 June 1394, when he ceded them <b>to</b> <b>Venice.</b> After Maria's death in 1393, her uncle Engelbert—who had originally received the lordship in 1356—claimed her inheritance, but when the Venetians provided the document of sale, and suggested that {{they would be willing to}} cede the castles if he could pay for their defence and reimburse Venice for the costs of their purchase and the ongoing siege of Argos, he dropped his claim. Argos remained in Venetian hands until conquered by the Ottomans at the outbreak of the First Ottoman–Venetian War in 1463, while of all Venetian territories in the Morea, Nauplia persisted longest in her possession, and was surrendered to the Ottomans in 1540 after the conclusion of the Third Ottoman–Venetian War.|$|E
