5|$|After a {{slow start}} to the {{historic}} campaign, Loxton struck form midway through the English summer and forced {{his way into the}} team for the last <b>three</b> <b>Tests.</b> He played a prominent role in the Fourth Test, scoring an aggressive and counterattacking 93 that helped Australia pry the initiative from England; the tourists eventually won the match. In 1949–50, Loxton cemented his position in the national team, playing in all five Tests in South Africa and scoring his only century at international level. He remained a regular member of the Test team until a form slump during the 1950–51 home season; he was dropped after <b>three</b> <b>Tests</b> against England and never played for Australia again. Loxton continued to play for Victoria in domestic competition until retiring {{at the end of the}} 1957–58 season.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{continued}} to play for Auckland on his return from the Originals' tour. They had regained the Ranfurly Shield in 1905, and he played {{in a number of}} shield defences over the subsequent seasons. He was selected for the New Zealand team that toured Australia in 1907 where he played seven matches, including all <b>three</b> <b>Tests</b> against Australia. He was again selected for the All Blacks in 1908, this time to play the touring Anglo-Welsh team, and played in all <b>three</b> <b>Tests.</b> This was his last appearance for New Zealand, which gave him 39 appearances for his national team, including 9 Test matches. He was later selected for the inaugural New Zealand Māori team (now called the Māori All Blacks) on their 1910 tour of Australia, and again for another tour in 1912.|$|E
5|$|England {{selected}} {{a total of}} 16 players in the <b>three</b> <b>Tests.</b> Six players (Barlow, Grace, Peate, Shrewsbury, Steel and Ulyett) played in all three matches.

5|$|Australia {{used the}} same eleven players in all <b>three</b> <b>Tests,</b> Scott making his debut in the first Test, and in the {{majority}} of their first-class matches as Alexander was effectively a reserve who made only five appearances on the tour and Cooper, who also made just five appearances, suffered a long-term injury.|$|E

Gilchrist scored {{a century and a}} fifty in the <b>three</b> <b>Tests.</b> Upon his return to Australia late in the year, Gilchrist was accepted into the Australian Cricket Academy. Over the next year, Gilchrist represented the ACA as they played matches against the Second XI of Australia's state teams, and toured South Africa to play provincial youth teams.|$|E

5|$|On {{the return}} trip to Australia, the touring team stopped to play <b>three</b> <b>Tests</b> against South Africa, the first between the two nations. Australia won the series two Tests to nil, but Darling's own form was poor. In {{successive}} innings, Darling made 0, 14, 6, 4 and 1. After the tour, he returned to Stonehenge and took a two-year break from first-class cricket. In his absence, Monty Noble captained the Australian team against the touring English in 190304.|$|E

5|$|The 1911–12 season started {{strongly}} for Macartney. He scored 122 {{and took}} 5/81 as New South Wales defeated Queensland by an innings. However, the season went downhill from there; Macartney {{failed to pass}} 30 in the next ten innings and took only three wickets {{in the next six}} matches. As a result, he was left out of the playing XI and made twelfth man for the first <b>three</b> <b>Tests</b> against the touring England team.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{dominated}} by the West Indies bowlers Holding and Colin Croft, who claimed 41 wickets between them in the series. England suffered an innings defeat in the first Test, and lost the third by 298 runs as they failed to register an innings of over 250 in the first <b>three</b> <b>Tests.</b> Strong batting performances and rain enabled England to draw the final two Tests, and so the series ended 2–0 to the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|When {{the team}} for the <b>three</b> <b>Tests</b> at home to Sri Lanka was announced, Karthik was dropped in place of Dhoni. In ten Tests since his debut, Karthik had managed only 245 runs {{at an average of}} 18.84 with only one half-century and one other score beyond 25. In contrast, Dhoni's had been a {{prolific}} run-scorer in ODIs, and had won the man of the series award against Sri Lanka and scored 183 not out in one match.|$|E

5|$|After England {{lost the}} first <b>three</b> <b>Tests</b> (which {{included}} a 46 all {{out in the}} second innings of the third Test) {{there was talk of}} another blackwash series. England secured a victory in the fourth Test however, with Stewart’s two centuries and Fraser’s eight wickets being the main contributors to the win. This {{was the first time in}} 59 years that a visiting nation had won at the Kensington Oval. The main highlight of the series was to come in the final Test at Antigua, where Brian Lara broke Sobers' Test world record score of 365 not out, set 36 years earlier, by scoring 375. Lara was congratulated by Sobers, who was present on the ground to see his record broken.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking part}} in a tour of Jamaica by the Yorkshire team, on which he scored 115 and 75 in {{successive}} games, Leyland scored 1,790 runs at 45.89 in 1936. He hit seven centuries, including an innings of 263 runs against Essex in the season, the highest first-class score of his career. He played in two of the <b>three</b> <b>Tests</b> against India that season—he missed the second with injury—but only batted twice. In the first Test, he scored 60 runs against a strong bowling attack when England were in a difficult position. The home side won the series 2–0. During the season, Leyland was among the first players chosen to tour Australia with the MCC in the forthcoming winter.|$|E
5|$|After the 1934 tour, Woodfull and Ponsford—Australia's first-choice opening pair—retired, leaving {{vacancies}} in the Test team. Fingleton scored {{four centuries}} {{and was the}} leading run-scorer during the 1934–35 domestic season to earn a recall to the Australian team for the 1935–36 tour of South Africa. From that point onwards until the outbreak of World War II, he opened the batting with his New South Wales partner Bill Brown. With Bradman absent due to illness, it was the happiest time of Fingleton's career, and he scored centuries in three consecutive innings as Australia won {{each of the last}} <b>three</b> <b>Tests</b> by an innings. In the Fourth Test, he and Brown put on the first double century opening partnership for Australia in a Test.|$|E

5|$|Australia played Pakistan at Karachi in {{the first}} Test between the two {{countries}} on a matting pitch, rather than the more familiar grass pitch. Miller top-scored {{in the first}} innings with 21, as Australia fell for 80. He took 2/40 and then scored 11 in the second innings as Australia fell to defeat. It was the last Test of his career, as his knee injury deteriorated to the point that he could not play in the <b>three</b> <b>Tests</b> against India, and retired upon his return to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Booth {{was then}} {{selected}} for the Ashes tour of England in 1961; he and Victorian opening batsmen Bill Lawry, the two uncapped batsmen in the team, were regarded as the last two players chosen. Booth quickly gained a reputation for his attention to physical fitness. He led the Australians in their morning exercises during the sea voyage, which captain Richie Benaud made optional. After scoring 37 and seven against Worcestershire in his first match on English soil, Booth broke through for his first century for Australia, scoring 113 against Cambridge University in his fifth match in England. He made 59 against the Marylebone Cricket Club, but was overlooked for the first <b>three</b> <b>Tests.</b>|$|E
5|$|Buttler captained the England {{side in the}} ODI {{series against}} Bangladesh in October but was again reserve wicket-keeper for the Test series.
