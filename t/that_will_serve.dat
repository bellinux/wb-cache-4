5|$|SR11 is {{proposed}} to be a toll facility <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>serve</b> a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa, the Otay Mesa East Port of Entry. It will connect SR 905 and SR 125 to the Corredor Tijuana-Rosarito 2000 corridor that connects to Mexican Federal Highway 2D and Mexican Federal Highway 2 to Tecate, and Mexican Federal Highway 1D to Ensenada.|$|E
5|$|Previously, SR125 had {{a direct}} {{connection}} with SR905 via two at-grade intersections on Otay Mesa Road. With {{the completion of the}} freeway segment of SR905 and the freeway-to-freeway connection to SR 125 unconstructed, traffic on SR 125 must head west on Otay Mesa Road and south on La Media Road to make the connection. A freeway-to-freeway interchange is planned for the connection between SR125 and SR905, and construction began in late 2015; there are also plans to connect to the new SR 11 freeway once it is constructed. SR11 is planned to be a toll facility <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>serve</b> a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa. Ramps from SR 11 westbound and eastbound to SR 125 northbound were completed on November 30, 2016, at a cost of over $21 million.|$|E
5|$|Since December 2013, a {{plan has}} been {{underway}} for the Halifax Regional School Board to close and demolish {{at least two of}} the three DMHS feeder schools, as well as DMHS itself, and replace them with a larger, more modern school in Sheet Harbour, <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>serve</b> grades primary-12. This new school will teach about 300 students and will serve the large area around Sheet Harbour. On 26 April 2016, the site for the project was chosen; the site that Duncan MacMillan High School currently occupies.

5|$|Roark {{is arrested}} and his action is widely condemned, but Wynand decides {{to use his}} papers to defend his friend. This unpopular stance hurts the {{circulation}} of his newspapers, and Wynand's employees go on strike after Wynand dismisses Toohey for disobeying him and criticizing Roark. Faced {{with the prospect of}} closing the paper, Wynand gives in and publishes a denunciation of Roark. At his trial, Roark makes a speech about the value of ego and integrity, and he is found not guilty. Dominique leaves Wynand for Roark. Wynand, who has betrayed his own values by attacking Roark, finally grasps the nature of the power he thought he held. He shuts down the Banner and commissions a final building from Roark, a skyscraper <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>serve</b> as a monument to human achievement. Eighteen months later, the Wynand Building is under construction. Dominique, now Roark's wife, enters the site to meet him atop its steel framework.|$|E
5|$|SR 905 {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of Tocayo Avenue and Oro Vista Road in Nestor. It begins as a freeway, intersecting with I-5 at a partial cloverleaf interchange. After interchanges with Beyer Boulevard and Picador Boulevard, the freeway then intersects I-805. Following this, SR 905 veers southeast to parallel Otay Mesa Road, with interchanges at Caliente Avenue (in Pacific Gateway Park), Britannia Boulevard, and La Media Road. After La Media, the route interchanges with the SR 125 (South Bay Expressway) toll road and the SR 11 freeway, which is planned to be a toll facility <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>serve</b> a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa. Immediately after, SR 905 turns south to its final interchange at Siempre Viva Road before the route ends at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry, which truck traffic must use to cross the border.|$|E

25|$|Molecular cloning {{is a set}} of {{experimental}} methods in molecular biology that are used to assemble recombinant DNA molecules and to direct their replication within host organisms. The use of the word cloning refers {{to the fact that the}} method involves the replication of one molecule to produce a population of cells with identical DNA molecules. Molecular cloning generally uses DNA sequences from two different organisms: the species that is the source of the DNA to be cloned, and the species <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>serve</b> as the living host for replication of the recombinant DNA. Molecular cloning methods are central to many contemporary areas of modern biology and medicine.|$|E

500|$|The Washington Post Stuever {{has many}} {{complaints}} about the show {{including the fact that}} it is about Washington, DC, but filmed in Baltimore.

However, it is not likely a show <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>serve</b> well those who spend a lot of time with the issues that the show deals with. After viewing the first two episodes, Stuever also finds fault with the use of breaking the fourth wall, describing it as [...] "the show's unwise narrative trope".

500|$|There, {{near the}} parade square, in March 1964, while viewing the college flag atop the Mackenzie Building, Stanley, then RMC's Dean of Arts, first {{suggested}} to Matheson, then Member of Parliament for Leeds, that the RMC flag should {{form the basis}} of the national flag. The suggestion was followed by Stanley's memorandum of March 23, 1964, on the history of Canada's emblems, in which he warned that any new flag [...] "must avoid the use of national or racial symbols that are of a divisive nature" [...] {{and that it would be}} [...] "clearly inadvisable" [...] to create a flag that carried the Union Jack or a fleur-de-lis. According to Matheson, Pearson's one [...] "paramount and desperate objective" [...] in introducing the new flag was to keep Quebec in the Canadian union. It was Dr. Stanley's idea that the new flag should be red and white and that it should feature the single maple leaf; his memorandum included the first sketch of what would become the flag of Canada. Stanley and Matheson collaborated on a design that was ultimately, after six months of debate and 308 speeches, passed by a majority vote in the House of Commons on December 15, 1964. Just after this, at 2:00 am, Matheson wrote to Stanley: [...] "Your proposed flag has just now been approved by the Commons 163 to 78. Congratulations. I believe it is an excellent flag <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>serve</b> Canada well." [...] The Senate added its approval two days later.|$|E
