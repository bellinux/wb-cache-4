40|$|The {{paper has}} two related aims. One is <b>to</b> <b>outline</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> for a {{spatially}} motivated model of discourse, called Discourse Space Theory. The other {{is to use}} this framework to explore, in a relatively formalised way, the spatial basis of the conceptual complexities arising in the uses of the English progressive verb form (be+-ing). The theory utilises an abstract space in three dimensions (time, space and modality). Verb stems are associated with Aktionsart schemas; aspectual forms like the progressive are viewed as operations on these schemas. The proposal is that geometric concepts, specifically coordinate systems and vectors, can provide a motivated formalism for investigating conceptual structures generated by a human discourse processor...|$|E

40|$|In spite {{the fact}} they {{represent}} true exogenous agents, studies and projects related to local development and to territorial phenomena do not take into due consideration the role of regional, national as well as European laws. Moreover direct practices do not always help politicians {{to make the right}} decisions when it comes to single out local strategic projects. Rarely changing processes deriving from new laws are analyzed as ‘activators’ outlining local territorial identities too. Historical identities are well rooted in the minds and in the daily life of people and cannot be reduced to a mere “dormant local heritage” issue. Therefore they have to be considered as a true starting point in defying a new idea of identity.

40|$|In this paper, {{we attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>outline</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> of a data-base {{management}} system which supports an entity-relationship model, {{as a collection}} of abstract data tvpes. Each abstract data type in this collection can be for [...] ' malized using algebraic axiom specification technique of Guttag; each can then be implemented to yield a set of interactive tools which will provide a formal and stepwise process in the specification of a database system. For nearly a decade, the abstract data type (ADT) concept has been investigated as a promising tool in software engineering and programming language design. Its ability to provide precise implementation-independent specifications of complex data structure led to the suggestion that it could be used to describe a database management system (DBMS). Indeed, in recent years, several efforts have been made to use the ADT concept to characterize particular aspects of a DBMS [3, 9, 16 x However, we are not aware of any work that has succeeded in integrating thes...|$|E
40|$|One {{reason why}} Distributed AI (DAI) {{technology}} has been deployed in relatively few real-size applications is that it lacks a clear and implementable model of cooperative problem solving which specifies how agents should operate and interact in complex, dynamic and unpredictable environments. As {{a consequence of the}} experience gained whilst building a number of DAI systems for industrial applications, a new principled model of cooperation has been developed. This model, called Joint Responsibility, has the notion of joint intentions at its core. It specifies pre-conditions which must be attained before collaboration can commence and prescribes how individuals should behave both when joint activity is progressing satisfactorily and also when it runs into difficulty. The theoretical model has been used to guide the implementation of a general purpose cooperation framework and the qualitative and quantitative benefits of this implementation have been assessed through a series of comparative experiments in the real-world domain of electricity transport management. Finally, the success of the approach of building a system with an explicit and grounded representation of cooperative problem solving is used <b>to</b> <b>outline</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> {{for the next generation of}} multi-agent systems...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{controversial}} {{topic of the}} origin of Castile in three epigraphic inscriptions from Lara de los Infantes,from a perspective both philological and historical. The making of the oldest inscription, found in the hermitage of SanJulián (and preserved at the Museum of Burgos since the early 20 th century) must date back to the mid- 12 th century. It was written with the monastery of San Pedro de Arlanza (Burgos) in mind, since it highlights the preeminence of the former because of its links to count Fernán González. It was also possibly based on a local tradition from Lara now lost to us and of spurious provenance. In the humanistic period, prior to 1600, a copy of this inscription was made, to which a new one was added, from an unknown source; and both were placed in the western gable of Lara’s parish church {{in the event of a}} structural alteration to enlarge the temple, thus counteracting the aims of the monasteries of San Millan (La Rioja), Santo Domingo de Silos (Burgos) and the neighbouring town of Salas de los Infantes to appropriate the memory of Fernán González and the seven Infantes. The parish inscriptions, then, are also of use <b>to</b> <b>outline</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> of periods in the structural evolution of this Romanesque church...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop the}} {{theoretical}} framework for calculating magnetic noise from conducting two-dimensional (2 D) materials. We describe how local measurements of this noise can directly probe the wave-vector dependent transport {{properties of the}} material over {{a broad range of}} length scales, thus providing new insight into a range of correlated phenomena in 2 D electronic systems. As an example, we demonstrate how transport in the hydrodynamic regime in an electronic system exhibits a unique signature in the magnetic noise profile that distinguishes it from diffusive and ballistic transport and how this can be used to measure the viscosity of the electronic fluid. We employ a Boltzmann approach in a two-time relaxation-time approximation to compute the conductivity of graphene and quantitatively illustrate these transport regimes and the experimental feasibility of observing them. Next, we discuss signatures of isolated impurities lodged inside the conducting 2 D material. The noise near an impurity is found to be suppressed compared to the background by an amount that is directly proportional to the cross-section of electrons/holes scattering off of the impurity. We use these results <b>to</b> <b>outline</b> <b>an</b> experimental <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> measure the temperature dependent level-shift and line-width of the resonance associated with an Anderson impurity.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has tended to}} focus on the development of separate number components (e. g. counting, addition, written numbers) and so, cannot comment on how development in one component affect development in others. The purpose of this thesis was to provide preliminary evidence towards a unifying view about the development of children's number competence, from early counting skills, at age four, to knowledge of place value, at age seven. To accomplish that aim 152 children from three different cohorts (Reception, Year 1 and Year 2) were given thirteen maths tasks, three times along one school year, assessing their understanding of four separate number components: counting and knowledge of the number-word sequence; generation of verbal number-words and the understanding {{of the structure of the}} numeration system; understanding of the arithmetical operations; and the ability to read and write numbers and understanding of the principles underlying place value. Beyond the assessment of these various number components, special emphasis was given to the separate role of each component and the developmental inter-relations amongst components in the child's development of progressively more complex ideas about number. Based on the children's performance on these tasks and the exploration of their relationships along time, it was possible <b>to</b> <b>outline</b> <b>a</b> preliminary <b>proposal</b> about children's number development. The evidence suggests that each number component plays a significant role at key times. For example, no children could develop the counting-on strategy or succeed in the arithmetical operation tasks without prior knowledge of continuation of counting. The data also showed that no development is possible without the inter-related development of several components, at other times. For example, no child could understand the structure of the decade numeration system without previous combined understanding of continuation of counting, addition and multiplication. Between 93...|$|R
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} common {{approach}} for various taxonomies concerning the evolution stages of environmental management in organizations {{presented in the}} specialized literature. The analysis of the contributions related {{to the understanding of}} environmental management in companies found in the literature was based on their similarities. The aim of this analysis was <b>to</b> <b>outline</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposal</b> of a common approach concerning the evolution stages for environmental management. This taxonomy was then related to the evolution of both organizational configurations, as well as the human resource and production management areas. A common taxonomy related to the analysis of environmental management consisting of the three following evolution stages is proposed: functional specialization, internal integration and external integration of the environmental variable in organizations. These stages tend to follow the evolution of both organizational configurations, as well as the human resource and production management areas. This article systematizes the similarities of various taxonomies concerning environmental management in companies that appear to be disconnected in the literature. This paper contributes to the scarce literature related {{to the understanding of the}} integration of environmental management by considering the taxonomies of the evolution of organizational configurations, as well as the production and human resource management areas.

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{is being given}} to the legal and governance issues relating to the removal of directors in Australian public companies. This has been due mainly to the difficulties experienced {{by the board of}} National Australia Bank in attempting to remove one of its fellow directors, and the subsequent development of public companies entering into so-called 2 ̆ 7 prenuptial agreements 2 ̆ 7 with new directors, requiring that the director 2 ̆ 7 resign 2 ̆ 7 if the board pass a vote of no-confidence in the director. In this article, the author revisits the area of director removal in Australian public companies for two reasons. The first reason, which covers the majority of the article, is to engage in a detailed analysis of whether the pre-nuptial agreements which some public companies have indicated that they support using to remove directors, are in fact enforceable under Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Corporations Act The second reason is <b>to</b> <b>outline</b> <b>a</b> law reform <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> enable public companies to remove directors without requiring the vote of shareholders at a general meeting. The proposal involves providing Australia 2 ̆ 7 corporate  regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) with the power to grant relief from the statutory removal provisions to public companies, but in a way which balances the competing objectives of commercial efficiency and shareholder participation and, very importantly, encourages good corporate governance practices by companies in relation to the performance assessment  of directors. It is in the interests of both shareholders and directors to agree on a set of ground rules for the effective supervision of companies that reconciles the rights of the owners to overall control with the much tougher demands on modern directors<br /...|$|R
