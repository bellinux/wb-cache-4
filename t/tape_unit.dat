25|$|For the {{magnetic}} tape sound recording Kornél Tolnai used magnetic tape {{as a medium}} for magnetic recording, made of a thin magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic. Most audio, video and computer data storage is this type. It was developed in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording. Devices that record and play back audio and video using magnetic tape are tape recorders and later on video tape recorders. A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape is a tape drive (<b>tape</b> <b>unit,</b> streamer).|$|E
25|$|The first rotating-drum {{storage device}} {{was used in}} the Birkbeck Automatic Relay Computer {{developed}} by Andrew Booth and Kathleen Booth in 1948. By 1954, magnetic core memory was rapidly displacing most other forms of temporary storage, including the Williams tube. It went on to dominate the field through the mid-1970s. A key feature of the American UNIVAC I system of 1951 was the implementation of a newly invented type of metal magnetic tape, and a high-speed <b>tape</b> <b>unit,</b> for non-volatile storage. Magnetic tape is still used in many computers.|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} of Moore's Gibson Super 400 with the Echosonic ("a jazz classic meets a rock'n'roll revolution") became legendary. Soon, many seminal {{rock and roll}} players, including Carl Perkins, started using an EchoSonic, which in turn led to other manufacturers producing individual <b>tape</b> echo <b>units</b> {{that could be used}} in the studio as well as on stage. One of those <b>tape</b> <b>units</b> was the Echoplex, which started as a copy of the echo unit from an EchoSonic, and became one of the most important echo effects of the twentieth century.|$|R
50|$|Pertec XL-40, {{introduced}} in 1977, {{was a more}} successful successor of Pertec PCC-2100. The XL-40 machine used custom 16-bit processors built from the TI3000 or AMD2900 slices, up to 512 KB operating memory and dedicated master-capable DMA controllers for <b>tape</b> <b>units,</b> floppy and rigid disk units, printers, card reader and terminals.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} CVRs used analog wire recording, later {{replaced by}} analog magnetic tape. Some of the <b>tape</b> <b>units</b> used two reels, with the tape automatically reversing at each end. The original was the ARL Flight Memory Unit produced in 1957 by Australian David Warren and an instrument maker named Tych Mirfield.|$|R
