5|$|During the Renaissance, {{money and}} art went hand in hand. Artists {{depended}} entirely on patrons while <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> needed money to foster artistic talent. Wealth {{was brought to}} Italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into Asia and Europe. Silver mining in Tyrol increased the flow of money. Luxuries from the Eastern world, brought home during the Crusades, increased the prosperity of Genoa and Venice.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, {{the rectory}} of Quarrington and the vicarage of Old Sleaford {{combined}} {{to form the}} ecclesiastical parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford. The parish boundaries of Quarrington with Old Sleaford were last altered in 1928. The rectory is in the Diocese and Archdeaconry of Lincoln {{and has been in}} the Lafford Rural Deanery since 1968; the current rector of Quarrington is the Rev Sandra Benham and <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> are alternatively the Bishop of Lincoln and Sir Lyonel Tollemache, 7th Baronet.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>patrons</b> {{ensured that}} cricket was financed in the 18th century but their interest, equally {{applicable}} to horse racing and prizefighting, {{was based on}} the opportunities that cricket provided for gambling. Every important match in the 18th century, whether eleven-a-side or single wicket, was played for stakes. The early newspapers recognised this and were more interested in publishing the odds than the match scores. Reports would say who won the wager rather than who won the match.|$|E
5|$|The wealthy {{families}} {{living on the}} estates of these scholar-officials – as well as rich merchants, princes, and nobles—often maintained a massive entourage of employed servants, technical staffs, and personal favorites. They hired personal artisans such as jewellers, sculptors, and embroiderers, while servants cleaned house, shopped for goods, attended to kitchen duties, and prepared furnishings for banquets, weddings, and funerals. Rich families also hosted literary men such as secretaries, copyists, and hired tutors to educate their sons. They were also <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> of musicians, painters, poets, chess players, and storytellers.|$|E
5|$|A {{visit by}} Dahlia Brinkley, the only Springfield Elementary {{graduate}} ever to enter an Ivy League college, gives Lisa a severe inferiority complex {{because she is}} involved in very few extracurricular activities. When Ned Flanders resigns as coach of Bart's Little League team, the Springfield Isotots, Lisa seizes the chance to extend her résumé and takes the position. Since she knows nothing about baseball, she seeks advice from <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> of Moe's Tavern, who direct her to Professor Frink and his scientific colleagues. She learns about sabermetrics from them and uses this science to organize the Isotots' strategy; as a result, their record quickly improves and they rise in the league standings. However, Bart eventually rebels against her management, saying that she has taken all {{the fun out of}} the game, and hits a home run despite her orders to let the pitcher walk him. The Isotots win the game, but Lisa throws Bart off the team for his insubordination.|$|E

50|$|Because {{a client}} was beholden to his patron for his position, the client {{was eager to}} please his patron by {{carrying}} out his policies. The Soviet power structure essentially consisted (according to its critics) of groups of vassals (clients) who had an overlord (<b>the</b> <b>patron).</b> <b>The</b> higher <b>the</b> <b>patron,</b> <b>the</b> more clients <b>the</b> <b>patron</b> had. Patrons protected their clients and tried to promote their careers. In return for the patron's efforts to promote their careers, the clients remained loyal to their patron. Thus, by promoting his clients' careers, <b>the</b> <b>patron</b> could advance his own power.|$|R
5|$|Although {{tickets for}} the Masters are not expensive, they are very {{difficult}} to come by. Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A waiting list for <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.|$|E
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> leave due to not {{receiving}} a refund, the pictures going black {{when they were}} getting to important scenes, and complain about {{the taste of the}} popcorn (due to the mess the babies have made in the concession stand), Stu is angry at the fact that The Land Without Smiles went out at the climax. But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E
5|$|Ashot III {{established}} the Kingdom of Lori (Tashir-Dzoraget Kingdom) in Gugark for strategic reasons and enthroned Gurgen in 982. Gurgen {{along with his}} brother Smbat are depicted on the sculptures of <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> in both Sanahin and Haghpat. When the Tashir-Dzoraget kingdom fell {{as a result of}} Seljuk raids the Kyurikids migrated to Tavush and Metsnaberd yet they maintained ties with their ancestral fortress and compound in Akhtala. The fortress was built on an elevated rocky outcrop surrounded by deep canyons from three sides forming a natural protection. The somewhat accessible parts between the cliffs are reinforced by towers and walls. The only entrance to the compound is on the northern side protected by bell-shaped towers and walls. The walls and towers of the fortress are built of bluish basalt and lime mortar. The Kyurikids gradually lost their influence under the Seljuk grasp {{by the end of the}} 12th century.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{client and}} <b>patron</b> {{were not allowed}} to sue or to bear witness against each other, and had to abstain from any injury to each other. In early times, the client {{accompanied}} <b>the</b> <b>patron</b> in war, being in this respect similar to the vassal of the Middle Ages. The client had to ransom <b>the</b> <b>patron</b> if <b>the</b> <b>patron</b> was taken prisoner, and to vote for <b>the</b> <b>patron</b> if <b>the</b> <b>patron</b> was a candidate for an office. The client was regarded as a minor member of their patron's gens ("clan"), entitled to assist in its religious services, and bound to contribute to the cost of them. The client was subject to the jurisdiction and discipline of the gens, and was entitled to burial in its common sepulchre. According to Niebuhr, if the client died without an heir, <b>the</b> <b>patron</b> inherited their property.|$|R
5|$|Bartender Sam Malone (Ted Danson) {{has been}} jealous {{of his brother}} Derek, who is more successful, better-educated, multi-talented and handsome, for years, and discovers that he is {{arriving}} in Boston on his private jet. Meanwhile, co-bartender Coach (Nicholas Colasanto) is offered a coaching job in Venezuela requiring fluency in Spanish. Derek (an unseen character voiced by George Ball) arrives unexpectedly {{at the bar and}} entertains <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> with his talents, which include singing, playing a pool table, tap dancing and telling stories. Derek offers a job to regular patron Norm (George Wendt), teaches Coach Spanish (increasing his chances of being hired) and impresses waitress Diane (Shelley Long) with their common interests. Diane and Derek pair off (which bothers Sam). During his date with Debbie (Deborah Shelton), Sam hears Derek's private jet, where he carries Diane along.|$|E
5|$|Between 1887 and 1889 the French {{archaeologist}} Jacques de Morgan discovered 576 rectangular stone sepulchers, {{along with}} cultural items made of clay, bronze and iron near Akhtala {{dating back to}} the 8th century BC. The settlement of modern Akhtala was known as Agarak in the 5th century. The fortress was almost certainly built on top of Bronze and Iron Age foundations. It was built in the late tenth century by the Kyurikids, this branch of the Bagratunis originated from Gurgen (the name was pronounced Kyurikeh in the local dialect of Gugark). He was the son of <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> of Sanahin and Haghpat monasteries located not far from Akhtala, King Ashot III the Merciful and Queen Khosrovanush. Gurgen's brothers were King Smbat II the Conqueror and Gagik I Bagratuni, under whom the Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia reached the peak of its prosperity.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} parades on St. Patrick's Day {{throughout}} Northern Ireland. Although the parade celebrates <b>the</b> <b>Patron</b> Saint's stature as <b>the</b> <b>Patron</b> Saint of Ireland, {{it has been}} recognised that St. Patrick is <b>the</b> <b>patron</b> saint of <b>the</b> island of Ireland, and <b>the</b> <b>patron</b> saint of both Nationalists and Unionists throughout Ireland. In recent years, loyal orders such as the Orange Order and the Apprentice Boys of Derry have held parades to mark St. Patrick's day.|$|R
5|$|In 1415, King Henry V {{dissolved}} {{the alien}} priories (those under control of religious houses abroad) {{and the church}} at Poulton reverted to the Crown. It was given by Henry to Syon Monastery in Middlesex. At {{the time of the}} English Reformation in the 16th century, St Chad's became the Anglican parish church. Originally, the parish included Poulton, Carleton, Thornton, Hardhorn-with-Newton and Marton. The Syon Monastery was suppressed in 1539 during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries and St Chad's again returned to the Crown's possession. In the reign of Elizabeth I (after a brief restoration of Syon by Mary I), the advowson was granted to John Fleetwood of Penwortham. The Fleetwood family remained <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> of St Chad's until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Krusty is {{inspired}} {{to return to}} doing low-key events, where he structures a new image for himself as a stand-up comedian who tells the truth, criticizes commercialism, and refuses to sell out to corporate America. He also changes his appearance, sporting a dark sweater and tying his hair in a ponytail. Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle called the Canyonero. Although he tries to resist, he eventually succumbs to the lure of money. After promoting the Canyonero at a comedy performance in Moe's Tavern, he is booed off stage by <b>the</b> <b>patrons.</b> He finally admits to himself that comedy is not in his blood and selling out is. The episode ends with an extended advertisement for the Canyonero, as Krusty and Bart leave Moe's tavern in Krusty's new SUV.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk, {{hearing of}} the turmoil, headed for Moscow and Beijing in order to demand that <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> of PAVN and the Viet Cong exert {{more control over their}} clients. On 18 March 1970, Lon Nol {{requested}} that the National Assembly vote {{on the future of the}} prince's leadership of the nation. Sihanouk was ousted from power by a vote of 92–0. Heng Cheng became president of the National Assembly, while Prime Minister Lon Nol was granted emergency powers. Sirik Matak retained his post as deputy prime minister. The new government emphasized that the transfer of power had been totally legal and constitutional and it received the recognition of most foreign governments. There have been, and continue to be, accusations that the U.S. government played some role in the overthrow of Sihanouk, but conclusive evidence has never been found to support them.|$|E

5|$|Stela 10 is on {{the north}} side of StructureA-3. It depicts Wat'ul Chatel, dressed in Terminal Classic Maya style, {{although}} his foreign-looking face bears a moustache, which is not a typically Mayan characteristic. The text on this stela displays the emblem glyphs of Tikal, Calakmul and Motul de San José, describing how he received visitors from those cities. Among the visitors are named Kan-Pet of Calakmul and Kan Ek' of Motul. Wat'ul Chatel wears a headdress associated with the patron gods of Seibal, the heron god and K'awiil, deities that were also <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> of Palenque. This appears to be an attempt by this foreign king to identify himself more closely with the city he came to rule.|$|E
5|$|The caravan trade {{depended}} on patrons and merchants. Patrons owned the {{land on which}} the caravan animals were raised, providing animals and guards for the merchants. The lands were located in the numerous villages of the Palmyrene countryside. Although merchants used <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> to conduct business, their roles often overlapped and a patron would sometimes lead a caravan. Commerce made Palmyra and its merchants among the wealthiest in the region. Some caravans were financed by a single merchant, such as Male' Agrippa (who financed Hadrian's visit in 129 and the 139 rebuilding of the Temple of Bel). The primary income-generating trade good was silk, which was exported from the East to the West. Other exported goods included jade, muslin, spices, ebony, ivory and precious stones. For its domestic market Palmyra imported variety of goods including slaves, prostitutes, olive oil, dyed goods, myrrh and perfume.|$|E
5|$|While training, Miller flew Beauforts, Beaufighters and Mosquitos. He {{had another}} near death experience: {{mechanical}} problems {{forced him to}} make an emergency landing of his Beaufighter. The plane was repaired for use by others, but, on its next flight, the pilot was killed when the problem recurred. On another occasion, Miller avoided colliding with a hangar by centimetres. He then escaped death by skipping a social appointment; a V1 bomb hit the venue and killed many of <b>the</b> <b>patrons.</b> In October, he went AWL to watch a concert and was summarily discharged, but the CO revoked his decision after Miller agreed to play for his cricket team. At {{the end of his}} officer training, Miller was sent aboard a Royal Navy destroyer as part of an exchange program between the forces. During a mission to Belgium, the vessel fought a German U-boat, which was sunk. Upon his return to England, Miller was promoted to flying officer on 4 November 1944.|$|E
