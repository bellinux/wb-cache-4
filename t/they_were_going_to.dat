5|$|According to the Bureau of Immigration, 54,057 Armenians {{entered the}} US between 1899 and 1917. The top listed {{countries}} of origin were Turkey (46,474), Russia (3,034), Canada (1,577), Great Britain (914) and Egypt (894). Immigrants {{were asked to indicate}} which state <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> settle in; for Armenians, the most popular answers were New York (17,391), Massachusetts (14,192), Rhode Island (4,923), Illinois (3,313), California (2,564), New Jersey (2,115), Pennsylvania (2,002), Michigan (1,371). The largest Armenian American communities at that time were located in New York City; Fresno; Worcester, Massachusetts; Boston; Philadelphia; Chicago; Jersey City; Detroit; Los Angeles; Troy, New York; and Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|Certain scenes, {{such as the}} {{argument}} between Giles and Buffy in the library, and Buffy's first meeting with Angel, were re-shot {{eight months after the}} first episode was recorded with both Whedon and Gellar feeling that Buffy was too angry in the original takes. Whedon subsequently teased Gellar that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> reshoot the scenes a third time. The high school used for external and some internal scenes in the series is Torrance High, the same school used for the series Beverly Hills, 90210.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was {{to ensure that}} all party leaders were made aware of these plans and actions. Thus, it would be impossible for them to later deny knowledge of the killings. Because the Allies had indicated that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the planned genocide.|$|E

A tyre blew out and the car rolled on the Leichhardt Highway near Condamine. Murray was taken to Miles District Hospital with broken ribs.

5|$|After the Roman {{victory at}} Mount Olympus, the Tectosagi begged {{them not to}} attack them and asked to meet him for a conference halfway between their camp and Ancyra. The main aim of the conference was for the Tectosagi to delay the Roman attack {{so that they could}} allow the women and {{children}} to retreat across the Halys River. Their other aim was to assassinate Manlius while he was at the conference. While <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the conference the Romans saw the Galatian cavalry charging at them. In the skirmish that followed the Galatians overpowered Manlius' bodyguard due to their numbers but were driven back when the escort that had been accompanying the Roman foragers arrived and forced the Galatians to retreat.|$|E
5|$|At Bound for Glory, Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) fought The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott Steiner) in a two out {{of three}} falls tables match. They were {{unsuccessful}} at defeating the Steiners as The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin; MCMG) interfered and helped the Steiners win the match. On the October 18 episode of Impact!, Team 3D attacked MCMG during their match in The 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament, injuring them in the plot, which led to a spot being vacant. Afterwards, they stated <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> destroy the X Division, for which MCMG belonged. On the November 1 episode of Impact!, MCMG returned from injury and attacked Team 3D. Afterwards, Shelley challenged Team 3D to a fight at Genesis, which was later made official by TNA.|$|E

5|$|Custine's {{leadership}} and character, although impugned by the Tribunal, proved fundamentally {{sound in the}} field. As an admirer of the Prussian style of drill and discipline, he was a strict disciplinarian, but his soldiers actually liked him, and felt inspired by him. Custine liked to make speeches and reportedly knew the names of his soldiers. He visited men in the hospital, demonstrated blunt good humor, and was the master of repartee. His ready wit was quoted throughout his command. He did not tolerate disorder or insubordination however; when encountering a troop of volunteers in 1792, who bragged that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> teach the army the right step (make it Republican), he ordered his cavalry to surround and disarm them.|$|E
5|$|Dustin Kensrue and Teppei Teranishi {{knew each}} other from school and had played in a band called Chapter 11. Teppei {{recruited}} his skate park friend Eddie Breckenridge to play bass, who then brought his brother Riley on as a drummer. In 1998, before their first show, they realized they needed a name. Hard-pressed for time, they decided {{to go with the}} name 'Thrice' out of desperation. Thrice was initially an inside joke between the band members, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> use it only temporarily for their first show. However, they began to gain fans with the name, and people started to associate them with it, so they were forced to keep it.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E

5|$|On 30 April the men {{informed}} their landlord that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Bristol for a {{week and}} then returning to Iraq, stated that they would no longer require the flat, and arranged for their belongings to be sent to Iraq. They left the building at 09:30 (BST) on 30 April. Their initial destination is unknown, but en route to the Iranian Embassy they collected firearms (including pistols and submachine guns), ammunition and hand grenades. The weapons, predominantly Soviet-made, are believed to have been smuggled into the United Kingdom in a diplomatic bag belonging to Iraq. Shortly before 11:30, and almost two hours after vacating the nearby flat in Lexham Gardens in South Kensington, the six men arrived outside the embassy.|$|E
5|$|On March 20, Parker sent a {{chartered}} Greyhound bus {{to transport}} Presley {{and his entourage}} from Memphis, Tennessee to Nashville. The session personnel consisted of guitarist Scotty Moore, drummer D.J. Fontana, pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Hank Garland, bassist Bobby Moore, percussionist Buddy Harman and the backing group The Jordanaires. Presley's original bassist Bill Black declined to join the sessions as he was enjoying success with the Bill Black Combo. To prevent possible disruption by fans, the musicians were initially told <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> play on a Jim Reeves session. RCA executives Sholes and Bill Bullock were joined in the control booth by Parker, his assistant Tom Diskin, A head Chet Atkins, engineer Bill Porter and Hill and Range's Bienstock.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Light Infantry {{had arrived}} in Singapore from Madras in October 1914. They {{had been sent to}} replace the Yorkshire Light Infantry, which had been ordered to France. The 5th Light Infantry {{consisted}} of roughly equal numbers of Punjabi Muslims and Pathans serving in separate companies. Their morale was constantly low, being affected by poor communication, slack discipline and a weak leadership. The regiment had been employed to guard the captured crew from the German ship, SMS Emden and reportedly attempts were made to fan the discontent amongst the sepoys. The regiment was under orders to embark for further garrison duty in Hong Kong, however rumours started that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be sent to fight in the Middle East against fellow Muslims from the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5|$|Admiral de Grasse had {{the option}} to attack British forces in either New York or Virginia; he opted for Virginia, {{arriving}} at the Chesapeake {{at the end of}} August. Admiral Graves learned that de Grasse had sailed from the West Indies for North America and that French Admiral de Barras had also sailed from Newport, Rhode Island, and he concluded that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> join forces at the Chesapeake. He sailed south from New York with 19 ships of the line and arrived {{at the mouth of the}} Chesapeake early on 5 September to see de Grasse's fleet at anchor in the bay. De Grasse hastily prepared most of his fleet for battle—24 ships of the line—and sailed out to meet him, and the two-hour engagement took place after hours of maneuvering. The lines of the two fleets did not completely meet; only the forward and center sections fully engaged. The battle was consequently fairly evenly matched, although the British suffered more casualties and ship damage, and it broke off when the sun set. The British tactics have been a subject of debate ever since.|$|E
5|$|By September 1944, Ostojić {{had been}} {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel, and was the Chetnik area commander in eastern Bosnia. In early September 1944, as Mihailović had been removed as Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Force with {{the demise of the}} Purić government-in-exile, Ostojić tried to make contact with Allied forces in Italy, and agreed with Lukačević to issue a proclamation to the people explaining that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> attack the Germans. After 12 September 1944, when King Peter called for all in Yugoslavia to rally around Tito, he and Baćović warned Mihailović that their men were losing their will to fight the Partisans. Concerned that the Russians would hand the Chetniks over to the Partisans, he then contacted the United States Office of Strategic Services (OSS) liaison officer with the Chetniks, Colonel Robert H. McDowell, but was unable to arrange for the Chetniks to be placed under American command.|$|E
5|$|The German crusaders, {{accompanied}} by the papal legate and cardinal Theodwin, intended to meet the French in Constantinople. Ottokar III of Styria joined Conrad at Vienna, and Conrad's enemy Géza II of Hungary allowed them to pass through unharmed. When the German army of 20,000 men arrived in Byzantine territory, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos feared <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> attack him, and Byzantine troops were posted {{to ensure that there}} was no trouble. There was a brief skirmish with some of the more unruly Germans near Philippopolis and in Adrianople, where the Byzantine general Prosouch fought with Conrad's nephew, the future emperor Frederick. To make matters worse, some of the German soldiers were killed in a flood at the beginning of September. On 10 September, however, they arrived at Constantinople, where relations with Manuel were poor, resulting in a battle, after which the Germans were convinced that they should cross into Asia Minor as quickly as possible. Manuel wanted Conrad to leave some of his troops behind, to assist in defending against attacks from Roger II, who had taken the opportunity to plunder the cities of Greece, but Conrad did not agree, despite being a fellow enemy of Roger.|$|E

5|$|The provincial forces began {{landing at}} Gabarus Bay on 30 April, and laid siege to the {{fortress}} while the British ships blockaded the harbour. The Americans began suffering battle losses, while the British naval officers, {{who had a}} low opinion of American soldiers, grew increasingly critical of the American efforts. Warren tried to exert control over the provincial troops, but Pepperrell resisted him. Louisbourg surrendered on 17 June. The Americans lost 180 men in combat, to disease or at sea during the siege, while the Royal Navy ships did not fire on the fortress, and lost just one sailor. As the victors settled into occupation of Louisbourg, friction grew between the Americans and the British. The terms of surrender guaranteed the French in all of their possessions; there was no plunder for the American troops. On the other hand, the Royal Navy had captured several rich French prizes, and British sailors on shore leave bragged to the Americans about how rich <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be from their shares.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September, {{the press}} {{announced}} that on 8 May 1996 NSB had agreed that Class 71's axles could receive a steel quality substandard to European standard and recommendation from the International Union of Railways. The {{reason was that}} the class would have a much higher weight than planned, and that this would cause the trains to operate more slowly and thus {{not be able to}} reach the airport in the desired 19 minutes. Class 73 inherited the same axle quality from the Class 71 order. On 11 September, Adtranz accepted responsibility for the axle problems, and stated that they would replace all axles free of charge, an operation which would cost them NOK70 million. In October, Adtranz announced that they would also replace all the wheels on both classes. NSB was spending NOK1.5 million on brake discs and brake shoes per month. The parties continued to disagree on the size of compensation Adtranz should give NSB, with NOK100 million separating the two. In July, NSB replaced DNV with CorrOcean as their inspection supplier for the class. NSB stated that this halved the cost of the inspections. The same month, Bombardier Transportation, who by then had taken over Adtranz, stated that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> replace the bogie frames for all the Class 71 and 73, as well as Class 93 trains, as part of the compensation deal with NSB.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Fox, Dominic Monaghan and Jorge Garcia {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Sawyer, who at the time {{was supposed to be a}} suit-wearing city con man, but the role was given to Josh Holloway. Garcia was the first actor the producers knew <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cast. While the producers thought Garcia was spectacular, they did not think he fit in the role of Sawyer, so they created the Hurley character for him instead. When Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked his southern accent and the edge he brought to the character (Holloway reportedly forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration). The producers knew he did not suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, but kept the same intelligence he originally had. After appearing in The Lord of the Rings, Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles, like elves and pixies. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part that had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rocker that has been a big hit in the 1980s but now had a heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan's audition of Sawyer, they decided to cast him as Charlie and rewrote the script to make Charlie a young has-been instead.|$|E
