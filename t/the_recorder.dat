5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>recorder.</b> Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
5|$|Nash was {{immediately}} appointed captain of Camberwell and quickly {{became one of}} the most popular figures in the VFA, drawing large crowds to even practice matches. Playing mainly at centre-half-back in his first season but later in the forward-line, Nash was runner-up in the 1938 Camberwell Best and Fairest and won the 1939 Best and Fairest; and in 1939, he finished second in both of the VFA's Best and Fairest awards: <b>the</b> <b>Recorder</b> Cup and VFA Medal. Nash spent four seasons at Camberwell, where he played 74 games and kicked 418 goals, including 100 in 1939 and 141 in 1941. At the start of the 1940 season Nash was still considered amongst the best footballers in the country and, with the transfer of former South Melbourne team mate Bob Pratt and Collingwood full-forward Ron Todd to rival VFA sides Coburg and Williamstown respectively, there was talk that the VFA would now match the VFL for crowds.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiment}} resumed at 14:00. Weil {{worked the}} final control rod while Fermi carefully monitored the neutron activity. Fermi {{announced that the}} pile had gone critical (reached a self-sustaining reaction) at 15:25. Fermi switched the scale on <b>the</b> <b>recorder</b> to accommodate the rapidly increasing electrical current from the boron trifluoride detector. He wanted to test the control circuits, but after 28 minutes, the alarm bells went off to notify everyone that the neutron flux had passed the preset safety level, and he ordered Zinn to release the zip. The reaction rapidly halted. The pile had run for about 4.5 minutes at about 0.5 watts. Wigner opened a bottle of Chianti, which they drank from paper cups.|$|E

5|$|Davenport uses a mayor-council form {{of local}} {{government}}. , city government consists of mayor Frank Klipsch and a ten-person council. One person is elected {{from each of}} the eight wards and two at-large aldermen are elected to represent the whole city. Nonpartisan elections are held in odd-numbered years. The mayor is top elected individual for the city. The mayor's duties include running city council meetings and approves or vetoes all actions taken by the council members, and can vote in case of a tie. He or she also appoints city board members. The city council's job is to make laws and set the city budget. The city administrator, currently (no permanent administrator), is appointed by the mayor with confirmation by two-thirds of the council. Citywide goals through 2012 include having a financially responsible government, having a growing economy, revitalizing neighborhoods, and upgrading city infrastructure and public facilities. The establishment of Davenport as a political and government unit came in 1839, three years after the city was settled. The city was incorporated {{as a result of a}} resolution by Iowa Representative Jonathan W. Parker by special charter in the Iowa Territory on January 25, 1839. Parker was a resident of Davenport and one of six trustees elected to govern the city with Rodolphus Bennet being the first mayor. Activity for the first four months was minimal as the council failed to meet. In 1842, the city charter was amended for the first time. Changes include having six alderman replace the five trustees, dividing the city into three wards, and appointing a city clerk position to replace <b>the</b> <b>recorder.</b> The charter was amended again in 1851 to expand the city area, provide greater detail of the duties of the mayor, city council, and other officials. During the last half of the 19th century, government assumed expanding responsibilities for public welfare and public works improvements.|$|E

25|$|In 1826, Singapore was {{united with}} Malacca and Prince of Wales' Island (present-day Penang) {{to form the}} Straits Settlements, which were granted a Court of Judicature by the Second Charter of Justice dated 27 November 1826. The Charter conferred on the Court the {{jurisdiction}} of the Courts of King's Bench, Chancery, Common Pleas and Exchequer in civil, criminal and revenue matters, among other things. The judges of the Court were the Governor, the Resident Counsellor, and <b>the</b> <b>Recorder</b> of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Malacca. The Governor's power to overrule decisions of <b>the</b> <b>Recorder</b> led to dissatisfaction as <b>the</b> <b>Recorder</b> was {{the only member of the}} Court who was a professional judge, and there were calls for the executive and judicial branches to be separated. This issue was not resolved by the Third Charter of Justice granted to the Straits Settlements on 12 August 1855, though there were now to be two Recorders, one for Penang and the other for Singapore and Malacca. It was only in 1867 that the Governor and Resident Counsellors ceased to exercise judicial powers.|$|E
