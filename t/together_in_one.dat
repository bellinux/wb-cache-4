5|$|Henry VI, {{the three}} parts {{considered}} <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> chapter, is not, for Hazlitt, {{on a level}} with the other history plays, but, in a long comparison of King Henry VI with King Richard II, he finds occasion to reinforce his major theme of the fine discrimination of superficially similar characters.|$|E
5|$|Houston City Council District J now covers Gulfton. District J {{was created}} in 2011 to allow Hispanic voters to more easily select {{candidates}} who cater to them. Robert Jara, a political consultant of the group Campaign Strategies, drew the boundaries of District J {{in order to ensure}} that Gulfton and Sharpstown were <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> area. That way, the Hispanic residents could lobby for influence with their city council representative, whether he or she is of Hispanic origin or not.|$|E
5|$|In 1955-56, Ray was {{overlooked}} {{and spent}} four years out of first-class cricket, and he never played alongside Neil again at first-class level. Neil played in all of Victoria's matches, and Mick played in Queensland’s first six matches before being dropped for the second and final match against Victoria. In 1956-57, Mick played in two matches for Queensland {{earlier in the season}} before being dropped and retiring; neither were against Victoria, so none of the brothers played <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> match. Ray was recalled to the Victorian team {{in the latter half of}} the 1958-59 season. By this time, Neil had moved to New South Wales for employment reasons, and played each other late in the season. The Harvey brothers never played together or against one another again at first-class level. In 1959-60, Neil was in the Indian subcontinent representing Australia as Ray played his final first-class season before retiring.|$|E

5|$|In December 2012, Network Rail {{appointed}} BAM Nuttall as {{its main}} contractor. The Network Rail team which {{worked on the}} line was {{essentially the same as}} the one which delivered the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link in 2009. A Network Rail spokesman confirmed that lessons learned from the previous project had been applied to the Borders project, such as better coordination between the different teams by having them <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> office in Newtongrange. In June 2013, the design contract for the line was awarded to URS which agreed to design new bridges, stations and roads, as well as the refurbishment of existing bridges and the provision of engineering support, for £3.5 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{two works}} are bound <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> {{surviving}} manuscript, the earliest surviving cartulary from medieval England. A major theme is the losses suffered by Worcester {{at the hands}} of royal officials and local landowners. Included amongst the despoilers are kings such as Cnut and William the Conqueror, and nobles such as Eadric Streona and Urse d'Abetot. Also included are accounts of lawsuits waged by the Worcester monks in an effort to regain their lost lands. The two sections of the cartulary were first printed in 1723. The original manuscript was slightly damaged by fire in 1733, and required rebinding. A new printed edition is in production as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|This {{theory is}} debatable; Hermann Alexander Schlögl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jochem Kahl {{argue that the}} clay seals were only found at the {{entrance}} area of Peribsen's tomb {{and none of them}} depict Peribsen and Sekhemib's names <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> inscription. Furthermore, they remark that it was customary for a pharaoh to bury and seal his predecessor's tomb; the presence of Sekhemib's seals show the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences can be drawn from the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found at the entrance of king Qa'a's tomb and the clay seals of Djoser found at the entrance of Khasekhemwy's tomb. Schlögl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that the discovery of Sekhemib's seals support the view that Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him.|$|E
60|$|Was {{there anybody}} {{in the world who}} ever loved London for itself? Did Dr. Johnson, in his paradise of Fleet Street, love the {{pavement}} and the walls? I doubt that--whether I ought to do so or not--though I don't doubt at all that one may be contented and happy here, and love much in the place. But the place and the privileges of it don't mix <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>one's</b> love, as is done among the hills and by the seaside.|$|R

25|$|Bojagi {{were used}} for {{transporting}} items, as well as covering, or keeping things <b>together</b> <b>in</b> storage. <b>One</b> such example is a 'knapsack' arrangement, where the cloth is wrapped and tied so that items can be securely transported upon ones' back.|$|R
5|$|Viral genomes are circular, {{as in the}} polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses. The type of {{nucleic acid}} is {{irrelevant}} {{to the shape of}} the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented. For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> capsid. However, all segments are not required {{to be in the same}} virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses.|$|E
25|$|Containment or {{agglomeration}} – Small {{objects are}} typically grouped <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> package {{for reasons of}} storage and selling efficiency. For example, a single box of 1000 pencils requires less physical handling than 1000 single pencils. Liquids, powders, and granular materials need containment.|$|E

For example, if a macro is run, all undo-able actions performed by the macro may be grouped <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> undo unit.|$|E

25|$|Valentiner also reorganized how art was {{displayed}} at the museum. Breaking with the tradition of organizing artworks by their type with, for example, painting grouped <b>together</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> gallery and sculpture in another. Valentiner organized them by nation and chronology, this was recognized as being so revolutionary that the 1929 Encyclopædia Britannica used an illustration of the main floor plan of the DIA {{as an example of}} the perfect modern art museum.|$|E
