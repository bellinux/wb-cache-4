Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity.|$|E
5|$|A {{vector space}} (also called a linear space) is a {{collection}} of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{entitled}} the Need of Instructing Patients after <b>Operation</b> <b>of</b> Varicose Veins. It {{deals with the}} general issue of the disease, {{the role of a}} nurse in the treatment <b>of</b> patients after <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> varicose veins and the instructions given as an inseparable part of the nursing care. The paper follows 4 essential objectives. Objective 1 : Finding out what information patients have after <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> varicose veins. Objective 2 : Finding out what information the patients need. Objective 3 : Finding out, in which way nurses in a surgery department instruct patients after <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> varicose veins. Objective 4 : Creating an instructional brochure for patients after <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> varicose veins, based on the information obtained. There were 4 research questions asked. 1. What information do patients have after <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> varicose veins? 2. What information do patients need after <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> varicose veins? 3. In which way do nurses instruct patients after <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> varicose veins? 4. Do nurses perceive instructions as an inseparable part of the nursing care?The research was carried out at Pelhřimov hospital, subsidized organization, with the consent of the head nurse. The research group consisted of 10 patients after <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> varicose veins who were interviewed before leaving the hospital for home care, and 8 nurses from the aseptic section of the surgery department. All the respondents were asked using the technique of a non-standardized interview with questions prepared in advance. Based on the analysis of the respondents' answers, an informative brochure was drafted which was then tested by a questionnaire. It was found out that the brochure would be advantageous for the surgery department. The objectives of the paper were met. Improvement in the process of instructing patients after <b>the</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> varicose veins could be reached by introducing an informative brochure. Not only patients, but also nurses working at a surgery department could benefit from the brochure...|$|R
