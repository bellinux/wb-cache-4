5|$|In 1862, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich was {{appointed}} viceroy of Russian Poland {{by his brother}} and moved to Warsaw {{with his wife and}} children. The stay in Poland proved difficult for the Grand Duke, who was the victim of a nationalist assassination attempt <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> arrival in the Polish capital. Although Constantine embarked on a program of liberalization and re-instated Polish as an official language, Polish nationalists agitating for reform were not appeased. Finally, an uprising in January 1863 and the radicalization of the separatists pushed the Tsar to recall his brother in August. Olga's difficult experiences in Poland marked her profoundly.|$|E

The family lived in Birkenhead, where for six months Henson stayed with them. He had ample leisure time, much of which he spent in visiting local churches and nonconformist chapels. This process left him struggling with doctrinal questions, but sure of a religious vocation. <b>The</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> return to Oxford in October 1885 he went into St Mary's, Iffley, and {{with his hand on}} the altar vowed to dedicate himself to God and the Church.|$|E

5|$|On 12 June 1917, <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>his</b> accession, Alexander {{revealed}} his liaison with Aspasia Manos {{to his father}} and asked for his permission to marry her.

In the intervening months, Alexander increasingly resented his separation from his family. His regular letters to his parents were intercepted by the government and confiscated. Alexander's only source of comfort was Aspasia, and he took the decision to marry her despite his father's request.|$|E

The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army.|$|E

5|$|Lord Cave {{resigned}} on 28 March 1928 due to ill health, {{and died}} <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after.</b> <b>His</b> replacement was Lord Hailsham, {{who was appointed}} by Stanley Baldwin on 29 March 1928. Hailsham's first tenure as Lord Chancellor lasted barely a year and highlighted the fact that despite his abilities (many politicians considered {{that if he had}} not accepted the offer to become Lord Chancellor he would likely have become Prime Minister) he was not a particularly innovative Lord Chancellor. For a short period in August 1928 he acted as Prime Minister (Baldwin was on holiday in Aix-en-Provence) with Schuster as his chief adviser, but he rarely went to 10 Downing Street and nothing eventful happened during his time in charge.|$|E
