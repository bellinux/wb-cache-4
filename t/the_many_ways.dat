25|$|The de Ménils, however, did {{not limit}} their {{acquisitions}} to modern art, and their eclectic tastes became {{a hallmark of}} their collecting practices. As modernists, they recognized the profound formal and spiritual connections between contemporary works {{of art and the}} arts of ancient and indigenous cultures, broadening their collection to include works from classical Mediterranean and Byzantine cultures, as well as objects from Africa, Oceania, and the Pacific Northwest. Influenced by the teachings of Father Couturier and Father Congar, the de Menils developed a particular humanist ethos in which they understood art as a central part of the human experience. Their collection was motivated by their shared interest in <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> individuals over different cultures and eras reveal through art their understanding {{of what it means to}} be human.|$|E

25|$|In a 1939 essay titled When Fiction Lives in Fiction, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges {{described}} Flann O'Brien's masterpiece as follows, I have enumerated many verbal labyrinths, {{but none}} so complex {{as the recent}} book by Flann O'Brien, At Swim-Two-Birds. A student in Dublin writes a novel about the proprietor of a Dublin public house, who writes a novel about the habitués of his pub (among them, the student), who in their turn write novels in which proprietor and student figure along with other writers about other novelists. The book consists of the extremely diverse manuscripts of these real or imagined persons, copiously annotated by the student. At Swim-Two-Birds {{is not only a}} labyrinth; it is a discussion of <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> to conceive of the Irish novel and a repertory of exercises in prose and verse which illustrate or parody all the styles of Ireland. The magisterial influence of Joyce (also an architect of labyrinths, also a literary Proteus) is undeniable, but not disproportionate in this manifold book. Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that dreaming and wakefulness are the pages of a single book, and that to read them in order is to live, and to leaf through them at random, is to dream. Paintings within paintings and books that branch into other books help us sense this oneness.|$|E

These contemporaries include his former competitors, many of whom were driven to ruin, but many others of whom sold out at a profit (or a profitable stake in Standard Oil, as Rockefeller often offered his shares as payment for a business), and quite a few of whom became very wealthy as managers as well as owners in Standard Oil. They include politicians and writers, some of whom served Rockefeller's interests, and some of whom built their careers by fighting Rockefeller and the [...] "robber barons".|$|E

Wilson, a convert to Islam, said [...] "This is not evangelism. It {{was really important}} for me to portray Kamala as someone who is struggling with her faith." [...] Wilson continued, [...] "Her brother is extremely conservative, her mom is paranoid that she's going to touch a boy and get pregnant, and her father wants her to concentrate on her studies and become a doctor." [...] Amanat added, As much as Islam is a part of Kamala’s identity, this book isn't preaching about religion or the Islamic faith in particular. It's about what happens when you struggle with the labels imposed on you, and how that forms your sense of self. It's a struggle we've all faced in one form or another, and isn't just particular to Kamala because she's Muslim. Her religion is just one aspect of <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> she defines herself.|$|E

500|$|The {{position}} of the Palmyrene deity as Aurelian's Sol Invictus is inferred from a passage by Zosimus reading: [...] "and the magnificent temple of the sun he (i.e. Aurelian) embellished with votive gifts from Palmyra, setting up statues of Helios and Bel". Three deities from Palmyra exemplified solar features: Malakbel, Yarhibol and Shamash, hence {{the identification of the}} Palmyrene Helios appearing in Zosimus' work with Malakbel. Some scholars criticize the notion of Malakbel's identification with Sol Invictus; according to Gaston Halsberghe, the cult of Malakbel was too local for it to become an imperial Roman god and Aurelian's restoration of Bel's temple and sacrifices dedicated to Malakbel were a sign of his attachment to the sun god in general and his respect to <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> in which the deity was worshiped. Richard Stoneman suggested another approach in which Aurelian simply borrowed the imagery of Malakbel to enhance his own solar deity. The relation between Malakbel and Sol Invictus can not be confirmed and will probably remain unresolved.|$|E

2500|$|Organizational {{rewards and}} job {{conditions}} play {{a large role}} in perceived organizational support as well. [...] Sometimes, extrinsic motivation can mean more to an employee than intrinsic motivation because perceived appreciation has the power to turn a bitter employee into a content employee. [...] Eisenberger and Rhoades discuss <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> that employers can show appreciation and reward their employees. [...] A few examples are paying their employees fairly; recognizing their employees for new ideas, exceptional work, etc.; promoting their employees when they deserve it; providing job security as incentive to remain with the organization; encouraging autonomy to correspondingly increase production and morale; reduce stress when made aware of it; and to provide proper training, to ensure employees' confidence in their jobs. [...] Some of these factors carry less weight than others do. [...] Being autonomous increases an employee's desire to continue to remain loyal to his or her organization because if he feels competent and confident in his ability to do well, he will be less likely to give up or lose faith.|$|E

2500|$|Boas's {{students}} dominated cultural anthropology through World War II, {{and continued}} to have great influence through the 1960s. [...] They were especially interested in two phenomena: the great variety of forms culture took around the world, and <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> individuals were shaped by and acted creatively through their own cultures. [...] This led his students {{to focus on the}} history of cultural traits: how they spread from one society to another, and how their meanings changed over time—and the life histories of members of other societies. [...] Others, such as Ruth Benedict (1887–1948) and Margaret Mead (1901–1978), produced monographs or comparative studies analyzing the forms of creativity possible to individuals within specific cultural configurations. [...] Essential to their research was the concept of [...] "context": culture provided a context that made the behavior of individuals understandable; geography and history provided a context for understanding the differences between cultures. [...] Thus, although Boasians were committed to the belief in the psychic unity of humankind and the universality of culture, their emphasis on local context and cultural diversity led them away from proposing cultural universals or universal theories of culture.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wide range}} of Marian devotions are {{followed}} by Catholics ranging from simple Rosary recitations to formalized, multi-day Novenas to activities which do not involve any prayers, such the wearing of scapulars or maintaining a Mary garden. Two well known Marian devotions are the Rosary recitation and the wearing of the Brown Scapular. Following their joint growth in the 18th and 19th centuries, by the early 20th century the Rosary and the devotional Scapular had gained such a strong following among Catholics worldwide that the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1914 stated: [...] "Like the Rosary, the Brown Scapular has become the badge of the devout Catholic." [...] In his encyclical Rosarium Virginis Mariae Pope John Paul II {{emphasized the importance of}} the Rosary. The Mariological basis of the Scapular devotion is effectively the same as Marian consecration, as discussed in the dogmatic constitution Lumen gentium of the Second Vatican Council, namely the role of the Virgin Mary as [...] "the mother to us in the order of grace" [...] which allows her to intercede for [...] "the gift of eternal salvation". The same Council decree clarified that <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>ways</b> in which Mary can encourage and assist us [...] "neither takes away from nor adds anything to the dignity and efficaciousness of Christ the one Mediator." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the initial}} {{release of the}} game, some players were {{disappointed}} that they lost the option of using Quiet as an ally after completing [...] "Mission 45: A Quiet Exit".

[...] However, the November 2015 release of the Version 1.06 update adds the ability to bring Quiet back in the game. The player needs to complete [...] "Mission 11: Cloaked in Silence" [...] seven times in a row without killing or leaving Quiet, to unlock a version of the mission titled [...] ": Cloaked in Silence". Completing this new version of the mission will have Quiet return permanently with all of the equipment she had at the time she left.|$|E
