The other two were the Fairbanks Times and the Tanana Daily Tribune. Competition among the three newspapers was intense, and they often clashed about issues such as city council meetings, a permanent bridge over the Chena River, and the mineral prospects of the town of Iditarod, where gold had just been discovered. The intense rivalries were driven by the declining economic situation in Fairbanks, as the initial gold findings <b>that</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>the</b> Fairbanks Gold Rush began to wane.|$|E

5|$|The Castillonnais {{probably}} descends {{from the}} horses <b>that</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>the</b> Magdalenian-era paintings found, for example, at the Cave of Niaux, with Oriental and Iberian blood added later. Originally bred as a multipurpose breed used for cavalry, agriculture and driving, the breed declined in population during the 20th century, and almost became extinct. In 1980, {{a group of}} supporters began to work to save the breed, and a breed association, now called the Association Nationale du Cheval Castillonnais d'Ariège Pyrénées (ANCCAP), was formed in 1992. The breed was officially recognized by the French Ministry of Agriculture in 1996. The French government, breed association and a regional conservation group all now share {{an interest in the}} preservation of the breed. Population numbers are still quite low, and inbreeding is a concern.|$|E
