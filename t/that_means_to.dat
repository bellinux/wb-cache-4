500|$|In {{addition}} to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually {{paid tribute to}} the film Apocalypse Now, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan [...] "Primus sucks": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, [...] "they finger us back—and you know what <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> us—that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good. Les Claypool came out {{the first night of}} the tour and got a big kick out of it. We figured it was the right idea. It makes hecklers go 'huh.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the song}} is {{performed}} live, the crowd will usually shout 'Megadeth, Megadeth, aguante Megadeth!' in between each of the opening riffs. This chorus began in Argentina and quickly spread worldwide. It can be loosely translated as 'Megadeth, Megadeth, go Megadeth'. 'Aguante' is an Argentinian slang term <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> [...] "hold on tight", which represents to stick strongly to something, it's normally used in sports events to give support to the team players. It is also applied to something that [...] "rules" [...] or [...] "rocks". The first time the Argentine crowd chanted this out, heavily influenced by its soccer song singing culture in stadiums, Dave Mustaine was blown out of his mind. This is mainly the reason that Argentina became {{one of his favorite}} countries to play in, as he states in the [...] DVD filmed in Argentina, and also because [...] "it's the only public that will sing out the guitar parts".|$|E
2500|$|Swift previewed {{the track}} on the October 1, 2012 episode of ABC's Good Morning America. The song finds Swift {{playing with the}} idea of colors in {{relation}} to her emotions about a relationship. Before playing the track, Swift explained its meaning: [...] "I wrote this song about the fact that some things are just hard to forget," [...] she said, [...] "because the emotions involved with them were so intense and, to me, intense emotion is red." [...] Swift explained that she decided to name this song as her album title, as its lyrics encompass the entire theme of the project. [...] "Thinking about what <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> me and all the different emotions that are written about on this album – they're all pretty much about the sexy, crazy, insane, intense, semi-toxic relationships that I've experienced in the last two years," [...] I noted. [...] "All those emotions – spanning from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion – in my mind, all those emotions are red. There's nothing in between; there is nothing beige about any of those feelings." ...|$|E

2500|$|Continuing on {{the idea}} from the {{previous}} Marvel Netflix series that New York City is a [...] "fifth Defender", Loeb said the series would examine the high-end financial world of New York City, examining [...] "the One Percent of the One Percent and how that affects our world on a day-to-day basis... high-level corporation, Big Pharma, things like that". Jones added the series examined [...] "corporate corruption and corporate responsibility in the modern world, and... ow much do corporations have impact on society? And what we actually look at in the show is the heroin epidemic of the city, and how corporations maybe actually fund the heroin epidemic, and what <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> society". In terms of Rand donning a comic-based costume in the season, Buck stated, [...] "There was no good reason we could imagine to put Danny Rand in a costume. Because Danny Rand is still discovering who he is as a hero and where {{he is going to}} be, so he’s not yet ready to put on a mask or a costume. t the same time he is someone who is rather well known as a billionaire, so he can’t necessarily go out in public and do the things he does without being recognized. It does become an issue for the character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Typically, a bolt is {{tensioned}} (preloaded) by {{the application}} of a torque to either the bolt head or the nut. The applied torque causes the bolt to [...] "climb" [...] the thread causing a tensioning of the bolt and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by the bolt. The preload developed in a bolt is due to the applied torque and {{is a function of the}} bolt diameter, the geometry of the threads, and the coefficients of friction that exist in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut. The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness of the bolt and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of the bolt when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.|$|E
2500|$|During the Middle Ages spathula {{was used}} to refer to the {{shoulder}} blade. Spathula is a diminutive of spatha, with the latter originally meaning broad, two-edged sword without a point, broad, flat, wooden instrument for stirring any liquid, a spattle, spatula [...] or spathe of the palm tree [...] and its diminutive used in classical and late Latin for referring to a leg of pork [...] or a little palmbranch. The English word spatula is actually derived from Latin spatula, an orthographic variant of spathula. Oddly enough, classical Latin non-diminutive spatha can be translated as English spatula, while its Latin diminutive spatula is not translated as English spatula. Latin spatha is derived from ancient Greek σπάθη. Therefore, the form spathula is more akin to its origin than spatula. Ancient Greek σπάθη has a similar meaning as Latin spatha, as any broad blade, and can also refer to a spatula or to the broad blade of a sword., but also to the blade of an oar. The aforementioned πλάται for shoulder blades was also used for blades of an oar. Concordantly σπάθη was also {{used to refer to}} the shoulder blade. Interestingly, the English word spade, as well as the Dutch equivalent spade [...] is cognate with σπάθη. Please notice, that the aforementioned term pala as applied by Roman physician Caelius Aurelianus, also means spade. Pala is probably related to the Latin verb pandere, to spread out, [...] and to extend. This verb is thought to be derived from an earlier form spandere, with the root spa-. Σπάθη is actually derived from the similar root spē(i), <b>that</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> extend. It seems that os latum scapularum, ὠμοπλάτη, πλάται, pala, spathula and σπάθη all refer to the same aspect of the shoulder blade, i.e. being a flat, broad blade, with the latter three words etymological related to each other.|$|E
