In this paper, we study {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>awareness</b> capability <b>of</b> system and network parameters, such as latency, jitter, and data loss rate; also, according to the features and preferences <b>of</b> user <b>awareness,</b> a network-statusbased solution is proposed for self-adaptable <b>awareness</b> scheduling. Moreover, <b>the</b> scheduling algorithm is implemented and verified by a prototype system, results from which indicate that awareness scheduling is useful for decreasing <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>awareness</b> capability <b>of</b> system in a limited or unstable network. ...|$|R
