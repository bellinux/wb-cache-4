Estonia, Finland and Germany also broadcast the inaugural contest in 2003, followed by Andorra in 2006 and Bosnia and Herzegovina (in 2006, 2008 and 2009), however <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> yet to participate. Since 2006, the contest has been streamed live on the Internet through the official website of the contest. Australia was invited to sing at the 2015 contest and has participated every year since.|$|E

50|$|While {{the growth}} in sales of {{processed}} foods in <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> <b>has</b> been much more rapid than {{the growth in}} fresh food sales, the imperative nature of supermarkets to achieve economies of scale in purchasing, means that the expansion of supermarkets in <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> <b>has</b> important repercussions for small farmers, particularly those growing perishable crops. New supply chains have developed involving cluster formation; development of specialized wholesalers; leading farmers organizing supply; and farmer associations or cooperatives. In some cases supermarkets have organized their own procurement from small farmers; in others wholesale markets have adapted to meet supermarket needs.|$|R

25|$|Modern {{national}} boundaries are thus remarkably invariable, though {{the stability of}} the nation states has not followed in suit. African states are plagued by internal issues such as inability to effectively collect taxes and weak national identities. Lacking any external threats to their sovereignty, <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> failed to consolidate power, leading to weak or failed states.|$|E

25|$|European {{immigration}} in Argentina {{has not stopped}} since this wave from Eastern Europe. According to the National Bureau of Migrations, some 14,964 Europeans have settled in Argentina (3,599 Spaniards, 1,407 Italians and 9,958 from other countries) during the period 1999–2004. To this figure, many of the 8,285 Americans and 4,453 Uruguayans may be added, since <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> European-descended majorities of 75% and 87% in their populations.|$|E
25|$|Pap smears {{have not}} been as {{effective}} in developing countries. This is in part because many of <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> an impoverished health care infrastructure, too few trained and skilled professionals to obtain and interepret Pap smears, uninformed women who get lost to follow-up, and a lengthy turn-around time to get results. These realities {{have resulted in the}} investigation of cervical screening approaches that use fewer resources and offer rapid results such as visual inspection with acetic acid or HPV DNA testing.|$|E
25|$|Compared to general-service {{incandescent}} lamps giving {{the same amount}} of visible light, CFLs use one-fifth to one-third the electric power, and last eight to fifteen times longer. A CFL has a higher purchase price than an incandescent lamp, but can save over five times its purchase price in electricity costs over the lamp's lifetime. Like all fluorescent lamps, CFLs contain toxic mercury which complicates their disposal. In many countries, governments have banned the disposal of CFLs together with regular garbage. <b>These</b> <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> established special collection systems for CFLs and other hazardous waste.|$|E
2500|$|Aware that <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> <b>had</b> {{been pushed}} toward {{socialism}} through invasion {{rather than by}} proletarian revolution, Stalin referred to them not as [...] "dictatorships of the proletariat" [...] but as [...] "people's democracies", suggesting that in <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> there was a pro-socialist alliance combining the proletariat, peasantry, and lower middle-class.|$|R

25|$|Lynn and Harvey {{have argued}} that the causes of the above are {{difficult}} to interpret since <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as {{there is a limit to}} how much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between fertility and intelligence although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two. They estimate that there has been a dysgenic decline in the world's genotypic IQ (masked by the Flynn effect for the phenotype) of 0.86 IQ points per decade for the years 1950–2000.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the people}} in <b>these</b> <b>{{countries}}</b> <b>have</b> become educated enough and they realize {{their place in the}} world economy, they can also demand help from the core countries. Although unlikely, {{due to the fact that}} the core countries rely on the exploitation of the periphery, there have been pushes for core countries to help better the periphery countries. Some of the ideas suggested are to help aid the periphery countries in developing by exploiting them less, help the periphery countries lose some of their debt and raise the prices on goods coming from these countries to allow them to be more profitable. These policies are obviously not beneficial to the core countries and is mostly why they have never been adapted successfully but this is another way in which the periphery could rise to a higher status.|$|E
25|$|After the {{establishment}} of the State of Israel in 1948, Israel was subjected to Arab League boycotts and attempts to diplomatically isolate the state. Today, Israel has diplomatic ties with 157 out of the other 192 member states of the United Nations as well as with non-member Holy See (Vatican City) and the European Union. Some states recognize Israel as a state, but have no diplomatic relations. Several countries once had diplomatic relations with Israel, but have since broken or suspended them (Bolivia, Cuba, and Venezuela in Latin America; Mauritania in the Arab League; Chad, Mali and Niger in non-Arab Africa; and Iran until the Islamic revolution). Some of <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> since resumed relations. In addition, a number of countries (all members of the Arab League) that at one time had formal economic ties (primarily trade offices) with Israel that fell short of full diplomatic relations, have severed such ties (Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Qatar and Tunisia).|$|E

50|$|Some Muslim countries, {{including}} Somalia, Indonesia and Malaysia, {{were never}} {{subject to the}} authority of a Caliphate , with the exception of Aceh, which briefly acknowledged Ottoman suzerainty.

25|$|The most {{significant}} immediate {{threat to the}} existence of wild tiger populations is the illegal trade in poached skins and body parts between India, Nepal and China. The governments of <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> failed to implement adequate enforcement response, and wildlife crime remained a low priority in terms of political commitment and investment for years. There are well-organised gangs of professional poachers, who move from place to place and set up camp in vulnerable areas. Skins are rough-cured in the field and handed over to dealers, who send them for further treatment to Indian tanning centres. Buyers choose the skins from dealers or tanneries and smuggle them through a complex interlinking network to markets outside India, mainly in China. Other factors contributing to their loss are urbanization and revenge killing. Farmers blame tigers for killing cattle and shoot them. Their skins and body parts may however {{become a part of the}} illegal trade. In Bangladesh, tigers are killed by professional poachers, local hunters, trappers, pirates and villagers. Each group of people has different motives for killing tigers, ranging from profit, excitement to safety concerns. All groups have access to the commercial trade in body parts.|$|E
500|$|However, the FIVB's mandating of the bikini {{ran into}} problems. Some sports {{officials}} consider it exploitative and impractical in colder weather. It also drew {{the ire of}} some athletes. At the 2006 Asian Games at Doha, Qatar, only one Muslim country– Iraq– fielded a team in the beach volleyball competition because of concerns that the uniform was inappropriate. They refused to wear bikinis. The weather during the evening games in 2012 London Olympics was so cold that the players sometimes had to wear shirts and leggings. Earlier in 2012, FIVB had announced it would allow shorts (maximum length [...] above the knee) and sleeved tops at the games. Richard Baker, the federation spokesperson, said that [...] "many of <b>these</b> <b>countries</b> <b>have</b> religious and cultural requirements so the uniform needed to be more flexible".|$|E
