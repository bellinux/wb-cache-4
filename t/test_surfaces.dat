The third variation has the subject sitting, with an operator raising and lowering the carriage to which the leg is attached. The <b>test</b> <b>surface</b> was fixed at a given angle, a set of repeated tests was run, {{and the number of}} tests and slips were recorded. The test-surface angle was incremented through a range that varied from no slips to all slips. We analyzed the data using logistic regression.

In this study, an open loop spray cooling system has been fabricated to provide an upward-facing spray over a 12 mm diameter <b>test</b> <b>surface.</b> A full cone spray nozzle was used to deliver deionized water to the <b>test</b> <b>surface</b> at five pressures (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 psi), and at three different distances to the <b>test</b> <b>surface</b> (3, 7 and 12 mm). The volumetric flow rate at the surface used in the experiments depended on both the pressures and the distances. For a distance of 3 mm and 7 mm, the volumetric flow rate range from 336. 6 to 627 ml/min while for 12 mm, the range was from 336. 6 to 484. 28 ml/min.

The cavity preparations were performed in children be-tween 4 and 17 years of age. They were all filled with amalgam. Information about operative treatment and exfoliation or extrac-tion of the preparation teeth and the adjacent teeth during the following seven years was obtained from the patients ' records. Stereomicroscopic examination of the models revealed prepa-ration damage on 64 % of the unfilled approximal surfaces in primary teeth and on 69 % of the corresponding <b>test</b> <b>surfaces</b> in permanent teeth.
