5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} 150years, other expeditions, explorers, and {{scientists}} would piece together what happened next. Franklin's men wintered in 1845–46 on Beechey Island, where three crew members died and were buried. Terror and Erebus became trapped in ice off King William Island in September 1846 and never sailed again. According to a note dated 25 April 1848, and {{left on the}} island by Fitzjames and Crozier, Franklin had died on 11 June 1847; the crew had wintered on King William Island in 1846–47 and 1847–48, and the remaining crew had planned to begin walking on 26 April 1848 <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> River on the Canadian mainland. Nine officers and fifteen men had already died; the rest would die along the way, most {{on the island and}} another 30 or 40 on the northern coast of the mainland, hundreds of miles from the nearest outpost of Western civilization.|$|E
5|$|While rival teams Lotus and McLaren {{relied on}} the Cosworth DFV engine from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, Ecclestone sought a {{competitive}} advantage by investigating other options. Despite the success of Murray's Cosworth-powered cars, Ecclestone signed a deal with Italian motor manufacturer Alfa Romeo to use their large and powerful flat-12 engine from the 1976 season. The engines were free, but they rendered the new BT45s, now in red Martini Racing livery, unreliable and overweight. The 1976 and 1977 seasons saw Brabham fall <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the field again. Reutemann negotiated a release from his contract {{before the end of}} the 1976 season and signed with Ferrari. Ulsterman John Watson replaced him at Brabham for 1977. Watson lost near certain victory in the French Grand Prix (Dijon) of that year when his car ran low on fuel on the last lap and was passed by Mario Andretti's Lotus, with Watson's second place being the team's best result of the season. The car often showed at the head of races, but the unreliability of the Alfa Romeo engine was a major problem. The team lost Pace early in the 1977 season when he died in a light aircraft accident.|$|E

25|$|When the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, {{and stay}} {{toward the front}} of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The {{acceleration}} is less toward the front than <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (Fsinθ) and the vertical force (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain more speed, and lean on back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.|$|E
25|$|Hybodonts are {{characterized}} by having two dorsal fins each preceded by a fin spine with a specific shape. The fin spines shape is used to distinguish hybodonts from other shark groups and different hybodont species. The fin spines are elongate and gently curved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the animal. Male hybodonts had small spines across their heads. Hybodonts had thick, massive jaws that vary between different genera according to diet and teeth. Hybodonts had paired fins for steering and a fully heterocercal, or uneven tail, with the dorsal fin extending further than the ventral tail fin.|$|E

25|$|She {{was dressed}} for {{traveling}} and for cold weather. Her hood {{was large and}} round and red but not smooth, — it was corrugated; that is to say, it consisted {{of a series of}} rolls nearly as large as my arm, passing over her head sidewise, growing smaller <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> until they terminated in a big button that was embellished with a knot of green ribbon. Its general appearance was not unlike that of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally. The broad, white ruffle of her lace cap projected several inches beyond the front of the hood and waved back and forth like the single leaves of a great white poppy, as she nodded emphatically in her discourse.|$|E
25|$|Cap {{formation}} {{is now seen as}} {{closely related to}} the carbon particle experiments of Abercrombie. In this case, crawling fibroblasts were held in a medium containing small (~1 micrometre in size) carbon particles. On occasion, these particles attached to the front leading edge of these cells: When they did so, the particles were observed to move rearward on the cell’s dorsal surface. They did so in a roughly straight line, with the particle remaining initially stationary with respect to the substratum. The cell seemed to ooze forward under the particle. In view of what we know of capping, this phenomenon is now interpreted as follows: The particle is presumably stuck to many surface molecules, crosslinking them and forming a patch. As in capping, the particle moves <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the cell.|$|E
25|$|When San Francisco took {{possession}} with 4:54 left {{in regulation}} play, Dallas led 27–21; the drive began on San Francisco's 11-yard line. Behind six successful Montana completions and four running plays, San Francisco moved {{the ball to}} the Dallas 13-yard line. After one unsuccessful pass and then a seven-yard gain, San Francisco faced third down from the Dallas 6-yard line. Montana took the snap and ran to his right. He then made an off-balance pass <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the end zone, and San Francisco wide receiver Dwight Clark made a leaping catch for the game-tying touchdown. With just 51 seconds left on the game clock, Wersching kicked the extra point and San Francisco won the game 28–27. The reception by Clark was coined simply The Catch, and it put San Francisco into Super Bowl XVI.|$|E

25|$|Universal Studios Hollywood's back lot {{has been}} damaged by fire nine times {{throughout}} its history. The first was in 1932 when embers from a nearby brush fire were blown <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> lot causing four movie sets to be destroyed and resulting in over $100,000 damage. Seventeen years later, in 1949, another brush fire caused the complete destruction of one building and damage to two others. In 1957, the New York street film studio set was destroyed by an arson fire causing {{half a million dollars}} in damage. Ten years later, in 1967, twice as much damage was done when the Little Europe area and part of Spartacus Square was destroyed. It also destroyed the European, Denver and Laramie street sets. In 1987, the remaining portion of Spartacus Square was destroyed along with street sets and other buildings. As with the 1957 fire, this was suspected {{to be the result of}} an arsonist. Just three years later, another deliberate fire was started in the back lot. The New York Street set, the Ben Hur set and the majority of Courthouse Square were destroyed. In 1997, the seventh fire occurred at the back lot. A portion of the Courthouse Square was again destroyed, though most survived.|$|E

500|$|According to the Financial Times, the bandshell's {{acoustics}} are unparalleled {{compared to}} any contemporary outdoor venue. Critics say that musicians have lauded the onstage acoustics. Another Financial Times critic noted that Gehry revisited {{some of his}} past design motifs, such as his use of stainless steel, and explored new ones such as the trellis and sound system. This sentiment was echoed by others. [...] During the opening concert von Rhein noted that the sound is not of uniform quality throughout the venue and opined that the optimal sonics are <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the seated area and front of the lawn.

Each dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw) had between 14 and 17 teeth, with an average count of 16. The teeth became shorter, narrower, and more curved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the skull. All of the teeth had saw-like edges.
