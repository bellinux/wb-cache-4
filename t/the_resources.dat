Procurement of local raw materials would have been a simple task to accomplish, yet MSA sites regularly contain raw materials that were obtained from sources over 100 km away, and sometimes farther than 300 km.

50|$|The {{economic}} rent obtained is an abnormal rent, {{often referred to}} as resource rent, since it generates from a situation where <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> owner has open access to <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> for free.
