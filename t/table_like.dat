5|$|Ruthenium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ru and atomic number 44. It {{is a rare}} transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic <b>table.</b> <b>Like</b> the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals. The Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after his homeland, Ruthenia. Ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores; the annual production is about 20 tonnes. Most ruthenium produced is used in wear-resistant electrical contacts and thick-film resistors. A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as a chemistry catalyst.|$|E

Special utility breeds with desirable characteristics are used. Two eggs are laid and incubated for about 17 days. When they hatch, the squabs are fed by both parents on [...] "pigeon's milk", a thick secretion high in protein produced by the crop. Squabs grow rapidly, but are slow to fledge and are ready to leave the nest at 26 to 30 days weighing about [...] By this time, the adult pigeons will have laid and be incubating another pair of eggs and a prolific pair should produce two squabs every four weeks during a [...] breeding season lasting several months.|$|E

500|$|Overall, {{the episode}} was {{received}} well by critics. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger thought that [...] "The Damage a Man Can Do" [...] had [...] "some major foundational problems", {{but he said}} that both Michael C. Hall and Jimmy Smits' performances were [...] "wonderful". Paste magazine's Jeffrey Bloomer likened the episode simply to pulp and felt that Dexter's voice overs lacked their usual [...] "dry, dark humor and gonzo wisdom". IGN critic Matt Fowler believed that Dexter and Miguel's conversations contained [...] "traces of overly awkward dialogue all over" [...] and that the pairings of Debra and Quinn, and LaGuerta and Ellen were [...] "forced" [...] while Miguel's desire to kill seemed [...] "unnatural". Writing for TV Guide, Paula Paige said that her favorite part of the episode was Dexter's spinning Fleeter on the <b>table</b> <b>like</b> a roulette wheel and also she enjoyed Rita's storyline, calling her a [...] "hormonal hoot". TV Squad's Debra McDuffee thought that Angel and Barbara's romance was [...] "painfully awkward" [...] to watch and Rita's storyline was [...] "lame and stereotypical". The A.V. Club's Scott Tobias believed the episode to be [...] "awesome" [...] and said that he was [...] "more anxious than usual to see what Dexter was up to, and equally anxious {{to get away from the}} peripheral dramas". BuddyTV critic John Kubicek named [...] "The Damage a Man Can Do" [...] the sixty-fourth best television episode of 2008.|$|E

2500|$|The next year, Palin ran for Governor on a [...] "build-the-bridge" [...] platform, {{arguing that}} it was {{essential}} for local prosperity. She said in August 2006: [...] "We need {{to come to the}} defense of Southeast Alaska when proposals are on the <b>table</b> <b>like</b> the bridge, and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something that’s so negative."

2500|$|Moving {{into the}} 17th century, {{unsweetened}} or honey-sweetened waffles and oublies – often made of non-wheat grains – were the type generally {{accessible to the}} average citizen. The wheat-based and particularly the sugar-sweetened varieties, while present throughout Europe, were prohibitively expensive {{for all but the}} monarchy and bourgeoisie. Even for the Dutch, who controlled much of the mid-century sugar trade, a kilogram of sugar was worth ½ an ounce of silver (the equivalent of ~$7 for a 5lb. bag, 01/2016 spot silver prices), while, elsewhere in Europe, it fetched twice the price of opium.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] in [...] "A Transatlantic Interview - 1946", Stein insisted that this work was completely [...] "realistic" [...] {{in the tradition of}} Gustave Flaubert, stating the following: [...] "I used to take objects on a <b>table,</b> <b>like</b> a tumbler or any kind of object and try to get the picture of it clear and separate in my mind and create a word relationship between the word and the things seen." [...] Commentators have indicated that what she meant was that the reference of objects remained central to her work, although the representation of them had not. Scholar Marjorie Perloff had said of Stein that [...] "nlike her contemporaries (Eliot, Pound, Moore), she does not give us an image, however fractured, of a carafe on a table; rather, she forces us to reconsider how language actually constructs the world we know." ...|$|E

2500|$|Similar {{charges have}} been {{reported}} in previous years. In 1987, the BBC Panorama program Scientology: The Road to Total Freedom? featured an interview with former member Don Larson, who described Miscavige's physical violence towards a staff member. In a 1995 interview for ITV, Stacy Young, Miscavige's former secretary and the ex-wife of Hubbard's former public relations spokesman, Robert Vaughn Young, had previously asserted that Miscavige emotionally tormented staff members on a regular basis. [...] "His viciousness and his cruelty to staff was unlike anything that I had ever experienced in my life," [...] she said. [...] "He just loved to degrade the staff." [...] In an incident also witnessed and supported by Amy Scobee, Jeff Hawkins, a former marketing guru for Scientology, claimed to have attended a meeting where Miscavige [...] "jumped up on the conference room <b>table,</b> <b>like</b> with his feet right on the conference room table, launched himself across the table at me—I was standing—battered my face, and then shoved me down on the floor". Church executive David Bloomberg confirmed that there was a physical confrontation during the meeting but stated that it was Hawkins who became belligerent and attacked Miscavige. In the confrontation Hawkins fell out of his chair and ended up putting a scissor lock on Miscavige's legs. Bloomberg stated [...] "Mr. Miscavige did not touch Jeff Hawkins." ...|$|E
