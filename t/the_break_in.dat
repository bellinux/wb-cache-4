5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high in the ship. There were three deckhouses abaft <b>the</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E
40|$|This study {{estimates}} <b>the</b> <b>break</b> point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{residual variance}} {{and in the}} propagation mechanism of the real exchange rates at {{about the time of}} the Asian crisis that occurred in 1997, and provides some explanations for <b>the</b> <b>breaks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> residual variance increased the volatility of the real exchange rates, which given the overall effects of common adverse shocks to the countries seems to be reinforced by the sudden withdrawal of Japanese commercial banks' lending to the region. And <b>the</b> subsequent <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> propagation mechanism reduced the volatility, which reflects the change in the government policy stance to result in smoothing the pace of appreciation. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nominal exchange rates rather than in the price ratios are mainly responsible for <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real exchange rates...|$|R
40|$|Solutions, in {{the form}} H/r, of the {{homogeneous}} linear partial differential equation of the second order with constant coefficients are used as generalized potential functions. With the aid of generalized Green 2 ̆ 7 s theorems and the methods developed by Erhardt Schmidt, {{it is possible to}} obtain <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> derivatives of the generalized potentials due to a volume, simple surface and double surface distribution;When the functions involved satisfy certain differetiability and continuity conditions, it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> (n + 1) st order derivatives of these generalized potentials are given by recursion. For example, <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> (n + 1) st order derivatives of the generalized volume potential are obtained from <b>the</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nth order derivatives of potential due to a volume and simple surface distribution.

5|$|Duke is {{the tenth}} studio album by English rock band Genesis, {{released}} in March 1980 on Charisma Records. The album followed {{a period of}} inactivity for the band in early 1979. Phil Collins moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, {{in an effort to}} salvage his failing first marriage, while Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford recorded solo albums. Collins returned to the UK after his marriage ended and wrote a significant amount of material, some of which was used for Duke and some was later reworked for his first solo album, Face Value. Duke contained a mix of individually-written songs and tracks that evolved from jam sessions in mid-1979, while recording took place {{at the end of the}} year. <b>The</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> activity rejuvenated the band, and they found the album an easy one to work on.|$|E

She was rewarded with selection in and captaincy of the national Under-19 team during the season and played in two matches against England Under-19s, scoring 13 and 35 as Australia won both matches. At the end of the season, she was selected to lead an Australian Under-23 team to play against the senior England team. Poulton made 15 in her only innings.|$|E

5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form on {{the side}} of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving north and northeast into the main belt of the Westerlies. When the subtropical ridge shifts due to El Niño, so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September–November tropical cyclone impacts during El Niño and neutral years. During El Niño years, <b>the</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130°E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago. During La Niña years, the formation of tropical cyclones, and the subtropical ridge position, shift westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat to China and greater intensity to Philippines. Those that form near the Marshall Islands find their way to Jeju Island, Korea.|$|E
5|$|At 12:00, Dornal de Guy on Manche {{pulled away}} from her {{battered}} opponent, obeying Hamelin's order to join with his flagship. Hamelin then sent Manche and Créole after the slow Charlton and United Kingdom, using Vénus to chase Windham. Stewart had used <b>the</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the action to effect rudimentary repairs to his battered ship and, with the agreement of his officers, determined to abandon the other ships and escape alone. Manche and the corvette rapidly overhauled and captured Charlton and United Kingdom, their captains Charles Mortlock and William D'Esterre making no serious attempt to resist or escape. Vénus however became embroiled in a lengthy chase as Stewart threw all not essential stores overboard {{in an effort to}} make his ship lighter and faster. For five days, Windham led Vénus in pursuit across the Bay of Bengal and it was not until 10:30 on 22 November that Hamelin finally closed with the British ship and forced her surrender.|$|E

With six minutes left in normal time, United won a corner on the left hand side, which Ronaldo played short to Scholes. Scholes returned the ball to Ronaldo, who crossed it into the penalty area, where Keane was unmarked at the back post. The ball eventually broke to the United captain, who shot, only to see four Arsenal players between him and the goal, ready to block his effort behind for another corner. Lehmann came to meet the second corner kick, but missed the ball, allowing it {{to go all the way}} through to Van Nistelrooy; the Dutchman headed the ball goalwards, but Ljungberg was on the line and headed it up onto the crossbar and away.|$|E
5|$|The {{city itself}} is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, {{the city is}} said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but {{typically}} include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Delridge, Mount Baker, Seward Park, Washington Park, Broadmoor, Madrona, Phinney Ridge, Sunset Hill, Blue Ridge, Broadview, Laurelhurst, Hawthorne Hills, Maple Leaf, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are all located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington. <b>The</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result {{of two of the}} many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) {{at the mouth of the}} city's industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant, Maple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt. Baker Ridge, and Highlands/Carkeek/Bitterlake.|$|E
