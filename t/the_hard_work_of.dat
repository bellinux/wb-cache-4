25|$|Frequency {{analysis}} {{requires only}} {{a basic understanding}} of the statistics of the plaintext language and some problem solving skills, and, if performed by hand, tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping. During World War II (WWII), both the British and the Americans recruited codebreakers by placing crossword puzzles in major newspapers and running contests for who could solve them the fastest. Several of the ciphers used by the Axis powers were breakable using frequency analysis, for example, some of the consular ciphers used by the Japanese. Mechanical methods of letter counting and statistical analysis (generally IBM card type machinery) were first used in World War II, possibly by the US Army's SIS. Today, <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> letter counting and analysis has been replaced by computer software, which can carry out such analysis in seconds. With modern computing power, classical ciphers are unlikely to provide any real protection for confidential data.|$|E
25|$|At the 1895 {{elections}} it {{was clear}} that there were divisions as to what issue the Liberals were fighting for. The effect of Harcourt's aborted Local Veto Bill, which would have given parishes the right to vote on the closure of all local public houses, on the election was seen not only in his defeat at Derby, which gave the signal for the Liberal rout, but in the set-back it gave to temperance legislation. Though returned for West Monmouthshire (1895, 1900), Harcourt's speeches in debate only occasionally showed his characteristic spirit, and it was evident that for <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> opposition he no longer had the same motivation as of old. In October 1896 Gladstone, in his last public speech, called for action to support the Armenians who were being massacred by their Ottoman rulers. Harcourt backed Gladstone but Rosebery used the incident as an excuse to resign as Leader of the Opposition and Harcourt became an unenthusiastic leader.|$|E

The ideal would be prose so {{transparent}} that readers wouldn't even be aware of my fingers at <b>the</b> keyboard. <b>The</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> writing, I find, is concealing how much effort it takes, and beating down the urge to show off." ...|$|R

By May 1944, British participation in convoy escorts was withdrawn entirely, and Canada was left with sole responsibility until September 1944.

The farm also included a full vegetable garden which extended from the lawn of Alumni Hall to the current parking lot located between Joan of Arc Hall and Davison Hall. Due to <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the monks and several lay members from the local community, the college was agriculturally independent of the local community. Fr. Bonaventure Ostendarp, O. S. B. founded the Studio of Christian Art in 1893 in order to sell paintings to local Catholic churches throughout the region. The current Raphael House of the Courts dorms was the original art studio for the monks, built in 1895.|$|E
500|$|After the Court {{released}} its opinion, many commentators suggested that Navarette represented a significant {{expansion of the}} police's power to stop drivers on the road. Lyle Denniston, for example, remarked that the Court's opinion [...] "gave police broad new authority." [...] In its review of cases from the 2013 term, the Harvard Law Review suggested that [...] "Navarette may add to the police's already expansive power," [...] and that the case [...] "heralds unwarranted curtailment of Fourth Amendment protections." [...] Other commentators remarked that the case [...] "seemed to lower the bar for assessments of anonymous tipsters." [...] Paul Kleven, attorney for Lorenzo and Jose Prado Navarette, said that the ruling [...] "makes it easier for anonymous tipsters to call in and sic police on people they don't like," [...] while {{a spokesperson for the}} California Attorney General's office said [...] "e are pleased with the court's ruling, which supports <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> law enforcement." ...|$|E
500|$|The khagan then {{ordered his}} men to fill the moat with green wood, {{so that it would}} not burn, which the {{garrison}} countered by throwing in dry wood as well. After six days, when the moat was full, the Arabs set it afire; aided by a strong wind, <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the Turgesh was put to nought. The Arab archers also proved effective, exacting a heavy toll among the Turgesh, including Bazaghari. The Turgesh then executed a hundred Arab captives {{in full view of the}} garrison. In response, the Arabs killed the 200 young locals they held as hostages, despite their desperate resistance. The narrative of the siege in al-Tabari, evidently drawing from eyewitness accounts, continues with isolated episodes: the determined Turgesh assault on the gate, with five of them managing to climb the wall before being repelled, the Soghdian prince of al-Taraband who with his companions assaulted a breach in the wall which led into a house only to be killed by the house's elderly and sick owner and his family, how the Arabs used the wooden boards lining the irrigation ditches to improve their earthworks, or the time when the khagan, coming to inspect the Arab fortifications, received an arrow-shot in the face but was saved by his helmet's nose-guard.|$|E
60|$|Mr Crosbie and {{his wife}} went upon their honeymoon tour to Folkestone {{in the middle of}} February, and {{returned}} to London about the end of March. Nothing of special moment to the interests of our story occurred during those six weeks, unless the proceedings of the young married couple by the sea-side may be thought to have any special interest. With regard to those proceedings I can only say that Crosbie was very glad when they were brought to a close. All holiday-making is <b>hard</b> <b>work,</b> but holiday-making with nothing to do is <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> all.

500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
500|$|Many scholars, {{including}} Lonsdale, {{believe that}} the poem's message is too universal to require a specific event or place for inspiration, but Gray's letters suggest that there were historical influences in its composition. In particular, {{it is possible that}} Gray was interested in debates over the treatment of the poor, and that he supported the political structure of his day, which was to support the poor who worked but look down on those that refused to. However, Gray's message is incomplete, because he ignored the poor's past rebellions and struggles. The poem ignores politics to focus on various comparisons between a rural and urban life in a psychological manner. The argument between living a rural life or urban life lets Gray discuss questions that answer how he should live his own life, but the conclusion of the poem does not resolve the debate as the narrator is able to recreate himself in a manner that reconciles both types of life while arguing that poetry is capable of preserving those who have died. It is probable that Gray wanted to promote <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the poor but to do nothing to change their social position. Instead of making claims of economic injustice, Gray accommodates differing political views. This is furthered by the ambiguity in many of the poem's lines, including the statement [...] "Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood" [...] that could be read either as Oliver Cromwell being guiltless for violence during the English Civil War or merely as villagers being compared to the guilty Cromwell. The poem's primary message is to promote the idea of [...] "Englishness", and the pastoral English countryside. The earlier version lacks many of the later version's English aspects, especially as Gray replaced many classical figures with English ones: Cato the Younger by Hampden, Tully by Milton, and Julius Caesar by Cromwell.|$|E
500|$|Marjorie Baumgarten of Austin Chronicle {{referred}} to the film as being [...] "neither a true concert film nor a strict behind-the-scenes documentary, This Is It is, like Jackson himself, a real hybrid" [...] and felt that while the film's [...] "made up of lots of grainy footage, which Ortega has edited together seamlessly" [...] it will also [...] "provide a fitting farewell." [...] Baumgarten noted that [...] "the finished film is a fairly complete concert run-through with each song edited" [...] and that while the film will easily show that it was made for a profit, that, the audience will see a [...] "film to be a fitting elegy." [...] Joe Morgenstern, of The Wall Street Journal, felt the film was [...] "expertly packaged—brilliantly packaged," [...] and noted that the film [...] "quite convincingly" [...] had emphasized that Jackson had enough energy to perform, even with his [...] "wraith-thin body". Ann Powers, of Los Angeles Times {{said that while the}} film offers only a few such [...] "insights into Jackson's artistic process, though enough surface to make this a useful document, as well as a beautiful one" [...] that the film is [...] "a piece with Jackson's body of work: dazzling and strange, blurring the line between fantasy and reality." [...] She described Ortega's editing to make the film feel like a real concert film as being [...] "almost too good to believe." [...] Powers praised the film for showing [...] "intimate views" [...] of Jackson, like his [...] "vulnerable moments" [...] during performances and felt the film was made [...] "to honor not just the memory of Jackson but <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> a big cast and crew that never made it to opening night," [...] which she felt mostly is a tribute to the [...] "power of Jackson's body and voice." [...] Powers stated she had felt the film was such [...] "a tragic teaser for the shows that might have been, 'This Is It' hurts. If Jackson had been able to perform as he frequently does during these scenes, he would have accomplished the comeback for which he was so hungry." [...] She noted that Jackson's [...] "total lack of engagement with the cameras adds to the unreal mood" [...] because he was always performing — [...] "but for the imagined masses, not for the filmgoer" [...] and that the film does not [...] "entirely acknowledge that reality, and that's a little odd." ...|$|E
