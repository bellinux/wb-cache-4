Normal <b>tendons</b> with sheaths (wrist and ankle <b>tendons)</b> will appear hyperechoic with a 1 – 2  mm hypoechoic rim of sheath. <b>Tendons</b> without sheaths (Achilles, patellar) are hyperechoic without the hypoechoic encasing [249].|$|R
40|$|<b>Tendons</b> of {{slaughterhouse}} cattle are by-products {{in animal}} processing and contain a substantial proportion of collagen and also elastin. This contribution deals with preparing collagen-type hydrolysates from cattle <b>tendons</b> (long <b>tendons,</b> hind <b>tendons,</b> Achilles <b>tendons,</b> fore <b>tendons)</b> in a 3 - stage process. Factors under investigation are effects of added enzyme and extraction temperature on efficiency of hydrolysis. The character of starting {{raw materials and}} technological conditions in hydrolysate preparation markedly affect hydrolysis efficiency. Lower efficiency of hydrolysis (percentage of starting material converted into hydrolysate), max. 30 %, is achieved when processing long <b>tendons</b> containing a higher elastin proportion. On the contrary, when processing hind, Achilles and fore <b>tendons,</b> conversion nears 100 %, thus evaluating starting raw material to the utmost. Hydrolysates prepared under defined conditions (adequate addition of enzyme and suitably chosen extraction temperature) from these <b>tendons</b> meet strict standards specifying ash content (≤ 2. 0 %) for food or pharmaceutical applications. High efficiency and variability of technological conditions in the processing of cattle <b>tendons</b> enables to prepare high quality products (hydrolysates or gelatines) suitable for food, cosmetics or pharmaceutical applications...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Tendons</b> are [...] cords of {{connective}} tissue attaching muscle to bone, cartilage or other <b>tendons.</b> They {{are a major}} contributor to shock absorption, are necessary for support of the horse’s body, and translate the force generated by muscles into movement. <b>Tendons</b> are classified as flexors (flex a joint) or extensors (extend a joint). However, some <b>tendons</b> will flex multiple joints while extending another (the flexor <b>tendons</b> of the hind limb, for example, will flex the fetlock, pastern, and coffin joint, but extend the hock joint). In this case, the <b>tendons</b> (and associated muscles) are named for their most distal action (digital flexion).|$|R

5|$|There are two {{apparatus}} in {{the limbs}} {{of the horse}} - the suspensory apparatus and the stay apparatus. The fetlock joint is supported by group of lower leg ligaments, tendons and bones known as the suspensory apparatus. This apparatus carries much {{of the weight of}} the horse, both when standing and while moving, and prevents the fetlock joint from hyperextending, especially when the joint is bearing weight. During movement, the apparatus stores and releases energy {{in the manner of a}} spring: stretching while the joint is extended and contracting (and thus releasing energy) when the joint flexes. This provides a rebound effect, assisting the foot in leaving the ground. This ability to use stored energy makes horses' gaits more efficient than other large animals, including cattle. The suspensory apparatus consists of the suspensory ligament, the check ligament, the deep digital flexor <b>tendon,</b> the superficial flexor <b>tendon,</b> the common digital extensor <b>tendon</b> and the sesamoid bones.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{prevalence}} of left ventricular false <b>tendons,</b> premature ventricular complexes and their coexistence was evaluated prospectively in 187 healthy company workers aged 21 to 50 (mean 36) years. False <b>tendons</b> were demonstrated echocardiographically in 133 (71 %). Eight subjects were {{withdrawn from the}} study because of silent mitral valve prolapse. In these 179 healthy subjects, false <b>tendons</b> were detected in 127 (71 %) and premature ventricular complexes in 48 (27 %). Their coexistence was observed in 40, which showed a significant correlation (p < 0. 05) of false <b>tendons</b> and premature ventricular complexes. In seven of the eight subjects without false <b>tendons,</b> premature ventricular complexes were uniform and infrequent (mean 3 beats/ 24 h). In the 40 subjects with false <b>tendons,</b> premature ventricular complexes were uniform in 29, multiform in 6 and repetitive in 5, and the mean frequency was 96 beats/ 24 h. Correlation of premature ventricular complexes {{with the type of}} false <b>tendons</b> showed that premature ventricular complexes were significantly associated with thick (≥ 2 mm) and longitudinal <b>tendons</b> (p < 0. 005). Although it is not certain that left ventricular false <b>tendons</b> are arrhythmogenic, the {{prevalence of}} the coexistence of left ventricular false <b>tendons</b> and premature ventricular complexes in the general population, and the special relation between the frequency and the form of premature ventricular complexes and the type of false <b>tendons,</b> suggests that false <b>tendons</b> may play an etiologic role in the genesis of premature ventricular complexes in apparently healthy subjects...|$|R
40|$|To {{calculate}} the flexural strength of externally prestressed concrete beams, the ultimate stress in external <b>tendons</b> must be known firstly. The {{relationship between the}} ratios of the equivalent plastic hinge length to the neutral axis depth is established for prestressed concrete beams with external FRP <b>tendons</b> and steel <b>tendons.</b> Based on different investigators' test data, {{the ratio of the}} equivalent plastic hinge length to the neutral axis depth is analyzed for prestressed concrete beams with external FRP <b>tendons.</b> It is found the ratio for prestressed concrete beams with external FRP <b>tendons</b> is stable and can still be treated as a constant, but this constant {{is not the same as}} that previously found for prestressed concrete beams with external steel <b>tendons,</b> and it can be transformed by the suggested relationship equation. Finally, a method is proposed for the determination of ultimate stress in external <b>tendons.</b> It is applicable to simply supported beams as well as continuous beams.

40|$|Abstract. Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP), {{particularly those}} incorporating carbon fiber (CFRP), has high strength, high stiffness-to-weight ratio and high resistance to corrosion, which shows potential {{for use as}} prestressing <b>tendons</b> in corrosive environment. However, concrete beams prestressed with FRP <b>tendons</b> have showed brittle flexural failure due to the elastic rupture of FRP <b>tendons.</b> In order to improve the ductility, a combination of bonded and/or unbonded prestressing <b>tendons</b> was used. Nine prestressed concrete beams were tested up to failure to study the effect of bonded and unbonded FRP <b>tendons</b> on their flexural capacity. Three factors were taken into consideration; the bonding condition of CFRP <b>tendons,</b> the location of CFRP <b>tendons</b> and the prestressing ratio. Also an analytical investigation was carried out to extend some flexural capacity calculation equations to this beam type. The results of the experimental showed that under the same condition, the carrying capacity of concrete beam prestressed with bonded FRP <b>tendons</b> was 20 % {{higher than that of}} internal unbonded prestressed beam, and was 40 % higher than that of external unbonded prestressed beam without deviators. By combination of bonded and unbonded FRP <b>tendons,</b> the ductility of prestressed concrete beams can be improved...|$|R
40|$|The body {{curvature}} {{displayed by}} fishes differs remarkably between species. Some nonmuscular features (e. g., number of vertebrae) {{are known to}} influence axial flexibility, but we have poor knowledge {{of the influence of}} the musculotendinous system (myosepta and muscles). Whereas this system has been described in stiff-bodied fishes, we have little data on flexible fishes. In this study, we present new data on the musculotendinous system of a highly flexible fish and compare them to existing data on rigid fishes. We use microdissections with polarized light microscopy to study the three-dimensional anatomy of myoseptal <b>tendons,</b> histology and immunohistology to study the insertion of muscle fiber types into <b>tendons,</b> and µ-CT scans to study skeletal anatomy. Results are compared with published data from stiff-bodied fishes. We identify four important morphological differences between stiff-bodied fishes and Carapus acus : (1) Carapus bears short <b>tendons</b> in the horizontal septum, whereas rigid fishes have elongated <b>tendons.</b> (2) Carapus bears short lateral <b>tendons</b> in its myosepta, whereas stiff-bodied fishes bear elongated <b>tendons.</b> Because of its short myoseptal <b>tendons,</b> Carapus retains high axial flexibility. In contrast, elongated <b>tendons</b> restrict axial flexibility in rigid fishes but are able to transmit anteriorly generated muscle forces through long <b>tendons</b> down to the tail. (3) Carapus bears distinct epineural and epipleural <b>tendons</b> in its myosepta, whereas these <b>tendons</b> are weak or absent in rigid fishes. As these <b>tendons</b> firmly connect vertebral axis and skin in Carapus, we consider them to constrain lateral displacement of the vertebral axis during extreme body flexures. (4) Ossifications of myoseptal <b>tendons</b> are only present in C. acus and other more flexible fishes but are absent in rigid fishes. The functional reasons for this remain unexplained...|$|R

5|$|Slow-motion {{photography}} {{shows that}} the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog {{is still in the}} crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position {{for the duration of the}} jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched <b>tendon</b> which is wrapped around the ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the <b>tendon</b> releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{assess the}} {{behavior}} of concrete beams partially prestressed with external unbonded carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) <b>tendons,</b> three specimens prestressed with CFRP <b>tendons</b> and one reference specimen prestressed with external steel <b>tendons</b> were tested to failure under third point loading. It {{was found that the}} load-deflection curve of all specimens exhibited three stages, namely, elastic, cracked-elastic and plastic. The transition from the elastic to the cracked-elastic stage was caused by the development of cracks {{at the bottom of the}} beam, while the transition from the cracked-elastic to the plastic stage was caused by yielding of the non-prestressed steel. For beams prestressed with external CFRP <b>tendons</b> and that with external steel <b>tendons,</b> the relationships between the stress increment in external <b>tendons</b> and the mid-span deflection of specimens were linear or approximately linear. Although CFRP materials are brittle in nature and behave linearly elastically until failure, proper combination of external CFRP prestress <b>tendons</b> with internal steel reinforcing bars can impart ductility to the beams...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Friction loss is an {{important}} component of the calculation of prestressing loss for external prestress strengthening technology. Unfortunately, the test data of relevant curvature friction and wobble coefficients is scarce, especially for beams strengthened by external prestressing Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) <b>tendons.</b> Through the experiment of 12 concrete beams strengthened by external prestressing CFRP <b>tendons,</b> this study attempts to discuss the friction loss algorithm and the reasonable value of friction coefficient. The test results demonstrated that traditional friction loss algorithm for prestressed steel <b>tendons</b> is also suit to external prestressing CFRP <b>tendons,</b> but the value of curvature and wobble coefficients should be determined by different types of CFRP <b>tendons</b> and saddle design. What is more, aiming at the domestic production of CFRP <b>tendons</b> and the adopted special saddle design in this paper, the curvature friction coefficient is 0. 263 and the wobble coefficient is 0. 0067 at the deviator.
