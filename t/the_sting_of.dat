5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>of</b> the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E

5|$|Anthropomorphised ants {{have often}} been used in fables and children's stories to {{represent}} industriousness and cooperative effort. They also are mentioned in religious texts. In the Book of Proverbs in the Bible, ants are held up as a good example for humans for their hard work and cooperation. Aesop did the same in his fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. In the Quran, Sulayman {{is said to have}} heard and understood an ant warning other ants to return home to avoid being accidentally crushed by Sulayman and his marching army. In parts of Africa, ants are considered to be the messengers of the deities. Some Native American mythology, such as the Hopi mythology, considers ants as the very first animals. Ant bites are often said to have curative properties. <b>The</b> <b>sting</b> <b>of</b> some species of Pseudomyrmex is claimed to give fever relief. Ant bites are used in the initiation ceremonies of some Amazon Indian cultures as a test of endurance.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usually conciliatory nature, Crittenden was drawn into a disagreement between congressmen Jonathan Cilley and William J. Graves that ended in a duel. On {{the floor of the}} House, Cilley had attacked the integrity of Whig newspaper editor James Watson Webb. Webb demanded a retraction of Cilley's comments through his friend, Congressman Graves. When Cilley refused to receive the communication from Graves, Graves charged that Cilley was questioning Webb's honor and challenged him to a duel. Graves, accompanied by Kentucky Congressman Richard Menefee and Virginia Congressman Richard Wise asked Crittenden to serve as a second for Graves in the duel; Crittenden initially protested, but finally agreed. After two misses by both combatants, Cilley was killed on the third exchange. The House proposed the expulsion of Graves and the censure of the other participants (excluding Crittenden, who was a senator and not subject to House censure). The resolutions of expulsion and censure were eventually tabled, but Crittenden personally felt <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>of</b> what he considered an indirect censure and later regretted his actions.|$|E
5|$|M. nigrocincta ants have highly venomous stings {{which are}} painful and produce intense burning sensations. The sensations last for many {{days and the}} sting itches. If left untreated, the sting may develop into an ulcer. The venom of a closely related species, M. pilosula is amongst the strongest of the Formicidae and {{contains}} active ingredients such as acid and alkaline phosphatases, hyaluronidase, as well as phospholipases A2 and B. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 265 of the 376 participants taking {{part of the study}} reacted to <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>of</b> several Myrmecia species. Of these, 176 reacted to the M. pilosula, 15 to M. nigrocincta, three to M. ludlowi, and 56 to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. Besides Myrmecia species, these included the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica).|$|E

5|$|Unpalatability, broadly understood, can {{be created}} {{in a variety of}} ways. Some insects such as the {{ladybird}} or tiger moth contain bitter-tasting chemicals, while the skunk produces a noxious odour, and the poison glands of the poison dart frog, <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>of</b> a velvet ant or neurotoxin in a black widow spider make them dangerous or painful to attack. Tiger moths advertise their unpalatability by either producing ultrasonic noises which warn bats to avoid them, or by warning postures which expose brightly coloured body parts (see Unkenreflex), or exposing eyespots. Velvet ants (actually parasitic wasps) such as Dasymutilla occidentalis both have bright colours and produce audible noises when grabbed (via stridulation), which serve to reinforce the warning. Among mammals, predators can be dissuaded when a smaller animal is aggressive and able to defend itself, as for example in honey badgers.|$|E
5|$|M.regularis is {{a highly}} {{aggressive}} ant that will pursue any intruder to a distance of 1.8–2.7 metres (2–3 yards) if their nests are disturbed. Their stings are very painful and particularly powerful. In some cases, human victims of M.regularis bites have displayed an allergy to the venom. In a 2011 study which investigated the causes of ant sting anaphylaxis in Australia, 265 of the 376 human participants reacted to <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>of</b> several Myrmecia species. Of these, nine serum samples taken from patients were IgE positive to the venom of M.regularis. These ants are both diurnal and nocturnal, foraging on the trunks of Eucalyptus trees to feed on sap and nectar, or capturing small insects (such as caterpillars and ants in the genus Camponotus or subgenus Orthocrema). The larvae are carnivorous and exclusively feed on insects, either consuming small portions of the insect or all of it. Unlike most Myrmecia species, trophallaxis takes place among adults or between adults and larvae. All stages of the frog Metacrinia nichollsi are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies, where they use several galleries constructed by the ants. The parasitic ant M.inquilina may attempt to enter M.regularis nests to establish colonies, but M.inquilina queens may be seized and killed {{as soon as the}} two species come into contact.|$|E

25|$|Injected poisons (e.g., from <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>of</b> animals) can {{be treated}} by binding the {{affected}} body part with a pressure bandage and placing the affected body part in hot water (with a temperature of 50°C). The pressure bandage prevents the poison being pumped throughout the body, and the hot water breaks it down. This treatment, however, only works with poisons composed of protein-molecules.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>sting</b> <b>of</b> the Africanized bee is no {{more potent}} than any other variety of honey bee, and {{although}} they are similar in appearance to European bees, they actually tend to be slightly smaller and darker in color.

25|$|While all wasp stings are unpleasant, <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>of</b> R. romandi {{is known}} for being very painful. Additionally, because R. romandi is a paper wasp, it {{has the ability to}} {{repeatedly}} sting without dying. R. romandi is most aggressive if they are swarming, if their nests are disturbed or if the wasps feel their nest is threatened. If wasps feel threatened, they may swarm out of the nest, and pursue the aggressor. If you ever get swarmed by wasps, it is recommended that you remain as still as possible and move away slowly. Sudden movements will be regarded as aggressive acts and will result in more stings.|$|E
25|$|Their ratting {{talent and}} unique bond was seized {{upon by the}} city's press. Martin's saloon was a {{favorite}} haunt of newspapermen and journalists, so, with the dogs a fixture outside the bar, they never had to travel far for a story. The exploits of the dogs were recorded in detail in the Californian, Daily Alta California, Daily Morning Call, and Daily Evening Bulletin, the editors vying {{with each other in}} their attempts to endow the pair's adventures with thrills and parallels to the human condition. Bummer was portrayed as the gentleman down on his luck, yet still faithful and conscientious, while Lazarus, the mongrel, was cast {{in the role of the}} sly and self-serving fair-weather friend. When Bummer was shot in the leg after only a couple of months, and Lazarus left him to run with another dog, it suited the press no end: Bummer was said to be feeling <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>of</b> ingratitude at the desertion of the cur he had saved from death. Lazarus' return when Bummer recovered only added to the excitement.|$|E
25|$|Median wasps may be {{considered}} a pest by some because its nests are usually built in shrubs or on houses where they are easily disturbed. These nests are typically built {{out in the open}} and are often destroyed by people. Despite this the species is not very aggressive and tends to fly away instead of attack if disturbed. However, it may sting if it feels its nest is threatened. <b>The</b> <b>sting</b> <b>of</b> the median wasp is comparable to many other wasp species and should be treated with a cold compress and an antihistamine to reduce swelling unless a more serious allergic reaction occurs. D. media is attracted to sweet foods and as such may fly near food when people are eating. Median wasps are easily scared off and do not usually become aggressive. This species {{is more likely to be}} seen as a pest when it invades a new area due to its impact on the environment. One example is a median wasp that has been spotted in New Zealand. If the wasp becomes widespread and feeds on native flies, moths, and nectar it will compete for resources with other species. Its large size may also cause alarm in new areas.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{symptoms}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ants {{are similar}} to <b>stings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire ants. The reaction is local; swelling, reddening and fever, followed by formation of a blister. The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. In about 3% <b>of</b> cases, <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> causes anaphylaxis. Treatment {{is very similar to}} wasp and bee stings.|$|R

500|$|Among FBO's other offscreen talent, {{the best}} known {{director}} to work regularly at the studio was Ralph Ince, younger brother of famous filmmaker Thomas H. Ince. Pulling double duty on occasion, Ralph Ince starred {{in four of the}} fourteen films he made for FBO. One production in which Ince served in both capacities was particularly well received: Chicago After Midnight (1928) was described by the New York Times as [...] "n unusually well-acted and adroitly directed underworld story." [...] After The Mistress of Shenstone, Henry King directed two more R-C films with Pauline Frederick, also in 1921: Salvage and <b>The</b> <b>Sting</b> <b>of</b> the Lash.

500|$|Channel Orange has {{themes of}} unrequited love, sex, and existential longing. Allusions to Ocean's own {{experience}} with unrequited love are featured in several songs, including [...] "Thinkin Bout You", [...] "Bad Religion", and [...] "Forrest Gump". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found the album to be [...] "rife with <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> <b>of</b> unrequited love, {{both on the}} receiving and inflicting ends", with [...] "lovers who tantalize but remain at arm's length." [...] Ryan Dombal from Pitchfork said Ocean exhibits [...] "a timeless philosophy ... one of hard-won acceptance and the acknowledgement that love and sex and loss will always draw legends to them." [...] The album also explores decadence, the trappings of class disparity, drug dependency, and the tension between spirituality and secularity, a prevalent theme in soul music. Music journalist Sasha Frere-Jones noted [...] "a combination of decadence and spiritual ache similar to Prince's". Greg Kot wrote that Ocean presents [...] "a dialogue between his self-gratifying lust and more selfless conscience", with Prince-like [...] "psychedelic-gospel inflections" [...] and Marvin Gaye-like overdubbing of Ocean's vocals, which {{give the impression of}} voices in conversation with one another. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard viewed that Ocean examines love in the context of money, drugs, and sex.|$|E
