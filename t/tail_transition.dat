40|$|Courtship {{behaviors}} of 15 Sternotherus minor (seven males and eight females) were video recorded. Males perform nine motor patterns [approach, cloacal and bridge sniffing, turning (anterior and posterior) movements, mount, trailing, cloacal contact, intromission, and biting]. The females display two mutually exclusive motor patterns (biting and fleeing) {{and participate in}} two motor patterns involving both sexes (head-head and mutual grasping and interlocking of the <b>tail).</b> <b>Transitions</b> between the behavioral events in the flow diagram of courtship are numerous. The courtship is divided into five phases: approach, sniffing, turning, mounting, and fleeing. The probability of the first likeliest sequence (approach, mount, and copulation) leading to copulation never exceeds 0. 005. Sniffing occurs in the second likeliest sequence (approach, sniffing, mount, and copulation). From actual data, courtships in turtles are divided into three types: (1) the mounting-courtship type (most of the behavioral action patterns are performed during the mounting), (2) the premounting-courtship type (several behaviors are performed by the male before mounting), and (3) the intermediate-courtship type. As other kinosternids, S. minor has typically an intermediate-courtship type. The male mounts the female very quickly. He exhibits only three premounting motor patterns: biting, turning movements, and head-head with the female. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Suprathermal tails are {{a common}} feature of solar wind {{electron}} velocity distributions, and are expected in the solar corona. From the corona, suprathermal electrons can propagate through the steep temperature gradient of the transition region towards the chromosphere, and lead to non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions (VDFs) with pronounced suprathermal tails. We calculate {{the evolution of a}} coronal electron distribution through the transition region in order to quantify the suprathermal electron population there. A kinetic model for electrons is used which is based on solving the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation for electrons including Coulomb collisions with both ions and electrons. Initial and chromospheric boundary conditions are Maxwellian VDFs with densities and temperatures based on a background fluid model. The coronal boundary condition has been adopted from earlier studies of suprathermal electron formation in coronal loops. The model results show the presence of strong suprathermal <b>tails</b> in <b>transition</b> region electron VDFs, starting at energies of a few 10 eV. Above electron energies of 600 eV, electrons can traverse the transition region essentially collision-free.

Negative fluctuations in the PTEN layer of the membrane gated a local increase in PIP 3. In a subset of areas lacking PTEN (PTEN holes), PIP 3 was amplified until a propagated wave was initiated. Wave propagation implies that a PIP 3 signal is transmitted by a self-sustained process, such that the temporal and spatial profiles of the signal are maintained during passage of the wave across the entire expanse of the cell membrane.

40|$|Two of {{the most}} popular approximations for the {{distribution}} of the steady-state waiting time, W_∞, of the M/G/ 1 queue are the so-called heavy-traffic approximation and heavy-tailed asymptotic, respectively. If the traffic intensity, ρ, is close to 1 and the processing times have finite variance, the heavy-traffic approximation states that the distribution of W_∞ is roughly exponential at scale O((1 -ρ) ^- 1), while the heavy tailed asymptotic describes power law decay in the tail of the distribution of W_∞ for a fixed traffic intensity. In this paper, we assume a regularly varying processing time distribution and obtain a sharp threshold in terms of the tail value, or equivalently in terms of (1 -ρ), that describes {{the point at which the}} <b>tail</b> behavior <b>transitions</b> from the heavy-traffic regime to the heavy-tailed asymptotic.

The main focus is on Gaussian β-ensembles, including in particular the Gaussian orthogonal (β= 1), unitary (β= 2) and symplectic (β = 4) ensembles. The probability density function (PDF) of λ_ consists, for large N, of a central part described by Tracy-Widom distributions flanked, on both sides, by two large deviations tails. While the central part characterizes the typical fluctuations of λ_ [...] of order O(N^- 2 / 3) [...] , the large deviations tails are instead associated to extremely rare fluctuations [...] of order O(1).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} of complexes formed between ionic surfactants (SF) and a single oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (PE) chain. For our computer simulation we use the ``primitive'' electrolyte model: while the polyelectrolyte is modeled by a tethered chain of charged hard sphere beads, the surfactant molecules consist of a single charged head bead tethered to a tail of tethered hard spheres. A hydrophobic attraction between the tail beads is introduced by assuming a Lennard-Jones potential outside the hard-sphere diameter. As {{a function of the}} strengths of both the electrostatic and the hydrophobic interactions, we find the following scenario: switching on and increasing the electrostatic forces first leads to a stretching of the PE and then by condensation of SF to the formation of a complex. For vanishing hydrophobic forces this complex has the architecture of a molecular bottle-brush cylindrically centered around the stretched PE molecule. Upon increasing the hydrophobic attraction between the SF <b>tails,</b> a <b>transition</b> occurs inverting this structure to a spherical micelle with a neutral core of SF tails and a charged corona of SF heads with the PE molecule wrapped around. At intermediate hydrophobicity there is a competition between the two structures indicated by a non-monotonic dependence of the shape as function of the Coulomb strength, favoring the cylindrical shape for weak and the spherical micellar complex for strong interaction.

Ligand-induced higher-order EGFR oligomerisation or clustering has been reported {{but it is not clear}} how EGFR oligomers, as distinct from EGFR dimers, influence signaling outputs. To address this question, we combined measures of receptor clustering (microscopy; image correlation spectroscopy) and phosphorylation (Western blots) with modelling of mass-action chemical kinetics. A stable BaF/ 3 cell-line that contains a high proportion (> 90 %) of inactive dimers of EGFR-eGFP but no secreted ligand and no other detectable ErbB receptors was used as the model cell system. EGF at concentrations of greater than 1 nM was found to cluster EGFR-eGFP dimers into higher-order complexes and cause parallel increases in EGFR phosphorylation. The kinetics of EGFR clustering and phosphorylation were both rapid, plateauing within 2 minutes after stimulation with 30 nM EGF. A rule-based model was formulated to interpret the data. This model took into account ligand binding, ligand-induced conformational changes in the cytosolic <b>tail,</b> monomer-dimer-trimer-tetramer <b>transitions</b> via ectodomain- and kinase-mediated interactions, and phosphorylation.

Spin density waves (SDW) have been found with some confidence. They are either incommensurate with the lattice period or {{the ratio of the}} respective periods is far away from ratio of small integers. SDW shape is very unconventional i. e. differs from the sinusoidal shape. Magnetic order starts with lowered temperature as narrow sheets of the significant electron spin density separated by areas with very small spin density. Magnetic sheets are likely to be ordered in the alternate anti-ferromagnetic fashion as the material as whole behaves similarly to collinear anti-ferromagnet. Further lowering of temperature simply expands sheet thickness leading to the near triangular SDW. Finally, sheets fill the whole available space and almost rectangular shape of SDW is reached. Substantial maximum amplitude of SDW appears at the temperature just below the magnetic onset temperature, and this maximum amplitude increases slightly with lowering temperature. The square root from the mean squared hyperfine field behaves versus temperature according to the universality class (1, 2), i. e., with the electronic spin space having dimensionality equal unity and the real space having dimensionality equal two.

Instead, we generalize this model to the wider class of Levy stable distributions, characterized by heavy tails. Phonon-assisted scattering of excitons, localized by the disorder, leads to thermally activated exciton motion. The time evolution of the second moment of the exciton distribution is shown to be sublinear, thus indicating that the exciton dynamics in such systems is not diffusive, but rather subdiffusive instead. The heavier the <b>tail</b> in the <b>transition</b> energy distribution is, the larger are the deviations from the diffusive regime. This from fluctuations of site energies larger than the exciton band width (outliers).

Zinc acetate dehydrate, CoCl 3 4 H 2 O or InCl 3, ethanol, and monoethanolamine were used as a starting materials, dopant source, solvent, and stabilizer, respectively. The X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that the undoped and doped ZnO thin films have polycrystalline nature and hexagonal wurtzite structure with (002) preferential orientation.

The most accurate and sensitive methods to date for prediction of calving within 24 h are the measurement of pelvic ligament relaxation and assays for circulating progesterone and oestradiol- 17 β. Conversely, the absence of calving within the next 12 - 24 h can be accurately predicted by the measurement of incremental daily decrease in vaginal temperature and by the combination of pelvic ligament relaxation and teat filling estimates.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on two methods to {{approximate}} the loglikelihood function for univariate diffusions: 1) the simulation approach using a modified Brownian bridge as the importance sampler; and 2) the recent closed-form approach. For the case of constant volatility, we give a theoretical justification of the modified Brownian bridge sampler by showing that it is exactly a Brownian bridge. We also discuss computational issues in the simulation approach such as accelerating numerical variance stabilizing transformation, computing derivatives of the simu-lated loglikelihood, and choosing initial values of parameter estimates. The two approaches are compared {{in the context of}} financial applications with annualized parameter values, where the diffusion model has an unknown transition density and has no analytical variance stabilizing transformation. The closed-form expansion, particularly the second-order closed-form, is found to be computationally efficient and very accurate when the observation frequency is monthly or higher.

The simulation approach combined with the variance stabilizing transformation is found to be more reliable than the closed-form approach when the observation frequency is lower.

To assist with the monitoring of parturition, it would be beneficial to understand the behaviour of dairy cows that is associated with normal calving. This study systematically quantified the behaviour of cows to identify what changes in behaviour occur during the 24 h before normal calving compared with that quantified during pre-calving observations during late pregnancy. The behaviour of twenty Holstein-Friesian cows was recorded for 24 h prior to the calf being expelled and for a 24 -hour control period during late pregnancy. Continuous focal observations from video recordings were used to quantify daily frequencies and durations of behaviours. Comparisons were made between daily totals recorded in the 24 h before calving and during the control period and each observation was also divided into four six-hour periods to help determine the time when changes occurred before calving. Segmented regression lines were also fitted to identify the point when behaviour changed before calving. The frequencies of lying and tail raising showed consistent increases in the final six-hour period before calving and a significant break point in their segmented regressions. Durations of lying, walking, eating and ground-licking, and number of walking bouts, did not show consistent changes at the time of calving.

By varying {{the thickness of the}} PrBCO separator layer, the influence of the interlayer coupling on the superconducting properties is studied. An excellent fitting by the Larkin two-dimensional superconducting fluctuation theory with only two scaling parameters (A(T) and H(PHI) (T)) for each R(T) curve shows that by taking thicker PrBCO layers it is possible to induce the dimensional crossover from the anisotropic 3 D behavior in pure YBCO to the quasi- 2 D behavior in YBCO/PrBCO superlattices. The resistive transition broadening in a magnetic field can be related to giant conductivity fluctuations in the quasi-two-dimensional CuO 2 superconducting double layers in YBCO. For Y:Pr = 1 : 3 and 1 : 5 superlattices, the temperature dependence of the first scaling parameter A(T), determined by the fluctuation amplitude, follows quite well the Larkin beta(T) function typical for 2 D systems. For Y:Pr = 1 : 1 and 5 : 6 superlattices, the YBCO layers are not completely decoupled or too thick and A(T) deviates from beta(T). The temperature dependence of the second scaling parameter H(PHI) (T), the phase coherence breaking field, is consistent with the recent theoretical prediction by Reizer for the quasi-two-dimensional electron-electron interactions.

Acta 1615, 33 (2003) ] for polymer grafted membranes, the contributions to the bending modulus due to changes arising from the grafted polymer and bilayer thinning are partitioned. The contributions to the changes in kappa from bilayer thinning were found to lie within 11 % for the lipids with four to six tail beads, increasing to 15 % for the lipids containing nine tail beads. The changes in the area stretch modulus were also assessed and were found to have a small influence on the overall contribution from membrane thinning. The increase in the area per head group of the lipids was found to be consistent with the scalings predicted by self-consistent mean field results. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|Networks [...] {{abstract}} objects {{composed of}} vertices connected by edges, are ubiquitous {{in the real}} world. Examples such as social networks, the world wide web, and neural networks in the brain are constantly evolving in their topology, the state of their vertices, {{or a combination of}} the two. This dissertation presents a computational and theoretical study of three models of network dynamics, one corresponding to each of these modes of evolution. The first study models the disintegration of a social network of voters with binary opinions, who prefer to be connected to others with the same opinion. We study two versions of the model: the network evolves by voters in discordant ties choosing to either adopt the opinion of their neighbors, or to rewire their ties to some randomly chosen voter of (i) the same, or (ii) any, opinion. We examine how the probability of rewiring, and the initial fraction ρ_i in the minority, determine the final minority fraction ρ_f, when the network has bifurcated. In case (i), there is a critical probability, that is independent of ρ_i, above which ρ_f is unchanged from ρ_i, and below which there is full concensus. In case (ii), the behavior above the critical probability, that now depends on ρ_i, is similar; but below it, ρ_f matches the result of starting with ρ_i = 1 / 2. Using simulations and approximate calculations, we explain why these two nearly identical models have such dramatically different behaviors. The second model, called the quadratic contact process (QCP) involves "birth" and "death" events on a static network. Vertices take on the binary states occupied(1) or vacant(0). We consider two versions of the model [...] Vertex QCP, and Edge QCP, corresponding to birth events 1 - 0 - 1 ⟶ 1 - 1 - 1 and 1 - 1 - 0 ⟶ 1 - 1 - 1 respectively, where `-' represents an edge. We study the fraction of occupied vertices at steady state {{as a function of the}} birth rate, keeping the death rate constant. To investigate the effects of network topology, we study the QCP on homogeneous networks with a bounded or rapidly decaying degree distribution, and those with a heavy tailed degree distribution. From our simulation results and mean field calculations, we conclude that on the homogeneous networks, there is a discontinuous phase transition with a region of bistability, whereas on the heavy <b>tailed</b> networks, the <b>transition</b> is continuous. Furthermore, the critical birth rate is positive in the former but zero in the latter. In the third study, we propose a general scheme for spatial networks evolving in order to reduce their total edge lengths. We study the properties of the equilbria of two networks from this class, one of which interpolate between two well studied objects: the Erdős-Rényi random graph, and the random geometric graph. The first of our two evolutions can be used as a model for a social network where individuals have fixed opinions about a number of issues and adjust their ties to be connected to people with similar views. The second evolution which preserves the connectivity of the network has potential applications in the design of transportation networks and other distribution systems. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{quantitative}} techniques for trading strategies on two commodities, {{the difference of}} whose prices exhibits a long-term historical relationship known as mean-reversion. A portfolio of two commodity prices with very similar characteristics, the spread may {{be regarded as a}} distinct process from the underlying price processes so deserves to be modeled directly. To pave the way for modeling the spread processes, the fundamental concepts, notions, properties of commodity markets such as the forward prices, the futures prices, and convenience yields are described. Some popular commodity pricing models including both one and two factor models are reviewed. A new mean-reverting process to model the commodity spot prices is introduced. Some analytical results for this process are derived and its properties are analyzed. We compare the new one-factor model with a common existing one-factor model by applying these two models to price West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. We investigate the recent behavioral change in the location spread process between WTI crude oil and Brent oil. The existing three major approaches to price a spread process namely cointegration, one-factor and two-factor models fail to fully capture these behavioral changes. We, therefore, extend the one-factor and two-factor spread models by including a compound Poisson process where jump sizes follow a double exponential distribution. We generalize the existing one-factor mean-reverting dynamics (Vasicek process) by replacing the constant diffusion term with a nonlinear term to price the spread process. Applying the new process to the empirical location spread between WTI and Brent crude oils dataset, it is shown how the generalized dynamics can rigorously capture the most important characteristics of the spread process namely high volatility, skewness and kurtosis. To consider the recent structural breaks in the location spread between WTI and Brent, we incorporate regime switching dynamics in the generalized model and Vasicek process by including two regimes. We also introduce a new mean-reverting random walk, derive its continuous time stochastic differential equation and obtain some analytical results about its solution. This new mean-reverting process is compared with the Vasicek process and its advantages discussed. We showed that this new model for spread dynamics is capable of capturing the possible skewness, kurtosis, and heavy <b>tails</b> in the <b>transition</b> density of the price spread process. Since the analytical transition density is unknown for this nonlinear stochastic process, the local linearization method is deployed to estimate the model parameters. We apply this method to empirical data for modeling the spread between WTI crude oil and West Texas Sour (WTS) crude oil. Finally, we apply the introduced trading strategies to empirical data for the location spread between WTI and Brent crude oils, analyze, and compare the profitability of the strategies. The optimal trading strategies for the spread dynamics in the cointegration approach and the one-factor mean-reverting process are discussed and applied to our considered empirical dataset. We suggest to use the stationary distribution to find optimal thresholds for log-term investment strategies when the spread dynamics is assumed to follow a Vasicek process. To incorporate essential features of a spread process such as skewness and kurtosis into the spread trading strategies, we extend the optimal trading strategies by considering optimal asymmetric thresholds...|$|R
