5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} an {{economic}} analysis that showed that the largest part of the economic benefit from road pricing {{was not in the}} relief of congestion but in the revenue collected, which would only be released when the revenue is used. In the arguments that followed, <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> could come about by using the money from such a scheme was frequently overshadowed by a vision of the restraints and penalties levied on the motorist.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Church understands {{human beings}} to consist of body and mind, the {{physical}} and the non-physical (or soul perhaps), and that the two are inextricably linked. Humans are capable of discerning the difference {{between good and evil}} because they have a conscience. There are many manifestations of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> we can pursue. Some, like procreation, are common to other animals, while others, like the pursuit of truth, are inclinations peculiar to the capacities of human beings.|$|E
25|$|Without overstating it (and without fully {{defending}} it) {{not only}} is there a consensus about the need for a conception of the good, there may even be a consensus about the particular conception of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> should inform policies on these nonconstitutional political issues. Communitarians endorse civic republicanism {{and a growing number of}} liberals endorse some version of deliberative democracy. Both envision a need for citizens who are independent and responsible and for public forums that present citizens with opportunities to enter into public deliberations on social policies.|$|E

50|$|The {{non-availability}} explains {{international trade}} {{by the fact}} that each country imports <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>that</b> are not available at home. This unavailability may be due to lack of natural resources (oil, gold, etc.: this is absolute unavailability) or to <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> cannot be produced domestically, or could only be produced at prohibitive costs (for technological or other reasons): this is relative unavailability. On the other hand, each country exports <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> <b>that</b> are available at home.|$|R
25|$|When {{the amount}} of one factor of {{production}} increases, the production of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> uses that particular production factor intensively increases relative {{to the increase in}} the factor of production, as the H–O model assumes perfect competition where price is equal to the costs of factors of production. This theorem is useful in explaining the effects of immigration, emigration, and foreign capital investment. However, Rybczynski suggests that a fixed quantity of the two factors of production are required. This could be expanded to consider factor substitution, in which case the increase in production is more than proportional.|$|E
25|$|Given that {{a factor}} {{is used in}} the {{production}} of a range of first-order goods, its value is determined by <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> is worth the least among all the goods in the range. This value is determined at the margin, the marginal utility of the last unit of the least valuable good produced by the factor. In connection with his opportunity cost, the value so derived represents an opportunity cost across all industries, and the values of the factors of production and goods are determined in the whole system. Thus, supply and demand do not develop into the determinants of value; the determinant of value is the marginal utility.|$|E
25|$|In 1712 Berkeley Codd, Esq. of Sussex County, Delaware disputed some of {{the rights}} of Penn's grant from the Duke of York. Some of William Penn's agents hired lawyer Andrew Hamilton to {{represent}} the Penn family in this replevin case. Hamilton's success led to an established relationship of good will between the Penn family and Andrew Hamilton. Penn had grown weary of the politicking back in Pennsylvania and the restlessness with his governance, but Logan implored him not to forsake his colony, for fear that Pennsylvania might {{fall into the hands of}} an opportunist who would undo all <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> had been accomplished. During his second attempt to sell Pennsylvania back to the Crown in 1712, Penn suffered a stroke. A second stroke several months later left him unable to speak or take care of himself.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{in an effort}} to boost Downtown and upgrade the city's western entrance, Federal and state Urban Cultural Park grants were used on Mill Street, a small brick-paved street between State and Church streets. Two {{restaurants}} opened with great success but later folded during Downtown's continued decline. The project was a failure and was home to abandoned concrete kiosks, planters, and benches all disgraced by graffiti as of 2006. Another failed attempt at urban renewal was the $11 million Canal Square shopping plaza next to Proctor's Theatre in the 1980s. This was praised by then-President of the United States Ronald Reagan as an example of <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> could be done by the smart use of urban renewal money. The shopping plaza, however, failed due to suburban competition. Another proposal that never got off the ground was to level Proctor's for a shopping mall.|$|E

Rockwell's response to this criticism was, [...] "I paint life as I would like it to be." [...] Rockwell made it known that he hoped these would be his masterpieces, but was disappointed.

[...] He however did not feel that Swaminarayan's values aligned perfectly with his interpretation of Vaishnavism. In a letter dated 25 July 1918, to Manganlal Gandhi, he stated, “To be sure, I have felt in all seriousness that Swaminarayan and Vallabhacharaya have robbed us of our manliness. They made the people incapable of self-defense... It was all to <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> people gave up drinking, smoking, etc., this, however, is not an end in itself, it only is a means.

500|$|When Smallville first began, Lana was in {{a romantic}} {{relationship}} with Whitney Fordman, the star quarterback of the football team. Kreuk believes that Lana truly {{was in love with}} Whitney when they first started dating, {{but by the time the}} audience first sees her in the pilot she is no longer in that same state of mind. Kreuk believes that by the time of the pilot Lana had grown “comfortable” with Whitney, and that was where their relationship ended. Though Lana had growing feelings for Clark, Kreuk feels that the producers rushed the coupling of Clark and Lana at the end of the second season. She believes that with everything that had happened throughout the season between the two characters, it seemed a bit of a stretch for Lana to just quickly fall into Clark's arms. The next season began to develop more of the relationship between Lex and Lana. Kreuk believes that Lana cares for Lex as a friend, and that she recognizes the [...] "undertones" [...] that Lex may be placing on their relationship, but that Lana tends to ignore them. Kreuk recognizes that Lex is a big part of Lana's life, and that Lana tries to pay more attention to <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> Lex does and focus less on the darker aspects of his life.|$|E

500|$|From Molossia, Themistocles {{apparently}} fled to Pydna, {{from where}} he took a ship for Asia Minor. This ship was blown off course by a storm, and ended up at Naxos, which an Athenian fleet {{was in the process}} of besieging. Desperate to avoid identification, Themistocles pestered the captain of the ship to continue the journey immediately. According to Thucydides, who wrote within living memory of the events, the ship eventually landed safely at Ephesus, where Themistocles disembarked. Plutarch has the ship docking at Cyme in Aeolia, and Diodorus has Themistocles making his way to Asia in an undefined manner. Diodorus and Plutarch next recount a similar tale, namely that Themistocles stayed briefly with an acquaintance (Lysitheides or Nicogenes) who was also acquainted with the Persian king, Artaxerxes I. Since there was a bounty on Themistocles's head, this acquaintance devised a plan to safely convey Themistocles to the Persian king in the type of covered wagon that the King's concubines travelled in. All three chroniclers agree that Themistocles's next move was to contact the Persian king; in Thucydides, this is by letter, while Plutarch and Diodorus have a face-to-face meeting with the king. The spirit is, however, the same in all three: Themistocles introduces himself to the king and seeks to enter his service: [...] "I, Themistocles, am come to you, who did your house more harm than any of the Hellenes, when I was compelled to defend myself against your father's invasion—harm, however, far surpassed by <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> I did him during his retreat, which brought no danger for me but much for him."

500|$|In October 1562 the Queen {{fell ill}} with {{smallpox}} and, believing {{her life to}} be in danger, she asked the Privy Council to make Robert Dudley Protector of the Realm and {{to give him a}} suitable title together with twenty thousand pounds a year. There was universal relief when she recovered her health; Dudley was made a privy councillor. He was already deeply involved in foreign politics, including Scotland. In 1563 Elizabeth suggested Dudley as a consort to the widowed Mary, Queen of Scots, the idea being to achieve firm amity between England and Scotland and diminish the influence of foreign powers. Elizabeth's preferred solution was that they should all live together at the English court, so that she would not have to forgo her favourite's company. Mary of Scotland at first enquired if Elizabeth was serious, wanting above all to know her chances of inheriting the English crown. Elizabeth repeatedly declared that she was only prepared to acknowledge Mary as her heir on condition that she marry Robert Dudley. Mary's Protestant advisors warmed to the prospect of having Dudley as their prince, and in September 1564 he was created Earl of Leicester, a move designed to make him more acceptable to Mary. In January 1565 Thomas Randolph, the English ambassador to Scotland, was told by the Scottish queen that she would accept the proposal. To his amazement, Dudley was not to be moved to comply: But a man of that nature I never found any ... he whom I go about to make as happy as ever was any, to put him in possession of a kingdom, to lay in his naked arms a most fair ... lady ... nothing regardeth <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> shall ensue unto him thereby ... but so uncertainly dealeth that I know not where to find him. Dudley indeed had made it clear to the Scots at the beginning that he was not a candidate for Mary's hand and forthwith had behaved with passive resistance. He also worked in the interest of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, Mary's eventual choice of husband. Elizabeth herself wavered as to declaring Mary her heir, until in March 1565 she decided she could not bring herself to it. Still, she finally told the Spanish ambassador that the proposal fell through because the Earl of Leicester refused to cooperate.|$|E
