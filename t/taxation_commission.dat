50|$|William John Sutton {{was one of}} {{the first}} to {{advocate}} preservation of the forests in British Columbia. He gave evidence to several government commissions (1905, 1909) and in 1910 published, as a member of the Natural History Society, a booklet, Our Timber and its Conservation,Internet Archive in which he described 18 commercial species of forest trees. He argued that timber resources in British Columbia were comparatively limited and was critical of current government practise in regard to land leases and taxes. He recommended the government establish a forestry commission identifying key areas for research. He used his booklet to submit evidence to the Fulton Royal Commission on Timber and Forestry and some of his recommendations were accepted by the government. He gave further evidence to an Assessment and <b>Taxation</b> <b>Commission</b> in 1911 as well as to the Forestry and Conservation Convention in Vancouver in January 1914.|$|E

Hobbs acted in a voluntary capacity as a director and Finance spokesperson for The Consumers association of Ireland from 1993 to 2006.

Hobbs' complaint to the EU <b>Taxation</b> <b>Commission</b> that the Irish tax code was being adjusted to create competitive advantage to domestic Irish funds in breach of The Treaty of Rome, resulted in the Commission writing to Finance Minister McCreevy who adjusted the new gross roll-up tax regime to all OECD funds. When Minister McCreevy announced the SSIA savings scheme, Hobbs launched the Consumers Association of Ireland 'Savermark' standard that required banks to link deposit interest to the ECB base rate movements to prevent margins widening. Hobbs accused the Life Insurance industry of colluding to avoid the 'Savermark' pricing and called for a Competition Authority investigation.|$|E

50|$|It was {{proposed}} in clause 4 to omit from clause (1) of article 286 the Explanation which had {{given rise to}} a great deal of legal controversy and practical difficulty. In view of the centralisation of inter-State sales tax proposed in clause 2 of this Bill, clause (2) of article 286 in its present form would cease to be appropriate. In its place, it {{was proposed}} to insert a provision empowering Parliament to formulate principles for determining in case of a sale or purchase of goods outside a State, in the course of import of the goods into the territory of India, or in the course of export of the goods out of the territory of India. It was further proposed to replace clause (3) of article 286 by a new clause on the lines recommended by the <b>Taxation</b> Enquiry <b>Commission.</b> Under this revised clause Parliament would have the power to declare by law the goods which were of special importance in inter-State trade or commerce and also to specify the restrictions and conditions to which any State law (whether made before or after the Parliamentary law) would be subject in regard to the system of levy, rates and other incidents of the tax on the sale or purchase of those goods.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Taxation</b> Enquiry <b>Commission</b> {{examined}} {{the problem and}} made certain recommendations which might be summarised as follows. In essence, sales tax must {{continue to be a}} State source of revenue and its levy and administration must substantially pertain to the State Governments. The sphere of power and responsibility of the State might, however, be said to end, and that of the Union to begin, when the sales tax of one State impinges, administratively on the dealers, and fiscally on the consumers, of another State. Broadly, therefore, inter-State sales should be the concern of the Union, but the responsibilities pertaining to the Union could be exercised through the State Governments, and in any case, the revenue should appropriately devolve on them. Intra-State sales, on the other hand, should be left to the States, but with one important exception. Where, for instance, raw material produced in a State is important {{from the point of view}} of the consumer or the industry of another State, certain restrictions have to be placed on the taxing power of the State Government, as otherwise it can effect an increase in the cost of the manufactured article, whether such manufacture takes place in the State which produces the raw material, or in another State which imports the material from the State. In either case, to the extent that the finished goods are consumed in a State other than the one which taxes the raw material, the increase in cost on account of the tax is a matter of direct concern to the consumer of another State. Such cases of intra-State sales should appropriately be brought under the full control of the Union. These recommendations of the Commission had been generally accepted by all the State Governments.|$|R
40|$|The {{advanced}} level of integration among EU member states, the single currency {{about to be}} introduced, global business activities and liberalization of the capital market are the prime movers in attempts to improve tax co-ordination within the EU. Efforts to reform taxes at national level, while highly advisable in cases such as the excessive tax burden on labor, are increasingly self-defeating because of their negative competitive impact. Empirical observations find that mobile tax bases, especially company locations and financial capital, are increasingly good at removing themselves from national taxation. This {{may result in a}} growing tax burden to be borne by less mobile tax bases, especially payrolls. Such a development is unfavorable if not outright detrimental to employment and equity of <b>taxation.</b> The EU <b>Commission</b> has made a renewed effort to deal with this major problem, achieving its first success by adopting its Code of Conduct on Business Taxation. But the Code will need to be put in practice to see whether EU member states are seriously endeavouring to escape the prisoner's dilemma and potential tax competition.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 89 - 90). A group taxation regime can {{be defined}} as: "a set of rules that enables corporate taxpayers to compute the tax liability of related corporations on a consolidated or combined basis(.) (and) [...] . encompasses not only full consolidation. but also tranifer of particular tax allributes between the members (?f a corporate group [...] I. This definition is very broad and group taxation could be better understood when considering the more common forms of group taxation such as the group relief regime and the consolidation regime. The consolidation regime generally involves each company with{{in a group of}} companies computing its own income after which the income is consolidated at the holding company-level for tax purposes. The holding company would thereafter become liable for the group's tax 2, whereas a group relief regime involves the ability of losses incurred by one company in a group of companies to be transferred to another member group company 3. Does group taxation exist in South Africa? Based on the above, it would appear not. The more pertinent question that has to be answered is whether or not elements of group taxation currently exist in South African tax legislation. The debate in terms of the introduction of group taxation in South Africa was raised for the first time by the Margo Commission of Inquiry, which ultimately decided against recommending the introduction of group <b>taxation.</b> The Katz <b>Commission</b> of Inquiry however recommended the introduction of group taxation.
