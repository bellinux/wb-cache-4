5|$|After the {{shakeout}} of {{the casting}} it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts.

Flow marks are marks left on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of the {{spectrum}} can also reveal the surface gravity of the star. This is usually expressed as log g, the base-10 logarithm of the gravitational acceleration given in CGS units, in this case, cm/s².

5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones {{in the rear of}} the mandible and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.|$|E

Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
