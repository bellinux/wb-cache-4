The adult robin gives alarm calls and dives in a threatening manner towards creatures it considers potential predators, such as approaching cats, dogs and humans. The fledglings are able to fly short distances after leaving the nest. The wings of juvenile birds develop rapidly, and it only <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks for them to become proficient at flying. The cryptically colored young birds perch in bushes or trees for protection from predators.|$|E

[...] Lu, along with Robert Gibbs and several other Obama staffers, read Obama's manuscript for The Audacity of Hope and provided him with several editorial suggestions.|$|E

The scene was filmed in a period of three days, and took approximately twelve takes to complete. Expressing that she was initially nervous, Bullock stated in an interview with Sky News that [...] "when everyone else acts like it's just a normal day it really helps you relax." [...] Although she revealed that producers provided them with fig leaves, Bullock stated that they would continuously fall off. She added, [...] "You could literally see everything." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Reynolds, who in an interview with People, stated, [...] "Filming a scene that involves being entirely naked and <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> days can be a little awkward." [...] He continued: [...] "Thankfully you're there for so long and you're doing it for so long that you dispense with the awkwardness pretty quickly and start to have mundane, normal conversations – the difference being you're not wearing pants." ...|$|E

500|$|Just Dance was {{developed}} by a small team of around 20 at Ubisoft Paris, and was only officially pitched six months prior to its eventual release. Poix explained that unlike the Raving Rabbids games, which he described as being a [...] "gamer's game", Just Dance was designed to contrast skill-based rhythm games with a concept and control scheme that would be accessible to a mainstream audience, encouraging them to [...] " [...] off the couch and [...] fun together". Ubisoft producer Florian Granger noted that Just Dance was designed to help players overcome their inhibitions and anxiety towards dance, helping them build a [...] "vocabulary" [...] of moves they can practice in a [...] "safe context", and with the game itself being {{the focal point of}} attention rather than themselves. He reminisced that [...] "everyone remembers going to a nightclub or school disco where it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hours before anyone has the bottle to get up and dance. Most guys do the fix-placed-beer-bottle dance or neck-shake to the beat." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkish {{coffee is}} also called [...] "Bosnian coffee" [...] (Bosnian: bosanska kahva), {{which is made}} {{slightly}} differently from its Turkish counterpart. A deviation from the Turkish preparation {{is that when the}} water reaches its boiling point, a small amount is saved aside for later, usually in a coffee cup. Then, the coffee is added to the pot (džezva), and the remaining water in the cup is added to the pot. Everything is put back on the heat source to reach its boiling point again, which only <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of seconds since the coffee is already very hot. Coffee drinking in Bosnia is a traditional daily custom and plays an important role during social gatherings.|$|E

2500|$|It <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> {{of weeks}} of regular use to become {{accustomed}} to the unusual feel of the Rotor linkage cranksets. [...] After becoming accustomed to it, most riders prefer it. [...] However, there is no difficulty in switching between ordinary cranksets and Rotor linkage cranksets. [...] Once a rider has learned to use Rotor linkage cranksets the adaption when switching {{back and forth between}} crankset types only takes a minute or two. [...] Many competitive cyclists, including the Cervélo TestTeam, use Rotor's Q-rings which mimic the fluctuation in gear size without the added weight. However Rotor Q-rings and other non-round rings cannot duplicate the crank arm movements that allow application of power through the dead spots of the pedaling cycle. [...] Non-round rings also increase the difficulty of setting up the front derailleur, while Rotor linkage cranksets present no extra difficulty in that regard.|$|E

The other four were Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Kim Philby, and Sir Anthony Blunt, the Queen’s art curator. The media and press were split between {{positive}} and negative reaction to The Fifth Man. The Irish Times reviewer Kieran Fagan said: ‘This book by an Australian journalist is very unusual... Few writers on espionage achieve the page-turning fluency of Roland Perry.’ The Weekend Australian reviewer Richard Hall said ‘it only <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of phone calls to establish that the Rothschild operation had been pretty small beer for a long time.’ In contrast, Norman Abjorensen in The Sunday Canberra Times wrote: Perry makes a plausible case that the Fifth Man was...
