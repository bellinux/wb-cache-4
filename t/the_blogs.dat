40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the use of a <b>blog</b> in <b>the</b> classroom. This paper {{describes}} why the teacher created <b>the</b> <b>blog</b> and how <b>the</b> <b>blog</b> is used by teachers and pupils in and outside the classroom. The study also describes teachers’ thoughts regarding future use of <b>the</b> <b>blog.</b> Seven primary school teachers were interviewed and the material was analysed using a multimodal design theoretical perspective on learning (Selander & Kress 2010). The conclusion of the study was that the teachers created and designed blogs to give parents, pupils, relatives and others an opportunity to have an insight into the pupils’ school day. <b>The</b> <b>blog</b> is used mostly by teachers and pupils’ school work is published on <b>the</b> <b>blog.</b> <b>The</b> pupils in some classes use <b>the</b> <b>blog</b> to write weekly journals, make films and interviews that are published. Several teachers mention that publishing school work on <b>the</b> <b>blog</b> improves <b>the</b> quality of the school work. It seems that pupils try harder when the school work is published on <b>the</b> <b>blog.</b> Some teachers mention pupils’ age and their ability to write when discussing pupils posting work on <b>the</b> <b>blog.</b> <b>The</b> <b>blog</b> is though a multimodal way to communicate. It seems that <b>the</b> <b>blog</b> has <b>the</b> ability to support both pupils’ writing development and their competencies in multimodal communication. Regarding future use of <b>the</b> <b>blog</b> <b>the</b> teachers have many ideas and all teachers agree that pupils will be given the opportunity to use <b>the</b> <b>blog</b> more in <b>the</b> future. The ideas of future use can be related to the idea of <b>the</b> <b>blog</b> as a virtual third space, a link between home and school. In this third space pupils are able to use knowledge from home when carrying out school tasks.   Since there are few studies regarding <b>blogs</b> in <b>the</b> classroom and especially regarding younger pupils, this study has given a wider perspective regarding <b>the</b> use of <b>blogs</b> in <b>the</b> classroom. ...|$|R

500|$|When the Cuban {{government}} blocked {{access to}} Sánchez's blog from the island, it also blocked {{access to the}} DesdeCuba website, where these other blogs were housed. The other bloggers faced the same challenges Sánchez had in maintaining their blogs, and also needed to find ways around the censorship—either relying on friends with access inside Cuba from their government offices, using complex and time-consuming workarounds to find 'back doors' into their blogs, or reaching out to friends and strangers abroad who volunteered to help, [...] and who posted email blog entries they {{would never be able}} to see. [...] With their blogs targeted to Cuban readers on the island, the discouragement was compounded by knowing that even if they could post, their readers could not read the posts. This limitation was circumvented by making copies of <b>the</b> <b>blogs</b> on CDs, either from computers on the island with access to the website, or sent from friends abroad. [...] Although this method of disseminating <b>the</b> <b>blogs</b> was slow and delayed, and readers could not comment directly on the website, it was quite effective and continues to this day [...] Sanchéz said to a known Venezuelan blogger that visited her in Havana: [...] "In any case we are trying to educate others so blogging would become in Cuba a permanent feature, a means of democratizing citizen expression, as in the free world." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul {{formally}} {{declared his}} candidacy for the 2008 Republican nomination on March 12, 2007, on C-SPAN. Few major politicians endorsed him, and his campaign was largely ignored by traditional media.

In May 2007, shortly after the first televised primary debates, <b>the</b> <b>blogs</b> search engine site Technorati.com listed Paul's name as the term most frequently searched for; and Paul's campaign claimed that Paul had more YouTube channel subscribers than Barack Obama or any other candidate for president.

500|$|After the song's release, critics heavily {{compared}} its {{lyrics to}} Eminem, and suggested Carey alluded {{to him and}} his 'obsession' with her. [...] "Obsessed" [...] never mentions the rapper's name, although reviewers felt it to be very obvious. The song begins with [...] "I was like, 'Why are you so obsessed with me?'", before the music begins. This line references the 2004 film Mean Girls.

Additionally, the song suggests the stalker is under the influence of drugs: It must be the weed, it must be the E / 'Cause you be poppin', heard you get it poppin'." [...] During the chorus, Carey confronts her stalker, asking: Why are you so obsessed with me / Boy I wanna know / Lying that you're sexing me / When everybody knows/ It's clear that you're upset with me / Oh, Oh, Oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress / last man on the earth still couldn't get this." [...] During the song's second verse, critics complimented Carey's lyrics, highlighting phrases such as: You're a mom & pop, I'm a corporation / I'm the press conference, you're a conversation", [...] "suggesting the rapper isn't a worthy suitor".|$|E

2500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began in}} 2002 when Max Niedermaier, {{a physicist at}} the University of Tours, emailed Ted Newman, a physicist at the University of Pittsburgh, alleging that the twins—who had previously had celebrity status for a science fiction television program in France—had spoofed their PhD theses. Rumors spread on Usenet newsgroups that the work was a deliberate hoax intended to target weaknesses in the peer review system employed by the physics community to select papers for publication in academic journals. The story spread like wildfire in public media, prompting Niedermaier to offer an apology to the Bogdanovs, admitting {{that he had not}} read the papers firsthand. While the Bogdanov brothers continued to defend the veracity of their work, a Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) internal report was conducted in private. [...] The conclusions of their reports are confidential and only released to the parties involved. [...] Some physicists have also treated this as evidence of the fallibility inherent within the peer review system.
