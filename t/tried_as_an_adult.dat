5|$|The {{jury found}} Bell guilty, and {{he faced the}} {{possibility}} of up to 22years in prison. The judge scheduled sentencing for September 20, 2007. Bell's new defense attorneys, Bob Noel, Walter Lee Perkins Jr., Peggy Sullivan, Louis Scott and Carol Powell-Lexing, requested a new trial {{on the grounds that}} Bell should not have been <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> A request to lower Bell's $90,000bond was denied on August 24, 2007, due to his juvenile record. Bell had been put on probation for a battery that occurred December 25, 2005. While on probation, he was convicted of another battery charge and two charges of criminal damage to property. One of the battery charges was reportedly for punching a 17-year-old girl in the face. The media had initially reported that Bell had no prior criminal record. On September 4, 2007, Judge Mauffray vacated the conspiracy conviction on the grounds that Bell should have been tried as a juvenile, but he let the battery conviction stand. Bell appealed his conviction, principally on the ground that he had been improperly <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> On September 14, 2007, Louisiana's Third Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Bell's battery conviction, agreeing that this remaining charge was not among those for which a juvenile may be <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b>|$|E

50|$|The human-rights {{organization}} Amnesty International {{opposed the}} effort to <b>try</b> Jordan <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult,</b> citing the mandatory {{life in prison without}} the possibility of parole penalty <b>as</b> <b>a</b> violation of international law.|$|R
5000|$|After the hearing, {{prosecutor}} David Joyce {{indicated that}} he would attempt to <b>try</b> Lane <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> and file three counts of aggravated murder, among other charges, for the incident. [...] It was revealed at the hearing that Lane admitted to shooting 10 rounds of ammunition during the incident. He also told the police {{that he did not}} know the victims and that they were selected randomly. However, a witness who said he knew the shooter indicated that Lane knew several of the victims.|$|R

He eventually got 10 years of probation and {{went on to become a}} lawyer in Florida.|$|E
25|$|Consensual (between minors) sexual {{intercourse}} over the 2-year age difference (where the minor is under 13 years old) would subject the older minor to {{a charge of}} Sexual Assault, 1st Degree, in violation of C.G.S. §53a-70(a)(2). A guilty verdict would result in conviction of a Class A felony sex offense, with a mandatory minimum of 5–10 years and maximum 25 years imprisonment. Any juvenile offender 14 years old or older has the case automatically transferred to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court by operation of law, and thus stands before the court to be <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> However, the offender {{would have the same}} chance to apply for Youthful Offender status (see Sexual Assault, 2nd Degree above) provided the criteria are met.|$|E
25|$|Surviving pirate Abduwali Muse {{was held}} on Boxer and was {{eventually}} flown to the United States for trial. Prosecutors brought charges in a federal courtroom in New York City that included piracy, conspiracy to seize a ship by force, and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking. Muse's lawyers asked that he be tried as a juvenile, alleging that he was either 15 or 16 {{years old at the}} time of the hostage-taking, but the court ruled that Muse was not a juvenile and would be <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> He later admitted that he was 18 years old and pleaded guilty to hijacking, kidnapping, and hostage-taking charges in lieu of piracy charges. He received a prison sentence of 33 years and nine months.|$|E
50|$|Regarding juveniles' {{knowledge}} about criminal court, {{it has been}} found that most adolescent offenders are ignorant of the transfer laws that may force them to be <b>tried</b> and sentenced <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult,</b> and it is suggested that a previous knowledge of these laws might have deterred them from committing their crime.|$|R
50|$|Following his arrest, Ramsey {{claimed he}} did not {{understand}} his actions would kill anyone. His trial was delayed as prosecutors discussed whether Ramsey should be <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> juvenile or <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> Prosecutors decided to <b>try</b> Ramsey <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> in Anchorage. On Dec. 2, 1998, Ramsey was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder, three counts of first-degree attempted murder, and fifteen counts of third-degree assault. Judge Mark Isaac Wood sentenced him to 210 years in prison; on appeal, however, his sentence was reduced to two 99-year prison sentences. He is imprisoned at the Spring Creek Correctional Center in Seward, and will be eligible for parole in 2064, when he will be 82 years old.|$|R
5000|$|The jury deliberated {{for four}} hours, finding Dassey guilty of first-degree {{intentional}} homicide, rape and mutilation of a corpse. [...] Though only 17 {{years old at}} the time, Dassey was <b>tried</b> and sentenced <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult,</b> and his intellectual limitations were ruled irrelevant.

25|$|Consensual sexual {{intercourse}} over the 3-year age difference (where the minor is 13 to 15 years old) would subject the older party to {{a charge of}} Sexual Assault, 2nd Degree, in violation of C.G.S. §53a-71(a)(1). Any juvenile offender 14 years old or older has the case automatically transferred to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court by operation of law, and thus stands before the court to be <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> See C.G.S. §46b-127(a). A guilty verdict would result in conviction of a Class B felony sex offense, with a mandatory minimum of 9 months and maximum 20 years imprisonment. It would not matter if the older person {{did not know of}} the age difference, or if the younger person lied about age. However, if the offender is 17 years old or younger, has a clean record, and such sexual activity was consensual, Youthful Offender status (a pre-trial diversionary program that seals the court record and results in a dismissal of charges) may be granted. See C.G.S. §54-76b to o.|$|E

When Judge John Lohn ruled that Lynch would be <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult,</b> Thompson passed a message from Mishne's father to the judge, asserting that [...] "the attorneys had better tell the jury about the violent video game that trained this kid [...] showed him how to kill our daughter, JoLynn.

500|$|Following the shooting, {{police arrested}} James Newman and booked {{him as an}} adult on charges of {{suspicion}} of attempted murder, use of a deadly weapon and use of a firearm by a minor in Washoe County Jail with a bail of $150,000. However, his trial was put on hold as prosecutors discussed whether he should be <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> or juvenile. Washoe District Attorney Richard Gammick had announced on March 17 that the evidence given did not support Newman being charged as an adult. By May 2006, Newman was tried as a juvenile by the Jan Evans Juvenile Justice Center for the charges of two counts of battery with a deadly weapon, instead of the initial charges and was put under house arrest until he completed 200 hours of community service.|$|E
50|$|On May 29, 2015, {{a hearing}} that will {{determine}} whether the case will be moved to a juvenile court was rescheduled for June 22. The proper trial for the stabbing rampage was also rescheduled for at least July 6. On June 23, victims of the rampage testified in court about their injuries and urged the judge to <b>try</b> Hribal <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> On September 24, a judge ruled that Hribal must be transferred from a juvenile detention center to Westmoreland County Prison when he turns eighteen years old. This transfer was carried out on October 1, and the judge refused to set bail for Hribal on October 26, citing public safety concerns.|$|R
5000|$|Authorities {{have called}} the killings the [...] "worst single {{criminal}} event in Broken Arrow history". The brothers were charged with five counts of first-degree murder and one count of assault and battery with intent to kill. On July 25, authorities announced that Michael Bever will be charged <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> <b>A</b> conviction on first-degree murder carries the punishment of life imprisonment or the death penalty. However, the Tulsa County District Attorney stated that Michael Bever will be exempt from a death sentence since he was {{under the age of}} 18 {{at the time of the}} familicide. Bever's attorney argued against the constitutionality of the decision to <b>try</b> Bever <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult,</b> stating that his client will die in prison and that it is the same as the death penalty. He also tried to argue that Bever should be rehabilitated instead of imprisoned if he was physically and emotionally abused at home, though no evidence indicated any abuse occurring in the Bever home.|$|R
5000|$|Hulin {{entered the}} Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) system after setting trash on fire. Hulin {{produced}} Molotov cocktails {{and threw them}} over a fence, which, according to an incident report, [...] "caused a small fire {{in a pile of}} empty cans against the outside wall of the residence." [...] At the time of his arrest, Hulin was one month shy of his 17th birthday thus was considered a juvenile under Texas law. However, a 17-year-old under Texas law is considered to be <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> in the state penal system. The juvenile court debated whether to <b>try</b> Hulin <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adult; the political climate of the mid-1990s in Texas supported the trying of juvenile offenders as adults. After the court system decided to <b>try</b> Hulin <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult,</b> Hulin learned that he had two choices if he took a plea agreement for two charges of second-degree arson. He could enroll in boot camp and probation, and would receive two 15 year sentences if he failed. He could also take eight years in prison with the possibility of parole in two years. Hulin chose the latter option.|$|R

On July 2, three members of the Spokane Court of Appeals convinced Judge Evan Sperline to allow court-appointed psychiatrist Joan Petrich to present a testimony based on Loukaitis' mental health. The trial was later moved to Seattle, Washington due to media publicity. Loukaitis had pleaded insanity on all charges against him, and claimed that [...] "mood swings" [...] were the cause of his violent actions. During his trial, Joan Petrich testified that Loukaitis had been experiencing delusional and messianic thoughts before the shooting. She had stated, [...] "He felt like he was God and would laugh to himself. He felt he was superior to other people, and then those feelings were later replaced by hate, disdain, and not measuring up." ...|$|E

After the United Nations adopted the CRC in 1989, the United States became a signatory nation in 1994. However, to date the country has refused to ratify the Convention, joining only one other {{nation in the world}} with that status. Among the reasons the United States has failed to ratify the Convention {{is the fact that the}} Convention clearly states that anyone under the age of 18 is a child. The U.S. government has reservations about how that would affect matters when a 16- or 17-year-old commits a crime; currently, in certain instances, such a person can be <b>tried</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> in the U.S. courts.

Lamb, who turned 17 during the trial, was <b>tried</b> and convicted <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> for [...] "breaking, entering and theft ... possession of a [...]22 calibre revolver, dangerous to public peace". Motivated by a presentence investigation report characterising Lamb as exceptionally violent, Magistrate J.
