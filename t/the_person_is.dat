5|$|A seizure {{does not}} occur just because the {{government}} questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. <b>The</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E

5|$|Detection of {{particular}} antibodies {{is a very}} common form of medical diagnostics, and applications such as serology depend on these methods. For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis, a titer of antibodies directed against Epstein-Barr virus or Lyme disease is estimated from the blood. If those antibodies are not present, either <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not infected or the infection occurred {{a very long time}} ago, and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed.|$|E
5|$|In Arizona v. Gant (2009), the Court {{ruled that}} a law {{enforcement}} officer needs a warrant before searching a motor vehicle after an arrest of an occupant of that vehicle, unless 1) {{at the time of}} the search the person being arrested is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment of the vehicle or 2) police officers have reason to believe that evidence for the crime for which <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> being arrested will be found in the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|Pharmacological {{treatment}} {{can help to}} manage psychiatric or behavioral problems. Medication {{is also used to}} control post-traumatic epilepsy; however the preventive use of anti-epileptics is not recommended. In those cases where <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> bedridden due to a reduction of consciousness, has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems, or has any other problem heavily impacting self-caring capacities, caregiving and nursing are critical.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} to spot as <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent studies have shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E
5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt {{oral administration}} of drugs when pain occurs, starting, if <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not in severe pain, with non-opioid {{drugs such as}} paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. Then, if complete pain relief is not achieved or disease progression necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine or tramadol {{are added to the}} existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E
5|$|The viral load of an {{infected}} person {{is an important}} risk factor in both sexual and mother-to-child transmission. During the first 2.5months of an HIV infection a person's infectiousness is twelve times higher due to this high viral load. If <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> in the late stages of infection, rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater.|$|E

5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> the {{infringement}} {{of the right}} to bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's disease (HD), {{also known}} as Huntington's chorea, is an {{inherited}} disorder that results in death of brain cells. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases start {{before the age of}} 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson's disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems.|$|E
5|$|In addition, at {{some time}} between {{the date of the}} writ of {{election}} and 12:00 noon on nomination day, the potential candidate or someone on his or her behalf must hand to the returning officer a deposit amounting to three times of 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the preceding calendar year, rounded to the nearest $500. At the 2017 presidential election, the deposit was $43,500. The deposit is returned if <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not nominated as a candidate, withdraws his or her candidature, or is eventually elected. If the candidate is unsuccessful at the election, the deposit is only repaid if he or she polled more than one-eighth {{of the total number of}} votes polled, not including rejected votes.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is very important}} in this species. It has roles in alerting others of the identity, physical state and position of the individual. It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and is thought to have evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, etoposide or vinorelbine.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of gastroenteritis in {{both children and}} adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery may be required {{if there is a}} decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe. Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars. Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea. Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not willing to drink them. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted. In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient.|$|E
5|$|The role {{of intent}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, intent is important but not an essential precondition of sin or wrong conduct. Evil intent forms only one of the modes of committing sin. Any action committed, knowingly or unknowingly, has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a person is guilty of violence only if he had an intention to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> guilty of it, whether or not he had an intention to commit it.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> able to tolerate a transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.|$|E
5|$|When the {{question}} of whether a person is alive or dead arises, and it is shown that he was alive within 30 years, the burden of proving {{that he or she is}} dead lies on the person who affirms it. However, if it is proved that he or she has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of the person if he or she had been alive, the burden of proving that <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> alive shifts to the person who affirms this.|$|E
5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E
5|$|Stabilizing <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> {{the first}} priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to}} be intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> Captain John Hart (James Marsters), {{a fellow}} Time Agent and former lover of Jack. He is {{responsible}} for the death, and a public disturbance at a nightclub. After a passionate kiss and brief fight at the nightclub, John tells Jack that the Time Agency was disbanded and he has since undergone several rehabilitation programmes, before the team catch up with Jack and are introduced to John. John accompanies the team back to the Hub, where he tells the team of three cylindrical devices scattered throughout Cardiff, which he explains are radioactive cluster bombs, and he requires help to defuse them. Thus, they split into three pairs: Jack and administrator Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd) search an office block (during which Jack successfully asks Ianto out on a date), doctor Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) and technical expert Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) search a warehouse, and police liaison Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) and John search the nearby docks.|$|E
5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> demented.|$|E
25|$|As {{we try to}} find {{evidence}} of his clairvoyance, {{for the time being}} the null hypothesis is that <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not clairvoyant. The alternative is, of course: <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> (more or less) clairvoyant.|$|E
