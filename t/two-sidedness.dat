Gastrointestinal lumen is exposed to many inflammatory agents such as foods, free radicals and bacterial or viral antigens. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the possible role of NF-κB 1 in gastric adenocarcinoma. To detect the relative level of NF-κB 1 transcript, total RNA was extracted from tissue specimens, a cDNA library was generated, and quantitative RT-PCR was performed for thirty human gastric adenocarcinoma tissue samples and thirty matched normal gastric tissue samples. NF-κB 1 expression showed <b>two-sidedness,</b> which means that a group of 11 sample pairs showed up-regulation and a group of 16 sample pairs showed down-regulation. No histopathologic characteristics of samples could justify the observed <b>two-sidedness.</b> The NF-κB 1 <b>two-sidedness</b> expression indicates the involvement of NF-κB 1 and in a larger scale, NF-κB signaling pathway in gastric carcinogenesis.

40|$|Pricing {{pressure}} indices {{have recently}} been proposed as alternative screening devices for horizontal mergers involving differentiated products. We extend the concept of Upward Pricing Pressure (UPP) proposed by Farrell and Shapiro (2010) to two-sided markets. Examples of such markets are the newspaper market, where the demand for advertising {{is related to the}} number of readers, and the market for online search, where advertising demand depends on the number of users. The formulas we derive are useful for screening mergers among two-sided platforms. Due to the <b>two-sidedness</b> they depend on four sets of diversion ratios that can either be estimated using market-level demand data or elicited in surveys. In an application, we evaluate a hypothetical merger in the Dutch daily newspaper market.

We then identify the crucial elements that make a market two-sided and explain that <b>two-sidedness</b> {{is a matter of}} degree. Drawing from both economic theory and competition policy practice, we derive suggestions for the identification of the two-sided nature of a market. We argue that one can follow different qualitative or quantitative approaches. A qualitative approach is sufficient to establish whether the market is two-sided. A quantitative approach is more time-consuming but it allows measuring the degree of <b>two-sidedness.</b> Hence, a qualitative approach is a useful preliminary tool, but a quantitative approach is often necessary for a correct decision, if the market is two-sided. Our suggestions are relevant not only for the analysis of traditional markets, such as newspapers and payment cards, but also for the analysis of many new markets, such as those for online social networks, online search engines and Internet news aggregators. Given the time constraints competition authorities face, we would expect most quantitative approaches to {{take the form of a}} well-designed survey of customers on both sides of the markets.

This investigation has been attempted to provide for the prediction of the response action of fish to acoustic sound.

The over all length of the silver crucian carp, Carassius auratus (Japanese name HIBUNA) used in the experiment was 42 mm in overall length and 3. 45 g. in weight. The results obtained were as follows: 1) The characters of the response action were obtained by the statistical analysis of the stochastic processes, and this method was effectual. 2) The behaviour of the fish under the stimulus had <b>two-sidedness,</b> i. e., two contrary tendencies to rise or to diminish the action which the fish had shown at no stimulus. These tendencies depended on the frequencies. 3) In this experiment, the frequency equivalent to the boundary of <b>two-sidedness</b> mentioned above was 900 Hz, which was in agreement with the resonance frequency of the air bladder of the fish. 体長 42 mm,体重 3. 45 gの『ヒブナ』を用いて,入力として 8 種類の周波数の刺激純音を与え,これに対する魚の反応行動解析を試みた。実験の結果は次の通りであった。 1) 不規則な生物行動現象の解析においても確率過程としての取扱いが有効であった。 2) 魚の音に対する反応行動現象は音の周波数の相違により運動がより活発になる傾向と逆に不活発となる傾向の二面がある。 3) 上記した二面性の境界ともいうべき音の周波数は魚のうき袋の共振周波数と一致しており,反応行動とうき袋の役割りとの関係が充分考えられる...|$|E

Contrary to this result, only applying the rules of TOM to the PDG (including the precedence norm) yields mutual defection from all initial states (except initial state (3, 3)). It appears that TOM achieves the cooperative outcomes by introducing a concept of voluntary cooperation (magnanimity) and an interpretation of self-interest (the <b>Two-Sidedness</b> Convention), which are both based on collective rationality. Specifically, these elements of TOM ignore the conflict between individual and collective rationality, which characterizes the dilemma of the PDG.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{market segmentation}} in a two-sided market {{that consists of}} media consumers and advertisers. The analysis is motivated by a European Court of Justice Decision in October 2011, which allowed viewers {{to take advantage of}} international price differences and buy access to Premier League TV matches from whichever country they like. We compare complete market segmentation with the new situation where consumers can purchase from abroad (allowing for passive sales). Clearly, such a change is likely to harm Premier League, which at present is sold at different prices to viewers in different countries. More surprisingly, we find that all viewers - including those that switch to purchasing from abroad - might also be harmed. We further show that the <b>two-sidedness</b> of the market may break down in the country that attracts foreign viewers...|$|E

The model developed in this paper leads to a natural explanation for one side of the market singlehoming, and the other side multihoming. As such, it is well suited for investigating other industries, more in particular those where a platform needs several other up- or downstream platforms to succeed in business.

This allows us to examine the evolution of the industry both in the short-run (the network “chicken-egg ” dynamics) and in the long-run (dynamics resulting from changes in costs and income). Our analyses show that declining card service cost is consistent with increasing interchange fees. This is because a monopoly card network, while internalizing the two-sided market effects, has the incentive to inflate the nominal value of card transactions. As card service costs decline, lowering card fees to consumers and raising fees to merchants helps to boost its demand and profit. In addition our results show that the social planner prefers lower merchant fees and higher consumer fees, relative to the monopoly outcome. Furthermore, a price ceiling on merchant fees may improve welfare...|$|E

In addition we argue that an econometric analysis that does not incorporate these features can lead to biased estimates of elasticities. As demand substitution is a crucial element for defining market, bad estimates of elasticities could blur the boundaries of relevant markets. Second we propose a simple model that encompasses these features and in particular the <b>two-sidedness</b> of the market. Thirdly, we review some empirical papers that analyse the issue of demand estimation in printed media. Finally, we perform a statistical estimation on a dataset of magazines in order to provide a measure of the possible bias that could arise in the estimation of elasticities when one does not use a proper model. market definition; printed media; two-sided markets...|$|E

A direct corollary of our curvature estimates is a smooth compactness theorem which is an essential ingredient in the min-max theory of free boundary minimal hypersurfaces developed by the last two authors. We also prove a monotonicity formula for free boundary minimal submanifolds in Riemannian manifolds for any dimension and codimension. For the case of $ 3 $-manifolds with boundary, we prove a stronger curvature estimate for properly embedded stable free boundary minimal surfaces without any assumption on the area bound. This generalizes Schoen's interior curvature estimates to the free boundary setting. Our proof uses the theory of minimal laminations developed by Colding and Minicozzi.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{model of}} trade protection against a foreign monopolist {{suggests that a}} home country should often impose a tariff on the foreign firm, even though the this introduces an additional distortion. In this paper, I generalize the traditional model to include a basic network externality, e. g., the foreign firm also generates third party advertisement revenue from its product, and I determine that the network externality {{will result in a}} positive optimal tariff under a larger set of convex functions than in the traditional model. In this case, the firm has an additional gain from sales and so it is willing to bare a larger burden of the tax to maintain sales. Extending the model to include two-sided products (e. g., smartphones with consumers and app providers or video game consoles with consumers and game developers) leads to further results. With <b>two-sidedness,</b> the firm is able to alleviate some of the burden of the tariff through rent transfers {{from one side of the}} market to the other which makes a positive tariff policy optimal for these industries...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the rationale of airport business models. First, it provides {{evidence that the}} airports {{should be considered as}} two sided markets because of significant network externalities between the airlines and the passengers. This result invalidates the traditional approach where the airport-airline-passenger relationship is considered as vertically integrated, taking passengers as final consumers. Second, a testing procedure aimed at eliciting the real business model of airports demonstrates that the major U. S. airports do not internalize the externalities existing between airlines and passengers. We find that these airports set profit maximizing prices for the non-aeronautical services to passengers and Ramsey prices for the aeronautical services to airlines. Given these results, we conduct a welfare analysis by simulating the implementation of profit maximizing prices when an airport fully accounts for the <b>two-sidedness</b> of its activities. In particular, we show that the impact on social welfare is not independent on the specific features of each airport and that the privatization of airports cannot be considered as the only solution for airports...|$|E
40|$|The {{award of}} the Nobel Prize in Economics to Professor Jean Tirole in 2014 has {{generated}} intense interest about his brainchild theory of two-sided markets. Against this background, this paper explores {{whether there is}} such a thing as a unified theory of two-sided markets and whether the two-sided markets literature can readily be applied by antitrust agencies, regulatory authorities and courts. This paper vindicates caution. The buzz surrounding two-sided markets could mask the fact that, in many cases, the policy implications of the theory are not yet clear, and that divergences among its proponents are often underplayed. In that regard, the paper notably stresses that one of the key conditions of market <b>two-sidedness</b> identified by Rochet and Tirole in their seminal paper of 2003 – the unavailability of Coasian bargaining between both sides of a platform – has often disappeared from subsequent scholarship. This omission threatens the coherent implementation of the theory of two-sided markets. Without this qualification, markets are often mischaracterized as two-sided, as soon as they display prima facie signs of indirect network externalities...|$|E
40|$|Very {{preliminary}} {{and incomplete}} This paper analyzes {{issues associated with}} network effects and <b>two-sidedness</b> {{in the market for}} professional sports. Teams in professional sports leagues have to compete both for players (inputs) and for fans (consumers). In this setting, two-sided network effects are important since fans are more attracted to a team with higher-quality players and, at the same time, players want to show their ability in front of a larger number of fans. Unlike previous work on two-sided markets we introduce players ’ quality as medium to affect fan’s demand so that the level of competition in the market for fans critically depends on the number of high quality players between teams: it may lessen competition due to product differentiation effect, otherwise it intensifies competition. Moreover, these effects are augmented by having positive externality loop. Also, to analyze the important of competitive balance issue in professional sports leagues we consider two types of quality effects: proportional and constant quality gap effects on fan’s utility. We show that the competitive balance depends on the relative magnitude of these quality effects. JEL Classification: L 83, L 14, L 15...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we contend {{that there is}} little idiographic {{empirical}} research that considers the issue of deliberate networking action in network contexts. The ability of an organisation to manage in a network context involves the three myths of; action, limits to discretion and completeness (Ford et al., 2003). The corresponding dualities of inter-dependence, interaction and incompleteness are said to reflect the reality of being embedded in and managing in relationships and networks. In other words there is a <b>two-sidedness</b> for the organisational unit embedded in a network; the pull of the network and the action of the individual organisation (Håkansson and Ford, 2002; Möller and Halinen, 1999; Möller and Svahn, 2003; Ritter, Wilkinson and Johnston, 2004; Zolkiewski, 2007). Yet the paradox logic reminds us that an individual, embedded firm still needs to act, to try and control and influence, to suggest ideas and initiatives, set limits and seek opportunities. We address the issue of deliberate networking action in network contexts through the use of two complementary case studies. Both cases are examples of firms attempting deliberate networking action or experimentation in strategy project settings. Both projects are triggered by problems within the organisation concerned with capacity and competitiveness, and a relational solution is perceive...|$|E
40|$|This paper studies {{endogenous}} coalition {{formation in}} a rivalry environment where continuing conflict exists. A group of heterogeneous players {{compete for a}} prize with the probability of winning for a player depending on his strength {{as well as the}} distribution of strengths among his rivals. Players can pool their strengths together to increase their probabilities of winning as a group through coalition formation. The players in the winning coalition will compete further until one individual winner is left. We show that in any equilibrium there are only two coalitions in the initial stage of the contest. In the case of three players, the equilibrium often has a coalition of the two weaker players against the strongest. The equilibrium coalition structure with four players mainly takes one of the two forms: a coalition of the three weaker players against the strongest or a coalition of the weakest and strongest players against a coalition of the remaining two. Our findings imply that the rivalry with the possibility of coalition formation in our model exhibits a pattern of <b>two-sidedness</b> and a balance of power. We further study the impact of binding agreements by coalition members on equilibrium coalition structures.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{issues associated}} with network effects and <b>two-sidedness</b> {{in the market for}} professional team sports. Teams in professional sports leagues have to compete both for players (inputs) and fans (consumers). In this setting, we construct a theoretical framework where fans are more attracted to a team with a large portion of talented players from a fixed talent pool, {{at the same time that}} players want to show their ability in front of a large number of fans. We observe that either perfect imbalance or alleviated imbalance will prevail as an equilibrium. The outcome depends upon the relative magnitude of two opposite effects, the product differentiation effect and the wage reduction effect caused by externalities from the size of talented players and fans respectively. Furthermore, we incorporate asymmetric relative quality effects into consumers ’ utility in order to analyze its impact on competitive balance. This is shown to either exacerbate or improve the imbalanced distribution of talented players, depending on fans ’ sensitivity to the relative quality between teams. The policy implications of revenue sharing on competitive balance and the level of wage offers under the condition of two-sided network effects are analyzed.

40|$|The {{question}} of Russian national identity has become quite significant {{again after the}} fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Especially after Vladimir Putin came to power and the country regained its political and military strength, the Russian state embarked on the (sometimes ambiguous) road of nation-building. Scholars of nationalism and Russian national identity have tried to analyze this ‘Russian Question’, whereby most concluded that there is not a coherent Russian national identity. In this sense, it is useful to look at national identity in some of Russia’s specific regions. This thesis analyzes this process in the case of Russia’s most-western region, Kaliningrad. This so-called exclave has only been part of Russian since the Second World War and due to its German history and geographical distance from homeland Russia, it occupies a special position inside the country. In the process of nation-building by the Russian state, officials cannot solely use ‘common’ Russian markers of identity but also have to take Kaliningrad’s ‘particular’ circumstances into account. This thesis therefore argues that the Russian nation-building process in Kaliningrad lies ‘between commonality and particularity’. It will analyze this <b>two-sidedness</b> through the symbolic, military and anti-Western dimensions of nation-building in Kaliningrad; the speeches and statements of Russian officials in this light are used as the main points of analysis...|$|E
