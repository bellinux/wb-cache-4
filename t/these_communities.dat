5|$|Before 1950, Gulfton {{consisted}} of farm land {{and much of}} the area belonged to Westmoreland Farms. In the mid-1950s, the Shenandoah subdivision was established; consisting of sixteen city blocks of ranch-style homes. Shenandoah was located adjacent to the land which would later become the site of the Gulfton apartment complexes. Decades later <b>these</b> <b>communities</b> would clash as the apartments surrounding Shenandoah deteriorated and property values became threatened.|$|E

Small microbial pinnacles are also present, and it appears that the large conical stromatolites and the small pinnacles are made by different microbial communities. <b>These</b> <b>communities</b> provide an important analog to some of the oldest fossil stromatolites found to date.|$|E

5|$|Communities {{have formed}} around the creation, play and {{discussion}} of LARP. <b>These</b> <b>communities</b> have developed a subculture that crosses over with role-playing, fan, reenactment, and drama subcultures. Early LARP subculture focused on Tolkien-like fantasy, but it later broadened to include appreciation of other genres, especially the horror genre with the rapid uptake of the World of Darkness setting in the 1990s. Like many subcultures, LARP groups often have a common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that can be regarded {{by some as a}} lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 the Treaties of Rome {{established}} two, similar, communities {{creating a}} common market (European Economic Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however {{they had a}} separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission in <b>these</b> <b>Communities.</b> The {{reason for this is}} the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.|$|E

5|$|Indian women {{negotiate}} survival {{through an}} array of oppressive patriarchal family structures: age, ordinal status, relationship to men through family of origin, marriage and procreation as well as patriarchal attributes. Examples of patriarchal attributes include: dowry, siring sons etc., kinship, caste, community, village, market and the state. It should however be noted that several communities in India, such as the Nairs of Kerala, Shettys of Mangalore, certain Maratha clans, and Bengali families exhibit matriarchal tendencies. In <b>these</b> <b>communities,</b> {{the head of the}} family is the oldest woman rather than the oldest man. Sikh culture is also regarded as relatively gender-neutral.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Eddy was a Massachusetts-born {{resident}} of Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, where the fort was located. He and John Allan, {{both of whom}} served in the provincial assembly, were the prime movers of Patriot activity in the area, {{which was one of}} several hotbeds of agitation in Nova Scotia. The other major areas of Patriot activity were Maugerville in the St. John River valley of Sunbury County (present-day New Brunswick), and Cobequid, and there were also pockets of activity in Pictou and the Passamaquoddy Bay area, which separates present-day Maine and New Brunswick. Patriots in <b>these</b> <b>communities</b> were in contact with each other, and those of Cumberland and Maugerville were active in trying to interest nearby natives (Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and Mi'kmaq) in their cause.|$|E
5|$|Polar bears can be {{hunted for}} sport in Canada {{with a special}} permit and accompaniment by a local guide. This can be an {{important}} source of income for small communities, as guided hunts bring in more income than selling the polar bear hide on markets. The United States, Russia, Norway, Greenland, and Canada allow subsistence hunting, and Canada distributes hunting permits to indigenous communities. The selling of these permits is a main source of income for many of <b>these</b> <b>communities.</b> Their hides can be used for subsistence purposes, kept as hunting trophies, or can be bought in markets.|$|E

Although microbial mats were once widespread, the evolution of grazing organisms in the Cambrian vastly reduced their numbers. <b>These</b> <b>communities</b> are now limited to inhospitable refugia, such as the stromatolites found in Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve in Shark Bay, Western Australia where the salt levels can be twice those of the surrounding sea.|$|E
5|$|The Igu Aro festival (counting of the year) was a royal festival the eze Nri used to {{maintain}} his influence over the communities under his authority. Each of <b>these</b> <b>communities</b> sent representatives to pay tribute during the ceremony to show their loyalty. At the end the Eze Nri would give the representatives a yam medicine and a blessing of fertility for their communities. The festival {{was seen as a}} day of peace and certain activities were prohibited such as the planting of crops before the day of the ceremony, the splitting of wood and unnecessary noise. Igu Aro was a regular event that gave an opportunity for the eze to speak directly to all the communities under him.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduced}} common blackbird is, {{together with}} the native silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), the most widely distributed avian seed disperser in New Zealand. Introduced there along with the song thrush (Turdus philomelos) in 1862, it has spread throughout the country up to an elevation of , as well as outlying islands such as the Campbell and Kermadecs. It eats {{a wide range of}} native and exotic fruit, and makes a major contribution to the development of communities of naturalised woody weeds. <b>These</b> <b>communities</b> provide fruit more suited to non-endemic native birds and naturalised birds, than to endemic birds.|$|E

Between the 1970s and 1990s, US 98 was rerouted to bypass Tylertown, Columbia, Hattiesburg, Beaumont, McLain, and Lucedale.

5|$|Bounded on each {{sides by}} {{military}} training grounds, the I-80 corridor is overflown by commercial airliners traveling west from Salt Lake City International Airport. The freeway veers north around the Cedar Mountains {{in a small}} gap {{between them and the}} Lakeside Mountains. Further east, the highway passes the Stansbury Mountains, which are located in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. After the mountain ranges, the freeway arrives at the southern shore of the Great Salt Lake and closely follows the shore towards the western suburbs of Salt Lake City. However, the historical routes from which the route of I-80 was derived were routed further from the lake, passing through the towns of Grantsville and Tooele before crossing a bottleneck between the Oquirrh Mountains and Stansbury Island in the Great Salt Lake. <b>These</b> <b>communities</b> are now served by SR-138 and SR-36 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, <b>these</b> <b>communities</b> should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
