Although unsure {{what he wanted to}} do with his life, Pirkis was cast for his first professional role in 2003, when he appeared in the successful film, [...] The hire occurred after production staff visited Eton to hire boys for the ship's teenage crew. Pirkis attended a workshop and auditions as [...] "a joke", ultimately securing the part of the 13-year-old, eventually one-armed midshipman Lord Blakeney of HMS Surprise. Director Peter Weir thought Pirkis [...] "stood out very early on, but not to the extent <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the film. That was a complete surprise." [...] According to Pirkis, he was at first [...] "nervous" [...] about acting with Russell Crowe, but changed his mind when he realised that Crowe was [...] "a pretty normal guy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Quite a lot, but in {{the sense}} in my {{preparation}} to find the Walter {{that we all know}} now, I {{had to go back to}} him right at the beginning to see where he came from. So that process was started before the pilot really, what was this man like before he deteriorated, so I was able to revisit that. Physically, of course, what I had to do was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by my hair and makeup and special effects people here in terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well. And then we, the shot up through these beautiful lenses that we got a different feel to the episode than we would now. All of those elements work together... to create this version <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Webber hired Ben van Os as his {{production}} designer because [...] "... he wasn't {{intimidated by the}} period obligations. He was {{much more interested in}} story and character." [...] For inspiration in constructing the film's sets, Webber and van Os studied the works of Vermeer and other artists of the period, such as Gerard ter Borch. Set designer Todd van Hulzen said the goal was to [...] "... reflect that quiet, sober, almost moralizing ethos <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> Dutch paintings." [...] They built Vermeer's house on one of Luxembourg's largest film soundstages, a three-story set where they designed rooms that were meant to convey a lack of privacy. According to van Os, the film was about [...] "being observed," [...] so they intended Griet to always feel that she was being watched. In addition, they built two other interior sets to represent the homes of Griet and van Ruijven– Griet's home possessed Calvinistic characteristics while van Ruijven's contained mounted animals to reflect his [...] "predatory nature." [...] The Mauritshuis museum made a high resolution photograph of the actual painting, which was then shot on a rostrum camera {{to be used in the}} film.|$|E

2500|$|Mike Langberg of Knight Ridder {{was less}} positive, writing {{in his review}} that [...] "At first glance, the CD-ROM {{provides}} a lot of raw material. There are 350 brief animations, running two or three seconds each, showing 17 characters from the show in numerous poses. The CD-ROM delivery, unfortunately, falls flat." [...] He explained that [...] "Simpsons Cartoon Studio is awkward to operate and limited in what it can accomplish, producing animated sequences that are jerky and out of sync. The CD-ROM comes with 15 cartoons created by the developers, running from 10 seconds to 55 seconds. None flow smoothly or tell funny stories. There's no reason to expect {{the rest of us}} will do any better." [...] Similarly, Nancy Malitz of The Detroit News wrote that [...] "you move the characters around and invent the scenarios, but in the end you might feel your creativity wasn't heavily challenged. The whole deal is essentially a cut-and-paste operation. You can't create characters of your own, and the kind of automatic synchronization of sounds with movement <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> a simple product like Video Jam isn't available, so things look sort of choppy no matter how hard you try." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} on All Things Considered, Yale University history professor Beverly Gage, {{who is writing a}} biography of Hoover, stated that the film accurately conveys that Hoover came to the FBI as a reformer seeking [...] "to clean it up, to professionalize it," [...] and to introduce scientific methods to its investigation, eventually including such practices as fingerprinting and bloodtyping. She praises DiCaprio for conveying the tempo of Hoover's speech. However, she notes that the film's central narrative device in which Hoover dictates his memoirs to FBI agents chosen as writers, is fictitious: [...] "He didn't ever have the sort of formal situation <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the movie where he was dictating a memoir to a series of young agents, and that that is the official record of the FBI." [...] Historian Aaron J. Stockham of the Waterford School, whose dissertation was on the relationship of the FBI and the US Congress during the Hoover years, wrote on the History News Network of George Mason University, [...] "J. Edgar portrays Hoover as the man who successfully integrated scientific processes into law enforcement investigations.... There is no doubt, from the historical record, that Hoover was instrumental in creating the FBI's scientific reputation." [...] Stockham notes that Hoover probably did not write the FBI–King suicide letter to Martin Luther King, Jr., as the film portrays: [...] "While such a letter was written, Hoover almost certainly delegated it to others within the Bureau." ...|$|E

60|$|Sir Thomas More.--From that complacent tone {{it may be}} presumed <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> it proof both {{of moral}} and {{intellectual}} improvement. Montesinos, I must disturb that comfortable opinion, and call upon you to examine {{how much of this}} refinement which passes for improvement is superficial. True it is that controversy is carried on with more decency than it was by Martin Lutherand a certain Lord Chancellor, to whom you just now alluded; but if more courtesy {{is to be found in}} polemical writers, who are less sincere than either the one or the other, there is as much acerbity of feeling and as much bitterness of heart. You have a class of miscreants which had no existence in those days--the panders of the press, who live by administering to the vilest passions of the people, and encouraging their most dangerous errors, practising upon their ignorance, and inculcating whatever is most pernicious in principle and most dangerous to society. This is their golden age; for though such men would in any age have taken to some villainy or other, never could they have found a course at once so gainful and so safe. Long impunity has taught them to despise the laws which they defy, and the institutions which they are labouring to subvert; any further responsibility enters not into their creed, if that may be called a creed, in which all the articles are negative. I? we turn from politics to what should be humaner literature, and look at the self-constituted censors of whatever has passed the press, there also we shall find that they who are the most incompetent assume the most authority, and that the public favour such pretensions; for in quackery of every kind, whether medical, political, critical, or hypocritical, quo quis impudentior eo doctior habetur.|$|E
