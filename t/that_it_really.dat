5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E

These have taken various forms, interpreted in a scientific, rather than a wonder-filled manner, to accord with modern perceptions of reality.|$|E

500|$|Desplat's {{work also}} {{garnered}} positive reviews. The New York Times {{described it as}} a [...] "... gorgeous score ..." [...] which [...] "... brushes in a haunted gloom that gives the picture life where none seems to exist ...," [...] whilst Boston.com said it [...] "... burbles with elegant baroque minimalism." [...] Empire magazine called his score [...] "... a supremely elegant work ..."

500|$|ABC News's Allan Raible {{described}} the album as among his best work, writing, [...] "What makes this one sharp is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> captures the current culture {{in a bubble}} {{in a way that}} is more pinpointed than on previous records." [...] Billboard considered the record's original songs its best material, and [...] "Word Crimes" [...] the best parody. Paste similarly agreed that Yankovic's original materials were the highlight of the album, and that as a whole, Mandatory Fun is [...] "a good, humorous album that shows that Yankovic is not slowing down in the slightest".|$|E
500|$|Elysa Gardner from USA Today advised {{people who}} buy the album to skip the song. In his {{negative}} review for the album, Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine {{found it difficult to}} think of a song more unrefined or more irritating than [...] "Peacock". He believed all reviews of Teenage Dream will discuss the track, which will be because it is [...] "potentially historic in its badness, to the point that, once you've heard it, you too will have to describe it to other people just to convince yourself <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> exists." [...] Spin magazine writer Mikael Wood remarked that the song contains a double entendre that even a performer such as Kesha could find crude.|$|E

500|$|The climactic scene, which {{features}} {{the breakup of}} the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge {{to the bottom of the}} Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous Titanic films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He [...] "wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was". When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized [...] "by using computer generated people for the dangerous falls".|$|E

Gaga stated {{in an interview that}} [...] "Poker Face" [...] {{was written by}} her as a pop song and was a tribute to her [...] "rock 'n' roll boyfriends". She also stated that the main idea behind the song was sex and gambling. In an interview with UK's Daily Star, Gaga noted of the song, [...] "It's about a lot of different things. I gamble but I've also dated a lot of guys who are really into sex and booze and gambling, so I wanted to write a record my boyfriends would like too." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, when asked about the meaning of the line [...] "bluffin' with my muffin", Gaga explained <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was a metaphor for her vulva.|$|E

A July 2010 analysis by the Financial Times on the aftermath cited legal sources as saying that [...] "at some point {{the scale of the}} litigation becomes so large <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is novel", that [...] "the situation is likely to be complicated further because the variety of probable cases means {{it will be hard to}} aggregate them into so-called class actions" [...] and that there was [...] "no way to put this in historical context because we have never faced anything like this before". As with the Exxon Valdez disaster, litigation was being discussed in terms of a 20-year timescale.|$|E

Li Zhuang, a lawyer who was imprisoned as part of the [...] "Striking Black" [...] policy, said that [...] "the Chongqing model is problematic because the city's leaders do not follow the rule of law". According to Andrew J. Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University, [...] "the risk for China is that this scandal could taint everyone in power and challenge the legitimacy of the regime". Furthermore, he said, “All the worst things you ever imagined are actually true” and “It’s not like nobody knew about this stuff, but now they know <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is true and it’s as bad as it can possibly be.” ...|$|E
500|$|Philip Stead, {{writing in}} The Times Literary Supplement {{considered}} the novel to be [...] "a morbid {{version of that}} of Beauty and the Beast". The review noted that once Bond arrives on the scene to find Michel threatened by the two thugs, he [...] "solves [...] in his usual way. A great quantity of ammunition is expended, the zip-fastener is kept busy and the customary sexual consummation {{is associated with the}} kill." [...] Stead also considered that with the words of the police captain [...] "Mr. Fleming seems to have summarized in this character's remarks some of the recent strictures on James Bond's activities." [...] Vernon Scannell, as critic for The Listener, considered The Spy Who Loved Me to be [...] "as silly as it is unpleasant". What aggrieved him most, however, was that [...] "the worst thing about it is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> is so unremittingly, so grindingly boring." ...|$|E
500|$|Several game modes in Backbreaker {{can also}} be played as local or online multi-player over the Internet. In Exhibition mode, a second player can join the game and can play either against or with the first player. Two players may also compete against one another in Tackle Alley for the most points. Games against other players are played in splitscreen format {{as opposed to the}} usual single-camera view of other {{football}} game series. This is due to Backbreakers [...] "on the field" [...] camera angle, set close to the players, making it difficult for a single-camera two-player setup. Although this setup differs from most modern football games, the developers believe it would add realism to the player's experience. [...] "One of the benefits of having this down-on-the-field camera view is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> makes playing as the quarterback like the passing mechanic feel really natural," [...] said producer Rob Donald.|$|E

500|$|After the {{publication}} of The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Chabon was mistakenly featured in a Newsweek article on up-and-coming gay writers (Pittsburghs protagonist has liaisons with people of both sexes). The New York Times later reported that [...] "in some ways, [...] was happy" [...] for the magazine's error, and quoted him as saying, [...] "I feel very lucky about all of <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> <b>really</b> opened up a new readership to me, and a very loyal one." [...] In a 2002 interview, Chabon added, [...] "If Mysteries of Pittsburgh is about anything {{in terms of human}} sexuality and identity, it's that people can't be put into categories all that easily." [...] In [...] "On The Mysteries of Pittsburgh," [...] an essay he wrote for the New York Review of Books in 2005, Chabon remarked on the autobiographical events that helped inspire his first novel: [...] "I had slept with one man whom I loved, and learned to love another man so much that it would never have occurred to me to want to sleep with him." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Orloff, the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios, {{considered}} the creature {{one of the}} most challenging effects his company helped make for the season. He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> takes a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to believe in it is kind of the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When I first got here tonight, I was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E
500|$|Several reviews {{praised the}} game's setting. GameSpy's David Chapman called it [...] "a truly {{remarkable}} experience. And, while {{the game itself}} may not have broken any new ground, the world it introduces more than makes up for that. It will leave gamers hungry for more." [...] According to Game Informer, [...] "in terms of gameplay quality, this may be another middle-of-the-road shooter, but the unique premise sets it aside from everything else out there." [...] Greg Bemis of G4TV wrote that the biggest draw in Darkwatch is the [...] "different enough" [...] setting that [...] "does fall back on tired video game clichés {{from time to time}} like big-breasted, leather-clad babes who speak in aggressive sexually suggestive double entendres, but it’s nice to see something--anything--that’s a little off the beaten path." [...] GameShark's Will Jayson Hill wrote that [...] "about the sharpest criticism that can be leveled at Darkwatch is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> adds nothing original in the gameplay department. Aside from its extremely well executed western/horror environment, Darkwatch is a pretty generic FPS game with a weaker multiplayer mode." [...] On the other hand, some reviews thought that the gameplay was actually the strongest part of the game. Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine stated Darkwatch [...] "has a few neat ideas but wins us over by doing solid shooting well. Fast-paced with cool guns, what's not to like?" [...] GameZone's Mike David wrote that only a [...] "weak plot pacing and that feeling that something is missing" [...] kept it from being given a score of 9/10.|$|E

500|$|The Rockstar team {{wanted to}} synergise the game world's {{depiction}} of California {{with the radio}} stations by licensing tracks that imparted an appropriate [...] "Cali feel". Pavlovich noted that Los Angeles' cultural saturation of pop music necessitated the Non-Stop-Pop FM station; he said that [...] "the first time you get off an airplane in L.A. and you hear the radio and the pop just seeps out...We wanted <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> <b>really</b> connects you to the world". He felt that greater discernment was required for licensed music choices than in Grand Theft Auto IV because Grand Theft Auto Vs music plays {{a pivotal role in}} generating Californian atmosphere. Music [...] "reflects the environment in which the game is set", he said. Initially, the team planned to license over 900 tracks for the radio but they refined the number to 241. The tracks are shared between fifteen stations, with an additional two talk-back stations and a radio station for custom audio files on the PC version. Some tracks were written specifically for the game, such as rapper and producer Flying Lotus' original work composed for the FlyLo FM station he hosts. Pavlovich noted how the team would first develop an idea of what each station would sound like, and then select a DJ to match the station’s genre, such as Kenny Loggins who hosts the classic rock station Los Santos Rock Radio. He felt that {{to strike a balance between}} the radio and the score was a meticulous process, and cited a scenario where players would drive to a mission objective while listening to the radio, with the score taking over once players left the vehicle and proceeded to the mission's next stage.|$|E
