5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
5|$|After some time, Rodrigues is {{eventually}} taken {{to meet an}} older Ferreira. Ferreira says he committed apostasy while being tortured, and states that after 15 years {{in the country and}} a year in the temple, he believes Christianity is futile in Japan. Rodrigues repudiates him, but Ferreira is implacable. <b>That</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> his prison cell, Rodrigues hears five Christians being tortured. Ferreira tells him that they have already apostatized; it is his apostasy the Japanese demand. As Rodrigues looks upon a fumi-e, he hears an inner voice of Christ giving him permission to step on it, and he does.|$|E

5|$|Another storyline rivalry {{heading into}} Against All Odds {{was for the}} TNA X Division Championship between the champion, A.J. Styles, and the challenger, Christopher Daniels, in a thirty-minute Iron Man match. An Iron Man match {{involves}} two competitors fighting for a predetermined amount of time, in this case thirty-minutes, after which whoever gained more pinfalls or submissions is the victor. The rivalry for this match began on the January 21 episode of Impact!, when Daniels challenged Styles to a match <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> <b>in</b> which if Styles could not defeat him in under ten-minutes then Daniels got a X Division Championship match at Against All Odds. The match ended in a time limit draw, which meant per the pre-match stipulation Daniels gained a championship match at Against All Odds. Dusty Rhodes then entered the arena after the match and announced that the contest would be a thirty-minute Iron Man match.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{succession}} {{plans were}} thrown into chaos by {{the sinking of}} the White Ship on 25 November 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in the early evening, leaving William Adelin and many of the younger members of the court to follow on <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> a separate vessel, the White Ship. Both the crew and passengers were drunk and, just outside the harbour, the ship hit a submerged rock. The ship sank, killing as many as 300 people, with only one survivor, a butcher from Rouen. Henry's court was initially too scared to report William's death to the King. When he was finally told, he collapsed with grief.|$|E

The townsfolk are ruled by General Mapache, a corrupt, brutal {{officer in the}} Mexican Federal Army, who has been ravaging the area's villages to feed his troops, who have been losing to the forces of revolutionary Pancho Villa.

Pike defuses the {{situation}} and offers to work for Mapache.

5|$|According to legend, in 832 A.D. Óengus II led {{an army of}} Picts and Scots {{into battle}} against the Angles, led by Æthelstan, near modern-day Athelstaneford, East Lothian. The legend states that whilst engaged in prayer {{on the eve of}} battle, Óengus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland; Andrew then {{appeared}} to Óengus <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> a dream and assured him of victory. On the morning of battle white clouds forming the shape of an X were said to have appeared in the sky. Óengus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in terms of numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the crux decussata upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, Óengus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background {{is said to have been}} adopted as the design of the flag of Scotland on the basis of this legend.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Ric Flair and Kenny Dykstra (originally just Kenny) {{stemmed from}} Flair's feud with the Spirit Squad, which Dykstra {{was a part}} of. On the October 23 edition of Raw, Dykstra was angered by his teammates' recent losing streak against Flair, and he proved himself by {{defeating}} Flair <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> a singles match. Two weeks after defeating the Spirit Squad for the World Tag Team Championship, Flair and Roddy Piper lost their title to Rated-RKO. The legitimate reason behind their title loss was that Piper {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and had to immediately leave the show. Flair, however, continued to feud with the Spirit Squad, defeating them all at Survivor Series with his team of WWE legends. On the November 27 edition of Raw, Flair teamed up with DX to take on the Spirit Squad in a 3-on-5 handicap match. Flair and DX won, and DX packed them all in a crate (excluding Dykstra) and kayfabe sent them to Ohio Valley Wrestling. It was announced that Flair would face Dykstra at New Year's Revolution.|$|E

Mundo {{defeated}} Cage on February 24, after interference from the debuting Taya, subsequently becoming Mundo's valet.
