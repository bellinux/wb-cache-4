Several prominent Texians {{are known to have}} visited Travis's estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended, but historians are unsure which of these men might have delivered <b>the</b> <b>letter.</b> Travis's daughter Susan (aged five {{at the time of his}} death) passed <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> down to her descendants; it eventually reached her great-grandson, John G. Davidson. In February 1891, Davidson lent <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> to the Texas Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History. Two years later, Davidson offered to sell <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> to the state of Texas for $250 ($ today). This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts, and the state was hesitant to agree. After negotiations, Davidson agreed to accept $85 ($ today) for <b>the</b> <b>letter,</b> and on May 29 it officially passed into state ownership.|$|E

5000|$|This {{second volume}} of the Risale-i Nur {{demonstrates}} the special relationship between Bediuzzaman Said Nursi and his students. In this Collection, Said Nursi replied to numerous and diverse questions posed by the students. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>Letters</b> cover {{a lot of different}} subjects. For example, how death is a bounty; where Hell is situated; (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 21-29). how the metaphorical love for individuals or for this world can be transformed into true love; (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 28) explanation of where the Great Gathering and Last Judgement will take place; (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 57) a letter of condolence on the death of a child;The Letters 2004, p. 100)the proof for prophethood of Muhammad; (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 236)calling upon children to be kindly to their parents; (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 308)calling upon believers to brotherhood and love and pointing out effective ways of preventing enmity against a believer; (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 311)the best way in which believers can pray for each other; (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 330) the importance of supplication (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 353) and the numerous Qur'anic commands to offer thanks; (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 428) the reality and benefits of true dreams. (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 407)Moreover, <b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> provide helpful answers to many questions of Belief and Islam; they contain unique explanations of the truths of Iman and the mysteries of the Our'an which also illustrate the Qur'anic way of Knowledge of Allah manifested by the Risale-i Nur. For instance, Said Nursi explained some of the instances of wisdom in the fast of the blessed month of Ramadan (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 466) and he offers important guidance to contemporary Muslims concerning issues ranging from nationalism (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 379, 491) to Sufism. (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 518) This collection includes <b>the</b> famous Nineteenth <b>Letter</b> which describes more than three hundred of the miracles of Muhammad. Even though this letter includes many hadiths and is more than a hundred pages in length based on traditions and narrations, it was written completely from memory without referring to any book “in a few days by working two or three hours every day, for a total of twelve hours”. (<b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> 2004, p. 116) <b>The</b> <b>Letters</b> also shed light on Bediuzzaman's own life in his numerous years of exile and the conditions {{during the early years of}} the Turkish Republic.
