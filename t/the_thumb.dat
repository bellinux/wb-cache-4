A key {{at the side of}} the instrument at the same height as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G a semitone lower. The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A/B.|$|E
5|$|One of Parcells first {{decisions}} as coach was to replace Simms {{as the starting}} quarterback with Brunner. Simms asked to be traded after the benching, but his request was ignored. During the sixth game of the Giants' 1983 Season, Simms came in to replace the struggling Brunner against the Philadelphia Eagles. On his second drive, Simms suffered a season-ending injury when <b>the</b> <b>thumb</b> on his throwing hand hit a player's helmet on his follow-through. The injury was reported as a dislocation, {{but according to the}} book, Simms to McConkey, written by Phil McConkey, Simms, and Dick Schaap, the injury was much more severe, with <b>the</b> <b>thumb</b> literally hanging off after impact, and the bone sticking out through the skin.|$|E

40|$|By {{comparing}} {{the results of}} force matching between the jaw and <b>the</b> <b>thumbs,</b> whether subjects have any knowledge about the magnitude of exerted forces irrespective Of the motor system was studied. Subjects were asked to match isometric forces of their own choice exerted by flexion of one of <b>the</b> <b>thumbs</b> with <b>the</b> jaw, and the other way around. The results were compared with control experiments in which subjects matched forces exerted by flexion of one of <b>the</b> <b>thumbs</b> with <b>the</b> other <b>thumb</b> and vice versa. None of the subjects was able to match correctly in all experimental conditions. All subjects displayed inconsistent matching behaviour, showing a mixture of correct matching and mismatching. This holds both for absolute matches (in N), and for matches relative to the maximal forces. The results show that knowledge about the magnitude of exerted forces is different for the jaw and <b>the</b> <b>thumbs.</b> Sensations about isometric forces exerted by the jaw or <b>the</b> <b>thumbs</b> are different within each subject and from subject to subject...|$|R

5|$|Previously, the M-83 {{designation}} {{was used}} for a highway in the Upper Peninsula between 1919 and 1926. Immediately after that, the moniker was used to supplant the M-31 designation in <b>The</b> <b>Thumb</b> area. A disconnected segment of highway was given the M-83 name in 1929 in the Frankenmuth area. The {{gap between the two}} roads was eliminated within a year. By the end of the 1930s, the highway was truncated to its current northern terminus in the Richville area, removing <b>The</b> <b>Thumb</b> area segments. The last changes rerouted the southern end to connect with I-75 after that freeway was opened in 1962.|$|E
5|$|M-105 was the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway in <b>The</b> <b>Thumb</b> region of the US state of Michigan. It served as a connecting route between M-53 in Popple and M-83 (now M-142) near Elkton. The designation was in use in the 1920s and 1930s, {{and it has not}} been reused since.|$|E
5|$|M-19 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan. The trunkline begins northeast of Detroit at a junction with Interstate 94 (I-94) near New Haven and runs northward to a junction with M-142 {{just east of}} Bad Axe in <b>The</b> <b>Thumb</b> region of the Lower Peninsula. The highway runs through mostly rural and agricultural areas, connecting several small communities.|$|E

5|$|Opposable thumbs {{allowing}} the grasping of objects {{are most often}} associated with primates, like humans, monkeys, apes, and lemurs.

5|$|Specimens of Archaeopteryx {{were most}} notable for their {{well-developed}} flight feathers. They were markedly asymmetrical {{and showed the}} structure of flight feathers in modern birds, with vanes given stability by a barb-barbule-barbicel arrangement. The tail feathers were less asymmetrical, again {{in line with the}} situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes. <b>The</b> <b>thumb</b> did not yet bear a separately movable tuft of stiff feathers.|$|E
5|$|The first {{designation}} of M-83 {{was in place}} by July 1, 1919, for a routing along the Mohawk–Gay Road between the communities {{of the same name}} in Keweenaw County in the Upper Peninsula. This designation lasted until late 1926 when it was replaced by a northerly extension of M-26.

5|$|I-69 runs eastward out of Flint {{parallel}} to the railroad. At Davison, it intersects M-15 before crossing into Lapeer County. In this area, the freeway traverses farmlands {{in the southern part}} of the region called <b>The</b> <b>Thumb.</b> It jogs to the north around Lake Nepessing, which is southwest of Lapeer. The freeway continues through farmland to Imlay City, where it meets M-53 before crossing into western St. Clair County. Southwest of Capac, there is a temporary welcome center at the rest area along the westbound lanes. I-69 continues eastward through an interchange with M-19 at Emmett.|$|E
5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in <b>the</b> <b>thumb</b> and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E
5|$|M-81 is an east–west state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan.

Outside of the cities and villages along its route, M-81 passes through mostly rural farm country.

The highway is a lightly traveled roadway that runs through rural farmlands. The trunkline runs mostly east–west with two short north–south segments where it turns to run concurrently with other state highways. Along the routing, there are two river crossings and one railroad crossing.|$|E
5|$|North of {{downtown}} Port Huron, US25 followed Pine Grove Avenue {{to the eastern}} terminus of M-136 and then followed 24th Avenue out of town. South of Lakeport, the highway changed names to Lakeshore Road and ran along the Lake Huron shoreline in <b>The</b> <b>Thumb</b> region of the state. US25 stayed close to the shoreline and passed Lakeport State Park {{in the town of}} the same name. North of the park, the highway crossed into southern Sanilac County and followed the shoreline to the community of Lexington where it intersected the eastern end of M-90. Further north, the highway intersected the eastern end of M-46 in Port Sanilac.|$|E
5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four long fingers and an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon {{arrangement}} in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration of the fingers is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. Additionally, {{without the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>thumb,</b> the fingers and hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting the tops of the fingers against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E

5|$|The forelimbs were robustly {{built and}} {{proportionally}} long, measuring 70% {{of the length}} of the hind limbs. The radius of the forearm measured 70% {{of the length of}} the humerus (forearm bone). The hand was large, approaching the humerus in length, and possessed five fingers equipped for grasping. The second finger was the longest, followed by the third and the first finger (<b>the</b> <b>thumb).</b> The first three fingers ended in large and strong claws. The fourth and fifth fingers were strongly reduced, and possibly vestigial. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of finger bones in each finger starting from the first, was 2-3-4-3-2.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and one-half hours' deliberation.

Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of <b>the</b> <b>thumb</b> in open court.|$|E
