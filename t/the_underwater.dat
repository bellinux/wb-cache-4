5|$|In 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{returned}} {{all eight}} broadcast prints of Galaxy 4 and <b>The</b> <b>Underwater</b> Menace to the BBC to be disposed of. In the mid-1980s, former ITV engineer Terry Burnett purchased episode 3 of Galaxy 4 and episode 2 of <b>The</b> <b>Underwater</b> Menace from another collector, unaware of their value (the only extant {{episode of the}} former serial, and one of just two from the latter). In December 2011, after a chance encounter with Doctor Who Restoration Team member Ralph Montagu, Burnett returned the episodes to the BBC.|$|E
5|$|In {{civilian}} operations, {{police forces}} keep police diving units to perform {{search and rescue}} operations, and to recover evidence.

There are also professional divers such as underwater photographers and videographers, who record <b>the</b> <b>underwater</b> world, and scientific divers in fields of study which involve <b>the</b> <b>underwater</b> environment, including marine biologists, geologists, hydrologists, oceanographers and underwater archaeologists.|$|E

5|$|Later, Overman's corpse is discovered. Reviewing the body, Kay {{realizes that}} the shark that killed him is the first shark's mother, and that {{it must also be}} inside the park.

Flushed out from her refuge inside a filtration pipe, the shark begins to wreak havoc on the park, injures a water skier, and causes a leak that nearly drowns everyone in <b>the</b> <b>underwater</b> tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack, go down to the filtration pipe in an attempt to lure the shark back in as a trap. FitzRoyce leads the shark into the pipe, but is then attacked and killed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Hydrodynamic {{coefficients}} are {{the foundation}} of unmanned underwater vehicles modeling and controller design. In order to reduce identification complexity and acquire necessary hydrodynamic coefficients for controllers design, the motion of <b>the</b> unmanned <b>underwater</b> vehicle was separated into vertical motion and horizontal motion models. Hydrodynamic coefficients were regarded as mapping parameters from input forces and moments to output velocities and acceleration of <b>the</b> unmanned <b>underwater</b> vehicle. <b>The</b> motion models of <b>the</b> unmanned <b>underwater</b> vehicle were nonlinear and Genetic Algorithm was adopted to identify those hydrodynamic coefficients. To verify the identification quality, velocities and acceleration of <b>the</b> unmanned <b>underwater</b> vehicle was measured using inertial sensor under the same conditions as Genetic Algorithm identification. Curves similarity between measured velocities and acceleration and those identified by Genetic Algorithm were used as optimizing standard. It is found that the curves similarity were high and identified hydrodynamic coefficients of <b>the</b> unmanned <b>underwater</b> vehicle satisfied <b>the</b> measured motion states well.

5|$|All three {{ships were}} {{fitted with a}} shallow anti-torpedo bulge {{integral}} to the hull which was intended to explode the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and vent <b>the</b> <b>underwater</b> explosion to the surface rather than into the ship.

5|$|Begun in 1939, {{plans were}} far enough along that tests were {{conducted}} with the main armament and against <b>the</b> <b>underwater</b> protection. Even though the ships were approved for construction under a 1942 fleet replenishment program, the prioritizing of aircraft carriers and smaller ships due to the war, followed by Japan's defeat, killed any chance of the B-65's construction.|$|E
