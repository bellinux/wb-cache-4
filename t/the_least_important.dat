5|$|The {{title is}} known for its intense difficulty, which {{contributes}} to its reputation as a black sheep in the franchise. Reviewers viewed The Lost Levels {{as an extension of the}} original release, especially its difficulty progression. Journalists appreciated the game's challenge when spectating speedruns, and recognized the game as a precursor to the franchise's subculture in which fans create and share nearly impossible levels. This sequel gave Luigi his first character traits and introduced the poison mushroom item, which would be used throughout the Mario franchise. The Lost Levels was the most popular game on the Disk System, for which it sold about 2.5 million copies. It is remembered among the most difficult games by Nintendo and in the video game medium, and among <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>important</b> games in the Mario series.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese regime {{perceived}} Java as {{the most}} politically sophisticated but economically <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>important</b> area; its people were Japan's main resource. As such—and in contrast to Dutch suppression—the Japanese encouraged Indonesian nationalism in Java and thus increased its political sophistication (similar encouragement of nationalism in strategic resource-rich Sumatra came later, but only after it was clear the Japanese would lose the war). The outer islands under naval control, however, were regarded as politically backward but economically vital for the Japanese war effort, and these regions were governed the most oppressively of all. These experiences and subsequent differences in nationalistic politicisation would have profound impacts on {{the course of the}} Indonesian Revolution in the years immediately following independence (1945–1950).|$|E

The employers contributed one third, and the workers contributed two thirds. The minimum payments for medical treatment and sick pay for up to 13 weeks were legally fixed. The individual local health bureaus were administered by a committee elected {{by the members of}} each bureau, and this move had the unintended effect of establishing a majority representation for the workers on account of their large financial contribution. This worked to the advantage of the Social Democrats who, through heavy worker membership, achieved their first small foothold in public administration.|$|E
25|$|Acceleration {{increased}} during S-IC flight {{for three}} reasons. One, increased acceleration increased the propellant pressure at the engines, increasing the flow rate somewhat. This was <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>important</b> factor, though this feedback effect often {{led to an}} undesirable thrust oscillation called pogo. Two, as it climbed into thinner air F-1 engine efficiency increased significantly, a property of all rockets. The combined thrust of five engines on the pad was about 7.5 million pounds, reaching nearly 9 million pounds at altitude. But the biggest contribution by far was the rocket's rapidly decreasing mass. The propellant in just the S-IC made up about three-quarters of Saturn V's entire launch mass, and it was furiously consumed at over 13 metric tonnes per second. Newton's second law states that force is equal to mass times acceleration, or equivalently that acceleration is equal to force divided by mass, so as the mass decreased (and the force increased somewhat), acceleration rose. Including gravity, launch acceleration was only 1¼g, i.e., the astronauts felt 1¼g while the rocket accelerated vertically at ¼g. As the rocket rapidly lost mass, total acceleration including gravity increased to nearly 4g at T+135 seconds. At this point, the inboard (center) engine was shut down to prevent acceleration from increasing beyond 4g.|$|E

The game's poison mushroom item, with its character-impairing effects, became a staple of the Mario franchise.
