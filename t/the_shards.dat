5|$|After his {{transfer}} to JG 27, Galland met Mölders again. Due to his injuries, Galland could never match Mölders' sharp eyesight; <b>the</b> <b>shards</b> of glass {{in his eyes}} denied him that capacity. However, Mölders, by that time a recognised ace (a pilot with five or more aerial victories), shared what experiences he could with Galland; leadership in the air, tactics and organisation. Mölders was Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 53 {{at the time of}} their meeting. In order for Galland to gain experience on the Bf 109E, which Galland lacked, he offered Galland the chance to join his unit which was flying patrols along the French border. During these sorties, Galland learned Mölders' tactics, such as using spotter aircraft to indicate the position of enemy formation, as an early warning system. Galland learned to allow the Staffel to operate freely in order to seize the initiative and surprise. Taking his findings back to JG 27, its commander Max Ibel, agreed to their implementation. Galland gained further experience as a combat leader acting as the Gruppenkommandeur, when the Gruppenkommandeur went on leave.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a young {{traveller}} named Bartz, {{resting in}} the woods near Tycoon, witnesses a meteorite plunge to the planet's surface just outside the castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover {{an old man in}} the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains that she had been {{on her way to the}} Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring an underground cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but no sign of the missing king. <b>The</b> <b>shards</b> react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect those Crystals that yet remain.|$|E
5|$|Neverwinter Nights 2 is {{composed}} of three distinct acts. The game's first act begins {{in the village of}} West Harbor, where the player's character was raised as an orphan by the elven ranger Daeghun. After a festival, the town is attacked by a group, led by a githyanki, in search of an unnamed object. Afterward, the character is sent to retrieve a mysterious silver shard from a nearby cave, which was left there years earlier after the defeat of the King of Shadows. The character then sets out for Neverwinter, meeting other adventurers along the way, several of whom are available for recruitment. In Neverwinter, Daeghun's half-brother Duncan offers a more comprehensive explanation of the situation. In Neverwinter, Duncan instructs the party to speak with Aldanon, a sage who reveals the shard's connection with a dead warlock and his descendant, a farmer named Shandra Jerro. However, the githyanki kidnap Shandra and the player character must rescue her. At the end of Act I, the party dispatches the githyanki, rescues Shandra, and learns of the origin of <b>the</b> <b>shards.</b>|$|E

50|$|The first title {{match of}} the {{pay-per-view}} saw 3.0 (Scott Parker and Shane Matthews) defend the Chikara Campeonatos de Parejas against Pieces of Hate (Jigsaw and <b>The</b> <b>Shard)</b> in a {{two out of}} three falls match. The challengers won the first fall, when <b>The</b> <b>Shard</b> surprised Parker with a roll-up. Before the start of the second fall, <b>The</b> <b>Shard</b> attacked Parker's ankle, leaving him lying on the floor outside the ring for most of the fall, during which Pieces of Hate concentrated on attacking Matthews' ankle. Eventually, Parker managed to return to the match and fired a comeback, which ended with him and Matthews performing their double-team finishing maneuver, the Sweet Taste o' Professionalism, on <b>The</b> <b>Shard</b> to win <b>the</b> second fall and tie the score. In the third fall, Jigsaw removed Parker from the ring, before hitting a superkick on Matthews, whom <b>The</b> <b>Shard</b> then locked in an ankle lock. After <b>The</b> <b>Shard</b> added a grapevine to the hold, Matthews went unconscious, giving Pieces of Hate the third fall and the match and making them the new Campeones de Parejas.|$|R
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Professor E. Gadd completes his newest {{invention}} {{of a time}} machine powered by a gem called the Cobalt Star, which is presented at Peach's Castle. Peach enters the time machine into the past, but fails to return, only leaving {{a member of an}} alien species known only as the Shroobs within the damaged time machine. The Mushroom Kingdom of the past had actually been invaded by the Shroobs, with Peach being kidnapped and held hostage at her castle. After defeating the monster, a time hole opens, leaving a passageway into the past. While searching for Peach, Mario and Luigi locate their younger selves, and agree to locate the crystal shards, which are remnants of the Cobalt Star which had been shattered during Peach's journey. Unwittingly, the brothers collect all of <b>the</b> <b>shards,</b> while being pestered by Baby Bowser (Bowser in the past) who wants the Cobalt Star. At the end, they restore the Cobalt Star only to unleash the Elder Princess Shroob, who serves as the game's final boss character. The story ends when she is defeated, Peach is rescued, and the past returns to normal.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known salt {{works in}} the world is at Poiana Slatinei, near the village of Lunca in Vânători-Neamț, Romania. It was first used in the early Neolithic, around 6050 BC, by the Starčevo culture, and later by the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture in the Pre-Cucuteni period. Evidence from this and other sites indicates that the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture extracted salt from salt-laden spring-water through the process of briquetage. First, the brackish water from the spring was boiled in large pottery vessels, producing a dense brine. The brine was then heated in a ceramic briquetage vessel until all moisture was evaporated, with the remaining crystallised salt adhering to the inside walls of the vessel. Then the briquetage vessel was broken open, and the salt was scraped from <b>the</b> <b>shards.</b>|$|E

25|$|The UV {{intensity}} is specified for each lamp {{at a distance}} of 1 meter. UV {{intensity is}} inversely proportional to the square of the distance so it decreases at longer distances. Alternatively, it rapidly increases at distances shorter than 1m. In the above formula the UV intensity must always be adjusted for distance unless the UV dose is calculated at exactly 1m from the lamp. Also, to ensure effectiveness the UV dose must be calculated at the end of lamp life (EOL is specified in number of hours when the lamp is expected to reach 80% of its initial UV output) and at the furthest distance from the lamp {{on the periphery of the}} target area. In some applications coating is applied to the lamp to make it shatterproof. The coating is Fluoro Ethylene Polymer which completely encapsulates the lamp and contains <b>the</b> <b>shards</b> and mercury in case of accidental breakage. The coating decreases the UV intensity up to 20%.|$|E

25|$|Early in Sonic Adventure 2, Knuckles and Rouge {{argue over}} the Emerald; {{she wants the}} pieces for her {{personal}} collection.

He later helps Sonic, Tails, and Amy find Eggman's base inside a giant pyramid, {{as well as a}} key to an inner chamber housing a giant space shuttle. He follows them to a giant space station called the ARK with it, where he again scuffles with Rouge over the Emerald. He saves her from falling into a constructed pit of lava; she decides <b>the</b> <b>shards</b> are worthless and dismissively lets him keep them, so he reassembles the Emerald and runs off.

25|$|A subplot {{in which}} the Rohirrim are aided by the {{primitive}} Drúedain during their journey to the besieged Gondor is excised from the film. The Red Arrow brought by a messenger from Gondor to ask for aid is absent. Éowyn's presence on the battlefield is unknown to the reader until she takes off her helmet, but in the film the audience is aware, {{as it would have}} been difficult to have Miranda Otto playing a man. When hope seems lost, Gandalf comforts Pippin with a description of the Undying Lands, which is a descriptive passage in the book's final chapter. The film depicts the Army of the Dead fighting in the Battle, whereas in the book they are released from service prior to this, after helping Aragorn defeat the Corsairs of Umbar at the port city of Pelargir in Lebennin; Aragorn's reinforcements are merely more Gondorians, and the Dúnedain, Aragorn's people (the rangers of the North). An unstoppable and invulnerable force, the Dead wipe out Sauron's forces. The film also cuts out several supporting characters, such as Halbarad, a friend of Aragorn's, who helps lead the Dúnedain, Beregond, a member of the Citadel Guard of Gondor, whom Pippin befriends, and Elladan and Elrohir, the twin sons of Elrond who deliver Aragorn's banner and accompany him to the Pelennor Fields. Elladan and Elrohir are replaced by Elrond in the film, instead delivering Andúril in Dunharrow, and then returning to Rivendell. In the books Aragorn isn't doubtful about his destiny, but had already decided to claim the throne of Gondor {{from the beginning of the}} Quest; thus, it was he who had <b>the</b> <b>shards</b> of Narsil forged to Andúril in Rivendell, carrying it from there on the whole journey.|$|E
