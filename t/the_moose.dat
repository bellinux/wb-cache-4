5|$|The {{following}} season, Raymond {{made the}} Canucks' roster out {{of training camp}} and made his NHL debut on the team's top line with Henrik and Daniel Sedin. He picked up his first NHL point, an assist, in the season-opener against the San Jose Sharks on October 5, 2007.

5|$|Until the 1980s, {{the most}} {{reproduced}} and publicized of Bauer's works were two paintings depicting the princess and <b>the</b> <b>moose</b> from Sagan om älgtjuren Skutt och lilla prinsessan Tuvstarr (The Tale of <b>the</b> <b>Moose</b> Hop and the Little Princess Cotton Grass), published in 1913. The first picture {{is of the}} princess riding on <b>the</b> <b>moose</b> {{and the second is}} of <b>the</b> <b>moose</b> standing guard over the sleeping princess. They were mainly used as pictures on the wall in nurseries. The same tale also contains the picture of Tuvstarr gazing down into the tarn looking for her lost heart, an allegory of innocence lost. Bauer made several studies of this motif. During the 1980s the painting of Tuvstarr and the tarn was used in advertising for a shampoo. This started a debate in Sweden about how works of art, considered part of the national heritage, should be used. In 1999, the picture again appeared in advertising, this time in a manipulated version in which all the trees had been cut down and Tuvstarr seemed to be lamenting them. The award-winning advertising campaign was made by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and helped further the newly awakened environmental movement in Sweden. In his biography on Bauer, Gunnar Lindqvist argues that the picture has become too commercialized.|$|E

25|$|Moose are not grazing animals but browsers (concentrate selectors). Like giraffes, moose {{carefully}} select {{foods with}} less fiber and more concentrations of nutrients. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>moose's</b> digestive system has evolved to accommodate this relatively low-fiber diet. Unlike most hooved, domesticated animals (ruminants), moose cannot digest hay, and feeding it to a moose can be fatal. <b>The</b> <b>moose's</b> varied and complex diet is typically expensive {{for humans to}} provide, and free-range moose {{require a lot of}} forested acreage for sustainable survival, which is one of <b>the</b> main reasons <b>moose</b> have never been widely domesticated.|$|R

Making his professional debut with <b>the</b> <b>Moose</b> in Game 1 of the semi-finals against the Houston Aeros, he notched an assist on the game's first goal for his first professional point. He followed up with his first professional goal the next night, a wrist shot against Aeros goaltender Nolan Schaefer, in a 5–2 victory. While Hodgson started on the fourth line for <b>the</b> <b>Moose,</b> he quickly moved his way up to the second line with fellow Canucks first-round pick Michael Grabner. Advancing past the Aeros, Moose Head Coach Scott Arniel chose not to play Hodgson in Game 4 of the Calder Cup Finals against the Hershey Bears. Arniel explained the decision was attributed to fatigue on Hodgson's part from a lengthy season in the juniors (including the 2009 World Juniors and a lengthy OHL playoff run). He returned the next game to help <b>the</b> <b>Moose</b> stave off elimination with a goal in a 3–2 Game 5 victory. Manitoba went on to lose the Calder Cup in Game 6 by a 4–1 score.
