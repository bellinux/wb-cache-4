He identifies <b>these</b> <b>basic</b> constituents as a carefully planned but not complicated state of affairs to provide introductory motivation, visual stimuli to sexually excite the women, a theme that is generally rare in reality, a straightforward and very quick seduction, and the sex acts as the film's central theme.|$|E
5|$|In {{his opinion}} {{all human beings}} have the same {{abilities}} with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but <b>these</b> <b>basic</b> ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him {{it is obvious that}} the culture on Tierra del Fuego is at a lower level of development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E
50|$|The {{relatively}} low quality of ST BASIC quickly {{opened up a}} market for third-party BASICs on the ST. FaST BASIC and GFA BASIC {{were two of the}} first of <b>these</b> third-party <b>BASICs</b> to be released. As these BASICS were not free, a program written in one of <b>these</b> <b>BASICs</b> could only be listed and run if the user had that BASIC. However, compilers and run-time executables started to appear for <b>these</b> <b>BASICs</b> that produced executable code that could run on all STs, and type-in programs became less fashionable, so there was no longer a need for a standard BASIC. By then, HiSoft BASIC, Omikron BASIC and STOS BASIC had appeared. Some of <b>these</b> <b>BASICs</b> even started to be bundled with new STs in the later years.|$|R

5|$|In Poland, the {{earliest}} archeological sites considered Slavic include {{a limited number}} of 6th-century settlements and a few isolated burial sites. The material obtained there consists mostly of simple, manually formed ceramics, typical of the entire early Slavic area. It is {{on the basis of the}} different varieties of <b>these</b> <b>basic</b> clay pots and infrequent decorations that the three cultures are distinguished. The largest of {{the earliest}} Slavic (Prague culture) settlement sites in Poland that have been subjected to systematic research is located in Bachórz, Rzeszów County, and dates to the second half of 5th through 7th centuries. It consisted of 12 nearly square, partially dug-out houses, each covering the area of 6.2 to 19.8 (14.0 on the average) square meters. A stone furnace was usually placed in a corner, which is typical for Slavic homesteads of that period, but clay ovens and centrally located hearths are also found. 45 newer dwellings of a different type from the 7th/8th to 9th/10th centuries have also been discovered in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain <b>these</b> <b>basic</b> observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA {{is held in}} complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of <b>these</b> <b>basic</b> amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter {{the strength of the}} interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.|$|E

25|$|Referencing the {{inherent}} qualities {{of a system}} {{in place of a}} reference state environment is the most direct way that ecologists determine the exergy of a natural resource. Specifically, it is easiest to examine the thermodynamic properties of a system, and the reference substances that are acceptable within the reference environment. This determination allows for the assumption of qualities in a natural state: deviation from these levels may indicate a change in the environment caused by outside sources. There are three kinds of reference substances that are acceptable, due to their proliferation on the planet: gases within the atmosphere, solids within the Earth’s crust, and molecules or ions in seawater. By understanding <b>these</b> <b>basic</b> models, it’s possible to determine the exergy of multiple earth systems interacting, like the effects of solar radiation on plant life. <b>These</b> <b>basic</b> categories are utilized as the main components of a reference environment when examining how exergy can be defined through natural resources.|$|E
