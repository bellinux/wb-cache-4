The local {{people in this}} region of Georgia are paid a pittance to risk their lives climbing 30m high fir trees to collect the cones from which the seeds are extracted and sent to Christmas tree nurseries in Europe. Until Fair Trees came along these cone pickers were given no safety equipment or training, no health insurance and very little pay; every year people are injured and even killed doing this work. Fair Trees grow and sell the only fair trade Christmas trees in the world (certified by the WFTO).|$|E

As some lineages of the 90% of species that lack a backbone or notochord might have lost these structures over time, this complicates the classification of chordates. Some chordate lineages may only be found by DNA analysis, {{when there is no}} physical trace of any chordate-like structures.|$|E

Across Ireland, help has been provided for a locally set up organisation <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to assist him through the difficult period.

Chibiusa {{traveled}} from the future {{in order to find}} the Silver Crystal and use it to save her parents. She is followed by the Black Moon Clan, a new enemy force <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to kill her. Eventually, the Sailor Soldiers and Tuxedo Mask travel with Chibiusa to the future where Usagi rules Crystal Tokyo as Neo-Queen Serenity. They learn that Chibiusa is actually Usagi and Mamoru's future daughter, and they also meet Sailor Pluto who guards the Door of Space-Time. Eventually, the Sailor Soldiers battle against Wiseman, a dark force that was manipulating the Black Moon Clan with the intention of destroying Earth. Chibiusa is able to summon the Silver Crystal of the future and aids in the destruction of Wiseman. Afterwards, Chibiusa returns to her own time, now freed from the Black Moon Clan's corruption.|$|E

25|$|Prey {{is often}} flushed out of tall grass by the birds stomping on the {{surrounding}} vegetation. It also waits near fires, eating anything it can <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to escape. They can either catch prey by chasing it and striking {{with the bill}} and swallowing (usually with small prey), or stamping on prey until it is rendered stunned or unconscious enough to swallow. Larger or dangerous prey, such as venomous snakes, are instead stunned or killed by the bird jumping onto their backs, at which point {{they will try to}} snap their necks or backs. There are some reports that, when capturing snakes, the secretary birds will take flight with their prey and then drop them to their death, although this has not been verified. Even with larger prey, food is generally swallowed whole through the birds' considerable gape. Occasionally, like other raptors, they will tear apart prey with their feet before consuming it.|$|E
500|$|Meena reprised {{her role}} from the original, marking her {{comeback}} to Telugu cinema after sixteen years. It was her fifth collaboration with Venkatesh. She called her character [...] "innocent, vulnerable, emotional, sweet, funny and strong {{all at the}} same time", adding that she was initially sceptical to play a mother to adolescents because Telugu film sensibilities were different from that of Malayalam ones, but accepted it due to the script's novelty. Nadhiya was selected to play Asha Sarath's role of a police officer from the original. She confirmed later that she would be playing an Inspector General of Police, which is a role she found being [...] "almost like a role of a lioness <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to protect her family and yet is ferocious from the inside", calling it a [...] "challenging and different" [...] one.|$|E

He also praised the supporting stories, claiming that [...] "Matthew Fox does a great job of playing the uneasy leader" [...] as Jack Shephard and that the Shannon-Charlie storyline [...] "does supply a little comic relief". Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it described the revelation that Locke was a paraplegic as being [...] "one of the show's signature moments", and commented that the episode [...] "cemented the show as 'Must-See TV'" [...] and was [...] "a five-star effort." ...|$|E
500|$|PepsiCo's {{acquisition}} {{was seen}} by some analysts {{as a means for}} the company to increase its soft drinks sales. PepsiCo chairman D. Wayne Calloway denied that soft drink preference was a factor in the KFC takeover. KFC management had previously given franchisees the freedom to sell any soft drinks they wanted, but PepsiCo stated that it hoped it could convince them to stock Pepsi products. Before the takeover, only 1,000 of the 6,500 KFC outlets sold Pepsi Cola, and PepsiCo switched 1,800 company-owned stores to their own soft drinks with immediate effect. The purchase of KFC by PepsiCo led to some fast food competitors switching from Pepsi to Coca-Cola. One of the first to switch was Wendy's, whose chairman, Robert Barney, stated, [...] " [...] interests are now in conflict with Wendy's and we will not support a company <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to make our customers its customers." [...] Burger King, which had switched from Coca-Cola to PepsiCo in 1983, returned to Coca-Cola in 1990, citing the growth of the PepsiCo chains as a [...] "large factor" [...] in the switch. By 1998, the majority of KFC franchisees had agreed to stock PepsiCo soft drink products.|$|E
500|$|A {{flashback}} during [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] {{reveals that}} {{they manage to}} return to New York City, where Michael hands Walt over to Walt's grandmother. Michael then attempts suicide, unable {{to cope with the}} guilt of his murders. Tom (M. C. Gainey), one of the Others, arrives, and tells Michael he can redeem himself by saving the other survivors from an imminent threat. Tom gives Michael a passport with the new name of [...] "Kevin Johnson" [...] in order to infiltrate a freighter <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to find the Island. On the freighter he receives a call from Ben, who instructs him to send him information on all the crew, then to sabotage the radio room and the boat engines. In his first season four appearance, Michael meets Sayid (Naveen Andrews) and Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick), who have managed to get from the Island to the freighter. They tell the freighter's captain of Michael's true identity, who orders him to repair the engines. During the season finale, Michael and Jin attempt to disarm a bomb planted on the freighter. Michael slows the bomb's detonation with liquid nitrogen, then tells Jin to leave, when he is almost out of nitrogen. When the supply of nitrogen runs out, Christian Shephard (John Terry) appears to Michael and tells him he can go now. The bomb detonates, and Michael is killed in the explosion, having achieved the redemption he had been seeking. Michael reappears halfway through the sixth season as a ghost that only Hurley can see. He explains that the whispers on the island are the voices of those who have died on the island. As Hurley turns to depart, Michael stops him and apologizes for the pain he caused for both him and Libby.|$|E
