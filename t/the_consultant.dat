5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>consultant</b> {{talks with}} the {{residents}} of the town and investigates its history, the backstory of his injury is gradually revealed. After repeatedly stubbing his toe and covering it up with Apex bandages, <b>the</b> <b>consultant</b> accidentally stepped into pig feces during a company team retreat. Because of the colored bandage, he never discovered how his toe was badly infected, and fainted on the sidewalk after fleeing from an awards party. This led to the amputation of his toe, his departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his hermetic lifestyle.|$|E

40|$|Presently, clients {{seek the}} {{services}} of <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> to implement <b>the</b> projects. Some of the clients {{do not have enough}} technical staff to implement the project therefore they need {{the services of}} <b>the</b> <b>consultants.</b> In <b>the</b> Middle East, <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> worked together as a consortium. However, some of the clients are not satisfied with the services as provided by this consortium of <b>consultants.</b> <b>The</b> aim {{of this study is to}} examine the services provided by <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> in <b>the</b> construction industry. The objectives of the study are to study the services as provided by various <b>consultants,</b> to identify <b>the</b> methods of selection of <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> by <b>the</b> clients, to identify the problems faced by consultants in project implementation and to determine the level of satisfaction of client regarding the services provided by <b>the</b> <b>consultants.</b> <b>The</b> study is carried out on consultants (consortium) involved in civil and building projects in Iran.

30|$|What effect did <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report have? Did the {{regional}} cooperation body manage {{to change the}} procurement content? One thing is for sure, <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report created confusion among several actors in the municipalities and among the politicians on the PTA board [45]. For example, one municipality {{did not know how}} to value <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report in relation to the opinions it was to give on the procurement documents [46]. A civil servant in one municipality stated that neither he nor “his” politicians had received any information about <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report until it was already complete. He was very surprised to hear about the report, and confused as to why and by whom it was prepared. This civil servant decided to call his colleagues in two other municipalities to discuss <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report. These three civil servants then turned to the PTA president and said that they needed more time to respond to the procurement document, if they were also to consider the conclusions of <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report [32]. <b>The</b> regional cooperation body stated that it would await their response [45].|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>consultant’s</b> {{report was}} {{published}} {{at the same}} time as the PTA conducted its round of consultations regarding the procurement content. The regional cooperation body sent <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report to <b>the</b> PTA, municipalities, and county council.|$|R
30|$|What other effects did <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report have? A {{civil servant}} at the {{regional}} cooperation body argued that <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report was crucial to {{the outcome of the}} procurement document. He stated that “The PTA bought everything in the report” [47]. In addition, the PTA president thought <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report was relevant, not in a way that changed the procurement document, but rather as it ensured that the process was on the right track. A local politician thought that <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report was an addition to the procurement report. He believed that <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report was more research based, which was also important to consider when conducting a procurement. Regarding the timing of the completion of <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report, <b>the</b> informant believed it was right: “We had time to reflect on the report when it wasn’t too old – we can’t use old data in these kinds of processes” [42]. One consequence of <b>the</b> <b>consultant’s</b> report, besides allowing the regional cooperation body to influence the procurement process, was that other actors (including the PTA) also used the report as a resource to gather political support for their decisions. Not only did the actor mobilizing power resources in the initial stage benefit from this resource mobilization, but other actors could also use the resources to their own benefit.|$|R
5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer {{in one of}} the small rooms of the temple—although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again <b>the</b> <b>consultant</b> in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E

5|$|The {{new group}} of drugs was {{initially}} greeted with optimism by the medical profession, but gradually concerns arose; in particular, the risk of dependence became evident in the 1980s. Benzodiazepines have a unique history in that they {{were responsible for the}} largest-ever class-action lawsuit against drug manufacturers in the United Kingdom, involving 14,000 patients and 1,800 law firms that alleged the manufacturers knew of the dependence potential but intentionally withheld this information from doctors. At the same time, 117 general practitioners and 50 health authorities were sued by patients to recover damages for the harmful effects of dependence and withdrawal. This led some doctors to require a signed consent form from their patients and to recommend that all patients be adequately warned of the risks of dependence and withdrawal before starting treatment with benzodiazepines. The court case against the drug manufacturers never reached a verdict; legal aid had been withdrawn and there were allegations that <b>the</b> <b>consultant</b> psychiatrists, the expert witnesses, had a conflict of interest. This litigation led to changes in the British law, making class action lawsuits more difficult.|$|E

40|$|The almost {{inevitable}} situation in construction projects is variation. It {{is common in}} all types of construction projects and {{plays an important role}} in determining the closing cost and time of the projects. The study examines the impact of variation on construction projects in relation to the handler that is the in-house staff and <b>the</b> <b>consultants.</b> To achieve <b>the</b> study objectives, a critical review of relevant literature was done coupled with questionnaire survey to collect information on potential causes of variations in the public projects with special emphasis on projects carried out by the class 1 and 2 contractors for government. Through the literature review, 53 causes of variation orders were identified which provided the basis for the formulation of the questionnaire. The identified causes were earlier subjected to test by the professionals to determine the relevance of the causes of variation in Seychelles construction projects. 58 questionnaires were distributed to the in-house construction professionals, consultants and contractors involve in handling government projects. 30 in house staff responded to the questionnaire and 18 responded by both <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> and contractors who were involved in government construction projects.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an empirical study of factors responsible for errors in Nigerian construction documents and aims at identifying the significant {{factors that are}} responsible for errors in the Nigerian construction documents. Information was obtained from both <b>consultants</b> (<b>the</b> producers of construction documents) and contractors (the user of construction documents) for the purpose of comparing the significant factors identified by the two sets of respondents. Out of the two hundred and sixty questionnaires administered, eighty six were retrieved and used for the analysis of the study. The statistical methods used for analysis are frequencies, percentages and mean item scores. The findings of the research show that while the contractors agreed that <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> and management are the main factors responsible for errors in the Nigerian construction documents, <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> agreed that <b>the</b> management and clients are the main factors responsible for them. However, the collective agreement of <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> and contractors was that <b>the</b> <b>consultants</b> and management are the main factors responsible for errors in the Nigerian construction documents.
