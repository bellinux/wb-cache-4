Is {{had that}} {{the part of}} the fattened of the trays of bread is an {{important}} process within the elaboration of the products of the company Panificadora BIMBO from Costa Rica, due to that subsequently this products pass to the process of baking and of not working hard the fat in the molds the mass of the bread well it could come to stick in these. At this time in the line of bollería are carried out this process of manual form by means of some mouthpieces of due application to that the machine of fat DUBOR installed in this line was harmed, this reason permits that it wear out more fat of the necessary due to that it work hard of a more abundant form and also of a form less uniform. The expense of this fat, economically, is considerable, for this reason it analize the possibility of automating this process by means of the use of a controller (PLC) since the person could program of several forms searching for the more appropriate for the required process. A PLC of the ALPHA series of due Mitsubishi to their characteristics was utilized since it could carry out this task satisfactorily, for their comfortable cost, in comparison to another, and for the ease <b>that</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>the</b> <b>software</b> to the hour of carrying out the program. By means of a vicinity sensor a characteristic of the molds of bread was taken advantage of: the cavities; it thanks to these is that one could establish the moment of dispersion of the fat for each mold, this due to that several types of mold for several types of bread exist, for this reason is that it was utilized the PLC, by means of this one could program several processes according to a selection that it are carried out previous. With everything are controlled it a “electroválvula” that permits the pass of air toward the mouthpieces that they finally carry out the dispersion of the fat. The realization of this project permits to the company save 40 % of the fat utilized before the automation, with which, this calm justified project since the company benefits economically, {{as well as with the}} quality of the product final.

40|$|Part 2 : PhD Student Workshop — Management of Future NetworksInternational audienceToday, the {{communications}} network {{has become an}} essential element to the operation of any type of organization or infrastructure, {{such is the case}} of the electrical power substations. Such networks in particular, demand high levels of availability and reliability, as the substation is a key element in the chain of energy generation and distribution. However, although recent network modernization <b>introduced</b> new features <b>that</b> allow to optimize the operation of the substation, the variety of devices that integrate it (Intelligent Electronic Devices - IED: breakers, switches, Protection and Control, Merging Units - MU, Network Switches, IEEE 1588 Master Clock) and the huge set of application-level protocols (SMV - Sample Measure Value, GOOSE - Generic Object Oriented Substation Event, MMS - Manufacturing Message Specification, PTP - Precision Time Protocols, among others), increase the management complexity. In this context, the Applied Telecommunications Research Group (GITA), has decided to propose the development of S 3 N - Smart Solution for Substation Networks. S 3 N is defined as a network architecture <b>that</b> <b>introduces</b> <b>the</b> novel <b>Software</b> Defined Networks (SDN) and virtualization technologies, in order to simplify the management of communication networks in power substations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper extends {{a method}} for {{integrating}} source-code model checking with dynamic system analysis to verify properties of controllers for nonlinear dynamic systems. Source-code model checking verifies the correctness of control systems including features <b>that</b> are <b>introduced</b> by <b>the</b> <b>software</b> implementation, such as concurrency and task interleaving. Sets of reachable continuous states are computed using numerical simulation and bisimulation functions. The technique as originally proposed handles stable dynamic systems with affine state equations for which quadratic bisimulation functions can be computed easily. The extension in this paper handles nonlinear systems with polynomial state equations for which bisimulation functions can be computed in some cases using sum-of-squares (SoS) techniques. The paper presents the convex optimizations required to perform control system verification using a sourcecode model checker, and the method is illustrated {{for an example of}} a supervisory control system.

40|$|Change {{control is}} crucial in a {{software}} development organ-isation, as changes arrive during all stages of development. Changes <b>that</b> are <b>introduced</b> in <b>the</b> <b>software</b> at <b>the</b> peril of individual developers may affect aspects of <b>the</b> <b>software</b> such as stability, usability, and overall quality. Typically, change proposals are handled in a change control process, where the implications and impact of the change are analysed. In order to support this type of analysis, we have created a checklist-based process support instrument, the purpose {{of which is to}} allow for objective and systematic analyses. We present an approach for adapting generic checklists along three axes: process, domain, and roles, as well as character-istics of the resulting support instrument. We also describe two evaluations of the change control process, of which the latter is designed with the stepwise character of the process in mind. We discuss some preliminary evaluation results, and in the light of these conclude that the use of checklist-based process support seems promising so far. 1...|$|R
