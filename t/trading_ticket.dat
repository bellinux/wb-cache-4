40|$|This paper proposes FlexToken, a new copy {{prevention}} {{scheme for}} digital rights such as tickets or coupons, which are circulated as {{pieces of paper}} in the real world. The important feature of this scheme is that digital rights are represented using two separate types of information: the contents and the token of the rights. The token represents the "genuineness" of the contents and distinguishes the genuine digital rights from copies. A token is stored and circulated using tamper-proof devices such as smartcards while the contents can be held in any storage medium. This approach decreases the amount of memory required of the tamper-proof devices. Furthermore, circulating {{the identity of the}} right issuer and accredited information, which specifies the tamperproof devices trusted by the issuer, along with a token makes it possible to protect any type of digital right, regardless of the issuer.

Although these lotteries were random, subjects behaved as though their choice of ticket affected the outcome. [...] Participants who chose their own numbers were less likely to <b>trade</b> their <b>ticket</b> even for one in a game with better odds.|$|R

60|$|And now at this moment, when {{hope was}} dead, Tom Sawyer {{came forward with}} nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible.

But there was no getting around it--here were the certified checks, and they were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy--but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by <b>trading</b> <b>tickets</b> to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges. These despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake in the grass.|$|R
