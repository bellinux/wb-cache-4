25|$|Vélez was {{involved}} in several highly publicized and often stormy relationships {{over the course of}} her career. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, she was linked to actors Tom Mix, Charlie Chaplin and Clark Gable. Her first long-term, high-profile relationship was with actor Gary Cooper. Vélez met Cooper while filming The Wolf Song in 1929 and began a two-year affair with him. The relationship with Cooper was passionate but often stormy. When angered, Vélez reportedly physically assaulted Cooper. Cooper eventually ended the relationship in mid-1931 at the behest of his mother Alice who strongly disapproved of Vélez. By that time, the rocky relationship had taken its toll on Cooper who had lost 45 pounds and was suffering from nervous exhaustion. Paramount Pictures ordered him to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacation</b> to recuperate. While he was boarding the train, Vélez showed up at the train station and fired a pistol at him.|$|E

500|$|Mr. Burns {{remained}} largely ignorant of Smithers' devoted adoration, much to Smithers' frustration. Mr. Burns himself {{has been involved}} with several women and in [...] "A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love", Smithers is noticeably disgusted when Mr. Burns starts looking for a female companion. Burns, for his part, views Smithers as somewhat of a lackey, albeit a highly valued one for his competence. He has [...] "rewarded" [...] Smithers' devotion with the future [...] "honor" [...] of being buried alive with him after he dies. Smithers {{has been shown to be}} somewhat dependent on his relationship with Burns. In [...] "Homer the Smithers", Mr. Burns orders Smithers to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacation</b> and Homer Simpson is hired as a temporary replacement. When Homer loses his temper and punches Mr. Burns in the face, Mr. Burns learns to become self-reliant and this results in Smithers being fired. Smithers decides that he needs to be Mr. Burns' assistant and eventually gets his job back. In the season 27 episode [...] "The Burns Cage", Smithers attempts to admit his love to Burns, who interrupts to reaffirm his contempt for his assistant.|$|E

500|$|While the {{autonomous}} nature of different AFA-affiliated {{individuals and groups}} meant that McNallen and his wife Maddy Hunter had little power, they bore {{the brunt of the}} responsibility of running the Assembly and organizing its Althings. They were also impacted by a downturn in the Texan economy, with McNallen losing his job as a jail guard. Bankrupt and frustrated, McNallen and the other senior figures in the AFA found that they were unable to organise the group's seventh Althing for 1987. Seeking to ensure that it would continue regardless, McNallen assembled a committee of AFA members, the Southern Heathen Leadership Conference, which issued a document declaring that new membership would be frozen, that AFA responsibilities would be divided more widely, and that McNallen and Hunter should <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacation</b> from their organizational chores. However, in 1987 McNallen shut down The Runestone and dissolved the AFA altogether, relocating to Northern California. However, according to Strmiska and Sigurvinsson, the AFA had [...] "planted seeds that would take strong root". As a replacement for the Assembly, Murray established the Asatru Alliance, which organised the eighth American Althing for Arizona in June 1988.|$|E

Lois complains to Mayor Adam West, who admits that he sanctioned the dumping in exchange for free hair oil. Outraged, Lois decides to run against West in the upcoming mayoral election. Peter and his friends become strong supporters of Lois's campaign, realizing that they'd {{be able to get}} away with almost everything should she become mayor. But Lois's campaign soon falters as Mayor West proves more politically savvy. While Lois bores voters with detailed plans to improve the city, Mayor West uses glittering generalities and statements completely unrelated to the questions posed to him. Following Brian's advice to give short, simple answers, Lois resorts to similar tactics, dropping controversial terms such as [...] "Jesus" [...] and [...] "9/11" [...] in meaningless ways. She eventually gains the populace's support and wins the election.|$|E

2500|$|Other factors {{contributing}} to the rapid adoption of plug-in electric vehicles are the relative small size of the country, which reduces range anxiety (the Netherlands stretches about [...] east to west); {{a long tradition of}} environmental activism; high gasoline prices ( [...] per gallon as of January 2013), which make the cost of running a car on electricity five times cheaper; and also some EV leasing programs provide free or discounted gasoline-powered vehicles {{for those who want to}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacation</b> driving long distances.
