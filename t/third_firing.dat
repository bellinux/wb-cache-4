50|$|Kilns are an {{essential}} part of the manufacture of all ceramics. Ceramics require heat at high temperatures so chemical and physical reactions will occur to permanently alter the unfired body. In the case of pottery, clay materials are shaped, dried and then fired in a kiln. The final characteristics are determined by the composition and preparation of the clay body, by the temperature at which it is fired. After a first firing glazes may be used and the ware is fired a second time to fuse the glaze into the body. A <b>third</b> <b>firing</b> at a lower temperature may be required to fix overglaze decoration. Modern kilns often have sophisticated electrical control systems to firing regime, although pyrometric devices are often also used.|$|E
50|$|The pottery {{vessels are}} biscuit fired, usually between 900 ℃ and 1000 ℃. The fired vessel is dipped in a liquid glaze {{suspension}} which sticks to it, leaving a smooth and absorbent surface when dry. On this surface colours are applied by brush, the colours made from powered oxides mixed {{with water to}} a consistency of water-colour paint, sometimes {{with the addition of}} a binding agent such as gum arabic. The unfired glaze absorbs the pigment like fresco, making errors difficult to correct but preserving the brilliant colors of the oxides when fired. The glazed and decorated vessels are returned to the kiln for a second firing, usually between 1000 and 1120 ℃ (the higher temperatures used by modern potters). Lustered wares have a <b>third</b> <b>firing</b> at a lower temperature, necessitating a delicate control of the amount of oxygen in the kiln atmosphere and therefore a flame-burning kiln.|$|E

40|$|ZnS:Cu,Cl,Mn,Te, {{which shows}} red AC powder {{electroluminescence}} (ACPEL) emission, was synthesized using a conventional wet synthesis and a sealed vessel method. The photoluminescence (PL) and ACPEL were characterized. After the second firing, 0. 5 wt % tellurium (Te) -doped ZnS: Cu,Cl,Mn,Te phosphor shows almost red PL emission from the 4 T 1 – 6 A 1 transition of Mn 21 ions, which {{are affected by}} the Te. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure analysis on the Mn K edge proved that the substitution of sulfur (S) with Te changes the local crystal field of theMn 21 ions and shifts an orange emission (; 588 nm) to a red emission (; 650 nm). A red ACPEL emission is first shown in 0. 5 wt%Te-doped ZnS:Cu,Cl,Mn,Te after the <b>third</b> <b>firing</b> phosphor even though its luminance is not very high. The origin of the ACPEL emission is assumed to be not a CuxS–ZnS p–n junction but a CuxTe–ZnS p–n junction.

40|$|Two eervice {{propulsion}} system firings were required for rendezvous. The first firing, a corrective combination maneuver, {{was necessary to}} achieve the proper phase and altitude offset so that the second firing would result in an orbit coelliptic {{with that of the}} S-IW. The two firings achieved the desired conditions for rendezvous terminal phase initiation. The terminal phase initiation maneuver was performed with an onbaard computer solution based on optical tracking of the s-IVB stage with the sextant. A small midcourse correction was then made, followed by braking and final closure to within 70 feet of the S-IVB. Stationkeeping was performed for approximately 20 minutes, after which a 2 -foot-per-second service module reaction control system posigrade maneuver removed the spacecraft from the vicinity of the S-Iw stage.

40|$|A Buffalo curd {{packed in}} a clay pot {{is one of}} the most {{traditional}} dairy products in Sri Lanka. Although both clay pots and plastic cups are used for packaging of curd, the clay pot is the most popular package. However, the clay pot is disposable and become a waste after a use. This unsustainable consumption of limited clay resource is not environment friendly and cost effective. Re-using clay pots after re-firing will protect the earth while enhancing profit to the curd producer. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of re-firing of used curd packing clay pots on physical & microbiological qualities, quality of curd and analyze the possible energy saving. A Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used for the experiment with four treatments and eight replicates. The treatments are; Re-firing of used pots only once, twice, thrice and the control (new pots). Pots were re-fired at 800 0 C for one hour using a muffle furnace. Then the physical properties: weight, colour and compressive strength were measured. The initial microbial loads were tested by plate counts. Mold growth on curd was visually observed and pH was also measured to evaluate the shelf life of curd. According to the results, re-firing improved the red colour while reducing initial microbial counts. There was no effect on compressive strength and pot weight. The porosity of pots increased with re-firing. This led to excessive water loss resulting pH reduction of curd after <b>third</b> <b>firing.</b> Mold growth on curd was not observed for 12 days. Therefore, pots can be re-used at least twice after proper re-firing and there by 34 % of total energy and 2 / 3 rd of clay resources can be saved in the curd industry...|$|E
40|$|In the {{practice}} of Hungarian monument preservation there are obvious stresses emerging. These stresses are signed by conflicts unfolded recently and has appeared even in electronic and printed media. The debate about the last conservation of {{the ruins of the}} late Romanesque abby church in Zsámbék, or the open public capaign against the recently built covering roof above the ruins of the XIth century coronation church in Székesfehérvár, make it obvious, that there is a serious opposition between the professionals of monument preservation and the wide society. Within the field of architecture there is another opposition between the professional architects and the professional specialists of monument preservation. The idea of rebuilding a villa on the hillside of the Buda Castle designed by Miklós Ybl created raging storm in public media as a bitter aftermath of its planning conference. The <b>third</b> <b>firing</b> line is drown between certain groups of specialists of monument preservation. The strict followers of the Chart of Athens and Venice n the chartesians n has been in a continuous debate with other free thinkers of this field. It has always around the item of reconstruction of ruins. This theoretical debate has been international looking back a history of several decades since now. The inconsequent way of handling the phenomenon of the reconstruction of the historic downtowns of Warsow and Gdansk, while the charts had been strictly prohibit the reconstruction of ruins or the Japanese practice of handling the "Ise" sanctuary impossible to fit to European chartesian theories n are all represent several aspects of the inconsistency of monument preservation theories and practice worldwide. Analysing the ruins in Zsámbék I could prove that the recent conservation is in a strict correspondence to chartesian conceptions, so the public opposition has been caused by the theoretical bases. The international problem handling techniques had used to be creating exceptions. The Document of Nara in 1995 and the Chart of Krakow in 2001 underlines the "respect" towards different cultures (Ise-symptom) whereas reinforces the original ideas spreading their validity. When the exceptions getting to be numerous in a certain scientific field the crisis is close. The crisis will lead to a changing of paradigms. After the post-modern turn point in architecture during the 60 s and the 70 s, I cannot understand why these ideas left the monument preservation untouched, while the post-modern way of thinking is very similar to monument preservation ideas. The basic problem in ideas can be found among the circumstances of the birth of this discipline. As the preconceptions of museology and archeology had major influence on the newborn science the historic monuments has been handled as objects of art. This viewpoint misses the special character of buildings and their vigorous survival capability. Even in museology the "dead object" concept is fading and the reconstruction of the whole culture is prevailing. I offer a new meaning for the term iintegrated monument preservationî: we have to insert our present theories into the larger context of cultural history. In front of this new background the final aim of our activity must be the rebirth of the whole spiritual world that was dormant within the objects. So we should declare the priority of the living spiritual aspects related to traditional antiquity values, and the priority of a living monument related to dead object. For me the term "integrated preservation of heritage" means the reintegration of the past both in spiritual and objective sense of the word. This is the way to regain the lost respect and legitimity of monument preservation, as the Living Heritage will fulfill the role of this field within the society. ...|$|E
