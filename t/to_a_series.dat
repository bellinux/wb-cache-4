5|$|After much deliberation, Raskolnikov sneaks into Alyona Ivanovna's apartment, {{where he}} murders {{her with an}} axe. He also kills her half-sister, Lizaveta, who happens to stumble upon {{the scene of the}} crime. Shaken by his actions, Raskolnikov manages to steal only a handful of items and a small purse, leaving much of the pawn-broker's wealth untouched. Raskolnikov then flees and, due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of coincidences, manages to leave unseen and undetected.|$|E
5|$|Although Thảo's last plot failed, his {{activities}} in 1965 {{and the resultant}} infighting led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of internal purges within the ARVN. Amid the instability, the Vietcong made strong gains across the country throughout the year. In response to the deteriorating military situation, the Americans began to deploy combat troops to South Vietnam in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria is {{the type}} species of the genus. By extension, {{it is also the}} type species of Amanita {{subgenus}} Amanita, as well as section Amanita within this subgenus. Amanita subgenus Amanita includes all Amanita with inamyloid spores. Amanita section Amanita includes the species which have very patchy universal veil remnants, including a volva that is reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of concentric rings and the veil remnants on the cap <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of patches or warts. Most species in this group also have a bulbous base. Amanita section Amanita consists of A.muscaria and its close relatives, including A.pantherina (the panther cap), A.gemmata, A.farinosa, and A.xanthocephala. Modern fungal taxonomists have classified Amanita muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy. Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{identifying}} {{direct evidence}} of a crime, digital forensics {{can be used to}} attribute evidence to specific suspects, confirm alibis or statements, determine intent, identify sources (for example, in copyright cases), or authenticate documents. Investigations are much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis (where the usual aim is to provide answers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of simpler questions) often involving complex time-lines or hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|Between 1812 and 1816 {{divisions}} {{developed between}} an Unitarist faction centred on Buenos Aires and a Federalist faction in the provinces, which eventually led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of civil wars {{that ended with}} the conquest of Buenos Aires by Federalist caudillos at the Battle of Cepeda in 1820.|$|E
