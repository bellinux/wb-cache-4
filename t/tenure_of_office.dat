5|$|Stanton {{refused to}} leave his office, and on February 24, 1868, the House impeached the President for {{intentionally}} violating the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act, {{by a vote of}} 128 to 47. The House subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment, for the most part alleging that he had violated the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act, and had questioned the legitimacy of Congress.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{introduced}} a <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act, restricting Johnson from firing officials {{who had received}} Senate confirmation without getting that body's consent. The <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act was ambiguous, since it could be read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them, {{and most of the}} officials the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. Chief among these was Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a radical himself.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{notified}} Congress of Stanton's {{suspension and}} Grant's interim appointment. In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of his action, and reinstated Stanton, contending the President had violated the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act. Grant stepped aside over Johnson's objection, causing a complete break between them. Johnson then dismissed Stanton and appointed Lorenzo Thomas to replace him.|$|E

5|$|Johnson was {{initially}} deterred {{by a strong}} objection from Grant, but on August 5, the President demanded Stanton's resignation; the secretary refused to quit with Congress out of session. Johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of Congress as permitted under the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act; Grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the Army.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland was {{the first}} Democratic President subject to the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act which {{originated}} in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.|$|E
5|$|Re-elected in 1866, Hayes {{returned}} to the lame-duck session {{to vote for the}} <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act, which ensured that Johnson could not remove administration officials without the Senate's consent. He also unsuccessfully pressed for a civil service reform bill that attracted the votes of many reform-minded Republicans. Hayes continued to vote with the majority in the 40th Congress on the Reconstruction Acts, but resigned in July 1867 to campaign for governor of Ohio.|$|E

25|$|Through the {{leadership}} of Atty. Adel Tamano, the administration aggressively pursued its allocation for book acquisition to beef up the collection of PLM libraries, and allotted PhP 5 million to purchase new books for 2008 alone. Aside from improving the physical environment and setup, Tamano also revolutionized some of the existing policies and instituted reforms at the PLM, such as the implementing of stricter admission and retention policies, providing <b>of</b> <b>tenures</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> for deans <b>of</b> each school, upgrading of the wage and non-wage benefits of employees, and enforcing of zero tolerance on corruption, such as placing measures that would keep bidding and contract-awarding transparent and open to scrutiny.|$|R
50|$|James Haden Kerby (April 30, 1881 - September 11, 1957) was {{an early}} Arizona politician, elected 6 {{different}} times to the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> Secretary of State in the 1920s and 1930s. Kerby served the second longest <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> that <b>office,</b> his 12 years being only beaten by Wesley Bolin's 28 years, 9 months, and 18 days.|$|R
5|$|The defense {{relied on}} the {{provision}} of the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President {{had the right to}} test the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{spent most}} of his <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> in his diocese, only rarely {{attending}} the royal court or being assigned governmental duties. On 30 December 1223, Foliot assumed one of those duties, when he took custody of Hereford Castle after it was surrendered by Hubert de Burgh, during the redistribution of royal castles when de Burgh ousted des Roches from power. He also was appointed to determine the size of the royal forest in Gloucestershire. Foliot also founded a hospital in Ledbury, devoted to St Katherine. He helped found Alberbury Priory, a house of the Grandmontine order. In his cathedral, he reorganised the benefices and offices of the chapter, as well as endowing further benefices.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Taft {{wrote for}} a 6–3 {{majority}} in Myers v. United States that Congress could {{not require the}} president to get Senate approval before removing an appointee. Taft noted {{that there is no}} restriction of the president's power to remove officials in the constitution. Although Myers involved the removal of a postmaster, Taft in his opinion found invalid the repealed <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act, for violation of which his presidential predecessor, Andrew Johnson, had been impeached, though acquitted by the Senate. Taft valued Myers as his most important opinion.|$|E

5|$|On August 12, 1867, {{during a}} Senate recess, President Johnson {{suspended}} Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a Lincoln appointee who sympathized with Congressional Reconstruction. To keep Grant under control {{as a potential}} political rival, Johnson asked {{him to take the}} post. Grant recommended against the move, in light of the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act, which required Senate approval for cabinet removals. Johnson believed the Act did not apply to officers appointed by the previous president and forced the issue by making Grant an interim appointee on the same day. Grant agreed to accept the post temporarily, and Stanton vacated the office until the Senate reconvened.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the presidential}} {{election}} of 1868, Wilson toured the South giving political speeches. Many in the press believed Wilson was promoting himself to be the Republican presidential candidate. Wilson, however, supported the Civil War hero General Ulysses S. Grant. During Reconstruction Grant supported Republican Congressional initiatives rather than President Johnson's, and during the dispute over the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act which led to Johnson's impeachment, Grant served as temporary Secretary of War, but then returned the Department to Radical ally Edwin M. Stanton's control over Johnson's strong objection, making Grant a favorite to many Radicals.|$|E
5|$|Seymour's {{operatives}} sought Johnson's support, but he long {{remained silent}} on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, {{in part because of}} their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of President-elect Grant, who did not allow his to go.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} 1924 General Election Baldwin formed his second government, which saw {{important}} <b>tenures</b> <b>of</b> <b>office</b> by Sir Austen Chamberlain (Foreign Secretary), Winston Churchill (at the Exchequer) and Neville Chamberlain (Health). The latter two ministers strengthened Conservative appeal by reforms in areas formerly {{associated with the}} Liberal Party. They included industrial conciliation, unemployment insurance, a more extensive old-age pension system, slum clearance, more private housing, and expansion of maternal and child care. However, continuing sluggish economic growth and declines in mining and heavy industry weakened his base of support and, although Baldwin was supportive of Labour politicians forming minority governments at Westminster, his government also saw the General Strike in 1926 and the 1927 Trades Disputes Act to curb the powers of trade unions.|$|R

In case of internal or external danger he could declare {{a state of emergency}} in the country. He was authorized to appoint the Governors, the Judges of the Supreme Court, Auditor General and the Advocate General.|$|R

5|$|Johnson {{implemented}} his own form of Presidential Reconstruction– {{a series}} of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders, and passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, Congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, and Congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern {{for the remainder of}} his presidency. Johnson opposed the Fourteenth Amendment, which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, Johnson went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to destroy his Republican opponents. As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act, restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office. After failing to win the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination, Johnson left office in 1869.|$|E
5|$|Norreis was {{appointed}} to the abbacy of Evesham Abbey in 1190 and was blessed as abbot on 13 January 1190. He owed his appointment to King Richard and to Baldwin's attempts to make the dismissal from Christ Church look less like a defeat for the archbishop. Norreis also claimed that he received the office in return for unspecified services he rendered to Richard. There was no attempt at an election by the monks, a lack which went against canon law. During his <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> his monks accused him of fornication, excessive drinking, gluttony, setting up favourites, starving the monks, and appropriating monastic property for his own use. A further offence was his habit of wearing secular clothing rather than the monastic habit prescribed by the Benedictine Rule. All these charges come from one of his monks, the historian Thomas of Marlborough, who wrote much of the history of Evesham known as the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham. Thomas's account of Norreis's rule is biased against the abbot and is a self-aggrandising account of how Thomas single-handedly triumphed over both his and his abbey's foes. Norreis did manage some good for the abbey, as it was while he was abbot that the crossing tower of the monastic church was completed.|$|E
5|$|In January 1867, Congressman Stevens {{introduced}} legislation {{to dissolve the}} Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under martial law. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion {{of the process of}} adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to {{a modified version of the}} amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the First Reconstruction Act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.|$|E
50|$|In 1502, he was consecrated Bishop of London {{and became}} Keeper of the Great Seal, but his <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> both <b>offices</b> was short, as in 1504, he became Lord Chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1506, he became Chancellor of Oxford University, a role he held until his death. In 1509, he married and then crowned Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon.|$|R

During his <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> this <b>office</b> he was the acting manager of almost every public board, and a supporter of charitable institutions.|$|R

25|$|The {{election}} of 1866 decisively changed {{the balance of}} power, giving the Republicans two-thirds majorities {{in both houses of}} Congress, and enough votes to overcome Johnson's vetoes. They moved to impeach Johnson because of his constant attempts to thwart Radical Reconstruction measures, by using the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Act. Johnson was acquitted by one vote, but he lost the influence to shape Reconstruction policy.|$|E
25|$|Felix Louis Calonder (December 7, 1863 – June 14, 1952) was a Swiss politician, {{member of}} the Swiss Federal Council from 1913 to 1920, and President of the Confederation in 1918. He was {{affiliated}} to the Free Democratic Party. During his <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>office,</b> he held the Department of Home Affairs from 1913 to 1917, and the Political Department from 1918 to 1919. As of 2017, Felix Calonder has been the Federal Council's only native Romansh speaker.|$|E
25|$|Concerning Reconstruction, the President and Congress {{were deeply}} divided. Johnson, {{even when his}} amnesty policy had come under heavy criticism, had obdurately {{supported}} and continued it. Radical Republicans in Congress, however, came to prefer Stanton's military occupation proposal. The President's support from moderate Republicans dwindled after the gruesome anti-Negro riots in Memphis and New Orleans. The public seemed to be against Johnson as well. In the 1866 congressional elections, Republicans made sweeping gains on their Democratic rivals. In both the House and Senate elections, Republicans gained a two-thirds plurality of the seats. In the new year, some Republicans sought to use their majority to oust Johnson. They presented the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Bill, written with Stanton in mind. The President had long considered dismissing Stanton and replacing him with Maj. Gen. Sherman; the <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> <b>Office</b> Bill would have made this illegal without the advice and consent of Congress, which was unlikely to be given for Stanton, who was firmly supported by and cooperating with Radical Republicans. When the bill reached the President's desk, he vetoed it. His veto was overridden the same day.|$|E
50|$|His <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>office</b> <b>of</b> provost was not {{altogether}} free from controversy. He defied {{the order of}} Archbishop George Abbot {{that he and his}} colleagues should wear surplices in chapel. He insisted that as a layman he was entitled to dispense with that formality. Privately he was often in pecuniary difficulties, from which he sought to extricate himself by alienating the college estates to his wife and other relatives.|$|R

25|$|According to Alexander Hamilton, {{security}} <b>of</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> judicial <b>offices</b> {{is important}} for judicial independence, as appointments that require periodic renewal by the executive or legislature render the judiciary liable to rule in favour of these branches of government.
