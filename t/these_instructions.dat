5|$|Traditionally, {{computer}} software {{has been written}} for serial computation. To solve a problem, an algorithm is constructed and implemented as a serial stream of instructions. <b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> are executed on a central processing unit on one computer. Only one instruction may execute at a time—after that instruction is finished, the next one is executed.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> {{stated that}} the {{objectives}} of the Partisans meant that there could be no cooperation between them and the Chetniks. They also appointed Đurišić as a Chetnik vojvoda. Some historians have challenged the authenticity of these instructions; they say the document was a forgery made by Đurišić after he failed to reach Mihailović. Other historians either do not mention any controversy about the provenance of the instructions, mention evidence supporting their authenticity, or explicitly state they consider them to be authentic.|$|E
5|$|On April 1 Army Group B {{found itself}} {{completely}} surrounded in the Ruhr by the U.S. First and Ninth Armies. Hitler's {{response was to}} declare the Ruhr a fortress, from which he commanded that {{there was to be}} no surrender or attempt to break out, in an order similar to that which he had issued at Stalingrad. He further ordered that its physical economic infrastructure – the heart of Germany's industrial power – be destroyed by Army Group B to prevent it falling into Allied hands. Model ignored <b>these</b> <b>instructions.</b>|$|E

5|$|On May 2, 1683, the Captain of the frigate HMS Falcon was sailing from England to the West Indies and beckoned {{the other}} {{officers}} {{to be present}} as he broke open his secret instructions. He learned that his mission was {{to aid in the}} hunt for a large treasure near Hispaniola. A sloop in convoy, HMS Bonetta (sometimes Bonito), was designated to do most of the searching, but the Falcon would act as aid and protection. <b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> were from Sir John Narborough, a rear admiral and commissioner of the Royal Navy, who also had the ear of King Charles II.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral McGrigor {{issued an}} {{operational}} {{memo to the}} air units selected for Operation Mascot on 4 July, outlining how the attack would be conducted and providing further orders for the raid eight days later. In accordance with <b>these</b> <b>instructions,</b> the flying squadrons assigned to the three carriers undertook training exercises from their ships and shore bases from 4 July onwards. Intelligence gained from decrypting German radio messages during early July, and photos taken by a RAF aircraft on 12 July, provided further evidence that the battleship was once again fully operational and possibly preparing to put to sea. The airmen were informed on 13 July that they would attack Kaafjord in four days time.|$|E
5|$|At 8:32a.m., FAA {{officials}} were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and {{they in turn}} notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8:53a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had 9minutes' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and no notice {{about any of the}} other flights before they crashed. After both of the Twin Towers had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:30a.m. At 10:20a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked. <b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> were not relayed in time for the fighters to take action. Some fighters took to the air without live ammunition, knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets, the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes, possibly ejecting at the last moment.|$|E
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>instruction</b> sets {{also include}} {{numerous}} fixed sub-word instructions for shuffling, inserting and extracting the values around within the registers.

5|$|The prison {{officers}} {{guarding the}} gates outside the chapel abandoned them, and ran towards the Centre. The prison {{officer in charge}} of the Centre saw his colleagues running {{from the direction of the}} chapel, but due to the presence of scaffolding he was in a poor position to view the upper levels, and mistakenly assumed he saw prisoners running from the chapel. He informed other officers on C1 and D1 of this and, upon hearing that prisoners were in possession of keys, told them and officers on A1 that they should evacuate the prison. Governor Morrison, who was responsible for the main prison, was present and did not intervene with <b>these</b> <b>instructions.</b> Morrison then ordered officers to evacuate the Centre at 11:13 am as he mistakenly believed prisoners had entered the Centre. By this time prisoners had gained access to the roofs of E and F wings, and from there gained access to other wings by making holes in unprotected office ceilings.|$|E
5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement <b>these</b> <b>instructions</b> in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E
5|$|Desha {{was drawn}} into the Holley {{controversy}} during the 1824 presidential election. When no candidate achieved {{a majority of the}} electoral votes cast, the contest was resolved by the U.S. House of Representatives. Desha and the New Court partisans in the General Assembly instructed the state's congressional delegation to cast their votes for Andrew Jackson, but the delegation, led by House Speaker Henry Clay, defied <b>these</b> <b>instructions</b> and voted instead for John Quincy Adams. Because of this vote, Clay, a trustee for Transylvania and supporter of Holley, became Desha's political enemy. Desha's hostility for Transylvania and Holley worsened when, {{in the aftermath of the}} Isaac Desha trial, a student at Transylvania delivered a speech critical of the governor in the university's chapel. Although Holley was present for the speech, Transylvania historian John D. Wright, Jr. wrote that he did not know the student's topic beforehand and after hearing the speech, made no effort to condone its content. It was Holley's practice, however, to allow students to speak openly about current political matters, regardless of which position they took. Desha maintained that, because Holley had not silenced the student, he was at fault for tacitly condoning disrespectful criticism of the state's chief executive.|$|E
50|$|The {{first part}} of the first word is the opcode, {{the second part of the}} first word {{indicates}} a checkpoint register; the {{first part of}} the second word is the byte count field, the second part is the destination operand and the third part is the source operand. <b>These</b> <b>instruction</b> supported on the 990/12.|$|R
50|$|With a superscalar processor, the {{instruction}} {{window of the}} processor fills up {{with a number of}} instructions (known as the issue rate).

5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow <b>these</b> <b>instructions.</b>|$|E

25|$|Later, the Alpha {{included}} byte-word extensions, a set {{of instructions}} to manipulate 8-bit and 16-bit data types. <b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> were first introduced in the 21164A (EV56) microprocessor and are present in all subsequent implementations. <b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> performed operations that previously required multiple instructions to implement, which improved code density {{and the performance of}} certain applications. BWX also made the emulation of x86 machine code and the writing of device drivers easier.|$|E

25|$|The AGC {{also had}} a {{sophisticated}} software interpreter, developed by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, that implemented a virtual machine with more complex and capable pseudo-instructions than the native AGC. <b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> simplified the navigational programs. Interpreted code, which featured double precision trigonometric, scalar and vector arithmetic (16 and 24-bit), even an MXV (matrix × vector) instruction, could be mixed with native AGC code. While the execution time of the pseudo-instructions was increased (due {{to the need to}} interpret <b>these</b> <b>instructions</b> at runtime) the interpreter provided many more instructions than AGC natively supported and the memory requirements were much lower than in the case of adding <b>these</b> <b>instructions</b> to the AGC native language which would require additional memory built into the computer (at that time the memory capacity was very expensive). The average pseudo-instruction required about 24 ms to execute. The assembler and version control system, named YUL for an early prototype Christmas Computer, enforced proper transitions between native and interpreted code.|$|E

25|$|Count Extensions (CIX) was an {{extension}} to the architecture which introduced three instructions for counting bits. <b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> {{were categorized as}} integer arithmetic instructions. They were first implemented on the Alpha 21264A (EV67).|$|E
25|$|MIPS I has {{instructions}} for signed and unsigned integer multiplication and division. <b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> source their operands from two GPRs and write their results {{to a pair}} of 32-bit registers called HI and LO, since they may execute separately from (and concurrently with) the other CPU instructions. For multiplication, the high- and low-order halves of the 64-bit product is written to HI and LO (respectively). For division, the quotient is written to LO and the remainder to HI. To access the results, a pair of instructions (Move from HI and Move from LO) is provided to copy the contents of HI or LO to a GPR. <b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> are interlocked: reads of HI and LO do not proceed past an unfinished arithmetic instruction that will write to HI and LO. Another pair of instructions (Move to HI or Move to LO) copies the contents of a GPR to HI and LO. <b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> are used to restore HI and LO to their original state after exception handling. Instructions that read HI or LO must be separated by two instructions that do not write to HI or LO.|$|E
25|$|MIPS II {{removed the}} load delay slot and added several sets of {{instructions}}. For shared-memory multiprocessing, the Synchronize Shared Memory, Load Linked Word, and Store Conditional Word instructions were added. A set of Trap-on-Condition instructions were added. <b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> caused an exception if the evaluated condition is true. All existing branch instructions were given branch-likely versions that executed the {{instruction in the}} branch delay slot only if the branch is taken. <b>These</b> <b>instructions</b> improve performance in certain cases by allowing useful instructions to fill the branch delay slot. Doubleword load and store instructions for COP1ndash&3 were added. Consistent with other memory access instructions, these loads and stores required the doubleword to be naturally aligned.|$|E
50|$|<b>These</b> AVX <b>instructions</b> are in {{addition}} to the ones that are 256-bit extensions of the legacy 128-bit SSE instructions; most are usable on both 128-bit and 256-bit operands.|$|R
