2500|$|Oral {{rehydration}} solution (ORS) (a slightly sweetened {{and salty}} water) {{can be used}} to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given. There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two <b>tablespoons</b> <b>sugar</b> (18 grams) added (approximately the [...] "taste of tears"). Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half a teaspoon of salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness. Both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse.|$|E

Salt-cured herring is rinsed, cut in 1 cm (1/3in) thick slices and a raw, sliced onion added. Let stand for at least 24 hours.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the real}} origins of caipirinha, {{as it is}} known today, are unknown, {{according}} to one account it began around 1918 in the region of Alentejo in Portugal, with a popular recipe made with lemon, garlic and honey, indicated for patients with the Spanish flu. Today it is still being used as a remedy for the common cold. As it was quite common to add some distilled spirits to home remedies, in order to expedite the therapeutic effect, aguardente was commonly used. [...] "Until one day someone decided to remove the garlic and honey. Then added a few <b>tablespoons</b> <b>sugar</b> to reduce the acidity of lime. The ice came next, to ward off the heat," [...] explains Carlos Lima, executive director of IBRAC (Brazilian Institute of Cachaça).|$|E

50|$|Some recipes use up {{to three}} <b>tablespoons</b> of <b>sugar</b> in 3½ cups of chai. Condensed milk can also be added as a dual-purpose {{sweetener}} and dairy addition. Sugar is typically added to suit the drinker.|$|R
2500|$|The word in Dutch means [...] "measure of sugar". This has {{led some}} people to suggest - erroneously - that the island, capped with guano, may have resembled a <b>tablespoon</b> of <b>sugar</b> rising above {{the surface of the}} sea and that {{inspired}} the name.|$|R

5000|$|The drink {{crossed the}} Atlantic to the British colonies during the 18th century. Since brandy and wine were heavily taxed, rum from the Triangular Trade with the Caribbean was a {{cost-effective}} substitute. The inexpensive liquor, coupled with plentiful farm {{and dairy products}} available to colonists, helped the drink become very popular in America. When the supply of rum to the newly founded United States was reduced {{as a consequence of}} the American Revolutionary War, Americans turned to domestic whiskey, and eventually bourbon in particular, as a substitute. In places in the American colonies where even bourbon was too expensive, homemade moonshine spirits were added to eggnog. Eggnog [...] "became tied to the holidays" [...] when it was adopted in the United States in the 1700s. Eggnog [...] "...seems to have been popular on both sides of the Atlantic" [...] in the 18th century. Records show that the first US President, George Washington, [...] "...served an eggnog-like drink to visitors" [...] which included [...] "...rye whiskey, rum, and sherry." [...] The President's recipe called for a variety of alcoholic beverages along with the dairy and egg ingredients: [...] "One quart cream, one quart milk, one dozen <b>tablespoons</b> <b>sugar,</b> one pint brandy, 1/2 pint rye whiskey, 1/2 pint Jamaica rum, and 1/4 pint sherry." [...] The recipe instructs cooks to [...] "mix the liquor first, then separate yolks and whites of eggs, add sugar to beaten yolks, mix well. Add milk and cream, slowly beating. Beat whites of eggs until stiff and fold slowly into mixture. Let set in cool place for several days. Taste frequently." ...|$|E
50|$|Soy yogurt can be {{prepared}} at home using the same method as dairy yogurt. One <b>tablespoon</b> of <b>sugar</b> per 1 liter of unsweetened soy milk may be added to promote bacterial fermentation. Soy milk on its own lacks the lactose (milk sugar) that is the basic food for the yogurt bacteria.|$|R
50|$|Low cost coffee blade {{grinders}} {{for use in}} home kitchens {{frequently are}} difficult to clean. The Joy of Cooking (1997 edition) suggests a blade grinder may be cleaned by grinding a few <b>tablespoons</b> of <b>sugar</b> then wiping it out. Another suggestion is to clean around the blade with a soft brush or a damp cloth. Because these blade grinders frequently are used for grinding both coffee beans and spices, cleaning them well is important to prevent unwanted transfer of flavors. Some people keep two blade grinders, one for coffee {{and the other for}} spices.|$|R
5000|$|Many Naked juices {{contain more}} sugar per ounce than soft drinks. For example, Naked's [...] "Pomegranate Blueberry" [...] {{contains}} some 61g of <b>sugar</b> -- 5.3 <b>tablespoons</b> of <b>sugar</b> {{in a single}} bottle. [...] That equates to 1 teaspoon of sugar in every ounce of juice. This amount of sugar is greater than Coca Cola, which contains 3.25g of sugar per ounce. [...] Naked's [...] "Green Machine" [...] contains 3.5g of sugar per ounce, more than Pepsi Cola's 3.42g per ounce. [...] Naked juice is advertised as Pepsi's [...] "Good for you" [...] product line despite an even higher sugar content.|$|R
50|$|Nitrous oxide is {{used because}} it migrates easily into the cream, {{and does not}} cause the cream to oxidize while {{it is in the}} can.Cream must have a minimum fat content of 28% to produce whipped cream with a dispenser. To use a whipped cream dispenser, one starts by {{following}} a recipe — typically 1 cup of heavy cream, 2-3 <b>tablespoons</b> of <b>sugar,</b> and any flavorings/colorings as desired. The device is capped and one or two chargers are discharged into the unit, depending on its size. These pressurize the device with nitrous oxide and cause the fat-soluble gas to dissolve into the cream, just like carbon dioxide dissolves into water to create soda water. Shaking the dispenser a few times helps the gas dissolve. The dispenser is then ready for use.|$|R
50|$|Prepare the 250 ml of tea {{and allow}} to cool. Whisk the 5 <b>tablespoons</b> of <b>sugar</b> into the eggs (or egg yolks) and add a little cold white wine and then beat vigorously. Add the vanilla sugar to the mixture and pour in the {{remaining}} white wine, cinnamon, the cloves, lemon juice and the cooled tea. It is also optional to add 50ml of dark rum to the mixture. Transfer the mixture to a pan and gently heat. Do not let the mixture heat too quickly. Before the mixture comes to the boil remove from the heat, the mixture should be foaming on top. Remove the four cloves. Serve hot and foamy in a mug with optionally whipped cream on top and a ginger biscuit. (This recipe can also be made with red wine, however do not add 250 ml strong tea to the mixture, this will also affect the number of servings too.|$|R
2500|$|Food {{should be}} offered at {{the first signs of}} {{possible}} hypoglycemia. [...] If the animal refuses it, a sugar solution (corn syrup, honey, pancake syrup, etc.) should be poured on the finger and rubbed on its gums or under the tongue (sublingually). The solution must be applied this way to prevent possible aspiration of it. Intervet suggests one <b>tablespoon</b> of a <b>sugar</b> solution rubbed onto the gums, regardless {{of the size of the}} dog. Another hypoglycemia formula is 1gram of glucose for every kilogram (2.2lb) of the animal's body weight. Since sugar acts quickly, a response should be seen within a minute or two.|$|R
