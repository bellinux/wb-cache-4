50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, David Moffat, a Denver banker, {{established}} the Denver, Northwestern and Pacific Railway {{with the intention}} of building a railroad over the Front Range {{in the vicinity of the}} pass. The line was known as the Moffat Road, ran 23 miles over the pass, with a 4% grade along many stretches, and was one of the highest adhesion (non-cog) railroads ever constructed in North America. Along this route is the closed Needle's Eye Tunnel (not to be confused with lower and longer Moffat Tunnel constructed some 30 years later). Other notable landmarks on the route included Riflesight Notch, a one-and-one-half mile loop where trains crossed over a trestle, performed ~90 degree gradual turn to descend 150 feet, and passed through a tunnel underneath the trestle. A small rail stop called Corona was established as a station at the top of the pass, with a restaurant and lodging, which allowed workers to help keep the rail line free of snow in the winter. Despite the fact that the line was enclosed in almost continuous snow sheds near the top of the pass, trains were often stranded for several days (and in some cases for up to 30 days) during heavy winter snowstorms because the snow could fall through the wood planking of the sheds. Coal smoke and toxic gasses collected in the snow sheds causing <b>temporary</b> blindness, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> and sometimes death. Workers on the Moffat Road had an adage: There's winter and then there's August. It was these heavy snowstorms that led to the financial demise of the Moffat Road and served as the incentive for construction of a permanent railroad tunnel through the Rocky Mountains. Because the Rollins Pass route was intended to be temporary, it was constructed as cheaply as possible: using high trestles, 4% grades and switchbacks instead of high fills, iron bridges, and tunnels. Because of the high-altitude nature of the route, the route utilized wyes instead of turntables to turn locomotives around.|$|R
40|$|Syncope is a {{syndrome}} {{consisting of}} {{a relatively short period}} <b>of</b> <b>temporary</b> and self-limited <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> caused by transient diminution of blood flow to the brain (most often the result of systemic hypotension). Syncope comprises part of a subset of clinical conditions in which <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> is transient. Other conditions in this group, which are not syncope and should be clearly distinguished from syncope, include, for example, seizure disorders, posttraumatic <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> and cataplexy. Recent surveys indicate that syncope accounts for approximately 1 % of emergency department visits in Europe, although older reports from the United States placed this number closer to 3 %. The reported prevalence of syncope in the population varies: 15 % of children before the age of 18 years; 25 % of a military population aged 17 to 26 years; 16 % and 19 %, respectively, in men and women aged 40 to 59 years; and up to 23 % in a nursing home population older than 70 years. The highest frequency of syncope occurs in patients with cardiovascular comorbidity and older patients in institutional care settings. The causes of syncope are numerous and, not infrequently, multiple factors may contribute. The diagnostic evaluation is benefited by availability of a detailed medical history and reports of eyewitnesses. In this context, the physician must consider the classification of the causes of syncope, and address the most likely causes first. The principal groups of causes may be summarized as: (1) neurally mediated reflex syncope (eg, vasovagal faint, carotid sinus syndrome); (2) orthostatic (postural) syncope; (3) cardiac arrhythmias; (4) structural cardiac and pulmonary causes; and (5) cerebrovascular disorders (rare). In addition, conditions that may mimic syncope but are not true syncope (eg, psychogenic pseudosyncope) must be considered. Only after a definitive cause is established can appropriate treatment be initiated. In this regard, the syncope evaluation is facilitated by maintaining an organized diagnostic approach. The practitioner should avoid wasteful use of short-term ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings (eg, Holter monitors) and rarely positive neurologic tests (eg, electroencephelography, head magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography) in the absence of head trauma or evident neurologic signs. In many medical centers the evaluation of patients with syncope is haphazard, and may be substantially enhanced by establishment of a multidisciplinary syncope evaluation unit or tea...|$|R

50|$|Its {{physiological}} role involves {{attention and}} arousal, including {{control of the}} level of cortical activity. Some frequencies of extracellular electrical stimulation of the centromedian nucleus can cause absence seizures (<b>temporary</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness)</b> although electrical stimulation can be of therapeutic use in intractable epilepsy and Tourette's syndrome. General anaesthetics specifically suppress activity in the ILN, including the centromedian nucleus. Complete bilateral lesions of the centromedian nucleus can lead to states normally associated with brain death such as coma, death, persistent vegetative state, forms of mutism and severe delirium. Unilateral lesions can lead to unilateral thalamic neglect.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} {{automatism}} {{may be found}} in cases of intoxication.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying anesthesia-induced <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{remain a}} matter of debate. Recent electrophysiological reports suggest that while initial propofol infusion provokes an increase in fast rhythms (from beta to gamma range), slow activity (from delta to alpha range) rises selectively during <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Dynamic causal modeling was used to investigate the neural mechanisms mediating these changes in spectral power in humans. We analyzed source-reconstructed data from frontal and parietal cortices during normal wakefulness, propofol-induced mild sedation, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Bayesian model selection revealed that the best model for explaining spectral changes across the three states involved changes in corticothalamic interactions. Compared with wakefulness, mild sedation was accounted for {{by an increase in}} thalamic excitability, which did not further increase during <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> In contrast, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> per se was accompanied by a decrease in backward corticocortical connectivity from frontal to parietal cortices, while thalamocortical connectivity remained unchanged.

40|$|Thalamocortical {{networks}} play {{an important}} role in information integration during consciousness. However, little is known about how the information flows between the thalamus and the cortex are affected by a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> To investigate this issue, we analyzed effective connectivity between the cortex and the thalamus in animals during anesthesia-induced transitions. By recording the electroencephalogram from the primary motor and the primary somatosensory cortex and by recording local field potentials from the ventral lateral and the ventrobasal thalamic nuclei, we evaluated changes in the conditional Granger causality between cortical and thalamic electrical activity as mice gradually lost consciousness from the use of anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine). The point <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> was indicated by a moment <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> movement that was measured using a head-mounted motion sensor. The results showed that 65 % of the thalamocortical information flows were changed by anesthesia-induced <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Specifically, the effective connectivity between the cortex and the ventral lateral thalamus was altered such that the primary motor and the primary somatosensory cortex Granger-caused the ventral lateral thalamus before <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> whereas the ventral lateral thalamus Granger-caused the primary motor cortex and the primary somatosensory cortex after <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> In contrast, the primary somatosensory cortex consistently Granger-caused the ventrobasal thalamus, regardless <b>of</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> These results suggest how information flows change across the thalamocortical network during transitions in consciousness. open...|$|R

5000|$|CNH {{has been}} found to affect people of all ages, ranging from {{children}} at the age of seven to adults at the age of eighty-seven. [...] It has affected people while they have been both conscious and unconscious. After Plum and Swanson's initial discovery of CNH it was thought that CNH was rare in conscious patients. More cases of CNH have been observed in conscious patients since then. Additional symptoms of conscious CNH include loss of appetite, difficulty concentrating, poor memory, difficulties in eating or talking, cachexia, vomiting, disorientation, and a generalized confused state that varies from patient to patient. [...] It is generally seen, however, that the mood changes, anxiety, and difficulty concentrating progress as the tumor increases in severity and, in effect, CNH persists. All of these symptoms are not present in each reported case of CNH, and symptoms seem to vary on a case to case basis. Other symptoms that have been associated with CNH are transient epileptic episodes with a <b>temporary</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> This condition is thought to result from severe hypocapnia that induces blood vessels in the brain to constrict, leading to brain ischemia.

5000|$|The {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} controls all automatic functions {{in the body and}} contains two subsections within it that aids in response to an acute stress reaction. These two subunits are the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic response is colloquially known as the [...] "fight or flight" [...] response, indicated by accelerated pulse and respiration rates, pupil dilation, and a general feeling of anxiety and hyper-awareness. This is caused by the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal glands. the norepinephrine and epinephrine strike the beta receptors of the heart in order to feed the heart sympathetic nerve fibers to increase the strength of heart muscle contraction. as a result more blood is being circulated increasing the heart rate and respiratory rate. The sympathetic nervous system also stimulates the skeletal system and muscular system in an effort to pump more blood to those areas to handle the acute stress. Simultaneously the sympathetic nervous system inhibits the digestive system and the urinary system in order to optimize blood flow to the heart, lungs, and skeletal muscles. This plays a role in the alarm reaction stage. The para-sympathetic response is colloquially known as the [...] "rest and digest" [...] response, indicated by reduced heart and respiration rates, and more obviously by a <b>temporary</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> if the system is fired at a rapid rate. The parasympathetic nervous system stimulates the digestive system and urinary system in order to send more blood to those systems to increase the process of digestion. In order to do this, it must inhibit the cardiovascular system and respiratory system in an effort to optimize blood flow to the digestive tract causing low heart and respiratory rates. parasympathetic plays no role in acute stress response (VanPutte Regan Russo 2014).|$|E
