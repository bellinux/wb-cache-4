5|$|The Inn {{is run by}} Pension, its {{ultimate}} governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray's Inn—at Lincoln's Inn the governing body is called the Council, and at the Inner and Middle Temples {{it is called the}} Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard's Inn, Clement's Inn and New Inn. In Gray's Inn the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the Readers would be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray's Inn is made up of the Masters of the Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by <b>the</b> <b>Treasurer,</b> a senior Bencher. <b>The</b> <b>Treasurer</b> has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between individuals, with a term of one year.|$|E

50|$|Duties {{currently}} {{performed by}} the Comptroller's office were previously divided {{between it and the}} office of Texas State Treasurer; however, over time the Texas Legislature transferred most of <b>the</b> <b>Treasurer's</b> functions to <b>the</b> Comptroller's office. <b>The</b> last State <b>Treasurer,</b> Martha Whitehead, successfully campaigned for office in 1994 on the premise of abolishing the position and transferring its few remaining duties to the Comptroller's office; upon winning she successfully campaigned the Legislature for a Constitutional amendment in 1995 to formally abolish <b>the</b> <b>Treasurer's</b> office which was approved by voters in November of that year. By 1996, the Comptroller had taken over <b>the</b> <b>Treasurer's</b> few remaining duties.|$|R
5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>treasurer</b> of {{the riches}} of the world, Kubera is {{prescribed}} to be worshipped. Kubera also credited money to the god Venkateshwara (a form of the god Vishnu) for his marriage with Padmavati.

5|$|During Hughes's absence in Europe in mid-1919, {{the acting}} Prime Minister was <b>the</b> <b>Treasurer,</b> William Watt; Millen served as acting Prime Minister when Watt fell ill during July.

He returned to Australia in 1921, having arranged for the funding of Australia's debts and reorganised Australia House.|$|E
5|$|In his films, {{the common}} man exaggerations continued. Much {{of his time in}} the films was spent {{spoofing}} himself, whether it was the affected nervousness of <b>the</b> <b>treasurer</b> in The Treasurer's Report or the discomfort in explaining The Sex Life of the Polyp to a women's club. The longer, plot-driven shorts, such as Lesson Number One, Furnace Trouble, and Stewed, Fried and Boiled, likewise show a Benchley character overmatched by seemingly mundane tasks. Even the more stereotypical characters held these qualities, such as the incapable sportscaster Benchley played in The Sport Parade.|$|E

Arthur perished on Glastonbury Tor in 1539, hanged, drawn and quartered alongside his master, Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury, during the dissolution of the monasteries. The Abbot sat on a Glastonbury chair of this type during his trial at the Bishop's Palace. Other chairs of this age and later reproductions can also be seen.|$|E

Returning to Australia, he resumed his position as CFI at Point Cook in May 1937. At the direction of the Federal government, he was responsible for training <b>the</b> <b>Treasurer,</b> Richard Casey, to fly; the use of Air Force facilities for his own benefit by an elected official led to adverse publicity when it was revealed by the media. In September 1937, Scherger test flew the North American NA-16 at Laverton; the evaluation program led to the design being adapted as the CAC Wirraway the following year.

5|$|Stevenson {{was born}} in Newquay, Cornwall, on 17 October 1902, the eldest child and only son of the Reverend John George Stevenson and his wife Olive, sister of Henry Wickham Steed, {{journalist}} and editor of The Times from 1919 until 1922. Reverend Stevenson, a Congregational minister, died when his son was fourteen years old, plunging the family into economic distress. An uncle who was a solicitor funded Stevenson's ongoing education at Dulwich College in London, intending that the young Stevenson would join the family firm once his schooling was complete. There was no money available {{to allow him to}} attend university, so Stevenson studied for an external London University LLB degree after becoming an articled clerk in his uncle's legal practice. Stevenson was determined to become a barrister, and joined the Inner Temple, of which he became <b>the</b> <b>treasurer</b> in 1972.|$|E
5|$|The Chancellor was {{effectively}} the first {{minister of the}} kingdom. His department, the chancery, {{was responsible for the}} Great Seal, which was needed to process the inheritance of land titles and the confirmation of land transfers. His key responsibility was to preside at meetings of the privy council, and on those rare occasions he attended, at meetings of the court of session. The second most prestigious office was the Secretary, who was responsible for the records of the Privy council and for foreign policy, including the borders, despite which the post retained its importance after the Union of Crowns in 1603. <b>The</b> <b>Treasurer</b> was the last of the major posts and, with the Comptroller, dealt with the royal finances until the Comptroller's office was merged into the Treasurer's from 1610.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{head of the}} Exchequer {{for much}} of its {{existence}} was the Lord High Treasurer, who was tasked with collecting royal revenues.

During the reign of Elizabeth I the Treasurer's other duties began to increase, and he played less of a role in the Exchequer's affairs. By the 17th century, the Lord High Treasurer had been replaced by a dedicated Treasurer of the Exchequer (although earlier writs show that the Lord High Treasurer had been independently given this title), who was ceremoniously presented with a white staff by the monarch. <b>The</b> <b>Treasurer,</b> while active in the revenue side of the Exchequer, played little or no active role in the Exchequer of Pleas.|$|E
