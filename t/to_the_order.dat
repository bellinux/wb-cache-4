5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{appointments}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> were largely political, from the 1770s appointments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> were increasingly made for naval, military or diplomatic achievements. This is {{partly due to}} the conflicts Britain was engaged in over this period. The Peninsular War resulted in so many deserving candidates for the Bath that a statute was issued allowing the appointment of Extra Knights in time of war, who were to be additional to the numerical limits imposed by the statutes, and whose number was not subject to any restrictions. Another statute, this one issued some 80 years earlier, had also added a military note <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Order.</b> Each knight was required, under certain circumstances, to supply and support four men-at-arms for a period not exceeding 42 days in any year, to serve in any part of Great Britain. This company was to be captained by the Great Master, who had to supply four trumpeters, and was also to appoint eight officers for this body, however the statute was never invoked.|$|E

5|$|The British monarch is Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the monarch's {{representative}} in Ireland, {{served as the}} Grand Master. The office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished in 1922; the last Lord Lieutenant and Grand Master was The 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent. Rather oddly, the statutes of the Order did not provide that the Grand Master be admitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> {{as a matter of}} right.

When the Irish Free State left the United Kingdom that same year, the Irish Executive Council under W. T. Cosgrave chose to make no further appointments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Order.</b> The British government continued to entertain hopes for the order's revival as a pan-Irish institution. Therefore, while there was no legal or constitutional bar to the British government continuing to make appointments from among British subjects resident in Northern Ireland, it chose not to do so.|$|E

The latter organized protests outside of Rideau Hall on 9 July, while compatriots did the same in front of Government House in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, the official residence of that province's lieutenant governor.|$|E

5|$|Ants are eusocial insects of {{the family}} Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> Hymenoptera.

More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.|$|E
5|$|Any Canadian citizen or {{corporate}} body can petition for {{a grant of}} new arms or registration of existing arms.

A number of grants have been made to people who have already been recognized with state honours for their notable achievements, such as through admission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> of Canada, and who are accordingly entitled to a grant of arms. Those who are Companions of the order may also request the chief herald to grant them supporters.|$|E
