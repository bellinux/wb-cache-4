5|$|Rigmor Mydtskov (1925–2010) was a Danish court {{photographer}} who is remembered both for her portraits of artists performing in Danish theatres {{but also for}} her many portraits of Queen Margrethe {{and other members of}} the Danish royal family. Realizing that people in such positions tend <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> masked, she sought to portray the person behind the mask, although she often succeeded in maintaining a little of the secrecy. As a portrait photographer, she was gentle, intuitive and confident. Her life's work is a result of a constant, concentrated effort.|$|E
5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{they are going to do}} something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E
5|$|It was not Burr, but the Romantic {{poet and}} writer Percy Bysshe Shelley {{who had the}} {{greatest}} impact on Imlay and her sisters' lives. Impressed by Godwin's Political Justice, Shelley wrote to him and the two started corresponding. In 1812, Shelley asked if Imlay, then 18 and the daughter of one of his heroes, Mary Wollstonecraft, could come live with him, his new wife, and her sister. Having never actually met Shelley and being sceptical of his motivations (Shelley had eloped to marry his wife, Harriet), Godwin refused. When Shelley finally came to visit the Godwins, all three girls were enamoured of him, particularly Imlay. Both Shelley and Imlay were interested in discussing radical politics; for example, Shelley liked <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> class were irrelevant, but she argued that it was significant in daily affairs.|$|E

5000|$|The Bishop of Dover {{is given}} the {{additional}} title of [...] "Bishop in Canterbury" [...] and empowered <b>to</b> <b>act</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury, since the archbishop is so frequently away fulfilling national and international duties.|$|R
5|$|The {{impending}} {{dinner with}} Mr. Burns divides the Simpson household. Homer pragmatically supports Mr. Burns, while Marge and Lisa oppose him. Before the dinner arrives, Mr. Burns's advisers prepare {{the family for}} the event, even giving them pre-written questions to ask in lieu of conversation. Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all, but Marge tells her not to worry. To everyone's surprise, Marge serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns tries <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it does not bother him, but {{is not able to}} keep from spitting it out. The cameras flash as the bite flies through the air, {{and by the time the}} chunk hits the floor the press is gone and his governatorial campaign dissolves. Bailey wins the election and, despite Mr. Burns saying that Homer's dreams will be unfulfilled for as long as he is alive, the Simpson family happily get together again.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these, come (which {{may or may}} not be an auxiliary) may be used to indicate speaker indignation, such as in Don't come acting like you don't know what happened and you started the whole thing ('Don't try <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you don't know what happened, because you started the whole thing').|$|E
500|$|Two authors later {{reviewed}} the short film and documented two central themes. The {{first is a}} [...] "Child/Man" [...] theme; the role of both a boy and an adult, which writer James M. Curtis states Jackson plays throughout the music video for [...] "Say Say Say". Curtis writes that the bathroom scene involving the shaving foam is reminiscent of boys copying their fathers. He adds that the scene marks [...] "the distinction between Michael's roles as a Child and as a Man". The writer also highlights the part where the singer supposedly becomes strengthened with a miracle potion, a further play on the [...] "Child/Man" [...] theme. Furthermore, Curtis observes that Paul and Linda McCartney seem <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are Jackson's parents in the short film. The author also notes that in a scene where Jackson is handed {{a bouquet of flowers}} from a girl, it is a reversal of one from City Lights, a 1931 film starring Charlie Chaplin, whom the singer greatly adored.|$|E

500|$|The fifth episode, [...] "Kush", {{was filmed}} on a damaged {{fuselage}} set, {{which was built}} by production designer Bridget McGuire. The episode's cast disliked the episode the most because they had <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were in freezing temperatures, where {{in fact it was}} around 40degrees Celsius. Because it was an expensive set, the producers wanted to reuse it. It was later redesigned to look like the inside of a submarine for [...] "Requiem". It was redressed again for [...] "Revelations". Although released third, [...] "Fata Morgana" [...] was filmed as the fourth episode, and was considered to be aired after [...] "Folding Man". However, Tapping felt strongly that it would make a great stand alone episode after [...] "Sanctuary for All", and the characters appeared more comfortable with each other in [...] "Folding Man". Swapping the episodes caused a major continuity issue, in which Ashley appears to show scratches on her neck from [...] "Sanctuary for All" [...] in [...] "Folding Man", but not in between.|$|E
500|$|In what {{historian}} Robert R. Russell {{calls the}} [...] "Calhoun Doctrine", Calhoun {{argued that the}} Federal Government's role in the territories was only that of the trustee or agent of the several sovereign states: it was obliged not to discriminate among the states and hence was incapable of forbidding the bringing into any territory of anything that was legal property in any state. Calhoun argued that citizens from every state {{had the right to}} take their property to any territory. Congress and local voters, he asserted, had no authority to place restrictions on slavery in the territories. As constitutional historian Hermann von Holst noted, [...] "Calhoun's doctrine made it a solemn constitutional duty of the United States government and of the American people <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the existence or non-existence of slavery in the Territories did not concern them in the least." [...] The Calhoun Doctrine was opposed by the Free Soil forces, which merged into the new Republican Party around 1854. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney based his decision in the 1857 Supreme Court case Dred Scott v. Sandford, in which he ruled that the federal government could not prohibit slavery in any of the territories, upon Calhoun's arguments. However, moderates at this time rejected these beliefs, and Taney's decision became a major point of partisan attack by the Republican Party.|$|E
500|$|With these issues, Kavanagh {{argues that}} there {{are likely to be}} consequences. Firstly, if judges replace the text of a statute with the meaning given to it by a single {{minister}} in Parliament, there is a risk that they will attribute a meaning to it which was not supported by the MPs; interpretations, based on the views of ministers, are more likely to reflect the executive's intention than that of Parliament. Kavanagh also suggests that it could impact on the actions of ministers; rather than attempting to specify law through the difficult route of placing it in legislation, they can simply make a statement within Parliament about the legislation's intent. Lord Mackay's worry that this would increase the cost of litigation was also considered; under Pepper, every lawyer must go through every word said in both Houses of Parliament and in the various committees to ensure that they are giving the best advice to their client. Academics have also expressed worry about the reliability of Hansard as a source; [...] "the debate on the Bill is a battle of wits often carried out under extreme pressure and excitement where much more than the passage of this Bill may be at stake. The Ministers supporting it cannot be expected <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were under oath in a court of law".|$|E

5000|$|In 1884-1885, when Garfield's successor, Chester A. Arthur, was {{suffering}} {{the effects of}} the Bright's disease that would take his life less than two years after he left office.

5000|$|... 32-bit x86 {{processors}} {{themselves have}} two legacy modes: real mode and virtual 8086 mode. Real mode causes the processor <b>to</b> mostly <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it was an}} original 8086, while virtual 8086 mode allows {{the creation of a}} virtual machine to allow the running of programs that require real mode in order to run under a protected mode environment. Protected mode is the non-legacy mode of 32-bit x86 processors and the 80286.|$|R
500|$|Snowball V, later renamed Snowball II, is the Simpson family's fifth cat and {{is almost}} {{identical}} in appearance to Snowball II. In [...] "I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot", the Crazy Cat Lady gives Lisa {{one of her}} cats while she is mourning {{the death of her}} other four cats that are killed in the episode. Lisa then tells the cat to leave, as any cat that she owns is unlucky and is certain to be killed. As the cat starts to cross Evergreen Terrace, a car driven by Gil Gunderson drives past. As Gil swerves to avoid hitting the cat, his car hits a tree and bursts into flames, thereby giving him insurance compensation for his meals. Since the cat is intact and whole, Lisa takes it as a sign of good luck and adopts her. Lisa renames Snowball V [...] "Snowball II" [...] {{at the end of the}} episode, in her words [...] "to save money on a new dish", also promising <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the whole thing did not actually happen. Snowball V also is the focus of a subplot in the sixteenth season episode [...] "The Seven-Beer Snitch", in which she becomes overweight after abandoning the Simpsons for brief periods to visit a different family but she then goes back to live with the Simpson family. Snowball V dies after being accidentally stabbed by Rachel's knife after Rachel tried to kill Marge in [...] "BFF RIP", but this is non-canon since this was a Treehouse of Horror segment.|$|E
2500|$|In North Carolina, the Department of Transportation added cameras, {{message boards}} and safety patrols in the {{counties}} where the total eclipse would take place, {{as well as}} stopping road work.

2500|$|However, {{according}} to Greil Marcus, Laughton {{was the main}} act of Sullivan's show.

Laughton {{had to make the}} moment invisible: <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> nobody was actually waiting for anything.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} January 1560, an English fleet, {{under the}} command of William Wynter, arrived in the Firth of Forth, having sailed north from the naval base at Queenborough Castle in the Thames Estuary. English diplomats claimed Wynter's arrival in the Firth was accidental, and Norfolk told Wynter <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he was a {{maverick}} with no commission. The ships were sent by William Cecil under the authority of Queen Elizabeth. On 2 February, a proclamation was issued {{in the name of the}} Queen of Scots to summon the men of Selkirk and Jedburgh to be ready to mobilise against the [...] "wicked doings of the English ships" [...] in Scottish waters, and the intended invasion of the Merse and East Lothian.|$|E

Jamie, has not returned home, but has elected instead to continue drinking and to visit the local whorehouse. After calling Jamie a [...] "hopeless failure" [...] Mary warns that his bad influence will drag his brother down as well. After seeing the condition that his wife is in, her husband expresses the regret that he bothered to come home, and he attempts to ignore her as she continues her remarks, which include blaming him for Jamie’s drinking, and noting that the Irish are stupid drunks. Then, as often happens in the play, Mary and James try to get over their animosity and attempt to express their love for one another by remembering happier days. When James goes to the basement to get another bottle of whiskey, Mary continues to talk with Edmund.|$|E

The EU-3 in return explicitly agreed to recognize Iran's nuclear rights and to discuss ways Iran could provide [...] "satisfactory assurances" [...] regarding its nuclear power program, after which Iran would gain easier access to modern technology.

2500|$|Gabbard {{previously}} opposed both {{civil unions}} and same-sex marriage. As a Hawaii state legislator in 2004, she argued against civil unions, saying, [...] "To try <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{there is a}} difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii who have already made overwhelmingly clear our position on this issue... As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists." [...] Gabbard opposed Hawaii House Bill 1024, which would have established legal parity between same-sex couples in civil unions and married straight couples, and led a protest against the bill outside the room where the House Judiciary Committee held the hearing. In the same year, Gabbard expressed her opposition to Hawaii undertaking research on LGBT students, arguing that it would be a violation of their privacy and that [...] "many parents would see the study as an indirect attempt by government to encourage young people to question their sexual orientation". At the time, she disputed that Hawaii schools were rampant with anti-gay discrimination.|$|E

St. Benedict of Nursia (480-543 A.D.), later a Christian saint, {{the founder}} of western monasticism and [...] the Order of St. Benedict, today {{the patron saint of}} Europe, {{established}} the first monastery in Europe (Monte Cassino) on a hilltop between Rome and Naples, that became a model for the Western monasticism and one of the major cultural centers of Europe throughout the Middle Ages, where he wrote the [...] "Rule", containing directions for monks and Christians. The Rule of Saint Benedict {{is one of the most}} important written works in the shaping of Western civilian society because it included a written constitution, authority limited by law, and a degree of democracy. Besides, it mandated the moral obligations to care for the sick. In Monte Cassino St. Benedict founded a hospital that is considered today to have been the first hospital in Europe of the new era. There Benedictine [...] monks took care of the sick and wounded according to the Benedict's Rule. The monastic routine called for hard work. The care of the sick was such an important duty that those caring for them were enjoined <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they served Christ directly.|$|E
