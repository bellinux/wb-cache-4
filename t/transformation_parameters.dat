40|$|Abstract—To analyze non normal data, {{the data}} should be {{transformed}} {{to a normal}} distribution. The well-known Box-Cox transformation {{can be used to}} get the normality. Since the <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter</b> is usually unknown, many statisticians studied the methods of estimation of the <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter,</b> λ, appearing in the Box-Cox transformation. Moreover, we can use the numerical methods for single variable function optimization to find the value of the <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter</b> λ such as bisection method, Newton’s method, secant method, and others. The alternative numerical method λ is applied to find the suitable value of λ. It is better than the bisection method {{in the context of the}} number of function evaluations and the processing time...|$|R

Since a total of seven parameters (three translations, one scale, three rotations) have to be determined, at least two points and one coordinate of a third point (for example, the Z-coordinate) must be known. This gives a system of linear equations with seven equations and seven unknowns, which can be solved.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} class of power-transformed linear {{quantile}} regression models for survival data subject to random censoring. The estimation procedure follows two sequential steps. First, for a given <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter,</b> we can easily obtain the estimates for the regression coefficients by minimizing a well-defined convex objective function. Second, we can estimate the <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter</b> based on a model discrepancy measure by constructing cumulative sum processes. We show that both the regression and <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter</b> estimates are strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. The variance-covariance matrix depends on the unknown density function of the error term, so we estimate the variance by the usual bootstrap approach. We examine {{the performance of the}} proposed method for finite sample sizes through simulation studies and illustrate it with a real data example. © 2008 American Statistical Association. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Frequency-domain methods {{find the}} <b>transformation</b> <b>parameters</b> for {{registration}} {{of the images}} while working in the transform domain. Such methods work for simple transformations, such as translation, rotation, and scaling. Applying the phase correlation method {{to a pair of}} images produces a third image which contains a single peak. The location of this peak corresponds to the relative translation between the images. Unlike many spatial-domain algorithms, the phase correlation method is resilient to noise, occlusions, and other defects typical of medical or satellite images. Additionally, the phase correlation uses the fast Fourier transform to compute the cross-correlation between the two images, generally resulting in large performance gains. The method can be extended to determine rotation and scaling differences between two images by first converting the images to log-polar coordinates. Due to properties of the Fourier transform, the rotation and scaling parameters can be determined in a manner invariant to translation.|$|E

40|$|The Box-Cox {{transformation}} {{is applied to}} the linear mixed models for analyzing positive and grouped data. The problem in using Box Cox {{transformation is}} that the maximum likelihood estimator of the <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter</b> is generally inconsistent. To fix it, we suggest a simple and consistent estimator for the <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter</b> based on the moment method. The consistent estimator is used to construct consistent estimators of the parameters involved in the model and under some conditions, the estimators of model parameters are shown to be consistent under m→∞, where m is the number of groups. Moreover, in estimation of the expectation of the (future) observations, it is shown that the resulting estimators also hold consistency owing to the consistent estimator of the <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter.</b> The proposed estimating method is compared with the maximum likelihood method via simulation and it is shown that the proposed estimator works better than the maximum likelihood estimator.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{nursing and}} health related {{research}} studies have continuous outcome measures that are inherently non-normal in distribution. The Box-Cox transformation provides {{a powerful tool}} for developing a parsimonious model for data representation and interpretation when the distribution of the dependent variable, or outcome measure, of interest deviates from the normal distribution. The objectives {{of this study was to}} contrast the effect of obtaining the Box-Cox power <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter</b> and subsequent analysis of variance with or without a priori knowledge of predictor variables under the classic linear or linear mixed model settings. Methods Simulation data from a 3 × 4 factorial treatments design, along with the Patient Falls and Patient Injury Falls from the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI ®) for the 3 rd quarter of 2007 from a convenience sample of over one thousand US hospitals were analyzed. The effect of the nonlinear monotonic transformation was contrasted in two ways: a) estimating the <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter</b> along with factors with potential structural effects, and b) estimating the <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter</b> first and then conducting analysis of variance for the structural effect. Results Linear model ANOVA with Monte Carlo simulation and mixed models with correlated error terms with NDNQI examples showed no substantial differences on statistical tests for structural effects if the factors with structural effects were omitted during the estimation of the <b>transformation</b> <b>parameter.</b> Conclusions The Box-Cox power transformation can still be an effective tool for validating statistical inferences with large observational, cross-sectional, and hierarchical or repeated measure studies under the linear or the mixed model settings without prior knowledge of all the factors with potential structural effects. </p...|$|R
