40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} problem of rigorously quantifying {{the performance of a}} <b>fault</b> <b>diagnosis</b> scheme in terms of probabilistic performance metrics. Typically, when the perfor-mance of a <b>fault</b> <b>diagnosis</b> scheme is of utmost importance, physical redundancy is used to create a highly reliable system that is easy to analyze. However, in this dissertation, we provide a general framework that applies to more complex analytically redundant or model-based <b>fault</b> <b>diagnosis</b> schemes. For each <b>fault</b> <b>diagnosis</b> problem in this framework, our performance metrics can be computed accurately in polynomial-time. First, we cast the <b>fault</b> <b>diagnosis</b> problem as a sequence of hypothesis tests. At each time, the performance of a <b>fault</b> <b>diagnosis</b> scheme is quantified by the probability that the scheme has chosen the correct hypothesis. The resulting performance metrics are joint probabilities. Using Bayes rule, we decompose these performance metrics into two parts: marginal probabilities that quantify the reliability of the system and conditional probabilities that quantify the performance of the <b>fault</b> <b>diagnosis</b> scheme. These conditional probabilities are used to draw connections between the <b>fault</b> <b>diagnosis</b> and the fields of medical diagnostic testing, signal detection, and general statistical decision theory...|$|R
