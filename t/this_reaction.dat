5|$|Investigation on <b>this</b> <b>reaction</b> was continued; the {{research}} was aimed at looking for fission fragments of isotopes of element 105. A subsequent paper was published in February 1970. Two activities were found, with half-lives of 14 ms and 2.2±0.5 s. The former activity was assigned to 242mfAm; the latter one was described as having been caused by an isotope of element 105. The possibility that the latter activity could come from a transfer reaction and thus not be from element 105 {{was said to be}} diminished {{by the fact that the}} yield ratio for <b>this</b> <b>reaction</b> was lower than that of the 242mfAm-producing transfer reaction. The idea that this synthesis reaction was indeed a (22Ne,xn) reaction was supported by research on reactions of the 243Am target with 18O; reactions producing 256103 and 257103 showed very little spontaneous fission (SF) activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier 258103 and 259103 produced no SF activity at all, falling in line with theoretical data.|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{woman of}} 41 years old {{underwent}} surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism. She developed a long-lasting sharply demarcated erythematous skin reaction, appearing one hour after parathyroid surgery. <b>This</b> erythematous <b>reaction</b> felt like sunburn and {{was limited to}} the light exposed skin of the operation field, leading to the diagnosis of a phototoxic <b>reaction.</b> Since <b>this</b> phototoxic <b>reaction</b> occurred just after changing the operation lamp from a halogen type to a Light-Emitting Diode (LED) type, we suspected that the type of operation lamp could {{be a part of the}} cause of <b>this</b> phototoxic <b>reaction.</b> <b>This</b> is because our department has never before diagnosed phototoxic reactions (with a halogen type of operation lamp) during methylene blue (MB) assisted parathyroid surgery. Methods: To investigate the cause of <b>this</b> phototoxic <b>reaction,</b> we performed an analysis of the adverse effects of all administered peroperative drugs and an evaluation of altered operation conditions. Results: MB, used as a peroperative surgical marker of the parathyroid glands, was the most likely causal agent of <b>this</b> phototoxic <b>reaction.</b> Emission spectrum analysis of the operation light shows that the new LED operation lamp gives a high intensity of blue light. This may have resulted in activation of MB leading to a phototoxic reaction. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first described phototoxic reaction in adults due to MB used as peroperative marker. Although rare, this potential side effect should be considered when using high doses of MB in combination with high intensity of blue light...|$|R
