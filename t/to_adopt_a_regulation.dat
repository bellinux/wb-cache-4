The Act sets out certain obligations of a professional to its clients, including sexual behavior and access to information contained in the records that the professional constitutes. The law now obliged each professional order <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>regulation</b> on the professional liability insurance of its members who would henceforth have to take out an individual insurance policy, adhere to the contract of a collective plan concluded by the order, Subscribe to the insurance fund established by the order. The OPQ is now empowered by law to investigate orders that do not fulfill or could not fulfill the duties imposed on them by law. The OPQ is mandated to prepare and make available to the professional associations and the public documents and forms to assist in the exercise of remedies under the Act, including the request for an investigation and the private complaint to the Discipline Committee. Professional corporations become professional corporations.|$|E

H 577 P LMS 2015 Zhaoxiii, 124 pages :illustrations; 30 cmThis {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} socially responsible operations in agricultural {{and health care}} industries. In the first essay, we examine whether the government or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can improve farmers' welfare by offering agricultural advice and market information. Towards this end, we consider a situation where farmers decide whether to use market information to improve their production plans or adopt agricultural advice to improve their operations when they engage in Cournot competition under both uncertain market demand and uncertain process yield. We show that both farmers will use the market information to improve their profits in equilibrium. Hence, relative to the base case in which market information is not available, the provision of market information can improve the farmers' total welfare (i. e.,total profit for both farmers). Moreover, when the underlying process yield is highly uncertain or when the products are highly het-erogeneous, the provision of market information is welfare-maximizing {{in the sense that}} the maximum total welfare of farmers is attained when both farmers utilize market information in equilibrium. Furthermore,in equilibrium, whether a farmer adopts the agricultural advice depends on the size of the requisite upfront investment. More importantly, we show that agricultural advice is not always welfare improving unless the upfront investment is sufficiently low. This result implies that to improve farmers' welfare, governments should consider offering farmer subsidies. In the second essay, we study the performance measurements of health care systems. Many governments use waiting time per admission (i. e.,the waiting time that a patient spends per admission) as a measurement to evaluate the congestion level and the performance of the health care system. Adopting this criterion may force doctors to speed up their service and spend less time on each patient, resulting in a decline in service quality and an increase in readmission rate. To characterize both system congestion and service quality,we propose a new performance measurement,total waiting time, which is the total amount of time a patient spends in the sys-tem before being cured. We then consider the optimal design and control issues of the health care system based on this new measurement. We model the health care system as an M/M/ 1 queue with Bernoulli feedback, where the service rate is a de-cision variable of the health care provider (HCP) and the readmission rate (i. e.,the feedback) is increasing in the service rate. We study the decision problems for the three parties in the system: patients, the HCP and the social planner (government). We demonstrate that a naive adoption of the waiting time reduction target could even worsen the system performance,leading to a higher congestion level,lower accessibility for new patients and a busier HCP. We find that the social optimality cannot be achieved via the single pricing mechanism. Instead,the social planner needs <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>a</b> <b>regulation</b> mechanism with multi-dimensional control variables. Department of Logistics and Maritime StudiesPh.

40|$|Despite the fact, that in 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany {{had decided}} to base its {{economic}} system {{on the concept of}} Social Market Economy, the transport sector in the 1950 s and 1960 s was characterized by <b>a</b> strict <b>regulation,</b> prohibiting competition in most transport markets. One fundamental aim of this regulation was the protection of the state owned railway company (Deutsche Bundesbahn). In the paper, at first the transformation of Germany's transport policy from a system of anti-competitive <b>regulation</b> to <b>a</b> framework for competitive markets is shown. Nevertheless, this process has not been straightforward. Especially in the late 1960 s, policy makers intended <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>an</b> even stricter <b>regulation.</b> Moreover, the decisive impetus towards deregulation came from outside, namely the 1985 ruling of the European Court of Justice on the common transport market. In {{the second part of the}} paper, two current discussions in the field of transport policy are reviewed. Firstly, a strong support for governmental interventions aiming at a reasonable modal split can be observed. In contrast, within the Social Market Economy, the modal split should be the result of an open market process, not a target of transport policy. Nevertheless, in order to achieve an economically efficient modal split, a level playing field should be provided, leading to many controversies about the elements of a non-discriminatory framework for intermodal competition. Secondly, as mobility is a crucial prerequisite for participating in social, cultural and political life, transport policy makers intend to guarantee a certain degree of mobility for everybody. Therefore, many public transport companies are owned or subsidized by local or regional authorities, in order to enable affordable prices for transportation. It is shown in the paper that vouchers for the use of public transport services show a higher degree of compatibility with the concept of the Social Market Economy than other state interventions. Especially, vouchers do not distort the price mechanism, provide incentives for more customer-orientation and lead to a higher degree of transparency.

40|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission (2 ̆ 2 SEC 2 ̆ 2) {{recently}} <b>adopted</b> <b>a</b> novel {{exemption from}} the registration {{requirements of the}} Securities Act of 1933. This new exemption, <b>Regulation</b> CE, contains <b>a</b> single rule, Rule 1001, that exempts from registration 2 ̆ 2 [o]ffers and sales of securities that satisfy the conditions of paragraph (n) of Sec. 25102 of the California Corporations Code [...] 2 ̆ 2 California section 25102 (n), in turn, exempts offerings to 2 ̆ 2 qualified purchasers 2 ̆ 2 and includes a 2 ̆ 2 test-the- waters 2 ̆ 2 provision that allows issuers to solicit purchasers in writing, even if non-qualified investors receive the solicitation. Regulation CE {{is part of the}} SEC 2 ̆ 7 s continuing effort to ease the regulatory burdens on small businesses issuing securities. The intent of the regulation is to facilitate capital raising by small businesses by providing a coordinated federal-state exemption, without sacrificing investor protection. Regulation CE is the first coordinated federal-state exemption that defers to the state exemption. While states have previously adopted exemptions from state registration tied to compliance with federal exemptions, this is the first transaction exemption adopted by the SEC that defers to a state exemption. The basic idea underlying Regulation CE-allowing issuers to solicit qualified purchasers-is sensible, but the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s execution of that idea creates a regulatory quagmire. In essence, the SEC is giving California authorities the power to determine the scope of an exemption from federal securities law. Regulation CE 2 ̆ 7 s delegation of authority to California state officials probably exceeds the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s regulatory authority. In addition, the language of Regulation CE effectively allows California officials to amend the federal exemption without further proceedings at the federal level-a possible violation of the federal Administrative Procedure Act. Finally, applying Regulation CE to so-called 2 ̆ 2 covered securities 2 ̆ 2 violates the preemption provisions Congress recently added to section 18 of the Securities Act. Even if Regulation CE is valid, the interaction of federal law and California law presents difficult interpretive questions. For instance, as drafted, calculation of the 2 ̆ 2 aggregate offering price 2 ̆ 2 of <b>a</b> <b>Regulation</b> CE offering is troublesome. Additionally, the application of the integration doctrine to Regulation CE offerings is confusing. If the SEC had drafted the regulation more carefully, these problems could have been avoided. This article first introduces and outlines the <b>Regulation</b> CE exemption- <b>a</b> task that can only be fully accomplished by also reviewing the requirements of section 25102 (n) of the California Corporations Code. The accompanying appendix to this article focuses, in particular, on the definition of 2 ̆ 2 qualified purchaser 2 ̆ 2 and the wandering trail one must follow to give content to that term. The article then examines the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s authority <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>an</b> exemption like <b>Regulation</b> CE and whether Regulation CE is consistent with section 18 of the Securities Act. Finally, the article examines the difficult interpretive issues this new type of federalstate coordination raises-in particular, the determination of the 2 ̆ 2 aggregate offering price 2 ̆ 2 of <b>a</b> <b>Regulation</b> CE offering and the application of the integration doctrine to Regulation CE offerings...|$|R
