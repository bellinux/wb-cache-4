Famous examples include his game against Bukhuti Gurgenidze at the 1957 USSR championship, excerpted below, and his win against Yuri Averbakh at the same tournament the following year.|$|E

5|$|Most historians {{agree that}} Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, {{but what exactly}} he {{achieved}} {{is a matter of}} some confusion. As has been discussed, some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC. Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of subject ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it seems likely that, under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC.|$|E

Under the leadership of Francis I, who had succeeded Louis to the throne, the French and Venetians would, through victory at Marignano in 1515, regain the territory they had lost; the treaties of Noyon and Brussels, which ended the war the next year, would essentially return the map of Italy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> quo of 1508.|$|E

5|$|Under Spanish Crown rule, {{the town}} of Gibraltar fell into severe decline.

It was effectively reduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> of an unremarkable stronghold on a rocky promontory and Marbella replaced it as the principal Spanish port in the region.|$|E
