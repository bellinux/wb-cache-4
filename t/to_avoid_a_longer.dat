The Pyramid chord consists of every interval stacked, low to high, from 12 to 1 and while it contains all intervals, it does not contain all pitch classes and is thus not a tone row. Klein chose the name Mutterakkord in order <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> term such as all-interval twelve-tone row {{and because it is}} a chord which unites all other chords by containing them within itself.|$|E
50|$|In {{a series}} stack, the {{deflection}} {{is not exactly}} proportional {{to the number of}} springs. This is because of a bottoming out effect when the springs are compressed to flat as the contact surface area increases once the spring is deflected beyond 95%. This decreases the moment arm and the spring will offer a greater spring resistance. Hysteresis can be used to calculate predicted deflections in a series stack. The number of springs used in a series stack is not as much of an issue as in parallel stacks even if, generally, the stack height should not be greater than three times the outside diameter of the disc spring. If it is not possible <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> stack, then it should be divided into 2 or possibly 3 partial stacks with suitable washers. These washers should be guided as exactly as possible.|$|E

In 2012 the refurbished ticket office was closed and the entrance to the toilets from there blocked off. A new ticket office resembling a small Portakabin was built on the platform opposite the District line platform and the gate to the footbrige padlocked.

50|$|In 2016, {{both the}} Democratic and Republican {{conventions}} were held before the Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics instead of after, {{as was the}} case in 2008 and 2012. One reason the Republican Party scheduled their convention in July was <b>to</b> help <b>avoid</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer,</b> drawn-out primary battle similar to what happened in 2012, which left the party fractured heading into the general election and eventually led to Mitt Romney losing the election to Barack Obama. The Democratic Party then followed suit, scheduling their convention in Philadelphia the week after the Republicans' convention, to provide a quicker response. On May 3, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus declared Donald Trump the presumptive nominee after Texas senator Ted Cruz dropped out of the race. The next day, Ohio Governor John Kasich suspended his campaign, effectively making Trump the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Trump was the first presidential nominee of a major party since Wendell Willkie, the Republican candidate in 1940, who has held neither political office nor a high military rank prior to his nomination. He was also the first presidential nominee of a major party without political experience since General Dwight D. Eisenhower first captured the Republican presidential nomination in 1952. This was the first Republican National Convention to be held entirely in July since 1980. Twitter and CBS News live streamed the convention via Twitter.|$|R
40|$|System-on-Chips {{are getting}} more complex every day, making {{manufacturing}} test constantly more challenging. As chip size is increasing, a divide and conquer approach is tackled, through a core-based methodology, using Synopsys Design-for-Test (DfT) {{state of the art}} features. This document deals with flows implementing such architectures. A wrapping core flow is proposed, limiting ports impact, thanks to compression feature. A full automated flow is proposed, as well as one offering more test possibilities, implementing wrapper bypass paths for full custom tests. Then a top-down flow is presented to tackle an actual complex ST-Ericsson project, using most of Synopsys features, showing first how to use the tool and which workarounds are to be implemented to achieve the expected architecture. As a parallel study, clock management under test, {{which is one of the}} most challenging parts in DfT flows, was examined. Clocks are handled with On-Chip-Clocking (OCC) controller, setting dynamically clock behavior through clock chains. It was shown that all clock chains should be handled in a single scan chain through compression modules. As a consequence, and <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> clock chain than regular chains, an update of the current Synopsys OCC controller was proposed, improving test time in coming projects. System-on-Chip blir mer och mer komplexa, och det komplicerar chips tillverkningenstestar. På grund av chip storleks ökning, presenteras en ”divide-and-conquer” teknik med en ”core-based” metod och Synopsyss Design-for-Test (DfT) toppmoderna funktioner. Det här dokumentet utveklar flöder med sådana arkitekturer. Först föreslås ett wrapper IP flöden, som användar kompressions flöd för att begränsa påverkan om pads. Sedan en ”top-down” flöd presenteras för att hantera en verklig komplex ST-Ericssons projekt, med många Synopsyss funktioner. Verktygs begränsningar först visas, sedan sätter att komma runt dem presenteras för att få förvantade arkitekturen. En andra studie är klocka förvaltning under test kontrolleras med så kallade ”On-Chip-Clocking (OCC) controller”. Den här funktionen undersöks och studien bevisar att alla OCC kontroll bitarna bör hanteras i en enda clock-chain genom kompression moduler. Som en följd av det och för att undvika en längre clock-chain än vanliga scan chains, är här en OCC kontrollers uppdatering föreslås, minskar testtid i kommande projekt...|$|E

Two methods were used to obtain feedback from {{those involved in the}} delivery of the program {{as well as those who}} participated in programs. The first, semi-structured interviews, was undertaken with class room teachers who run the program in their schools, group facilitators running the program with more mature-age students at private facilities (n = 15 in total), and former participants in both school-based and private-based versions of the program (n = 19). The second method used an on-line survey for students (n = 79). Results from both methods were consistent with each other, indicating that strengths of the program were perceived as being its interactive components and the high level of engagement of the target audience. There was strong support from young and mature-age students for the program to remain compulsory. However, consistent with other findings on novice driver education, mature-age participants identified that the program was less relevant to them. It may be that to have greater relevance to mature-age learners, content could address and challenge perceptions about behaviours other than intentional high-risk behaviours (e. g. low level speeding, fatigue) as well as encourage planning/strategies <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> them. While <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> term, outcome focussed, evaluation of the pre-learner education program is needed, this study suggests that the program is well received by pre-licence drivers and that teachers and facilitators perceive it as both effective and beneficial...|$|R
40|$|Diamond films {{produced}} by the chemical vaporised deposition (CVD) technique, often called CVD diamond films, {{have been widely used}} in industry because of their extraordinary properties. However, the film surfaces are usually very rough and cannot be used directly in most cases. Many methods have been developed to polish such diamond films, among which the dynamic friction polishing (DFP) method {{has been found to be}} efficient. Generally speaking, the DFP combines the mechanisms of mechanical rubbing and the thermo-chemical reaction created by frictional heating for highly efficient polishing. This thesis investigates the feasibility of using the DFP technique to polish CVD diamond surfaces, both experimentally and numerically. Two types of specimens were studied; the research focus was on the finished surface quality and the material removal rates in relation to different polishing conditions. Both experimental and theoretical methods were used to explore the polishing mechanism. Experimental results proved that the DFP technique can be successfully used to polish both CVD diamond wafers and CVD diamond thin films. It was found that to minimise the cracking of specimens, a stepwise polishing process should be introduced. It was also found that specimen cracking is sensitive to the polishing pressure applied, and that the polishing window for CVD thin films is smaller. Polishing time is <b>a</b> critical factor <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> cracking, because <b>a</b> <b>longer</b> polishing time means a higher thermal stress. With the proper parameters obtained in this study, very smooth, high quality surfaces of CVD wafers and thin films could be obtained in minutes. On the other hand, simulation results proved that both the CVD diamond wafer and thin film experience similar temperature distributions, and that thermal expansion has an obvious effect on stress distribution. For the CVD diamond thin film, stress discontinuity is obvious across the interface of thin film, which could result in interface debonding. The CVD diamond wafer experiences a clear bulk bending and stressing. The maximum tensile stress can destroy a specimen easily if it is high enough. It was found that controlling the heat generation in polishing is instructionally useful for reducing stress...|$|R
