Although explicit analytic expressions can be computed for relatively small <b>truncation</b> <b>lengths,</b> the explicit expressions become prohibitively complex to compute as the <b>truncation</b> <b>lengths</b> and the weights increase. Fortunately, a very accurate asymptotic expansion can be derived using the Multidimensional Saddle-Point method (MSP method). This approximation is substantially easier to evaluate and is used to obtain an expression of the asymptotic spectral function, and to prove continuity and concavity in its domain (convex and closed). Finally, this approach is able to guarantee that the sequence of exponential growth rates converges uniformly to the asymptotic limit, and to estimate the speed of this convergence...|$|R

30|$|Recall {{that the}} ILC system is repetitive. Then, the one-iteration ILC-driven system output can be {{regarded}} as a segment of a periodic sequence. It is thus feasible {{to make use of the}} discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to compute the output spectrum. For the regard, Owens’ group has firstly introduced the DFT for error spectrum analysis [34], which has regarded the finite-length discrete-time output as a truncation of an infinite-length system output, where, by defaulting the time-domain convolution theorem for a finite-length ILC system, the frequency-wise input–output relation is described as an algebraic equation. For the circumstance, the Owens’ DFT technique is still z-transform-based. The so-called frequency-wise algebraic equation looks so brief that it has inspired a number of frequency-relevant ILC convergence and robustness investigations [35 – 41]. But, by careful comparison, one acquired that the complexity and premise of the ILC convergence as well as the robustness in discrete-time domain [17] are quite different from that made by Owens’ DFT technique [34] in frequency domain, so that it is hard to match their equivalence. This is not mathematically logic and very possibly makes confusion and puzzlement for practical applications. In authors’ opinion, the confusion is incurred by the approximate computation of z-transform-based Owens’ DFT technique. As a matter of fact, by reviewing the concept of z-transform, we see that it fits an infinite-length sequence whose spectrum at each frequency is relevant to the sequence terms at all sampling times [32]. This means that the spectrum computed by the z-transform-based Owens’ DFT technique is just an approximation because the finite-length truncation of an infinite-length system has lost last part of information. The approximation precision is relevant to the <b>truncation</b> <b>length</b> and stability of the system. Generally speaking, for a given system, the longer the <b>truncation</b> <b>length,</b> the better the precision. However, for a fixed <b>truncation</b> <b>length</b> and a given input, the precision of an unstable system is worse than that of a stable system because the energy loss of the last part information of an unstable system is larger.|$|E
40|$|Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (truncated BPTT) is a {{widespread}} method for learning recurrent computational graphs. Truncated BPTT keeps the computational benefits of Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) while relieving {{the need for a}} complete backtrack through the whole data sequence at every step. However, truncation favors short-term dependencies: the gradient estimate of truncated BPTT is biased, so that it does not benefit from the convergence guarantees from stochastic gradient theory. We introduce Anticipated Reweighted Truncated Backpropagation (ARTBP), an algorithm that keeps the computational benefits of truncated BPTT, while providing unbiasedness. ARTBP works by using variable <b>truncation</b> <b>lengths</b> together with carefully chosen compensation factors in the backpropagation equation. We check the viability of ARTBP on two tasks.

In this paper, we consider sliding-window MLM receivers, where for any integer m, the MLM detector is truncated to a length- m signaling neighborhood. For any number n of chosen times instants, we derive exact expressions for both i) the joint distribution of the MLM symbol reliabilities, and ii) the joint probability of the erroneous MLM symbol detections.

40|$|Privacy-minded Internet service {{operators}} anonymize IPv 6 addresses by truncating {{them to a}} fixed length, perhaps due to long-standing use of {{this technique}} with IPv 4 and a belief that it's "good enough. " We claim that simple anonymization by truncation is suspect since it does not entail privacy guarantees nor does it take into account some common address assignment practices observed today. To investigate, with standard activity logs as input, we develop a counting method to determine a lower bound {{on the number of}} active IPv 6 addresses that are simultaneously assigned, such as those of clients that access World-Wide Web services. In many instances, we find that these empirical measurements offer no evidence that truncating IPv 6 addresses to a fixed number of bits, e. g., 48 in common practice, protects individuals' privacy. To remedy this problem, we propose kIP anonymization, an aggregation method that ensures a certain level of address privacy.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} error bounds, algorithms, {{and techniques}} {{for evaluating the}} performance of convolutional codes on the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Convolutional encoders are analyzed using simple binary operations {{in order to determine}} the longest possible "zero-run" output and if "catastrophic error propagation" may occur. Methods and algorithms are presented for computing the weight enumerator and other generating functions, associated with convolutional codes, which are used to upper-bound maximum-likelihood (i. e., Viterbi) decoder error rates on memoryless channels. In particular, the complete path enumerator T(D, L, I) is obtained for the memory 6, rate 1 / 2, NASA standard code. A new, direct technique yields the corresponding bit-error generating function. These procedures may be used to count paths between nodes in a finite directed graph or to calculate transfer functions in circuits and networks modelled by signal flow graphs. A modified Viterbi decoding algorithm is used to obtain numbers for error bound computations. New bounds and approximations for maximum-likelihood convolutional decoder first-event, bit, and symbol error rates are derived, the latter one for concatenated coding system analysis. Berlekamp's tangential union bound for maximum-likelihood, block decoder word error probability on the AWGN channel is adapted for convolutional codes. Approximations to bit and symbol error rates are obtained that remain within 0. 2 dB of simulation results at low signal-to-noise ratios, where many convolutional codes operate but the standard bounds are useless. An upper bound on the loss caused by truncating survivors in a Viterbi decoder leads to estimates of minimum practical <b>truncation</b> <b>lengths.</b> Lastly, the power loss due to quantizing received (demodulated) symbols from the AWGN channel is studied.

For other conditions of indentation, different contact area functions, which take into account the effective <b>truncation</b> <b>length</b> or the radius of the rounded indenter tip, as well as some fitting parameters, have been proposed.

Sinusoidal roll-off spectrum with different roll-off factor and optimum <b>truncation</b> <b>lengths</b> of the sample impulse response are designed for the proposed scheme to approximate to the theoretical ideal. It has used an EF bandpass filter to band limit the modulated signal, which forms part of the satellite channel modelling. The high power amplifier (HPA) at the earth station has been used in the satellite channel modelling due to its effect in introducing nonlinear AMAM and AM-PM conversion effects and distortion on the transmitted signal from the earth station. The satellite transponder is assumed to be operating in a linear mode. Different phase-shift keying signals such as differentially encoded quaternary phase-shift keying (DEQPSK), offset quaternary phase-shift keying (OQPSK) and convolutionally encoded 8 PSK (CE 8 PSK) signals are analysed and discussed in the thesis, when the high power amplifier (HPA) at the earth station is operating in a nonlinear mode. Convolutional encoding is discussed when applied to the system used in the modem, and a Viterbi -algorithm decoder at the receiver has been used, for CE 8 PSK signals for a nonlinear satellite channel. A method of feed-forward synchronisation scheme is designed for carrier recovery in CE 8 PSK receiver. The thesis describes a method of baseband linearizing the baseband signal in order to reduce the nonlinear effects caused by the HPA at the earth station. The scheme which compensates for the nonlinear effects of the HPA by predistorting the baseband signal prior to modulation as opposed to correcting the distortion after modulation, thus reducing the effects of nonlinear distortion introduced by the HPA. The results of the improvement are presented. The advanced technology of digital signal processors (DSPs) has been used in the implementation of the demodulation and digital filtering parts of the modem replacing large parts of conventional circuits. The Viterbi-algorithm decoder for CE 8 PSK signals has been implemented using a digital signal processor chip, giving excellent performance and is a cost effective and easy way for future developments and any modifications, The results showed that, by using the various studied techniques, as well as the implementation of digital signal processor chip in parts of the modem, a potentially more cost effective modem can be obtained...|$|R
