50|$|The early Morris Mini Traveller and Austin Mini Countryman {{cars had}} an {{internal}} fuel tank {{located on the}} left hand side of the rear load area. This is identifiable by the fuel <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> being on the left hand {{side of the car}} just below the rear window.In October 1961 the fuel tank was relocated to the underneath of the car and the <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> was moved to low down on the right hand side of the car - the same configuration that was already in use on the Mini Van.|$|R

40|$|This degree {{project was}} {{conducted}} in collaboration with Husqvarna AB, the headquarters of which are located in Jönköping. The aim was to further develop the <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> found on {{more or less the}} whole of the company’s range of chain saws, {{in order to make it}} more user friendly. The present <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> is not easy to open and close, especially when wearing gloves, and under difficult conditions, which creates problems and prolongs filling time. On the basis of market surveys, different prototypes and tests, we have created an ergonomically improved cap of a new shape, which can be moved in the axial direction, thus making filling easier...|$|R

40|$|A {{facility}} and expertise {{has been developed}} at NAL to conduct automated internal pressure cycling tests. The hardware and instrumentation includes capturing {{of pressure on the}} data logger along with strain gage data. Digital data can be recorded continuously during entire pressure cycle, thus enabling to provide comparative view of reduction in stiffness, if any,in terms of graphs. The Maximum Pressure up To Which the Central Shells Could Be Tested Was 188. 5 psi. A Maximum Strain Of 5166 Micro Strains, At A Pressure Of 188. 5 psi, Was Found Near The GFRP Bulkhead In The Circumferential Direction. The Integrity Of The Bulkhead Joint Appears Satisfactory. The Nose-Cone, Tested For Internal Pressure Cycling Between 3 And L Lpsi Did Not Show Any Leaks Anywhere On The Surface Or From The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap.</b> However, After 1104 Pressure Cycles,The End Flange Failed With A Loud Pop. On Inspection, It Was Found That The Failure Is Due To Improper Adhesion Between The GFRP Base Material And The Aluminum Ring Holding The End-Flange. Subsequently, This Ring Was Joined To The GFRP Shell By Bolts And The Pressure Cycling Was Continued For A Further 5000 Cycles,As Required, Without Any Failure/Leaks Anywhere On The Nose Cone. The Nose Cone Was Then Subjected To A Steadily Increasing Pressure To Verify The Residual Strength. At About 60 psi, Leaks Were Observed Around The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap</b> And The Pressure Was Continued Up To 85 psi. At This Pressure, The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap</b> Seal Gave-Up And A Profuse Leak Sprouted Around The Cap This Was Verified Again By Replacing The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap</b> With A New One That Also Failed Completely At About 85 psi Pressure. Presently,It May Be Concluded That The Lca s Gfrp Drop Tank Internal Bulkheads Of Central Shell Can Withstand A Pressure Of 185 psi And The Weak Link,In The DT Assembly, Is The <b>Filler</b> <b>Cap</b> Seal That Can Stand A Pressure Of Only 60 psi. ...|$|R

50|$|Fueling and Charging: Via {{the tank}} <b>filler</b> <b>cap,</b> 1,133 lbs (140 gallons) of petrol (B-Stoff) were added (later longer-range models held more). The twin spherical iron air bottles {{were charged with}} 900 psi air to power the {{automatic}} pilot (Steuergerät). Air at 90 psi powered the pneumatic servo-motors for the elevators and rudder.|$|R
50|$|A {{collision}} {{had occurred}} between two vehicles {{when one of}} them skidded on diesel that had spilled from a truck belonging to the second defendant. The truck had broken down alongside the road. It appeared that, after the truck had broken down, the driver, supposing that there was a problem with the vehicle's fuel supply, opened a stopcock, which permitted diesel fuel to flow into the main fuel tank from another tank. He also opened the <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> of the main fuel tank, to inspect its interior. Thereafter he not only omitted to close the stopcock, but also omitted properly to replace the <b>filler</b> <b>cap.</b> As a result, diesel escaped from the main fuel tank onto the road surface, thus causing the accident. One person suffered injuries and another {{died as a result of}} the accident.|$|R

50|$|In a {{wet sump}} system, the main {{dipstick}} reaches to {{near the bottom}} of the crankcase. The oil <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> covers a hole in the crankcase where oil can be added; it is typically located on the top of the rocker cover (or if two, the one closer to the front of the vehicle).|$|R
50|$|On June 30, 1985, Douglas C-47B N168Z of Northern Peninsula Fisheries was {{substantially}} damaged at King Salmon {{when both}} engines failed on approach while the aircraft {{was on an}} executive flight from Homer Airport, Alaska. The cause of the accident was fuel exhaustion. A fuel <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> was discovered to be missing after the accident.|$|R
5000|$|Early systems {{locked and}} {{unlocked}} only the car doors. Many cars today also feature systems which can unlock {{such things as the}} luggage compartment or fuel <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> door. It is also common on modern cars for the locks to activate automatically when the car is put into gear or reaches a certain speed.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Mitsubishi i MiEV. Under {{the rear}} load platform. The inverter, {{rectifier}} and DC-DC voltage reduction device (For auxiliary battery). The motor, differential and reduction gear assembly are beneath. On the left, the red <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> is for motor coolant (water antifreeze mix). On the right, the electric vacuum pump for the braking system.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to prevent this from happening {{with the use of}} chemical additives in the cooling fluid that form a protective layer on the cylinder wall. This layer will be exposed to the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself. Additionally a regulated overpressure in the cooling system (regulated and maintained by the coolant <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> spring pressure) prevents the forming of cavitation.|$|R
5000|$|Combrinck J held, on the facts, {{that there}} was a {{sufficiently}} close link between the injuries and death, on the one hand, and the driving of the second defendant's truck, on the other, to justify the conclusion that the injuries and death had [...] "arisen out of" [...] the driving of the truck, as contemplated in section 8(1). The very reason why the driver had removed the <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> of the main fuel tank was because he had experienced trouble while driving the truck. His act in opening the stopcock and removing and replacing the <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> was intended to rectify the problem, and to allow him to continue driving the vehicle. The direct result of that ancillary act was the spilling of the diesel, which caused the accident and the resultant damage. In the circumstances, common sense dictated that the death and injuries had arisen from the driving of G the second defendant's truck.|$|R
50|$|Publicity {{shots from}} the early 1950s tend to avoid showing {{the rear of the}} car from the right side. That changes with 203s {{displayed}} at the 1953 Motor Show, after which the hitherto protruding fuel <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> was sunk a couple of centimeters lower into the rear wing, and gained the protection of an opening flap set flush with the line of the bodywork.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "T" [...] is {{a higher}} {{performance}} version of the Bentley Azure. Styling changes include 8.5J x 20-inch five-spoke, two-piece alloy wheels with 255/40 ZR20 Pirelli P Zero tyres, 'Le Mans' lower front wing air vents, dark-tinted upper and lower grilles, 'jewel' fuel <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> (made from billet aluminium), door mirror mountings finished in body colour. The exterior styling was inspired from Bentley Mark VI.|$|R
5000|$|Hudson dealers {{also sold}} Rambler and Metropolitan models under the Hudson brand. When sold by Hudson dealers, both cars were {{identified}} as Hudson vehicles via hood/grille emblems and horn buttons. Hudson Ramblers also received [...] "H" [...] symbols on fuel <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> (and, in 1956, also on hubcaps). For 1957, Rambler and Metropolitan became makes in their own rights, and no longer {{were identified as}} Hudson or Nash.|$|R
25|$|The D type was {{modified}} {{for use on}} unarmed, long-range photo-reconnaissance versions of the Spitfire, such as the P.R. Mk Id (P.R. versions {{described in more detail}} below), with weapon bays left empty, and the relatively heavy-skinned leading edge wing structure ahead of the main spar converted to integral auxiliary fuel tanks capable of carrying 66½ Imperial gallons (300 l) in addition to that stored in the fuselage tanks ahead of the cockpit. The <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> were well outboard, between ribs 19 and 20 on the leading edge, because the wing tips were higher {{than the rest of the}} wing due to dihedral, and thus the only place a fuel <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> could be located. An expansion and overflow vent was fitted to protect the tanks from bursting as the fuel vaporized and expanded from the hot sun beating directly on the thin metal wing skin (which doubled as the walls of the tank). This vent was fitted further outboard, between ribs 20 and 21, in the highest space in the tank, where vapor would naturally collect.|$|R
