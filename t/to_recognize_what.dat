Foster carers are taught <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>what</b> such children actually need rather than what they may appear to signal that they need. Such children often exhibit provocative and oppositional behaviors which may normally trigger feelings of rejection in caregivers. Withdrawn children may be overlooked and seemingly independent, indiscriminate children may be considered to be managing much better than they are. Foster carers are regularly contacted and visited to assess their needs and progress.|$|E
25|$|Language {{development}} and processing begins before birth. Evidence {{has shown that}} there is language development occurring antepartum. DeCasper and Spence performed a study in 1986 by having mothers read aloud {{during the last few}} weeks of pregnancy. When the infants were born, they were then tested. They were read aloud a story while sucking on a pacifier; the story was either the story read by the mother when the infant was in utero or a new story. The pacifier used was able to determine the rate of sucking that the infant was performing. When the story that the mother had read before was heard, the sucking of the pacifier was modified. This did not occur during the story that the infant had not heard before. The results for this experiment had shown that the infants were able <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>what</b> they had heard in utero, providing insight that language development had been occurring in the last six weeks of pregnancy.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{pictorial}} {{nature of the}} oracle bone script, it was a fully functional and mature writing system {{by the time of}} the Shang dynasty, i.e., able to record the Old Chinese language in its entirety and not just isolated kinds of meaning. This level of maturity clearly implies an earlier period of development of at least several hundred years. From their presumed origins as pictographs and signs, by the Shang dynasty, most graphs were already conventionalized in such a simplified fashion that the meanings of many of the pictographs are not immediately apparent. Compare, for instance, the third and fourth graphs in the row below. Without careful research to compare these to later forms, one would probably not know that these represented 豕 shĭ [...] "swine" [...] and 犬 quǎn [...] "dog", respectively. As Boltz (1994 & 2003 p.31–33) notes, most of the oracle bone graphs are not depicted realistically enough for those who do not already know the script <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>what</b> they stand for; although pictographic in origin they are no longer pictographs in function. Boltz instead calls them zodiographs (p.33), reminding us that functionally they represent words, and only through the words do they represent concepts, while for similar reasons Qiu labels them semantographs.|$|E
2500|$|To {{maintain}} a philosophical balance, {{the argument for}} [...] "raw feels" [...] needs to be set {{side by side with}} the claim above. Viewing sensations as [...] "raw feels" [...] implies that initially they have not yet—to carry on the metaphor—been [...] "cooked", that is, unified into [...] "things" [...] and [...] "persons", which is something the mind does after the sensation has responded to the blank input, that response driven by motivation, that is, initially by pain and pleasure, and subsequently, when memories have been implanted, by desire and fear. Such a [...] "raw-feel" [...] state has been more formally identified as [...] "non-epistemic". In support of this view, the theorists cite a range of empirical facts. The following can be taken as representative. There are brain-damaged persons, known as [...] "agnosics" [...] (literally [...] "not-knowing") who still have vivid visual sensations but are quite unable to identify any entity before them, including parts of their own body. There is also the similar predicament of persons, formerly blind, who are given sight for the first time—and consider what it is a newborn baby must experience. A German psychologist of the 19th century, Hermann von Helmholtz, proposed a simple experiment to demonstrate the non-epistemic nature of qualia: his instructions were to stand in front of a familiar landscape, turn your back on it, bend down and look at the landscape between your legs—you will find it difficult in the upside-down view <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>what</b> you found familiar before.|$|E

60|$|Eurylochus and his {{followers}} now passed under a lofty portal, and looked through the open doorway into {{the interior of the}} palace. The first thing that they saw was a spacious hall, and a fountain in the middle of it, gushing up towards the ceiling out of a marble basin, and falling back into it with a continual plash. The water of this fountain, as it spouted upward, was constantly taking new shapes, not very distinctly, but plainly enough for a nimble fancy <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>what</b> they were. Now it was the shape of a man in a long robe, the fleecy whiteness of which was made out of the fountain's spray; now it was a lion, or a tiger, or a wolf, or an ass, or, as often as anything else, a hog, wallowing in the marble basin as if it were his sty. It was either magic or some very curious machinery that caused the gushing waterspout to assume all these forms. But, before the strangers had time to look closely at this wonderful sight, their attention was drawn off by a very sweet and agreeable sound. A woman's voice was singing melodiously in another room of the palace, and with her voice was mingled the noise of a loom, at which she was probably seated, weaving a rich texture of cloth, and intertwining the high and low sweetness of her voice into a rich tissue of harmony.|$|E

40|$|Motivation is {{the inner}} power or energy that pushes toward acting, {{performing}} actions and achieving. Motivation {{has much to}} do with desire and ambition, and if they are absent, motivation is absent too. Often, a workers has the desire and ambition to get something done or achieve a certain goal, but lacks the push, the initiative and the willingness to take action. This is due to lack of motivation and inner drive. Motivation strengthens the ambition, increases initiative and gives direction, courage, energy and the persistence to follow one's goals. A motivated person takes action and does whatever it needs to achieve his/her goals. Internal motivation is the driving force that comes from inside, and causes workers to do a good job because they feel good about ourselves when they accomplish something. When workers are motivated, they operate according to their own values. That is way the managers should know how <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>what's</b> driving workers along, and to build a sense of pride in their work. Internal motivation becomes strong when workers have a vision, a clear mental image of what they want to achieve, and also a strong desire to materialize it. In this situation motivation awakens and pushes them forward, toward taking action and making the vision a reality. Motivation can be applied to every action and goal. ...|$|R

To me, if possible, he would come in the evening; a whole cornucopia of talk and speculation was to be discharged. If the evening would not do, and my affairs otherwise permitted, I had to mount into cabs with him; fly far and wide, shuttling athwart the big Babel, wherever his calls and pauses had to be. This was his way to husband time! Our talk, in such straitened circumstances, was loud or low as the circumambient groaning rage of wheels and sound prescribed,--very loud it had to be in such thoroughfares as London Bridge and Cheapside; but except while he was absent, off for minutes into some banker's office, lawyer's, stationer's, haberdasher's or what office there might be, it never paused. In this way extensive strange dialogues were carried on: to me also very strange,--private friendly colloquies, on all manner of rich subjects, held thus amid the chaotic roar of things. Sterling was full of speculations, observations and bright sallies; vividly awake to what was passing in the world; glanced pertinently with victorious clearness, without spleen, though often enough with a dash of mockery, into its Puseyisms, Liberalisms, literary Lionisms, or what else the mad hour might be producing,--always prompt <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>what</b> grain of sanity might be in the same.
