5|$|Only certain traits may be {{required}} to deceive predators; for example, <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sympatry/allopatry border (where the two are in the same area, and where they are not) of the mimic Lampropeltis elapsoides and the model Micrurus fulvius showed that color proportions in these snakes were important in deceiving predators, but that the order of the colored rings was not.|$|E
5|$|TPP is {{distinguished}} from {{other forms of}} periodic paralysis (especially hypokalemic periodic paralysis) with thyroid function <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> blood. These are normal in the other forms, and in thyrotoxicosis the levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are elevated, with resultant suppression of TSH production by the pituitary gland. Various other investigations are usually performed to separate the different causes of hyperthyroidism.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Robert Morris MBE (19 January 1922 – 22 August 2015) was an Australian cricketer {{who played}} 46 Test matches between 1946 and 1955. An opener, Morris is {{regarded}} as one of Australia's greatest left-handed batsmen. He {{is best known for his}} key role in Don Bradman's Invincibles side, which made an undefeated tour of England in 1948. He was the leading scorer in the <b>Tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tour, with three centuries. His efforts in the Fourth Test at Headingley helped Australia to reach a world record victory target of 404 on the final day. Morris was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century in 2000 and was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in track}} laying and depot {{construction}} affected vehicle testing.

5|$|During the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{executed}} {{a number of}} nuclear <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Amchitka {{in the face of}} vehement opposition from environmental and local indigenous groups. The first test, conducted in 1965, caused significant damage to the surrounding area, although the details of this damage were not released to the public until 1969. In 1969, the AEC executed a 'calibration shot' to determine whether Amchitka would be suitable for future tests. In 1970, the AEC announced plans to detonate a bomb named 'Cannikin', set to release a blast 385 times that released by the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945. After a United States Supreme Court challenge to the testing failed by one vote, the testing proceeded as scheduled in November 1971.|$|E
5|$|In August 2001, an {{expedition}} {{headed by the}} marine archaeologist and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found {{the remains of a}} ship embedded in the Rochelois reef. Only a few pieces of timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged, the remainder of the wreckage being lost within the coral. Initial <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of Mary Celestes 1872 refit, and it seemed the remains of the Mary Celeste had been found. However, dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that would still have been growing in 1894, about ten years after the Mary Celestes demise.|$|E

Swinging the ball both ways, Pathan took 5/45 and 6/51 {{including}} several LBW decisions in the First Test in Dhaka to claim his first ten-wicket haul and his first Test man of the match award as India claimed a commanding innings victory. He followed this with a match haul of 7/118 in the following match in Chittagong to take 18 wickets at 11.88 to be named as man of the series. India swept the series, winning both matches by an innings. Although the Indian batsmen scored heavily, Pathan managed only five and four. He played in {{only one of the}} three ODIs against the hosts as India rotated their players, taking 1/45 and scoring 21 not out in an 11-run win.|$|E

5|$|Tests {{scheduled}} for 11 and 14 November were to traverse {{each of the}} two tracks, in both directions of travel and at a test speed 10% above the speed limit when the line is in commercial service. On the afternoon of 14 November, the test train was scheduled to depart Meuse TGV Station at 14:18 and arrive at Strasbourg Station at 15:17. At 14:26, authorization was given to begin the test and the test train left Meuse TGV Station two minutes later. During this test, the test train traveled eastbound on Track2, the southern track on the east-west oriented LGV Est, in the direction opposite normal operation (Strasbourg towards Paris). The Meuse-Strasbourg run was the last series of <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line during the fourth phase of tests.|$|E
5|$|The 107-seater was {{launched}} on 26 April 1999 with the options and orders count at 109 aircraft. After {{three years of}} design, the maiden flight took place at Hamburg on 15 January 2002. <b>Tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lead engine, the Pratt & Whitney PW6000, revealed worse-than-expected fuel consumption. Consequently, Pratt & Whitney abandoned the five-stage high pressure compressor (HPC) for the MTU-designed six-stage HPC. The 129 order book for the A318 shrunk to 80 largely because of switches to other A320 family members. After 17 months of flight certification, during which 850 hours and 350 flights were accumulated, JAA certification was obtained for the CFM56-powered variant on 23 May 2003. On 22 July 2003, first delivery for launch customer Frontier Airlines occurred, entering service {{before the end of}} the month.|$|E

5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. <b>Tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> engine fuel system showed that when the engine boost pump was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, the vortex dissipated and any water would soon find its way into the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off.|$|E
5|$|The FIA {{introduced}} {{more stringent}} <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cars at the Malaysian race to ensure floor mounting systems used by Ferrari and BMW Sauber {{were not in}} breach of the regulations. After the first race {{of the season in}} Australia, the McLaren team had requested clarification of the rules regarding systems that allowed the front of the car's undertray to move upwards under aerodynamic loading at high speed. Autosport magazine reported that this movement would potentially increase straight line speed. Massa and Räikkönen said the performance of the Ferrari F2007 car would not be compromised in any way by the required modifications.|$|E
5|$|An {{event on}} July 6, 1944 derailed Robinson's {{military}} career. While awaiting results of hospital <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ankle he had injured in junior college, Robinson boarded an Army bus {{with a fellow}} officer's wife; although the Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered Robinson {{to move to the}} back of the bus. Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching the end of the line, summoned the military police, who took Robinson into custody. When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed. After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action, Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson did not drink.|$|E

5|$|By this stage, Yorkshire {{regarded}} Yardley as {{the heir}} to Brian Sellers as captain, and the England Test selectors also began to prepare him to assume the England captaincy. At {{the end of the}} 1938 season, Yardley was chosen to tour South Africa with MCC as vice-captain to Wally Hammond. He made a good start to the tour, scoring centuries in his first two innings, both surpassing his previous highest score. Wisden noted that he made a good impression on spectators in these early matches. In his fourth match, he captained the MCC in Hammond's absence for the first time. When Len Hutton was injured in a tour match and missed the first Test, Yardey made his debut but scored just seven runs in a total of 422 and did not bat in the second innings. Hutton returned for the second match, and the successes of other batsmen meant that Yardley was not required in the other <b>Tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tour. However, he scored a third century when he captained the MCC against Border.|$|E
5|$|Harvey's triple figure average {{from his}} first two Test seasons could not be {{maintained}} when Australia hosted the 1950–51 Ashes series. Following his success in South Africa, Harvey played regularly at either the No. 3 or No. 4 from that point onwards. He managed 362 runs at 40.22 with three half centuries as Australia took the series 4–1. Harvey had trouble with Alec Bedser's in-swingers {{in the early part}} of the series and Bedser was the only Englishman to dismiss Harvey in the first three <b>Tests.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first day of the series, Harvey top-scored with 74 out of Australia's 228. It turned out to be crucial as rain created a sticky wicket; England made 7/68 and Australia 7/32, both declared. Australia went on to win by 70 runs. The Second Test in Melbourne was also low scoring; Harvey made 42 and 31 as Australia won after neither team passed 200. He performed steadily through the series, with 39, 43 and 68 in the next two Tests, which were both won. He then made one and 52 in the Fifth Test defeat; it was the first in his 14 Tests and Australia's first since World War II and came on his home ground in Melbourne. Outside the Tests, Harvey scored 141 in a win over South Australia and then added 146 in the second innings of a match against New South Wales to stave off defeat. He ended the season with 1099 runs at 45.79.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, McNicoll was {{appointed}} {{chairman of the}} planning committee for the British nuclear <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Montebello Islands, {{off the coast of}} Western Australia. Later that year, he was made commanding officer of the heavy cruiser , a post he held for the next two years. As commander of Australia, McNicoll also served as Chief Staff Officer to the Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. HMAS Australia was near the end of its naval service and had been relegated to training duties from 1950. As such, the cruiser was primarily consigned to Australian waters, though a brief trip to New Zealand did occur in October 1953. McNicoll {{was appointed}} a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year Honours List for his involvement in the British atomic program; he was presented with the decoration three months later by Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony at Government House, Melbourne.|$|E
