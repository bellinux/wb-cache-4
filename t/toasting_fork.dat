60|$|Again {{and again}} as we thus fought hand to hand, we Americans {{retreating}} backwards step by step, striving to keep the red-coated enemy from spitting us like larks on a <b>toasting</b> <b>fork,</b> I saw the muskets of our people shattered, the butt breaking from the barrel {{with the force of}} a blow upon the head of an enemy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, young master," [...] {{answered}} Martin, [...] "but {{remember that}} I killed you long ago, {{so that you}} are only a ghost and of no account. Although I have tried to learn its use to please you, I don't mean to fight with a <b>toasting</b> <b>fork.</b> This is my weapon," [...] and, seizing the great sword which stood in the corner, he made it hiss through the air.|$|E
50|$|Bread {{can also}} be toasted by holding it near but not {{directly}} over an open flame, such as a campfire or fireplace; special toasting utensils (e.g. <b>toasting</b> <b>forks)</b> are made for this purpose. Before the invention of modern cooking appliances such as toasters and grills, {{this was the only}} available method of producing toast.|$|R

6000|$|It {{is claimed}} for this {{invention}} {{that a little}} child can make as much mess with it as can a grown-up person, and so all {{the children of the}} family are represented in the picture as hard at work, enameling whatever few articles of furniture and household use the grasping selfishness of their elders has spared to them. One is painting the <b>toasting</b> <b>fork</b> in a [...] "skim-milk blue," [...] while another is giving aesthetical value to the Dutch oven by means of a new shade of art green. The bootjack is being renovated in [...] "old gold," [...] and the baby is sitting on the floor, smothering its own cradle with [...] "flush-upon-a-maiden's cheek peach color." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{sister and}} I {{were in the}} habit of having the tea-kettle in our little sitting room; and we toasted the bread ourselves, which reminds me of a little {{circumstance}} not unworthy to be set down among these minuti√¶. Happening both of us to be engaged a few minutes one morning when we had a young prig of a Scotch lawyer to breakfast with us, my dear Sister, with her usual simplicity, put the <b>toasting</b> <b>fork</b> with a slice of bread into the hands of this Edinburgh genius. Our little book-case stood {{on one side of the}} fire. To prevent loss of time, he took down a book, and fell to reading, to the neglect of the toast, which was burnt to a cinder. Many a time have we laughed at this circumstance, and other cottage simplicities of that day. By the bye, I have a spite at one of this series of Sonnets (I will leave the reader to discover which) as having been the means of nearly putting off for ever our acquaintance with dear Miss Fenwick, who has always stigmatized one line of it as vulgar, and worthy only of having been composed by a country squire.--I.

5000|$|In {{his writing}} for this work, and elsewhere, Scholes never {{believed}} in holding back his personal views {{in favour of}} a neutral point of view. He is credited with the description of harpsichord music as sounding like [...] "a <b>toasting</b> <b>fork</b> on a birdcage"; when describing Handel and Bach, he said that [...] "Handel was the more elegant composer, but Bach was the more thorough".|$|E
