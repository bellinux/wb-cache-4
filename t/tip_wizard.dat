40|$|The term “agent”, (and hence “agent based computing”, “agent based system”, “multi-agent system”), {{is being}} {{increasingly}} used within information technology {{to describe a}} broad range of computational entities. These entities range from relatively simple systems, (such as Microsoft’s <b>TIP</b> <b>WIZARD,</b> which provides advice to users working in EXCEL 5, or desktop agents which prioritise and filter electronic mail (Maes, 1994)), right up to very large, interoperable expert systems or databases which contain thousands of lines of code (e. g., ARCHON (Jennings et al., 1995) and Carnot (Huhns et al., 1992)). Broadly speaking, we can identify three different classes of agent. At the simplest level, there are “gopher ” agents, which can execute straightforward tasks based on pre-specified rules and assumptions (e. g., remind me that I have a lecture every Monday this term at 2 : 00). The next level of sophistication involves “service performing ” agents, which execute a well-defined high-level task at the request of a user (e. g., arrange a meeting or find an appropriate flight). Finally, there are “predictive/proactive ” agents, which volunteer information or services to a user, without being asked, whenever it is deemed to be appropriate (e. g., an agent may monitor news groups on the Internet and return discussions that it believes to be of interest to the user) ...|$|E

The CMM uses Health Code Numbers (HCN) and user entered chemical concentrations to calculate hazard indices (HIs). The HIs indicate the level of adverse health effects an individual could experience from exposure to a mixture of chemicals. Current focus is on furthering {{development of}} the CMM Wizard, an online application that allows a user to input information about a specific chemical mixture (i. e. chemical names, receptor locations, concentration values) and then calculates the HI for the mixture. The Wizard then displays the results based on the mode of action of the chemicals and the target organs effected by the chemicals. In order to further develop this program, multiple tests have been executed to determine the Wizard’s accuracy and benefit as evidenced by the level of max HI as compared to simply adding HIs for each chemical. The Wizard test results were compared to hand calculations to ensure accuracy. Testing of CMM Wizard is still in progress. Apart from assisting with analysis of the CMM Wizard, other project goals were to compose a user guide and develop a contact page using HTML for the CMM Wizard. One additional goal was to create a user registration page for the CMM using HTML. The CMM Wizard user manual provides users with an easy to understand workable instruction guide along with troubleshooting <b>tips.</b> The CMM <b>Wizard</b> contact page allows users to report problems, pose questions, or submit comments. The registration page allows CMM users to register and receive updates on CMM tools and progress. In the future, a beta version of the CMM Wizard will be released with the user manual and new features...|$|R
