5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. <b>That</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
25|$|Could I {{forget that}} the event in St. Peter's Square {{took place on the}} day and at the hour when the first {{appearance}} of the Mother of Christ to the poor little peasants has been remembered for over sixty years at Fátima, Portugal? For in everything <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on that very day, I felt that extraordinary motherly protection and care, {{which turned out to be}} stronger than the deadly bullet.|$|E

Now the people are all right, but I just didn't like the town." [...] He also stated that it began to affect his {{performance}} on the mound, and that he began to get [...] "lazy" [...] from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: [...] "The best thing <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> there was pitching to Steve O'Neill. He caught me for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn't even need to give me a sign".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] was {{directed}} by Tim Pope, who had directed all of the band's previous videos since 1982's [...] "Let's Go to Bed". The video was filmed in England's Pinewood Studios in October 1987. Set on a cliff overlooking a sea, the video recreates many of the memories detailed in the song's lyrics. When a fanzine asked Smith what the song was about, {{he said it was}} inspired by [...] "something <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a long time ago—see the video!" [...] While Smith had claimed for years that the video was shot at the same place that inspired the song, he later admitted that the bulk of it was filmed in a studio, utilising footage of the water and cliffs of Beachy Head taken for the band's 1985 video for [...] "Close to Me".|$|E
500|$|It was '97 and I {{was leaving}} my {{marriage}} [...] which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's {{what he would}} say to me.

At that point I really believed that I was {{going to go back to}} the marriage – I didn't think I was going to leave forever. But then the things <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> during that time caused me to not go back. Had it been, 'Go be yourself, you've been with me since you were a kid, let's separate for a while,' I probably would've." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} a noticeably darker sound and lyrical subject matter than Vanilla Ice's previous albums, such as To The Extreme and Mind Blowin. The album {{was described by}} CNN as a [...] "shrill confessional" [...] on which the performer [...] "flays his '80s persona, his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder, which he has." [...] Vanilla Ice explained that the album [...] "just comes out dark because that's the way I feel I've been treated" [...] and that the album [...] "wasn't intended to be so dark. I opened up to Ross and I told {{him a lot of}} things <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in the past. It was like, really deep conversation, and he was like, you should write about that. And I was like, dude, I didn't want people to judge me for that. But he was right. It was like total therapy." ...|$|E

It wasn't until 2010 when Norwood would break her silence during an episode of her VH1 reality TV show Brandy and Ray J: A Family Business. During one of the episodes when her brother Ray J announces {{that he wants to}} work with Darkchild, Norwood reveals that she felt the producer [...] "did not put his all into the album", and that [...] "was a personal issue between me and him." [...] Elaborating on what she meant, Norwood replied [...] "You know what kind of chemistry Rodney and I have too, but on some personal issues, he doesn't deliver.....I don't want the same thing <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> to happen to you.".|$|E

Opinion around the NHL in the early 1980s was that Swedish players were [...] "soft"; teammate Colin Patterson credited Loob with changing that perception. [...] He was a vocal leader, unafraid to speak to his teammates when he felt it necessary. [...] He was a strong skater with [...] "dazzling technique", and former Calgary linemate Joe Nieuwendyk said Loob was a key reason for his own early success in the NHL: [...] "He just had such a great amount of skill. He could do things none of the rest of us could. The luckiest thing <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was getting put on Hakan Loob’s line my first full year in Calgary. He helped me so much, starting my career the right way. A big reason why I scored 50." [...] Nieuwendyk added that Loob could [...] "put pucks into areas, make plays, nobody else would dream of".|$|E

2500|$|Muriel's {{participation}} in the Student Christian Movement (SCM) at McGill was a life-changing experience. [...] "Looking back over the years," [...] she told her biographer, [...] "I've felt always {{that the experience of}} the SCM {{was the most important thing}} <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> probably the most important aspect of my college life, more important than any of the courses that I took." [...] The SCM conducted small study groups in which students were encouraged to discuss their beliefs freely and come to their own conclusions about how to interpret the Gospels. For Muriel, such discussions were unsettling and painful, yet also exciting. [...] "I had always before treated the Gospel as though its authors had set down day by day events in the life of Jesus as they happened," [...] she said. [...] "To face the implication that nothing was written down until after Jesus died was itself a shock. But this question of free and open discussion, that everything needed to be challenged, to be questioned, to be talked about, that was completely opposite to the authoritarian approach in the church." [...] The SCM study groups fostered independent thinking. [...] "This was the beginning of my adult search for truth," [...] Muriel told her biographer, [...] "and my sense that all things must be open to me." ...|$|E
