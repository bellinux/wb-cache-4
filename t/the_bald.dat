5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bald</b> eagle is {{both the}} {{national}} bird and national animal of the United States of America. <b>The</b> <b>bald</b> eagle appears on its seal. In the late 20th century {{it was on the}} brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the U.S. government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of threatened species. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the Lower 48 States on June 28, 2007.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bald</b> eagle {{was one of}} {{the many}} species {{originally}} described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work Systema Naturae, under the name Falco leucocephalus.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{protected}} in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty, later extended {{to all of}} North America. <b>The</b> <b>Bald</b> and Golden Eagle Protection Act, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected <b>the</b> <b>bald</b> eagle and the golden eagle, prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. <b>The</b> <b>bald</b> eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States {{due to the fact}} that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds. DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.|$|E

The Juniata Formation occurs in the same areas as <b>the</b> <b>Bald</b> Eagle Formation, as well as part of the northern part of the watershed. However, it takes up more area than <b>the</b> <b>Bald</b> Eagle Formation. The Reedsville Formation also occurs in the western and northwestern parts of the watershed. The undivided Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formations occur in a zigzagging band that goes from the northeastern to the southwestern part of the watershed. The Clinton Group occurs in a zigzagging band immediately north of the Bloomsburg and Mifflinville Formations. It also occurs in a few scattered areas in the northeastern and western parts of the watershed. The Tuscarora Formation occurs in a zigzagging band immediately north of the Clinton Group. The Wills Creek Formation occurs in parts of the southern and northeastern areas.|$|E

5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required {{the permission of}} the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles <b>the</b> <b>Bald,</b> prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out that the word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the Union Pacific Railroad and its {{chairman}} W.

5|$|Once {{a common}} sight {{in much of the}} continent, <b>the</b> <b>bald</b> eagle was {{severely}} affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century, <b>the</b> <b>bald</b> eagle population was 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania IBA #33is on the Allegheny Front, {{which is}} along a prime migratory path {{for a variety}} of birds of prey. The golden eagle, bald eagle, osprey, and {{northern}} harrier pass through the area during their annual migration periods. It is possible that <b>the</b> <b>bald</b> eagle may nest within the IBA, but this has not been confirmed. Raptors which do nest in the forests of the IBA include the northern goshawk, red-shouldered, broad-winged, red-tailed, sharp-shinned, and Cooper's hawks.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bald</b> eagle {{appears on}} most {{official}} seals of the U.S. government, including the presidential seal, the presidential flag, {{and in the}} logos of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer's right), which {{gave rise to the}} urban legend that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Balding</b> Avenue Historic District {{is located}} {{along the street}} of the same name, between Mansion and Marshall streets, in Poughkeepsie, New York, United States. These four acres (1.6 ha) include 27 houses mostly built in the late 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{guidelines}} for the conservation and reintroduction of <b>the</b> northern <b>bald</b> ibis were established in 2003 at an International Advisory Group for Northern Bald Ibis (IAGNBI) conference in Innsbruck at the Alpenzoo, which maintains the European studbook for <b>the</b> northern <b>bald</b> ibis.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bald</b> eagle is {{a sacred}} bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, {{like those of the}} golden eagle, are central to many {{religious}} and spiritual customs among Native Americans. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many pow wow dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the Navajo Tradition an Eagle feather is represented to be a Protector, along with the Feather Navajo Medicine Man use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The Lakota, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The Choctaw considered <b>the</b> <b>bald</b> eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bald</b> eagle is the {{national}} bird of the United States of America. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the design for the Great Seal of the United States depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with its talons.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{an adult}} bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is {{moderately}} long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism {{is evident in the}} species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African fish eagle (H. vocifer) (from far outside <b>the</b> <b>bald</b> eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from <b>the</b> <b>bald</b> in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.|$|E

5000|$|The four-way {{intersection}} of <b>the</b> Maddron <b>Bald</b> Trail, Old Settlers Trail, and Gabes Mountain Trail {{occurs in a}} large open area 1.2 mi from the trailhead. The Old Settlers Trail - [...] {{one of the longest}} trails in the park - [...] stretches westward for 15.8 mi, connecting <b>the</b> Maddron <b>Bald</b> Trail with Greenbrier. The Gabes Mountain Trail stretches in the opposite direction, connecting <b>the</b> Maddron <b>Bald</b> Trail to <b>the</b> Cosby Campground to the east. <b>The</b> Maddron <b>Bald</b> Trail continues southward, rising gradually along the slopes above the Indian Camp Creek valley. At around 2.3 mi, the gravel road comes to an end, and the trail becomes a rugged dirt path. The trail crosses Indian Camp Creek via footbridge approximately 2.7 mi from the trailhead.|$|R
