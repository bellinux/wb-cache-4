Five Indiana politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets in elections held between 1868 and 1916. Benjamin Harrison, an Indianapolis lawyer and former officer in the Union army, was elected the 23rd president of the United States in 1888.|$|E

5|$|When the South {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>firm</b> Democratic {{control at}} the end of the 1870s, Indiana, which was closely split between the two parties, was one of a few key swing state that often decided the balance of power in Congress and the presidency. Five Hoosier politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets held between 1868 and 1916, as the nation's political parties vied for the support of the state's electorate. In 1888, at the height of the state's post-war political influence, former Civil War general Benjamin Harrison was elected president, and served in that capacity from 1889 to 1893.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{interest}} of scholars and policymakers {{to better understand}} the determinants for researchers in public science to transfer knowledge and technology <b>to</b> <b>firms,</b> little is known how temporary international mobility of scientists affects both their propensity to engage in knowledge and technology transfer (KTT) as well as the locus of such transfer. Based on a sample of more than 950 German academics from science and engineering faculties, we investigate how the duration and the frequency of scientists' visits at research institutions outside their home country affect KTT activities. We find that most mobile scientists engage in KTT <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> both in the host and in their home country, suggesting that KTT activities <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> abroad do not substitute or crowd out, but complement KTT <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> in the home country. We further find that the longer research visits abroad are, the higher the likelihood that scientists engage in KTT <b>to</b> <b>firms,</b> again both in the host and the home country. However, the more frequently scientists visit institutions abroad, {{the more likely they are}} to engage in KTT <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> only in their home country. Our results therefore provide evidence for the benefits of "brain circulation". The article contributes to the growing strand of the literature on scientist mobility and on the determinants of industry-science linkages at the individual level.

5|$|The Erie County, New York Republicans had drafted Kemp after {{incumbent}} congressman Richard D. McCarthy {{decided to}} run for the United States Senate. During his inaugural campaign, his district was in economic malaise, and The New York Times described him as a John F. Kennedy throwback who campaigned on family values, patriotism, sports, and defense. Upon his election to the Congress in a class of sixty-two freshmen, he was one of six newcomers—along with Ronald Dellums, Bella Abzug, Louise Day Hicks, Robert Drinan, and Pete du Pont—discussed in Time. The article described him as a football fan like United States President Richard Nixon and as the recipient of advice from White House adviser Robert Finch and former Kemp boss Herb Klein, Nixon's director of communications. The Nixon aides encouraged Kemp to endorse the Cambodian invasion and to oppose criticism of Nixon's war policies in order <b>to</b> <b>firm</b> up Kemp's support from military hawks.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{factors influencing}} {{the decisions of}} prospective lenders to extend credit to small and minority-owned businesses. Using data from a government survey of small businesses, the analysis reveals that prospective lenders (primarily commercial banks) are {{four times more likely}} to deny credit <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> owned by African-Americans than <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> owned by Non-Hispanic whites, and {{are twice as likely to}} deny credit <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> owned by Asian-Americans than <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> owned by Non-Hispanic whites. These differences in denial rates remain both statistically and economically significant, even after controlling for differences in the type and size of the prospective loan; in the age, experience, education, and creditworthiness of the firm’s primary owner; in the age, size, capital structure, profitability, organizational form, creditworthiness, and industry of the firm; and in the types and length of pre-existing relationships between the firm and its prospective lender. Interestingly, these differences in denial rates are significant only when the prospective lender is a commercial bank. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{standard}} Heckscher–Ohlin model {{assumes that}} the production functions are identical for all countries concerned. This means that all countries {{are in the same}} level of production and have the same technology, yet this is highly unrealistic. Technological gap between developed and developing countries is the main concern for the development of poor countries. The standard Heckscher–Ohlin model ignores all these vital factors when one wants to consider development of less developed countries in the international context. Even between developed countries, technology differs from industry to industry and firm <b>to</b> <b>firm</b> base. Indeed, this is the very basis of the competition between firms, inside the country and across the country. See the New Trade Theory in this article below.|$|E

25|$|Jellyfish {{deteriorate}} rapidly at {{room temperature}} so processing starts soon after they are caught. The bell is separated from the dangling oral arms and both are washed in seawater before being scraped to remove the gonads and mucus. Dehydration is traditionally undertaken by sprinkling the jellyfish with table salt and alum, draining off the brine and repeating the process. Finally the jellyfish are heaped to drain, turned several times and left to dry. The whole process takes three to six weeks and results in a product with about 65% moisture and 20% salt. The alum reduces the pH and serves <b>to</b> <b>firm</b> the texture while the salt removes water and prevents microbial deterioration. In Malaysia and Thailand, a little sodium bicarbonate is added during processing which facilitates dehydration and increases crispness.|$|E

Human rights are guaranteed in the Federal Constitution, which was adopted in August 2012. They fall under the Ministry of Human Rights established in August 2013. The central authorities concurrently inaugurated a National Human Rights Day, endorsed an official Human Rights Roadmap, and completed Somalia's first National Gender Policy.
