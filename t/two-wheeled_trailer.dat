50|$|Designed as a {{dual purpose}} weapon for use against both {{aircraft}} and ground targets, it was effective against light tanks, with the armour-piercing round {{being able to}} penetrate 30 millimeters of armour at a range of 500 meters. It had a <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailer,</b> but due to its structural weakness that limited the towing speed to 20 km/h, the weapon was usually transported on a truck bed instead.|$|E
5000|$|A kuliglig is {{a vehicle}} {{composed}} of a <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailer</b> pulled by a two-wheeled tractor similar to a rotary tiller. It is powered by multi-purpose diesel or gasoline engine, commonly used in the provinces of the Philippines. The kuliglig traces its etymology from the Filipino term kuliglig, meaning [...] "cicada" [...] (a type of insect) which was adopted by one manufacturer as a brand.|$|E

To avoid arrest, O'Connor had dyed his hair red, grew a mustache, added a tattoo and gained 58 pounds.|$|E
5000|$|Single-wheel: {{a single}} {{rear-mounted}} wheel. Though of limited towing capacity, this design {{tends to be}} more stable (when moving) than trailers with two or more wheels. The single wheel can tilt from side to side when cornering (as the bicycle itself does,) allowing for coordinated turns at relatively high speed. The connection to the bicycle is simpler than a <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailer</b> since only two degrees of freedom are required- the trailer tilts with the towing bicycle.|$|E

The antenna is a 6.7 x 1.4 m elliptical reflector of open lattice construction, mounted on a small <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailer.</b> Rotation rate is 20 rpm, the BCC - Battery Control Central and the CWAR are synchronized by the PAR revolutions and the PAR system trigger.|$|E
50|$|The first {{field kitchens}} were carried in four-wheeled wagons by {{military}} units on campaign throughout history. Indeed, {{this method of}} feeding a large travelling group of people was often used, such as on the Wagon Trail in late 19th Century America where the Chuckwagon was employed. By the 20th Century, smaller <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailers,</b> became common, especially with the invention of locomotive travel. Field Kitchens were often given affectionate nicknames.|$|R

These initially wore a blue and white livery, before being repainted in a white/grey livery, a white/blue livery incorporating BEA's [...] "red square" [...] logo and, finally, a white/red livery with Speedjack-style BEA lettering. The London Routemasters carried BEA's passengers from the West London Air Terminal to Heathrow and towed their baggage in large, <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The VT 95.9 was {{developed}} {{based on the}} experience gained with the prototypes and was delivered in 1952 by Waggonfabrik Uerdingen. 557 single-motored Class VT 95.9 units were built, as well as 564 Class VB 142 trailer cars and 60 <b>two-wheeled</b> railbus <b>trailers</b> for the transportation of luggage.|$|R
50|$|To save petrol {{during the}} war, buses were powered by gas, which was {{produced}} in a coke burner towed behind the bus on a <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailer.</b> William Moore says that very limited power resulted, and the buses could only manage about fifteen miles per hour. On reaching Dunston Hill the passengers had perforce to alight and walk up the hill behind the struggling bus.During the war, scholars would walk to school carrying their lunch of meat paste, jam or even lard sandwiches, together with their gas mask and identity card; anyone forgetting the last two items could be sent back home to get them.|$|E
50|$|In 1939, the Commercial Motor {{magazine}} {{noted that}} there were several models available, with payloads from 5 cwt to 18-22 cwt, and that the Wilson-Scammell Electric Horse was in production. This {{was similar to the}} Scammell Mechanical Horse which had found favour with railway companies for local deliveries. It was a three-wheeled tractor unit, which could be coupled to a <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailer,</b> fitted with a van body or a flat bed. The trailer could carry 4 tons, and the vehicle had a range of 28.5 mi, based on five stops per mile. Road speed was around 10 mph when fully laden, and the speed was controlled by a mechanical controller, with no electro-mechanical contactors.|$|E
50|$|Shipped {{with two}} to three rockets in a package, the Target Rocket Projector M1 {{was used for the}} rocket's {{launching}} platform. It consisted of a set of launching rails on a <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailer</b> and weighed 750 lb; capable of being elevated to 60 degrees, it allowed the rocket to be launched at random angles and directions to increase the effectiveness of the training exercises, and could fire up to two rounds per minute. A modification of the basic rocket, designated as the Anti-Aircraft Training Rocket M2A1, replaced the basic M2 in service; it added a flare that ignited on launch to aid in visual tracking of the target that burned for approximately 30 seconds after launch.|$|E
50|$|Clarke's brother ran a {{large farm}} and Clarke {{realised}} {{that there was}} a market for trailers of various types. Clarke thought that existing <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailers</b> waggled about too much - particularly horse boxes. He established the Low Loading Trailer Company Ltd. (LoLode for short) in Bedford. LoLode produced a wide range of trailers based on Clarke's design for a low-slung chassis and four close-coupled wheels with a stable suspension system.LoLode became known for building caravans to customer requirements. Standard features included Clarke's anti-rolling system with shock absorbers and hydraulic brakes. On-board batteries, water tanks, petrol generators and other internal equipment attracted attention at shows. Clarke's chassis and suspension design allowed passengers travelling in the caravan (which was permitted at that time) at a speed of 40 mph to pour drinks without spilling them, and some LoLode caravans even featured a gimbal-mounted chemical toilet for use while travelling.|$|R
5000|$|A trailer bike (also {{known as}} a trailer cycle, and trademarked names such as Trailerbike, Trail-a-bike, Half wheeler or Tagalong) is a one-wheeled, or {{sometimes}} <b>two-wheeled,</b> bicycle <b>trailer</b> designed to carry one or more children in positions that closely resemble that of a bicycle rider. It {{can be described as}} the, [...] "back half of a bicycle." [...] The rider of a trailer bike usually has a saddle, handlebars, and pedals. Some fold for more compact storage.|$|R
30|$|Another {{approach}} for controlling the vehicle motion {{is the use}} of controller design methods based on kinematic models without pre-calculating the optimal paths for a given map. The kinematic models of four-wheeled cars, <b>two-wheeled</b> cars, truck <b>trailers</b> and so on can be represented in a chained form, which is a canonical form of nonlinear systems. The chained-form systems cannot be stabilized by a time-invariant smooth static controller [4]. Therefore, many controllers for chained systems have been proposed. Such controllers include time-varying functions or non-smooth functions such as a sign function [5 – 12]. The control design method based on the time-state control form is also one such controller [13]. By using the time-state control form, the controller can be relatively easily designed based on the linear control theory. However, the controller requires the switching of the direction of the time axis. Because of the switching, the conditions for stabilizing the controlled system had not been exactly proven for a long time. Generally, the stability of the switched system depends on not only the characteristics of individual subsystems but also the timings for switching. It is known that the switched systems may be unstable by switching at inappropriate timings even if they are composed of stable linear subsystems [14, 15]. Therefore, for the switched systems, the stabilization conditions are mostly derived under some assumptions, such as the periodic switching, dwell time, and state-driven switching. We have already proved the stabilization conditions for the time-state control-form system with periodic switching [16]. However, if disturbances exist, the controller cannot switch its parameters periodically. Therefore, we exactly derived the stabilization conditions for the time-state control-form system with arbitrary switching by using the common Lyapunov function [17, 18]. To demonstrate the control method, we proposed a tracking controller for a wheeled inverted pendulum robot, which needs to suddenly switch its traveling direction for stabilizing the tilt angle of the robot [19].|$|R
50|$|The Tarasque Type 53 T2 is a 20 mm {{anti-aircraft}} gun {{adopted by the}} French Army. The Tarasque {{is based on the}} M693 F1 20 mm auto-cannon and mounted on a light <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailer</b> that can be towed by a jeep and brought into action in only 20 seconds. The Tarasque can be used against both aerial and ground targets and there is a 5× magnification telescopic sight for use against ground targets and a 1× magnification sight for anti-aircraft use. The Tarasque carriage is powered by an auxiliary hydraulic pump which provides power for both traverse and elevation. As a backup the Tarasque can also be powered manually if the hydraulic system fails.|$|E
50|$|The BTR-152 was {{originally}} {{armed with a}} single pintle-mounted 7.62mm SG-43 Goryunov (SGMB) medium machine gun, fed by 1,250 rounds of stored on-board ammunition. This was mounted behind the driving position. Additional 7.62mm general-purpose machine guns could be mounted {{on either side of}} the hull top as needed. The SGMB machine gun could traverse 45 degrees and elevate between -6 and +24 degrees. Some of the BTRs were fitted with single 12.7mm DShK or 14.5mm KPV heavy machine guns in place of the SGMB. Vehicles designated BTR-152A were ground support vehicles with limited air defense capability. BTR-152As carried twin KPVs in a ZPU-2 anti-aircraft mount. Variations included an Egyptian model with a Czechoslovak M53 Quad mounting for four DShKs, which were normally towed on a <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailer,</b> and some modified by the Palestine Liberation Organization to accept 23mm ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns.|$|E

40|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{people are}} dying from treatable diseases because they cannot reach medical care when they need it most. Typical methods of transport, such as wheelbarrows or motorcycles, are too slow, dangerous, or expensive. The bicycle ambulance is a locally produced and maintained, fuel-less vehicle that provides safe, affordable transport. The design of this appropriate technology varies greatly between countries because of the variability in local conditions, such as terrain, cultural stigmas, and availability of materials. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} bicycle ambulance (Zambulance) designed for Zambia. The Zambulance is a <b>two-wheeled</b> <b>trailer</b> that carries a sheet metal stretcher, and can be towed by common bicycles. The ambulance is fabricated from standard bicycle components and steel stock, such as 25 mm round tube that can be easily bent to minimize cuts and welds. A single rider can transport one patient at average speeds of 25 kph for distances up to 35 km on passable B-grade roads. The trailer is 200 cm by 98 cm and weighs 22 kg, while the stretcher is 200 cm by 65 cm and weighs 20 kg. The Zambulance costs 1, 200, 000 Zambian Kwacha or about 315 USD (based on exchange rate on December 27, 2007). One Zambulance can be fabricated in about 20 hours, which are usually spread over 5 days. There are currently forty-seven Zambulances in Zambia, and more are being produced by Disacare Wheelchair Center in Lusaka, Zambia. From January 2006 to August 2007, one bicycle ambulance was used over 125 times to transport patients from their homes to the nearby clinic and hospice. According to records, the ambulance carried men and {{women between the ages of}} twelve and ninety who were suffering from various ailments including cholera, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, blindness, broken bones, anemia, and pneumonia. A production manual, user manual, and assessment material is available online for free downloading at [URL] Long-term monitoring and evaluation of the design is needed, but current data suggests that the Zambulances are already saving lives by closing the transport gap between patients and healthcare. by Jessica Vechakul.
