5|$|During a {{visit to}} Pompeii, he lost his passport, {{and went back to}} the amphitheatre he had visited earlier in the day in order to find it. Walking around the deserted ruins, he thought <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>and</b> natural ambient sounds present would make a good {{backdrop}} for the music. He also felt that filming the band without an audience would be a good reaction to earlier films such as Woodstock and Gimme Shelter, where the films paid equal attention to performers and spectators. One of Maben's contacts at the University of Naples, a professor who was a Pink Floyd fan, managed to persuade the local authorities to close the amphitheatre for six days that October for filming.|$|E
5|$|Unsuccessful {{contacts}} {{were the}} exception {{rather than the}} norm for the RLI, particularly on Fireforce. An example is an encounter with guerrillas in the Kandeya Tribal Trust Lands, north of Mount Darwin, on 19 July 1975. On that day a Territorial Force (TF) unit engaged a group of cadres near a river and killed two without suffering casualties. The nationalist fighters retreated into a defensive ambush position on the banks, beneath the roots of some overhanging trees. The Territorials then summoned a Fireforce made up of 7 and 10 Troops, 2 Commando from Mount Darwin, and on arrival made a sweep of the river line, accompanied by 10 Troop. When the Rhodesians rounded a bend in the stream the concealed insurgents opened fire, immediately killing a Territorial sergeant and RLI Rifleman Hennie Potgieter. Rifleman Ken Lucas, an FN MAG gunner, suffered a wound to his leg. After the initial burst of fire, the insurgents remained behind their cover and waited, concealed from security force eyes. Judging from <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>and</b> inactivity that the guerrillas had fled, and thinking that the two downed men were still alive, Major Hank Meyer told Lieutenant Joe du Plooy to sweep around the river with two 7 Troop sticks and send a medic out to give treatment.|$|E

500|$|While the Doctor alters part of {{the command}} module of Apollo 11, Canton and Amy visit a nearby orphanage, hoping to find where {{the girl in the}} {{spacesuit}} was taken from. Amy discovers a nest of <b>the</b> <b>Silence,</b> <b>and</b> a photograph of her and a baby amongst pictures of the little girl from the space suit. The girl enters with <b>the</b> <b>Silence,</b> <b>and</b> Amy is abducted and taken to their time engine control room. Arriving too late, the Doctor and his allies find Amy's recording device, through which Rory still can hear Amy's voice confessing her love for one of the group. Canton is able to shoot and wound one of the creatures, and from it the Doctor discovers the creatures are the Silence, a group he was warned about by several of his foes in his recent adventures. Analysing the now-empty space suit, River realises that the girl possesses incredible strength to have forced her way out of it, and that the suit's advanced life-support technology would have called the President as the highest authority figure on Earth when the girl got scared. The Doctor realises why the Silence have been controlling humanity— by guiding their technological advances, they have influenced humanity into the Space Race for purposes of building a spacesuit, which must somehow be crucial to their intentions. Meanwhile, Canton interrogates the captured Silent in the Area 51 prison, who mocks humanity for treating him when [...] "...you should kill us all on sight". Canton records this using Amy's mobile phone.|$|E

500|$|The {{poems in}} this volume, like her poems in other volumes and contexts, contain {{universal}} identifications with ordinary objects. [...] For example, [...] "The Telephone" [...] describes {{her relationship with}} an object, and how it has intruded upon <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>and</b> solitude of her life. [...] In this poem, which is three structured stanzas long, Angelou demands that the telephone ring, despite her resentment of its intrusion and her dependency upon it. [...] She uses familiar and feminine metaphors, and themes also found in blues songs, such as the colors black and blue and weekend loneliness. [...] In the poem [...] "Poor Girl", Angelou uses the vernacular to express universal themes, {{in the voice of}} a teenage girl who has lost her boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|During her internship, Cristina has an on-off {{relationship}} with the chief of cardiothoracic surgery Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) that leads to an accidental pregnancy. Yang schedules an abortion without telling him about the pregnancy due to Burke's behavior towards their lack of relationship status. However, Yang experiences an ectopic pregnancy and Burke discovers the pregnancy after Yang collapses from a burst fallopian tube. Burke and Yang begin a relationship {{in the aftermath of}} her miscarriage. After Burke is shot in the arm and develops a hand tremor, Yang helps him cover it up by developing a covert partnership wherein she performs most of his surgeries. Yang initially denies involvement during a confrontation, but then confesses everything to Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), the chief of surgery. Yang's actions jeopardize Burke's chances of becoming chief, which he sees as a huge betrayal. After a short breakup, Yang breaks <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>and</b> Burke proposes marriage, which Yang accepts after eight days of hesitation. Burke calls off the wedding, leaving Yang at the altar. She goes on her honeymoon to Hawaii with Meredith to recover, returning to discover that Burke has disappeared from her life and transferred to a different hospital.|$|E
500|$|Kira Schlechter in The Patriot-News {{declares}} [...] "The Body" [...] "one of {{the finest}} episodes of any series ever", stating that <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>and</b> novel cinematography are [...] "remarkable and the writing is brilliant". Buffy and Dawn's conversation at her school, Schlechter says, is [...] "positively wrenching". When the series ended in 2003, Amy Antangelo in the Boston Herald and Siona LaFrance of the New Orleans Times-Picayune both rated the best Buffy episodes giving [...] "The Body" [...] equal billing at the top with [...] "Hush" [...] and [...] "Once More, with Feeling", LaFrance designating the episode an [...] "instant classic". Jonathan Last in The Weekly Standard lists [...] "The Body" [...] eighth out of the ten best Buffy episodes, writing that it is [...] "the series' most difficult episode because it's real—and not real in the way ER or The Practice or Law & Order, all hyper-versions of reality, are real. At some point, {{most of us will}} experience a day like Buffy has in 'The Body' and we sense that the writers have gotten nearly every detail of that day—right down to the absence of a musical score—right." [...] In the A.V. Club, Noel Murray also finds small details compelling, such as the camera's focus on the paper towel Buffy uses to cover the vomit on the carpet. He does, however, write that some of the shots [...] "come off a little gimmicky, but the ones that work are so effective that it seems petty to complain that Whedon overdoes it at times.

500|$|As {{shown in}} [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", the Doctor joins his friends at Lake Silencio and then {{approaches}} the astronaut, now {{known to be}} a younger version of River Song, Amy and Rory's daughter, trained to kill the Doctor by <b>the</b> <b>Silence</b> <b>and</b> Madame Kovarian. River does not want to kill him but is unable to fight the suit's control, and the Doctor says he forgives her and reminds her that the event is inevitable. River, despite his warning against interfering with a fixed point, surprises the Doctor by draining the astronaut suit's weapons systems and averting his death. Time becomes [...] "stuck" [...] as a result and begins to disintegrate; all of Earth's history begins to run simultaneously at a fixed moment of 5:02p.m. on 22 April 2011. In London, Holy Roman Emperor Winston Churchill takes the Doctor, his [...] "soothsayer", out from his locked cell to ask him about the condition of time. The Doctor explains the preceding events, as tally marks begin appearing on his arms, indicating the presence of the Silence. After noticing a Silence nest overhead, they are rescued by Amy and a squad of soldiers under her command. Due to the effects of the crack in her bedroom, Amy is cognizant of the altered timeline, though she is unaware that her trusted captain is her husband Rory. Amy takes the Doctor to [...] "Area 52", a hollowed-out Giza pyramid, where they have captured over a hundred Silence and Madame Kovarian. River is also there; aware of the consequences of her actions, she refuses to allow the Doctor to touch her, an event that would [...] "unfreeze" [...] time and allow it to resume. They all wear [...] "eyedrives", external memory eye patches which enable them to avoid the Silence's effect of erasing themselves from memory.|$|E
