5|$|William Rufus {{crossed into}} Normandy {{to take the}} war to Robert in 1094, and when {{progress}} stalled, called upon Henry for assistance. Henry responded, but travelled to London instead of joining the main campaign further east in Normandy, possibly {{at the request of}} the King, who in any event abandoned the campaign and returned to England. Over the next few years, Henry appears to have strengthened his power base in western Normandy, visiting England occasionally to attend at William Rufus's court. In 1095 Pope Urban II called the First Crusade, encouraging knights from across Europe to join. Robert joined the Crusade, borrowing money from William Rufus to do so, and granting the King <b>temporary</b> <b>custody</b> of his part of the Duchy in exchange. The King appeared confident of regaining the remainder of Normandy from Robert, and Henry appeared ever closer to William Rufus, the pair campaigning together in the Norman Vexin between 1097 and 1098.|$|E

In 2007 church leader Warren Jeffs was convicted of being an accomplice to statutory rape of a minor due to arranging a marriage between a 14-year-old girl and a 19-year-old man.

Fam. Code Section 3170 states: If it appears {{on the face of}} a petition, application, or other pleading to obtain or modify a <b>temporary</b> or permanent <b>custody</b> or visitation order that custody, visitation, or both are contested, the court shall set the contested issues for mediation. 2 Cal. Fam. Code Section 3711 states: "Mediation proceedings pursuant to this chapter shall be held in private and shall be confidential". The effects of the rule of confidentiality are considered below. The reference to privacy is amplified by Cal. Fam. Code Section 3182, which states that the "mediator has authority to exclude counsel from participation in the mediation proceedings". As a matter of practice, the presence of attorneys at a mediation proceeding is extremely rare. All mediators, and most attorneys, prefer the parents to mediate the custody issues without their lawyers present.
