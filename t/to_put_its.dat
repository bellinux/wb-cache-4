5|$|Enola Gay {{became the}} center of a {{controversy}} at the Smithsonian Institution when the museum planned <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>its</b> fuselage on public display in 1995 as part of an exhibit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The exhibit, The Crossroads: The End of World War II, the Atomic Bomb and the Cold War, was drafted by the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum staff, and arranged around the restored Enola Gay.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell also {{investigated}} the kinetic theory of gases. Originating with Daniel Bernoulli, this theory was advanced by the successive labours of John Herapath, John James Waterston, James Joule, and particularly Rudolf Clausius, {{to such an}} extent as <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>its</b> general accuracy beyond a doubt; but it received enormous development from Maxwell, who in this field appeared as an experimenter (on the laws of gaseous friction) as well as a mathematician.|$|E
5|$|The White Stripes had a {{carefully}} constructed image built around lore they created {{for themselves and}} visual motifs. Early in their history, they turned down a potential deal with Chicago label Bobsled, because the label wanted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>its</b> green logo on the CD. Their presentation was a subject of intrigue among the public and in the media.|$|E

There still remained a faint hope that the Rev.

5|$|Back in Salisbury, the Southern Rhodesian {{government}} was coming {{under pressure from}} Britain <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>its</b> armed forces under the purview of a regional command. Huggins decided in late October 1942 to join a unified Southern African Command headed by South Africa's Jan Smuts. This choice was motivated {{by a combination of}} strategic concerns and geopolitical manoeuvring. Apart from considering South Africa a more appropriate partner in geographical, logistical and cultural terms, Huggins feared that the alternative—joining the British East Africa Command—might detract from the autonomous nature of Southern Rhodesia's war effort, with possible constitutional implications. A shift in the deployment of the colony's troops duly occurred. For the rest of the war the majority of Rhodesian servicemen went into the field integrated into South African formations, prominently the 6th Armoured Division.|$|E
5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>its</b> energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, the Lebanese Armed Forces planned <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>its</b> Hunters {{back into}} service {{following}} the 2007 Lebanon conflict, {{to deal with}} Fatah al-Islam militants in the Nahr el-Bared camp north of Tripoli. The programme was delayed by lack of spare parts for the aircraft, such as cartridges for the Martin-Baker ejection seats. On 12 November 2008, 50 years after its original introduction, the Lebanese Air Force returned four of its eight Hunters to service with 2nd Squadron, based at Rayak AB: one two-seater and three single-seaters. Military exercises were conducted with Hunters, {{such as those that}} took place on 12 July 2010. The Hunters were retired from service during 2014.|$|E

5|$|Wilde's charm {{also had}} a lasting effect on Parisian literati, who {{produced}} several original biographies and monographs on him. André Gide, on whom Wilde had such a strange effect, wrote In Memoriam, Oscar Wilde; Wilde also features in his journals. Thomas Louis, who had earlier translated books on Wilde into French, produced his own L'esprit d'Oscar Wilde in 1920. Modern books include Philippe Jullian's Oscar Wilde, and L'affaire Oscar Wilde, ou, Du danger de laisser la justice mettre le nez dans nos draps (The Oscar Wilde Affair, or, On the Danger of Allowing Justice <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>its</b> Nose in our Sheets) by , a French religious historian.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the Vietnamese occupation, the Kampuchean {{resistance}} groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences. Even though the Khmer Rouge enjoyed widespread international recognition, by 1980 the organization was under pressure to reform itself from the international community. ASEAN, which had backed the Khmer Rouge throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979, urged the Khmer Rouge leadership <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>its</b> blood-stained image behind it in order to join forces with other non-communist movements. However, the idea of forming an alliance with the Khmer Rouge initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality. Nonetheless, early in 1981, Sihanouk and Son Sann began engaging in talks with Khieu Samphan, President of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea, to discuss the prospect of forming an alliance.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of {{preparing}} his case, Aguirre began monitoring Manville in October 1981, when the company undertook a reorganization that moved 75% of its assets to four of five new companies it created.

Aguirre became convinced Manville was trying <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>its</b> assets beyond the reach of unsecured creditors and when he went to trial, he accurately predicted the company would file between 45 and 60 days.|$|E

Sponsorship was also a constant issue for the No. 30 team, and they managed to run 10 races with limited sponsorship. However, after Kentucky, Germain was unable to send the 30 team to Iowa without a sponsor. The week before the race at Iowa, Germain partnered with Randy Moss Motorsports to put Bodine in their 5 truck for the rest of 2011. Bodine went winless in 2011, and subsequently left Germain when the team decided <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>its</b> focus on the Sprint Cup Series.|$|E
25|$|In the aftermath, the {{handling}} of the incident was widely criticized by fans and media. While the sanctioning body was commended by many for choosing not <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>its</b> drivers in danger the race was largely viewed as a debacle, a low point for the slumping series, and very damaging to the organization in the months and years to come. CART reported that it spent $3.5 million for the settlement and legal costs, resulting in a $1.7 million loss for the third quarter of 2001. CART declared bankruptcy and was sold in 2003, became known as Champ Car, and never attempted to return to Texas Motor Speedway. Ultimately it was absorbed into the Indy Racing League in 2008.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, the McLean County Historical Society moved <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>its</b> {{museum in}} the Old Courthouse. Today the museum {{operates}} out of the courthouse building as it has since 1991. Until 1991, general county offices were still housed in the courthouse though the courts had moved to new facilities a few blocks away. In 2002 McLean County approved $1.2 million for renovation following a historic structures report. Other funding came through a Public Museum Capital Grant from the Illinois State Museum, {{a division of the}} Illinois Department of Natural Resources. The project included restoration of the 100-year-old courthouse dome. Original copper was salvaged and reused and the clock restored to working order. On December 24, 2004 the tower bell was rang {{for the first time in}} nearly fifty years. The dome was restored from its oxidized copper green to the original copper color.|$|E
