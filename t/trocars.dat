40|$|Background and Objectives: <b>Trocar</b> {{insertion}} injury {{has a high}} morbidity, mortality, and cost. The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare standard <b>trocar</b> entry with our reduced-force closed <b>trocar</b> entry technique by measuring <b>trocar</b> insertion force using a mechanical force gauge. Methods: In the operating room, the force gauge was inserted into a sterile glove and connected to the proximal portion of the <b>trocar</b> to measure insertion force. Through one incision, we used a standard closed <b>trocar</b> entry, while through the other incision, we used our reducedforce closed <b>trocar</b> entry technique. After making the skin incision and before <b>trocar</b> entry, we spread and dilated the skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle with a hemostat. Results: Twenty-five patients entered the trial and none were excluded. Median <b>trocar</b> insertion force was 3. 3 lb (range, 1. 6 to 5. 4) with our reduced-force <b>trocar</b> entry technique versus 6. 5 lb (range, 2. 0 to 14. 0) with the standard <b>trocar</b> entry (P�. 001). No complications occurred with the reduced-force <b>trocar</b> entry technique. Conclusion: Our reduced-force <b>trocar</b> entry technique decreases <b>trocar</b> insertion force by 50 %, requires no additional instruments or cost and is fast and safe. Reducedentry force pressure may decrease the risk of <b>trocar</b> insertion injury...|$|R

40|$|Hypothesis: The {{use of a}} nonbladed <b>trocar</b> with {{an optical}} view is a safe and {{effective}} method for initial <b>trocar</b> placement for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Design Retrospective review of consecutive patients. Setting University-associated hospital. Patients All patients who underwent laparoscopic bariatric surgery from December 2002 to November 2003. Intervention Initial <b>trocar</b> placement. Main Outcome Measures Injury and bleeding during initial <b>trocar</b> placement, <b>trocar</b> placement time, and insufflation time. <b>Trocar</b> placement time {{was defined as the}} time to place the <b>trocar</b> into the peritoneal cavity (including infiltration of local anesthesia and incision). Insufflation time was defined as time to insufflate the abdomen to a pressure of 10 to 15 mm Hg (including time to place tubing on <b>trocar).</b> Results: There were 228 patients who had no evidence of any bowel or vessel injury during initial <b>trocar</b> placement. In the last 50 patients, average body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) was 47 (range, 35 - 63). Average <b>trocar</b> placement time was 25 seconds (range, 10 - 60 seconds), and average insufflation time was 16 seconds (range, 5 - 25 seconds). In almost all cases, appropriate pneumoperitoneum was established in less than a minute. No correlation was seen between times and body mass index (<b>trocar,</b> P = 3 D. 56; insufflation, P = 3 D. 95) or waist-hip circumference (<b>trocar,</b> P = 3 D. 74; insufflation, P= 3 D. 48). Conclusions: Initial <b>trocar</b> placement using a nonbladed <b>trocar</b> with an optical view without prior abdominal insufflation is safe and effective in morbidly obese patients.

30|$|Introduction: <b>Trocar</b> {{dislodgement}} is {{a common}} problem complicating laparoscopy. <b>Trocar</b> stabilization methods have been vigorously investigated {{in order to minimize}} this risk contributing thus in patients’ safety, but also in reducing procedural time and increasing surgeon’s satisfaction. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate <b>trocar</b> stability using a fixation device aimed at controlling <b>trocar</b> insertion depth but especially providing greater stability during laparoscopic procedures.|$|R
50|$|In modern times, {{surgical}} <b>trocars</b> {{are used}} to perform laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery. They are deployed {{as a means of}} introduction for cameras and laparoscopic hand instruments, such as scissors, graspers, etc., to perform surgery hitherto carried out by making a large abdominal incision ('open' surgery), something that has revolutionized patient care. Today, surgical <b>trocars</b> are most commonly a single patient use instrument and have graduated from the 'three point' design that gave them their name, to either a flat bladed 'dilating-tip' product, or something that is entirely blade free. This latter design offers greater patient safety due to the technique used to insert them.|$|E

50|$|AAC {{requires}} specialized implants {{and installation}} tools. Hancock Laboratories, {{now part of}} Medtronic (Minneapolis, MN), developed and released a set of left ventricle connectors, valved conduits, and installation <b>trocars</b> in the 1970s. The Hancock left ventricle connectors, with inner diameters of 12 to 22 mm, have been used clinically {{for the vast majority}} of AAC procedures reported in the literature. For the valved conduit, surgeons have used the Medtronic Hancock Model 105 or 150 valved conduits which contain a complete porcine aortic valve. Other surgeons have constructed valved conduits on the back table using a variety of bioprosthetic valves such as the Medtronic Freestyle valve. The Hancock <b>trocars</b> for creating a hole in the left ventricle are rarely used clinically. Surgeons typically assemble their own tools to core and remove a plug of muscle from the left ventricular wall.|$|E
5000|$|A trocar is {{a medical}} device that {{is made up of}} an [...] (which may be a metal or plastic {{sharpened}} or non-bladed tip), a cannula (basically a hollow tube), and a seal. <b>Trocars</b> are placed through the abdomen during laparoscopic surgery. The trocar functions as a portal for the subsequent placement of other instruments, such as graspers, scissors, staplers, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} is {{the most}} common laparoscopic procedure performed. In this procedure, 5-10 mm diameter instruments (graspers, scissors, clip applier) can be introduced by the surgeon into the abdomen through <b>trocars</b> (hollow tubes with a seal to keep the [...] from leaking). Over one million cholecystectomies are performed in the U.S. annually, with over 96% of those being performed laparoscopically.|$|E
30|$|An {{alternative}} method for introducing the <b>trocar</b> is direct <b>trocar</b> insertion (Table  1). This procedure involves an infraumbilical skin incision, grasping and {{elevation of the}} abdominal wall, and insertion of the <b>trocar</b> directed toward the uterine fundus. This technique theoretically {{has the advantage of}} only one “blind” insertion (instead of two, with a <b>trocar</b> following insertion of a Veress needle). On the other hand, damage in the case of vessel or bowel lesion is more pronounced. Clinical research is contradictory [7]. After insertion of the primary <b>trocar,</b> the laparoscope is introduced and the abdominal cavity inspected 360 °. After inspection, the patient is placed in Trendelenburg position.|$|R
30|$|Discussion: The use of fixator {{significantly}} reduces plain (smooth) sleeve <b>trocar</b> movement, prohibits {{a complete}} dislocation or slippage of the port, while suturing {{the device to}} the skin further minimizes <b>trocar</b> movement.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare three {{techniques}} of establishment of pneumoperitoneum for efficacy: the Veress needle/first <b>trocar,</b> the Hasson <b>trocar,</b> and a newly developed modified blunt <b>trocar,</b> the TrocDoc. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June and December 1999, 62 patients eligible for laparoscopic surgery were randomized. The effectiveness of {{installation of the}} pneumoperitoneum using the {{three techniques}} was assessed by time-motion analysis. Primary efficacy measures were total time and number of actions required to establish the pneumoperitoneum. Secondary efficacy measures were procedure-related complications, wound complications, and occurrence of CO 2 leakage. RESULTS: Two patients were withdrawn from inclusion. The three groups were comparable for age and body mass index. Total time was shortest using the TrocDoc rather than the Veress needle/first <b>trocar</b> and the Hasson <b>trocar</b> (respectively, 138 +/- 58 v 237 +/- 56 v 350 +/- 103 seconds), {{and the number of}} actions was lowest for the Veress needle/first <b>trocar</b> combination: 22 +/- 7 v 32 +/- 12 (TrocDoc) v 53 +/- 17 (Hasson). There was no morbidity related to the installation of pneumoperitoneum nor <b>trocar</b> wound complications. Gas leakage occurred in five of the Hasson introductions.

5000|$|<b>Trocars</b> {{are widely}} used by veterinarians not only for {{draining}} hydrothorax, ascites, or for introducing instruments in laparoscopic surgery, but for acute animal-specific conditions as well. In cases of ruminal tympany (bloat) in cattle, a wide-bore trocar may be passed through the skin into the rumen to release trapped gas. In dogs, a similar procedure is often performed for patients presenting with GDV (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus) in which a wide-bore trocar is passed through the skin into the stomach to immediately decompress the stomach. Depending on the severity of clinical signs on presentation, this is often performed after pain management has been administered but prior to general anaesthesia. Definitive surgical treatment involves anatomical repositioning of the stomach and spleen followed by a right-sided gastropexy. [...] Depending on the severity, partial gastrectomy and/or splenectomy may be indicated if the relevant tissues have necrosed due to ischemia caused by torsion/avulsion of the supplying vasculature. 72hr post-operative supportive care, fluid therapy and ECG monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias is highly recommended.|$|E
40|$|Purpose Abdominal wall nerve injury as {{a result}} of <b>trocar</b> {{placement}} for laparoscopic surgery is rare.

5000|$|<b>Trocars</b> {{are also}} used {{near the end of}} the {{embalming}} process to provide drainage of bodily fluids and organs after the vascular replacement of blood with embalming chemicals. Rather than a round tube being inserted, the three sided knife of the classic trocar would split the outer skin into three [...] "wings" [...] which was then easily sutured closed in a less obtrusive way. It is attached to a suction hose (which usually is attached to a running water source and drain known as a hydroaspirator). The process of removing gas, fluids, and semi-solids from the body cavities and hollow organs using the trocar is known as aspiration. The instrument is inserted into the body two inches to the left and two inches up from the navel. After the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities have been aspirated, the embalmer injects cavity fluid into the thoracic, abdominal and pelvic cavities using a smaller trocar attached via a hose which is connected to a bottle of high index cavity fluid. The bottle is held upside down in the air so as to let gravity take the cavity fluid through the trocar and into the cavities. The embalmer moves the trocar in the same manner that he or she used when aspirating the cavities in order to fully and evenly distribute the chemical.|$|E
