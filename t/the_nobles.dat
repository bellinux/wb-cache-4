5|$|Not {{having been}} {{involved}} in the coup d'état, Rainilaiarivony provided direction for his brother {{and the rest of the}} court as they grappled with the gravity of their acts. He proposed that future monarchs would no longer have absolute power but would instead rule by the consent of <b>the</b> <b>nobles.</b> A series of terms were proposed by Rainilaiarivony that <b>the</b> <b>nobles</b> agreed to impose on Radama's widow, Rasoherina. Under Rainilaiarivony's new monarchy, a sovereign required the consent of <b>the</b> <b>nobles</b> to issue a death sentence or promulgate a new law, and was forbidden to disband the army. The new power sharing agreement was concluded by a political marriage between the queen and the Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|The Albanian {{revolt of}} 1432–36 {{was a series}} of {{conflicts}} between Albanian rebels and the Ottoman Empire during the early period of Ottoman rule in the region.

5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Kingdom of Madagascar, the French colonial authorities shifted the location of these tombs thereby disrupting the original cosmological symbolism of their arrangement. When the original tombs were excavated for relocation, the French found the mortal remains of <b>the</b> <b>nobles</b> within had each been wrapped in numerous traditional lambas (woven silk cloths) then set within wooden coffins packed with charcoal. Bodies buried at Ambohimanga were found to have been entombed in the same way.|$|E
5|$|Against {{all these}} reforms were <b>the</b> <b>nobles</b> of Wessex, who {{included}} most of Dunstan's own relatives, {{and who had}} an interest in maintaining established customs. For nine years Dunstan's influence was dominant, during which time he twice refused the office of bishop (that of Winchester in 951 and Crediton in 953), affirming that he would not leave the king's side so long as the king lived and needed him.|$|E

5|$|Although most Gothic {{architecture}} in Denmark {{is to be}} found in churches and monasteries, there are examples in the secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services of Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including parapets, false doors, dead-end corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect <b>the</b> <b>nobles</b> against peasant uprisings.|$|E
5|$|Among the few {{remains of}} {{buildings}} {{from the interior}} of the town, most notable are a large monumental staircase and a large church, with dimensions of some , in the northeast. The church was of relatively simple construction, but of unusual size, and A.

The remaining portions of the church's walls were completely destroyed by the German Army during the Occupation.|$|E
5|$|As was customary, {{the treaty}} {{would have to}} be {{approved}} by <b>the</b> <b>nobles</b> and knights of both lands. The meeting between the nobility of Pomerelia and Greater Poland took place between 13–15 September 1284 in the town of Nakło, where they confirmed the rights of Przemysł II over Gdańsk Pomerania. The unification of Pomerelia and Greater Poland was not the only decision made by Przemysł II and Mestwin II. The favors shown by the Duke of Pomerelia to the powerful witnesses of the agreement from Greater Poland showed that they were also keenly interested in the close integration of the two lands.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1590s, the full-length portrait came into vogue and artistic patrons among <b>the</b> <b>nobles</b> began to add galleries of such paintings to their homes as a form of cultural ostentation. Peake {{was one of those who}} met the demand. He was also among the earliest English painters to explore the full-length individual or group portrait with active figures placed in a natural landscape, a style of painting that became fashionable in England. As principal painter to Prince Henry, Peake seems to have been charged with showing his patron as a dashing young warrior.|$|E
5|$|His campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all {{the gains}} had been lost. Edward's reign was also {{marked by the}} further {{development}} of Parliament, which came to {{be divided into two}} Houses. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson Richard II. Like many of his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with <b>the</b> <b>nobles</b> by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin Henry Bolingbroke seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king as Henry IV.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilize}} Ottoman authority, Murat II appointed native Albanians like Jakub Muzaka and Skanderbeg to high positions within the sanjak of Albania. <b>The</b> <b>nobles</b> who accepted Ottoman overlordship were granted their pre-Ottoman holdings and border estates {{as well as}} a degree of autonomy, while others were exiled or continued warring. In 1436–37, rebels were active in the regions of Gjirokastër and Vlorë and Teodor Korona Muzaka led a revolt in the region of Berat. As many rebels used Venetian territories like Shkodër and Parga as bases to launch raids into Ottoman territory, representatives of Mehmed II asked the Venetians to outlaw their activity in October 1436.|$|E

5|$|In the Late Postclassic, {{the greater}} Q'umarkaj area is {{estimated}} {{to have had a}} population of around 15,000. The inhabitants of Q'umarkaj were divided socially between the nobility and their vassals. <b>The</b> <b>nobles</b> were known as the ajaw, while the vassals were known as the al k'ajol. The nobility were the patrilineal descendents of the founding warlords who appear to have entered as conquerors from the Gulf coast around AD 1200 and who eventually lost their original language and adopted that of their subjects. <b>The</b> <b>nobles</b> were regarded as sacred and bore royal imagery. Their vassals served as foot-soldiers and were subject to the laws laid out by the nobility, although they could receive military titles {{as a result of their}} battlefield prowess. The social divisions were deep seated and were equivalent to strictly observed castes. The merchants were a privileged class, although they had to make tributary payments to the nobility. In addition to these classes, the population included rural labourers and artisans. Slaves were also held and included both sentenced criminals and prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette {{continued}} to work for order in the coming months. On 28 February 1791, Lafayette {{and part of the}} National Guard left the Tuileries to handle a conflict in Vincennes. While he was gone, hundred of armed nobles arrived at the Tuileries to defend the king; however, there were rumors that these nobles had come to take the king away and place him {{at the head of a}} counter-revolution. Lafayette quickly returned to the Tuileries and disarmed <b>the</b> <b>nobles</b> after a brief standoff. The event, later called the Day of Daggers, boosted Lafayette's popularity with the French people for his quick actions to protect the king.|$|E
