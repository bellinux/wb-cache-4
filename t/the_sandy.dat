5|$|All public activities, flights, {{and schools}} were either closed or {{canceled}} on Puerto Rico. Eighteen shelters were {{open on the}} eastern part of the island. Also, on Anguilla, residents in <b>the</b> <b>Sandy</b> Ground, Valley Bottom, Welches and Mount Fortune areas were placed under evacuation orders. Shelters were opened throughout the island for those in need of shelter. Schools and government offices were also closed and visitors were told to leave the island.|$|E

5|$|Draining about , the Columbia Slough {{watershed}} lies in {{the floodplain}} of the Columbia River between the mouths of <b>the</b> <b>Sandy</b> River {{to the east and}} the Willamette River. Parts of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, Wood Village, and unincorporated Multnomah County lie within the drainage basin (watershed). As of 2005, about 158,000people, 5percent of Oregon's population, lived in the basin.|$|E
50|$|In 1971 Dippel {{began his}} head {{coaching}} career at Hereford High School, but left in 1975 {{for the head}} coaching job at Amarillo High School.

5|$|In late 1805 {{and early}} 1806, {{members of the}} Lewis and Clark Expedition spotted Mount St. Helens from the Columbia River but did not report either an ongoing {{eruption}} or recent evidence of one.

5|$|Neighboring {{watersheds}} on {{the east}} side of the Willamette River include Mount Scott Creek and Kellogg Creek, which flow through Milwaukie and drain directly into the Willamette; the Clackamas River, which drains the southeast suburbs and empties into the Willamette near Oregon City; <b>the</b> <b>Sandy</b> River, which drains the eastern suburbs and empties into the Columbia; and Fairview Creek and the Columbia Slough, which drain north Portland and Gresham, emptying into the Columbia.|$|E

50|$|The 13th-century parish Church of St. John the Baptist shows a close {{connection}} of <b>the</b> <b>Sandys</b> family with <b>the</b> American colonists. It {{can be seen}} in the floor slab monument to Penelope Washington within the altar rails. The oak chancel gates were installed in the 17th century with a monument to <b>the</b> <b>Sandys</b> family on <b>the</b> north side. Penelope Washington, whose mother married Sir Samuel Sandys and moved to the Manor House, was a distant relative of George Washington, the first President of the United States of America.|$|R
500|$|Leaving Pacific Springs, {{the trail}} moves {{southwest}} alongside Pacific Creek {{for a short}} distance until it swoops to the west to intersect Dry Sandy creek, a small stream that is a tributary of <b>the</b> Little <b>Sandy</b> River which in turn flows into <b>the</b> Big <b>Sandy</b> River. True to its name, the water level on <b>the</b> Dry <b>Sandy</b> varied depending {{on the time of}} year and was often dry. South of <b>the</b> Dry <b>Sandy</b> ford, <b>the</b> trail split into two major sections, the main route which continues south to Fort Bridger, and the Sublette cutoff, which proceeds west directly to the Green River and Bear River valleys, bypassing Fort Bridger. The point at which the trails diverge is known as Parting of the Ways. [...] south the main trail fords <b>the</b> Little <b>Sandy.</b> Here, a secondary path to the Sublette cutoff leads from <b>the</b> Little <b>Sandy</b> Pony Express station that was based here during the emigration period. The main trail goes on to ford <b>the</b> Big <b>Sandy</b> near <b>the</b> present day town of Farson. The trail proceeds along the northern side of <b>the</b> Big <b>Sandy</b> to its confluence with the Green River. Fording the Green River was very risky, so most travelers used {{one of a number of}} ferries operating on the Green River, including the Lombard Ferry and the Robinson Ferry.|$|R
5|$|The soils of {{the islands}} reflect the diverse geology. Bute has the most {{productive}} land, and a pattern of deposits that {{is typical of the}} southwest of Scotland. There is a mixture of boulder clay and other glacial deposits in the eroded valleys, and raised beach and marine deposits elsewhere, especially to the south and west which result in a machair landscape in places, inland from <b>the</b> <b>sandy</b> bays, such as Stravanan.|$|E
5|$|To {{force the}} Ojibwa to comply, the {{subagent}} Watrous {{announced he would}} pay future annuities only at Sandy Lake, Minnesota instead of La Pointe, {{where they had been}} paid previously. This change resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Sandy</b> Lake Tragedy, when hundreds of Ojibwas starved or died of exposure in Minnesota and on the journey home because the promised annuity supplies were late, contaminated or inadequate.|$|E
5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for food in <b>the</b> <b>sandy</b> sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting {{that it is a}} fairly recent innovation.|$|E
5000|$|As this occurred, {{the initial}} {{element of the}} rescue force—a pair of A-1E [...] "Sandies"—arrived to locate the {{position}} of the downed crewmen before calling in the waiting HH-53 Jolly Green helicopters orbiting at a holding point over Laos. Thorsness, with only 500 rounds of ammunition left, turned back from the tanker to fly RESCAP (rescue combat air patrol) for <b>the</b> <b>Sandies</b> and update them on the situation and terrain. As Thorsness approached the area, briefing <b>the</b> <b>Sandies,</b> he spotted MiG-17s in a wagon wheel orbit around him and attacked, probably destroying another that flew across his path.|$|R

5|$|Adjacent to the Columbia Slough basin are the {{watersheds}} of <b>the</b> <b>Sandy</b> River to the east, Johnson Creek to {{the south}}, the Willamette {{to the south}} and west, and the Columbia to the north. Lying slightly north of the watershed, large islands in the Columbia River include, from east to west, McGuire Island, Government Island, Lemon Island, and Tomahawk Island, which is connected to Hayden Island. Bordered by the Columbia and two arms of the Willamette, Sauvie Island lies just west of the mouth of the slough.|$|E
5|$|Although Carmarthenshire is less frequented as {{a tourist}} {{destination}} than some other counties in Wales, it offers {{a wide range of}} outdoor activities. Much of the coast is fairly flat; it includes the Millennium Coastal Park, which extends for ten miles to the west of Llanelli; the National Wetlands Centre; a championship golf course; and the harbours of Burry Port and Pembrey. Further west are <b>the</b> <b>sandy</b> beaches at Llansteffan and Pendine, and Dylan Thomas' boathouse at Laugharne. Further inland {{there are a number of}} medieval castles, hillforts and standing stones.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the rocks}} beneath the city {{contained}} a vast reservoir of fresh water, {{known as the}} Trarza Lake, it is running out, owing to the large growth of the city. Engineers have warned it could run out by 2054, since it is not rain-fed, and is therefore non-renewable. The problem is particularly bad in <b>the</b> <b>sandy</b> shanty towns {{where the majority of}} the population lives. Many people already have to buy water, which is expensive compared with the average wage.|$|E
