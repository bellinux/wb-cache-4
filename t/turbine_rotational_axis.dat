40|$|Because {{ocean wave}} propagates along water surface, wave energy {{resource}} {{is measured in}} the unit of line density (kW/m). It indicates that the output of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) is proportional to its wave front width {{when we consider the}} scaling-up of the device. It will be a problem in the commercialization of a scaled-up WEC because the cost of device increases with size in a higher pace. With the above consideration, the authors proposed a rotary type wave energy converter. It is a drag type vertical axis water <b>turbine</b> with its <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> lying horizontally on the water surface and in parallel to the wave front. To capture the orbital fluid particle motion in wave, the turbine is composed of a bucket and a streamlined counter weight. The device can be linearly extended in the direction parallel to the wave front to obtain the merits of scale. The WEC does not have massive components because the reaction torque of electric generation can be absorbed by a relatively small float system. This paper provides the numerical test of the device in deep water wave condition. The dependencies of the output to the wave height and the submergence of the <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> are checked by the two-dimensional flow simulation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstruct- We {{describe}} {{a method for}} the visual control of a robotic system which {{does not require the}} formulation of an explicit calibration between image coordinates and the world coordinates. Calibration is known to be a difficult and error prone process. By extracting control information directly from the image, we free our technique from the errors normally associated with a fixed calibration. We attach a camera system to a robot such that the camera system and the robot’s gripper rotate simultaneously. As the camera system rotates about the gripper’s <b>rotational</b> <b>axis,</b> the circular path traced out by a point-like feature projects to an elliptical path in image space. We gather the projected feature points over part of a rotation and fit the gathered data to an ellipse. The distance from the <b>rotational</b> <b>axis</b> to the feature point in world space is proportional {{to the size of the}} generated ellipse.
