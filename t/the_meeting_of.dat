50|$|In a few poleis the ekklesiasterion was a {{separate}} building, {{but in many}} cases the theater was used for both performances and <b>the</b> <b>meetings</b> <b>of</b> ekklesia.

5|$|As the eruptions continued, {{they became}} {{concentrated}} at one vent along the fissure {{and began to}} build the island into a more circular shape. By 24 November, the island measured about 900metres by 650metres (2950 by 2130ft). The violent explosions caused by <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> lava and sea water meant that the island consisted of a loose pile of volcanic rock (scoria), which was eroded rapidly by North Atlantic storms during the winter. However, eruptions more than kept pace with wave erosion, and by February 1964, the island had a maximum diameter of over 1300metres (4265ft).|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Palace of Westminster and the Tower of London {{were the}} main residences of the English Sovereign until Henry VIII {{acquired}} the Palace of Whitehall. Whitehall was destroyed by fire in 1698, leading to a shift to St James's Palace. Although replaced as the monarch's primary London residence by Buckingham Palace in 1837, St James's is still the senior palace and remains the ceremonial Royal residence. For example, foreign ambassadors are accredited to the Court of St James's, and the Palace {{is the site of}} <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> the Accession Council.

He preferred to dress in white, and it was noted that his garments were much cleaner than those of his men, although he had a lot in common with his warriors.

5|$|After his cathedral {{church was}} burned down in 1114, Luffa managed to secure King Henry I's {{financial}} help in rebuilding the church. Besides the rebuilding, Luffa built a Lady chapel, which still remains. Other work still extant {{in the cathedral}} are the arcades, the exteriors of the clerestory and those galleries that are unvaulted. The art historian George Zarnecki {{has argued that the}} rood screen in the cathedral also dates from Luffa's episcopate. Two panels from this work still survive, and depict <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> Jesus with Mary and Martha at Bethany as well as the miracle where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. The scenes show some resemblance to works in Hildesheim and Cologne, and this resemblance may mean that Luffa was from Germany, or hired sculptors from there.|$|E
5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, {{who was on the}} lookout for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> the railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as a civil engineer, Lemoine wrote a {{treatise}} concerning compass and straightedge constructions entitled, La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which he considered his greatest work, {{despite the fact that}} it was not well-received critically. The original title was De la mesure de la simplicité dans les sciences mathématiques, and the original idea for the text would have discussed the concepts Lemoine devised as concerning the entirety of mathematics. Time constraints, however, limited the scope of the paper. Instead of the original idea, Lemoine proposed a simplification of the construction process to a number of basic operations with the compass and straightedge. He presented this paper at a meeting of the Association Française in Oran, Algeria in 1888. The paper, however, did not garner much enthusiasm or interest among the mathematicians gathered there. Lemoine published several other papers on his construction system that same year, including Sur la mesure de la simplicité dans les constructions géométriques in the Comptes rendus of the Académie française. He published additional papers on the subject in Mathesis (1888), Journal des mathématiques élémentaires (1889), Nouvelles annales de mathématiques (1892), and the self-published La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which was presented at <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> the Association Française in Pau (1892), and again at Besançon (1893) and Caen (1894).|$|E
