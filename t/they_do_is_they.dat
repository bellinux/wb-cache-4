5000|$|Universal Display's Sid Rosenblatt {{talking about}} the future of OLED {{technology}} was quoted as saying: [...] "Samsung is going to introduce flexible screens, but the flexible plastic substrates are difficult to manufacture. Plastic is porous and oxygen with moisture causes OLEDs to degrade. However...These kind of displays are unbreakable, flexible on stainless steel foil. It would result in a thinner device because you don’t have the pieces of glass. It could conform around the sides, so you can show information on the sides. It would be lighter. So you can either make it smaller or thinner or you can make a larger battery so that it lasts longer. The challenges are encapsulation, so you need an encapsulation process. The temperature is too high to deposit them directly to the plastic, so <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> literally deposit them on glass." [...] Further SID Rosenblatt thinks that flexible OLEDs will be initially a niche market for the high end.|$|E

The band had never released a live video in the career. The Denver show was chosen to be filmed due to considerations such as fanbase, venue size, and the fact that Garbage were headlining. Butch Vig later explained, [...] "It's a very honest representation of what we sound like live. As a producer, I've seen a lot of bands release live DVDs and what <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> go back in the studio and re-record everything and make it sound perfect. We did not do that. We left it very pure. It's what we sound like live. You hear little mistakes and things in the set that happen any night because it's a live environment." [...] Vig added that the band felt that doing a show with lasers and special effects, or special guest vocalists would misrepresent the band: [...] "It's just Garbage on stage playing our songs. That's the DVD we wanted to put out." [...] Garbage also shot backstage documentary footage, as well as recorded audio from various shows across the tour, however this was not used on One Mile High...live.|$|E

After the fight, UFC president Dana White said he would no longer offer Nogueira fights, effectively ending his UFC career. White also indicated that he would instead offer Nogueira a position within the company. In turn, Nogueira confirmed his intention to retire.|$|E

[2000] P 09. A work of architecture does not begin at the physical boundaries of site as it ultimately looks as if, but it takes much more to complete its process mainly in architects mind. He produces sketches, drawings, models or some times a virtual space, in computers. What <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> resemble the real object they portray it in a visual way. That is why designing has become professionalized and creative process as opposed to "Making" or "Building". Designers manipulate the actual solution, rather in some iconic representation of it usually in the from of drawings or models. The whole purpose sketches or models is {{to act as a}} kind of additional memory store spatial ideas, which can then be evaluated and manipulated. One would see as the drawings, sketches, models, and computer generated animations primarily meant to convey design idea to clients or to the members involve in the design process. Then they can be identified as communicative tools. But the word communication by its definition is not simply to convey ideas, but it is exchange of meanings between individuals through a common system of symbols. "It is clear then that designers do not just use drawings to communicate with clients, builders or legislators. Drawings are {{an essential part of the}} design process itself. "Lawson [1994]P. 171 "The designer then is always working with some sort of mental image of the reality of his designs. Until the building or object is constructed no one really knows just what it will be like to live in, look at or hold. The designer tries to create and manipulate his own "reality" and may use drawings and models to help in this process. However the designer's mental image usually contains many qualitative ideas too nebulous for iconic representation. These ideas are often expressed as symbolic images, and although these symbolic images are undoubtedly essential to the designer he can easily become trapped by his own illusion.

40|$|Storing fruits Cue: While fruits taste {{great and}} are easiest to eat {{when they are}} ripe, it?s not always {{possible}} to eat fruits throughout the year. When there is drought for example, some fruit trees will not blossom. But there are ways of preserving the fruits so that {{during the dry season}} they can still be enjoyed. In this interview forest office Wyson Banda speaks to Excello Zidana in Malawi. Mr Banda explains how communities can make sure that they have delicious fruit all year round. IN:	?There are so many advantages? OUT:	?Very much so. ? DUR?N:	 1 ? 40 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Excello Zidana in Malawi talking to forest officer Wyson Banda. Why not try drying the fruits in the sun, or preserving them in a powdered form and adding water later? The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Banda	There are so many advantages because you see people enjoy fruit in Malawi, fruits are just very common here, like masuku; marula. Usually what they do is to dry or season some of the fruits, they dry them, there is time when they also go out of season. Then during off-season, what they do is to soak them in the water, then enjoy the water by putting porridge, they still enjoy the fruits during that time. Zidana	What containers do they use to store what you have just talked about? Banda	The containers are just locally found their villages, like baskets. Zidana	Now let?s go to the actual extraction of the juice that is to be stored. How do they do it locally? Banda	What <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> pound them in the mortar, the traditional mortars, after pounding them they dry them in the sun. Then the day after they store them while dry. But when they want to use it, when those things are off-season, they just soak them in water, or cook porridge from that water. Zidana	When they are trying to store fruits, they pound them. Do they keep them in the powder form or what? Banda	Some are kept in powder from but some are just dried as they are, then when soaked, they just extract water from them. Zidana	And you have an idea that people enjoy indigenous fruit trees? Banda	Yes for sure yes, they are really enjoying the indigenous fruits. Zidana	Are they nutritious? Banda	Very much so.

40|$|Drying and {{preserving}} meat Cue: When it?s available, fresh meat is a delicacy. But in some areas, dried meat is a delicacy too. In Cameroon, Martha Chindong {{went to the}} Ministry of Secondary Education to ask Chofor Ndimofor for some tips on drying meat. Smoking and drying meat has been done for centuries ? it?s {{one of the oldest}} kinds of preservation. But, there are health concerns related to drying meat. As usual, preparation and washing {{needs to be done in}} a clean area, and boiled water should be used. And different kinds of meat will require different drying times and storage periods. But why dry meat at all? Martha Chindong finds out. IN:	?Well basically there are two reasons? OUT:	?when meat will be scarce. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 53 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Martha Chindong speaking to Chofor Ndimofor of the Ministry of Secondary Education in Cameroon. It is always best to seek advice about how long it is safe to dry your meat or fish. If it decays, it can cause serious illness. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Ndimofor	Well basically there are two reasons. The first reason is that when meat is dried it is properly preserved and secondly it is a way of improving the taste of the meat. People consider dry meat as a delicacy. Chindong	So which type of meat or fish are also best to dry? Ndimofor	Well, as you see presently, I am in the process of drying a rabbit. Chindong	What of fish? Ndimofor	Yes fish, all kinds of fish can be dried, especially fish that is not too oily and which does not have a lot of water. We are thinking of fish like mackerel. Chindong	So how do you just get started?Just describe one, how you get started with at least one? Maybe this here rabbit which I see in front of you? Ndimofor	All right, in order to dry a rabbit, the first thing is you select a healthy rabbit, one that is not lean, one that is in good health. You kill it, you skin it and then you open it up. You actually open it up in such a way that it is spread out and you can use pieces of stick to get it well spread out so that it remains in shape. And then you salt it with brine; that is you put some salt in water and steep it in it for a while. You hang it out or you expose it in the sun to drip a little then you put it over the fire as you see me doing. Chindong	So is that the same process you do for meat and fish? Ndimofor	No, for meat you have to choose meat that does not have too much fat because too much fat will not enhance the drying process. Then the meat should be lean, it should not have too much fat and the best way is for you to slice it into strands. When you slice it into strands you treat it with brine in the same way. Sometimes in order to give added flavour you might like to spice it with other ingredients, maybe curry, maybe ginger then you hang it out to drip and then you put the strands either over a grill or you hang them from a hook or a rope over a fire, a smoke fire. Chindong	Smoke fire like what we are seeing? Ndimofor	Yes, what we are seeing, we are using the grill now. There is fire under the grill, not burning into flames but only producing the smoke and heat that go up to dehydrate the meat and after some three or four hours the meat is well dehydrated and now you only leave it for sometime to get properly dried. Chindong	Is it within the reach of smallscale farmers living in the villages? Ndimofor	Yes, I think it is within the reach of smallscale farmers. I say it is within their reach because the materials are not expensive. Chindong	So you have constructed it with what type of material? Ndimofor	Burnt bricks and then he will need to have a good piece of grill which cannot be rusted. The best one within the reach of the people in the rural areas is the traditional everyday fire with which they prepare their meals. What <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> prepare their meat or whatever animal they have to smoke or dry and just hang it over the fireplace. Chindong	So, Mr Chofor Ndimofor, this meat that you have dried can keep for how long? Ndimofor	Ah, it depends. If you really want the meat to keep for long it should be properly dehydrated. The only things is that you should avoid during that time, you should avoid it coming into contact with moisture. Chindong	When it comes in contact with moisture can it be contaminated? Ndimofor	Oh yes, when it comes in contact with moisture you know especially in rural areas there is this tendency that it can fall out of the containers and when it falls out of the containers onto the ground it can pick up dirt and germs and all kinds of things. When dry meat gets into contact with moisture maggots tend to infest it and it will reduce the quality and also the look of it and nobody would really like to eat it. Chindong	What advice do you have for farmers? What message do you have for people who are interested in drying meat? Ndimofor	Yes what I have to say is, you know in the first place why do we dry meat? We dry meat because there are certain seasons when you have abundance of meat. Use that opportunity to dry the meat and preserve it for when meat will be scarce. End of trackHow to get the most from your mea...|$|E
