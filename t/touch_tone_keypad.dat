40|$|Direction Assistance is an {{interactive}} program that provides spoken directions for automobile travel within the Boston area. The program has a telephone interface which uses <b>touch</b> <b>tone</b> <b>keypad</b> input and synthetic speech output. Routes are both short and easily followed. The directions {{are given in}} fluent English. The program has successfully directed newcomers through Boston. This paper tells how we built Direction Assistance, with emphasis on how the available databases are and are not useful for this application. It also talks about automatic generation of route descriptions, and compares our work to that of others. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the user interface to Direction Assistance, a program which provides high quality directions for driving between two {{points in the}} Boston area. The interface employs synthetic speech and touch tone input {{to provide access to}} telephone callers. The interface is able to diagnose common user errors and explain itself to the user. This paper also discussea some of the problems of synthetic speech for this type of interface. The most significant limitation of presently available speech synthehers is the lack of ability to specify prosodic features. ' Direct ion Assistance Direction Assistance [3] is an program that provides directions for automobile travel within the Boston area. The program has a detailed street map covering about 11 square miles, with about 279 miles of streets, including bridges, tunnels, and one way streets. A routing algorithm produces routes that are both short and simple. A text generation program provides natural language descriptions of these routes. A graphics interface displays routes on a map. The task of the voice interface is to make this power available to naive users through the telephone, by using synthetic speech and and <b>touch</b> <b>tone</b> <b>keypad...</b>|$|E
