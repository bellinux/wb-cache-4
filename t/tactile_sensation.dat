Collagen decreases, and <b>tactile</b> <b>sensation</b> increases. The skin becomes softer, {{more susceptible to}} tearing and irritation from scratching or shaving, and slightly lighter in color because of a slight decrease in melanin.|$|E
25|$|The body schema {{represents}} both {{position and}} {{configuration of the}} body as a 3-dimensional object in space. A combination of sensory information, primarily tactile and visual, contributes to {{the representation of the}} limbs in space. This integration allows for stimuli to be localized in external space with respect to the body. An example by Haggard and Wolpert shows the combination of <b>tactile</b> <b>sensation</b> of the hand with information about the joint angles of the arm, which allow for rapid movements of said arm to swat a fly.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} many {{contributing}} factors and risks associated with strokes, {{there are very few}} associated with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome and thalamic lesions specifically. In general, strokes damage one hemisphere of the brain, which can include the thalamus. The thalamus is generally believed to relay sensory information between a variety of subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. It is known that sensory information from environmental stimuli travels to the thalamus for processing and then to the somatosensory cortex for interpretation. The final product of this communication is the ability to see, hear or feel something as interpreted by the brain. Dejerine–Roussy syndrome most often compromises <b>tactile</b> <b>sensation.</b> Therefore, the damage in the thalamus causes miscommunication between the afferent pathway and the cortex of the brain, changing what or how one feels. The change could be an incorrect sensation experienced, or inappropriate amplification or dulling of a sensation. Because the brain is considered plastic and each individual's brain is different, {{it is almost impossible to}} know how a sensation will be changed without brain mapping and individual consultation.|$|E

25|$|Back at Westlake's lab, Dr. Westlake is {{conducting}} an experiment {{when the lights}} go out. Dr. Westlake and his assistant Yakatito, are astounded to find the synthetic skin is stable after 100 minutes. Westlake deduces that the synthetic skin is photosensitive. Their joy is short lived, when Durant and his crew show up and demand the Bellasarious Memorandum, which Westlake knows nothing about. While searching for the document, Durant and his gang kill Yakatito. They proceed to beat Westlake, burn his hands and dip his face in acid. After they find the document, they rig the lab to explode- leaving Julie to watch the explosion. The blast throws Westlake through the roof, into the river. Thought to be dead, he survives but is hideously burned. He is brought to a hospital and subjected to a radical treatment which cuts the nerves of the spinothalamic tract, so physical pain is no longer felt. However, he also loses his <b>tactile</b> <b>sensation.</b> The loss of this sensory input gives him enhanced strength due to adrenal overload and keeps his injuries from incapacitating him, but its absence also mentally destabilizes him.|$|E
60|$|The {{foregoing}} reasoning {{will be in}} no way affected, if, {{instead of}} pricking the finger, {{the point of the}} pin rests gently against it, so as to give rise merely to a <b>tactile</b> <b>sensation.</b> The <b>tactile</b> <b>sensation</b> is referred outwards to the point touched, and seems to exist there. But it is certain that it is not and cannot be there really, because the brain is the sole seat of consciousness; and, further, because evidence, as strong as that in favour of the sensation being in the finger, can be brought forward in support of propositions which are manifestly absurd.|$|E
6000|$|Yet {{another source}} of {{difficulty}} in clearly understanding Berkeley arises out of {{his use of the}} word [...] "outness." [...] In speaking of touch he seems to employ it indifferently, both for the localization of a <b>tactile</b> <b>sensation</b> in the sensory surface, which we really obtain through touch; and for the notion of corporeal separation, which is attained by the association of muscular and tactile sensations. In speaking of sight, on the other hand, Berkeley employs [...] "outness" [...] to denote corporeal separation.|$|E
60|$|A little {{attention}} {{will show that}} this sense of effort accompanies every muscular contraction by which the limbs, or {{other parts of the}} body, are moved. By its agency the fact of their movement is known; while the direction of the motion is given by the accompanying <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations.</b> And, in consequence of the incessant association of the muscular and the <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations,</b> they become so fused together that they are often confounded tinder the same name.|$|R

60|$|For example, {{the hairs}} and nails are utterly devoid of sensibility, as {{everyone}} knows. Nevertheless, if {{the ends of}} the nails or hairs are touched, ever so lightly, we feel that they are touched, and the sensation seems to be situated in the nails or hairs. Nay more, if a walking-stick a yard long is held firmly by the handle and the other end is touched, the <b>tactile</b> <b>sensation,</b> which is a state of our own consciousness, is unhesitatingly referred {{to the end of the}} stick; and yet no one will say that it is there.|$|E
6000|$|Nor is it {{possible}} that the idea of outness (in the sense of discontinuity with the sentient body) could be attained by such a person; for, as we have seen, every <b>tactile</b> <b>sensation</b> is referred to a point either of the natural sensory surface itself, or of some solid in continuity with that surface. Hence it would appear that the conception of the difference between the Ego and the non-Ego could not be attained by a man thus situated. His feelings would be his universe, and his tactile sensations his [...] "moenia mundi." [...] Time would exist for him as for us, but space would have only two dimensions.|$|E
60|$|For example, I get {{the ideas}} of co-existence, of number, of distance, and of {{relative}} place or direction. But all these ideas are ideas of relations, and imply the existence of something which perceives those relations. If a <b>tactile</b> <b>sensation</b> {{is a state of}} the mind, and if the localization of that sensation is an act of the mind, how is it conceivable that a relation between two localized sensations should exist apart from the mind? It is, I confess, quite as easy for me to imagine that redness may exist apart from a visual sense, as it is to suppose that co-existence, number, and distance can have any existence apart from the mind of which they are ideas.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—REV {{technology}} {{uses the}} mechanism of Reverse Electro Vibration, hence the name REV. It is an augmented reality technology. Augmented Reality has come along a long way. Many innovations {{have been made in}} this field. But most of these are restricted to a particular type of usage since they make use of actuators, which are mechanisms for controlling the environment. REV, on the other hand, is a tactile technology which gives the user an enhanced touch of real world objects by augmenting them with virtual <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations</b> using a device which the user will wear. It bridges the gap between the real and virtual world. According to this, we inject a weak electrical signal on the user’s body, which creates an electrical oscillating field around the user’s fingers. When the user slides his or her fingers around the object, the user experiences distinct textures after augmenting the physical object. The properties of the signal can be varied by programming to provide a wide range of <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations.</b> REV, thus, manipulates the user's <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations</b> and enhances the sense of touch...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Failure {{in proper}} design of {{ergonomic}} hand tools {{can lead to}} the prevalence of hand-related injuries. In order to improve the ergonomics of hand tools, numerous studies have been done on causal factors related to these injuries such as grip postures, grip forces and torque directions. Nevertheless, there appears to be limited studies concerning how pinch effort can change with different types of <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations.</b> Therefore this study aims {{to determine the effects of}} different <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations</b> on pinch effort. A total of 110 manual workers from the wooden pallets and furniture manufacturing firm participated in the study. The descriptive analyses were conducted in Microsoft Excel 2010 and the reliability of data was verified using Cronbach's alpha reliability analyses. The results show that individuals can produce a greater pinch effort while gripping objects that have a high friction coefficient between the fingers and the grip surface. This study improves our understanding on the implications of different <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations</b> and potentially decreases workplace hazards for eventual improvements on safety, health and medical costs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A novel micro-vibration {{actuator}} using a shape-memory alloy for {{the presentation}} of various <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations</b> to a human skin is introduced in this paper. The authors {{paid attention to the}} characteristics of a shape-memory alloy formed into a thread, which changes its length according to its temperature, and developed a vibration-generating actuator electrically driven by periodic signals generated by current control circuits. For the tactile information transmission to a human body, the human higher-level perception such as the phantom sensation and the apparent movement of the tactility is employed in consideration of presenting novel <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations.</b> By coupling the actuators as a pair, an information transmission is realized for presenting novel <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations</b> to a user. The information transmission was tested by changing various conditions of electric signals to drive actuators, and was evaluated by questionnaires. Several users reported that they perceived a novel rubbing sensation given by the apparent movement, and we further experimented {{the presentation of}} the sensation in detail {{to be used as a}} tactile display for the information transmission through our body...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new tactile display device (Stimulator of Tactile Receptors by Skin Stretch or STReSS) exploiting lateral skin {{stretch of the}} fingertip to create <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations.</b> The device consists of an array of one hundred piezoelectric bending actuators applying local strain patterns on the user's fingertip. It was found that manufacturing the piezoelectric material in a comb shape facilitates the device's fabrication process, allows for a spatial resolution of one actuator per mm 2, and guarantees high structural strength for the display. Simple but creative electronics drive the system at a 700 Hz refresh rate and keep the device compact and portable. The tactile display's manufacturing process and the controlling electronics are described. Finally, some <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations</b> experienced with the display are reported informally...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper focuses {{upon the}} {{research}} and development of a prototype dental simulator for training of periodontal procedures. By the use of virtual reality and haptics technology, the periodontal simulator allows trainees to learn performing diagnosis and treatment of periodontal diseases by visualizing a three-dimensional virtual human mouth and feeling real <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations</b> while touching the surface of teeth, gingiva, and calculi with virtual dental instruments. Since periodontics requires dentists to depend primarily on <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations</b> to per-form diagnostic and surgical procedures, the use of haptics is unquestionably crucial for a realistic periodontal simu-lator. The haptics-based virtual reality periodontal training simulator has been validated by a experiment conducted by the College of Dentistry at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) with faculty members and dental students, which demonstrates the scientific contribution and usefulness of the simulator as {{a vital part of the}} curriculum of the Department of Periodontics at UIC...|$|R
40|$|This {{review is}} aimed at giving an {{overview}} of the current state of knowledge of nonvolatile molecules with sensory activity in wine. For this purpose, nonvolatile molecules with known sensory properties are reported and their ability to impact or alter the taste and <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations</b> has been discussed. Then, the importance of sensory interactions in wine is highlighted. Finally, the techniques developed with the aim of detecting nonvolatile sensory-active molecules involved in wine taste or <b>tactile</b> <b>sensations</b> are reviewed. More research should be carried out for determining the real sensory impact of nonvolatiles in global flavor properties; as such, more strategies in both analytical and sensory analyses should be developed. The subsequent steps in relating instrumental data to sensory perception would involve sensory analysis, threshold analysis, and the use of model systems or the addition of a suspected nonvolatile compound with sensory activity directly to the wine. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
