5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest barrier island on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a barrier island but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half barrier island. The north end of the island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a barrier island that appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked <b>tidal</b> <b>marsh,</b> separates the two halves of the island.|$|E
5|$|Like most of Southern California, the {{majority}} of San Diego's current area was originally occupied by chaparral, a plant community made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs. The endangered Torrey pine has the bulk of its population in San Diego in a stretch of protected chaparral along the coast. The steep and varied topography and proximity to the ocean create {{a number of different}} habitats within the city limits, including <b>tidal</b> <b>marsh</b> and canyons. The chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone to wildfire, and the rates of fire have increased in the 20th century, due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1930s, Moses {{oversaw the}} {{conversion}} of a vast Queens <b>tidal</b> <b>marsh</b> garbage dump into the fairgrounds that hosted the 1939/1940 World's Fair. Called Flushing Meadows Park, it was Moses' grandest park scheme. He envisioned this vast park, comprising some 1,300acres(5km2) of land, easily accessible from Manhattan, as a major recreational playground for New Yorkers. When the 1939/1940 World's Fair ended in financial failure, Moses {{did not have the}} available funds to complete work on his project.

25|$|Recently, it {{has become}} widely {{accepted}} that late Holocene, 3,000 calendar years ago to present, sea level was nearly stable prior to an acceleration of rate of rise that is variously dated between 1850 and 1900 AD. Late Holocene rates of sea level rise have been estimated using evidence from archaeological sites and late Holocene <b>tidal</b> <b>marsh</b> sediments, combined with tide gauge and satellite records and geophysical modeling. For example, this research included studies of Roman wells in Caesarea and of Roman piscinae in Italy. These methods in combination suggest a mean eustatic component of 0.07mm/yr for the last 2000 years.|$|E
25|$|A {{salt marsh}} or saltmarsh, {{also known as}} a coastal salt marsh or a <b>tidal</b> <b>marsh,</b> is a coastal {{ecosystem}} in the upper coastal intertidal zone between land and open saltwater or brackish water that is regularly flooded by the tides. It is dominated by dense stands of salt-tolerant plants such as herbs, grasses, or low shrubs. These plants are terrestrial in origin and are essential to the stability of the salt marsh in trapping and binding sediments. Salt marshes play a large role in the aquatic food web and the delivery of nutrients to coastal waters. They also support terrestrial animals and provide coastal protection.|$|E
40|$|The <b>tidal</b> <b>marshes</b> {{along the}} Scheldt estuary are rather unique in Europe, because they still exist along the {{complete}} salinity gradient. Key ecological factors for the vegetation are salinity, tidal regime and current and historical management. A general portrait {{with the most}} characterising plant species {{as well as a}} succession scheme are presented for salt, brackish and fresh <b>tidal</b> <b>marshes</b> separately, because they have few plant species and vegetation types in common. Tidal regime changes as a combined effect of sea level rise and the channel deepening in the Westerscheldt. This affects the marsh vegetation. Biodiversity patterns and factors affecting the distribution of species on the <b>tidal</b> <b>marshes</b> are discussed for plants, gastropodes, arthropodes and birds. In general the number of species on the <b>tidal</b> <b>marshes</b> increases from salt to fresh water and from higher to lower inundation frequencies. However salt and brackish marshes accommodate relatively more specific, rare and vulnerable species. Faunal communities are much less known and understood as compared to vegetation and need more integrated monitoring...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to carbon, other nutrients are deposited and recycled in coastal salt marshes.

25|$|Prior {{to human}} development, Flushing Meadows was {{originally}} a <b>tidal</b> <b>marsh,</b> with Flushing Creek receiving south-flowing waters from the tides of Flushing Bay. Although the lakes were built as freshwater lakes and dammed to mitigate tidal effects, flooding continues {{to effect the}} park. The lakes are also highly eutrophic, due to nutrients such as phosphorus from the former marshland seeping into the water, leading {{to the death of}} fish in the lakes. The regular tidal action that would filter the lakes is prevented by the dam. In addition, the lakes are subject to pollution and storm runoff from the nearby highways, via pipes which feed into the lakes.|$|E
25|$|The refuge {{has five}} varied habitats: {{freshwater}} <b>tidal</b> <b>marsh,</b> impounded water, woods, meadow and field. The diversity of such habitats {{in such a}} concentrated area make it a natural magnet for all forms of wildlife. In addition to the above-mentioned there are {{a wide variety of}} fish species that can be found in both, Darby Creek, the lifeblood of Tinicum Marsh, as well as the 145 acre (0.6km2) impoundment and the smaller, Hoy's Pond. They include brown bullhead, channel catfish, crappie, carp and small striped bass that utilize the wider expanses of Darby Creek, just before its confluence with the Delaware River, in the earlier stages of their development. The fields and meadows provide open areas where wide arrays of insects including several species of butterflies can be found foraging the dozens of species of wildflowers.|$|E

500|$|Before 1900, East Matagorda Bay was a {{free flowing}} extension, which formed the eastern segment of Matagorda Bay. Flooding and {{drainage}} issues caused by the Colorado River, {{which at the time}} emptied into the bay, precipitated a massive dredging campaign in the 1920s. Flooding was not remedied by the dredging, as sediment deposited in the bay and formed a <b>tidal</b> <b>marsh</b> that grew at [...] a year. As a result, local citizens decided to change the course of the Colorado River in 1934 to bypass Matagorda Bay into the Gulf of Mexico, the dredging from this project causing the split and forming the isolated East Matagorda Bay.

40|$|<b>Tidal</b> <b>marshes</b> {{have high}} {{sediment}} surface areas, promoting processes affecting nutrient speciation, transformation and retention. In this project we performed whole-ecosystem 15 NH 4 + tracer addition experiments {{to quantify the}} fate and transport of ammonium through a <b>tidal</b> freshwater <b>marsh.</b> Combined with a mass-balance study, this approach allowed a simultaneous examination of transport and processing of nitrogen. We also performed additional studies on Si cycling in parallel to the N-labeling experiment. Our work shows that the large reactive surface of the <b>tidal</b> freshwater <b>marsh</b> vegetation is crucial for nitrogen transformation and assimilation. It clearly revealed the dominant role of microbes in initial nitrogen retention in marsh ecosystems. Parallel study of silica cycling revealed that <b>tidal</b> <b>marshes</b> act as biogenic Si recycling surfaces, importing biogenic Si while exporting dissolved Si. Export of dissolved Si is greatest during summer and spring, when dissolved Si concentrations in inundating waters are depleted by diatoms. <b>Tidal</b> <b>marshes</b> thus buffer estuarine dissolved Si in times of limitation. We can conclude that the studied marsh had an increasing effect on the Si:N ratio in flooding waters. Export of DSi and import of total dissolved nitrogen (DIN) contributed about equally to the increase of the Si:N ratio...|$|R
40|$|Salt marshes form true ecotones between {{land and}} sea fauna and flora that have adapted to an {{environment}} that is both aquatic and terrestrial in nature. Despite the extreme and sharp gradients that exist in salt marshes, they form the temporary or permanent home for many animals and plants and they fulfil many important roles in marine and estuarine ecosystems. While research on the terrestrial component of European marshes has helped in their management, knowledge of the aquatic component has largely been ignored in safeguarding the existence and ecological importance of <b>tidal</b> <b>marshes.</b> This situation is in sharp contrast with studies of coastal marshes along the eastern and southeastern coasts of North America. The typical European salt marsh differs in several physical aspects from the typical American salt marsh, but recent investigations have indicated parallels regarding nekton habitat usage. The present paper reviews the current state of European studies on the habitat role that <b>tidal</b> <b>marshes</b> play for fish and crustacean fauna. Mirrored against the more extensive American literature, we discuss where functional similarities and differences exist between both types of <b>tidal</b> <b>marshes</b> and where further knowledge is still needed for European marshes.

500|$|Until the mid-1600s, much of {{the area}} now known as Cley Marshes {{was part of a}} vast <b>tidal</b> <b>marsh</b> and was covered by {{seawater}} twice a day. The shoreline itself was hundreds of metres north of its present location. The raised area in the north-west corner, called the [...] "Eye", has been farmed since the earliest human habitation. It was 28ha (70acres) in extent in 1651, but is now much reduced by coastal erosion. Access to the Eye was by an ancient causeway, passable at low tide. John Heydon started the process of embanking the marshes to reclaim the land in 1522, and his banks were extended and improved by Dutchman Jan van Hasedunch from 1630. Simon Britiff, Lord of the local Manor of Cley, completed the scheme by building the bank {{on the east side of}} the Cley channel. Only the east and west banks have survived; the north bank was breached by the sea in 1897, then rebuilt with a concrete facing, but abandoned after another bad storm in 1921.|$|E

40|$|A {{consortium}} of DHV, Imares and Alle Hosper proposed the reclamation of <b>tidal</b> <b>marshes</b> {{in front of}} the Afsluitdijk.
