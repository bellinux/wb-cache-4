40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{acceptable}} quality level under which quality characteristics {{have a normal}} probability distribution with an unknown location parameter. <b>The</b> traditional <b>cumulative</b> sum depends on the unknown parameter, and hence can not be used. Replacing the unknown parameter by its estimator yields <b>the</b> estimated <b>cumulative</b> sum, but <b>the</b> replacement clearly affects the behavior under the acceptable quality level. To overcome this problem, <b>the</b> innovation <b>cumulative</b> sum is proposed. <b>The</b> innovation <b>cumulative</b> sum performs at least as good as <b>the</b> estimated <b>cumulative</b> sum under a linear trend rejectable quality level, and clearly performs better for a rejectable quality level with the change point occurring in the first 70 percent of the sample. Finally, the definition of <b>the</b> innovation <b>cumulative</b> sum is extended for acceptable quality levels involving quality characteristics having a nonnormal distribution.

5|$|In statistics, maximum spacing {{estimation}} (MSE or MSP), or maximum {{product of}} spacing estimation (MPS), {{is a method}} for estimating the parameters of a univariate statistical model.

5|$|From 1972 to 2006, {{dramatic}} reductions {{continued in}} the number of feral honey bees in the U.S. and a significant though somewhat gradual decline {{in the number of}} colonies maintained by beekeepers.

However, in late 2006 and early 2007, the rate of attrition was alleged to have reached new proportions, and people began to use the term colony collapse disorder to describe this sudden rash of disappearances (or sometimes spontaneous hive collapse or the Mary Celeste syndrome in the United Kingdom).|$|E
