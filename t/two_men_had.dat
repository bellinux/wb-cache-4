5|$|In Christmas 1979, Gillan {{was visited}} by Blackmore, who offered him the {{position}} of lead vocalist in Rainbow. Gillan declined due to the smaller workload the band had compared to his own. However, the pair did jam together for three nights at Marquee Club – {{the first time the}} <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> shared a stage since 1973.|$|E
5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E
5|$|According to Hayes' confession, the <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> {{planned to}} rob the Petit house {{under cover of}} {{darkness}} leaving the family bound, but unharmed. Hayes attributed the outcome to a change of plan. Upon their arrival {{in the early hours of}} July 23, they found William Petit sleeping on a couch on the porch. Komisarjevsky struck William on the head with a baseball bat found in the yard and then tied him up at gunpoint in the basement. The children and their mother were then bound and locked in their respective rooms. Hayes said that he and Komisarjevsky were not satisfied with their haul, and that a bankbook was found which showed an available balance.|$|E

5|$|Having {{recently}} signed a two-year extension to his BBC staff writer's contract, Nigel Kneale was specifically commissioned {{to write a}} sequel to The Quatermass Experiment in early 1955 to challenge the new ITV network. Kneale was inspired by contemporary fears over secret UK Ministry of Defence research establishments such as Porton Down, and also by being required, as a BBC staff member, to sign the Official Secrets Act. As with The Quatermass Experiment, Quatermass II was produced and directed by Rudolph Cartier; he and Kneale particularly enjoyed working together. Since the first Quatermass serial, the <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> collaborated on the literary adaptations Wuthering Heights (1953) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954), and on Kneale's abominable snowman play The Creature (1955).|$|E
5|$|In early 1787, Thomas Clarkson, {{a fellow}} {{graduate}} of St John's, Cambridge, {{who had become}} convinced {{of the need to}} end the slave trade after writing a prize-winning essay on the subject while at Cambridge, called upon Wilberforce at Old Palace Yard with a published copy of the work. This {{was the first time the}} <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> met; their collaboration would last nearly fifty years. Clarkson began to visit Wilberforce on a weekly basis, bringing first-hand evidence he had obtained about the slave trade.|$|E
5|$|McCormack {{transferred}} to the United States Air Force on 25 July 1950. After leaving the AEC in August 1951, he became Special Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Development. In January 1952 he was appointed Director of Nuclear Applications at the Air Research and Development Center in Baltimore, Maryland. He was subsequently promoted to major general, and became Deputy Commander of the Air Research and Development Command. He was called to testify at the Oppenheimer security hearing. Like other witnesses, McCormack testified that Oppenheimer was loyal, and that while the <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> disagreed over {{the merits of the}} Super, that he saw nothing dishonest or disloyal in Oppenheimer's opposition to it.|$|E

5|$|Returning to the United States in July 1920, Somervell {{was posted}} to the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, D.C. His war record {{earned him a}} place at the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, {{reserved}} for the Army's best and most promising officers. He once again ranked near the top of his class. After graduation he was posted to the 1st New York Engineer District but soon obtained leave to assist Hines with a special study of navigation on the Rhine and Danube Rivers on behalf of the League of Nations, essentially a continuation of the work that the <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> done in 1920. He then attended the Army War College from 1925 to 1926.|$|E
5|$|The band's road manager, Brian Maguire {{stated that}} when he drove away from Banbridge in the lead, a few minutes ahead of the band's minibus, he passed through {{security}} barriers manned by the RUC. As Maguire continued ahead, up the by-pass towards Newry, he noticed a blue Triumph 2000 pulling-out from {{where it had been}} parked in a lay-by. Maguire recalled that the car first slowed down, then it accelerated, flashing its lights. <b>Two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> been observed acting suspiciously inside the Castle Ballroom during the band's performance that night, suggesting that the Miami Showband's movements were being carefully monitored.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{focused his}} {{political}} agenda on promoting virtue, which he considered essential {{in a republican}} government. If republican leaders lacked virtue, he believed, liberty was endangered. His major opponent in this campaign was his former protégé John Hancock; the <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> a falling out in the Continental Congress. Adams disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Hancock left Congress in 1777, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against thanking him for his service as president of Congress. The struggle continued in Massachusetts. Adams thought that Hancock was not acting {{the part of a}} virtuous republican leader by acting like an aristocrat and courting popularity. Adams favored James Bowdoin for governor, and was distressed when Hancock won annual landslide victories.|$|E
5|$|Having {{served in}} both houses of the state legislature, Johnson saw {{election}} to Congress as the next step in his political career. He engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain Democratic support, including the displacement of the Whig postmaster in Greeneville, and defeated Jonesborough lawyer John A. Aiken by 5,495 votes to 4,892. In Washington, he joined a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson advocated for the interests of the poor, maintained an anti-abolitionist stance, argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs. With Eliza remaining in Greeneville, Congressman Johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the Library of Congress. Although a fellow Tennessee Democrat, James K. Polk, was elected president in 1844, and Johnson had campaigned for him, the <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> difficult relations, and President Polk refused some of his patronage suggestions.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's organised, bookish intellect {{served him}} well as he began setting up {{different}} SS departments. In 1931 he appointed Reinhard Heydrich chief of the new Ic Service (intelligence service), which was renamed the Sicherheitsdienst (SD: Security Service) in 1932. He later officially appointed Heydrich his deputy. The <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> a good working relationship and a mutual respect. In 1933, they began to remove the SS from SA control. Along with Interior Minister Frick, they hoped to create a unified German police force. In March 1933, Reich Governor of Bavaria Franz Ritter von Epp appointed Himmler chief of the Munich Police. Himmler appointed Heydrich commander of Department IV, the political police. That same year, Hitler promoted Himmler {{to the rank of}} SS-Obergruppenführer, equal in rank to the senior SA commanders. Thereafter, Himmler and Heydrich took over the political police of state after state; soon only Prussia was controlled by Göring.|$|E

5|$|La Cotte de St Brelade is a Palaeolithic site {{inhabited}} before {{rising sea}} levels transformed Jersey into an island. Jersey was a centre of Neolithic activity, {{as demonstrated by}} the concentration of dolmens. Evidence of Bronze Age and early Iron Age settlements can be found in many locations around the island. In June 2012 it was announced what could be Europe's largest hoard of Iron Age coins had been found in Grouville by two persons using metal detectors. The hoard may be worth up to £10 M. People had been searching for this treasure for 30 years. It was reported that the hoard weighed about three quarters of a tonne and could contain up to 50,000 Roman and Celtic coins. In 2012 the same <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> found 60 Iron Age coins in the same area.|$|E
5|$|McAleer's {{tenure as}} {{part-owner}} of the Red Sox {{came to a}} swift end. On July 15, 1913, McAleer became involved in a dispute with the AL president, Ban Johnson, when McAleer forced the resignation of Red Sox manager Jake Stahl, one of Johnson's closest friends. While McAleer claimed that he released Stahl because of a foot injury preventing Stahl from serving as a player-manager, rumors suggested that the <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> strong personal differences. Following a bitter quarrel with Johnson, McAleer sold his holdings in the Red Sox. His feud with Johnson {{turned out to be}} a lifelong affair, despite efforts taken by their mutual friend, Charles Comiskey, to smooth over the rift. While McAleer never publicly discussed the disagreement that spurred his retirement, he supposedly relayed his version of events to Frank B. Ward, a sports reporter with The Youngstown Daily Vindicator, with the understanding that the details remain confidential until McAleer's death.|$|E
5|$|Medina and Carter {{left the}} band soon after; they were {{replaced}} by Brian Khounvichit and Mark Nicks respectively. Carter went on to form the progressive death metal band, Deus Invictus. Nicks was later replaced by drummer Jake Ryan. In September 2005, The Chariot began a 27-city tour at Poughkeepsie, New York with High on Fire, Every Time I Die, and The Red Chord. An EP, titled Unsung, was released {{at the beginning of}} December. It featured two new tracks and four re-recordings from their debut and was well received among critics. The band played shows with labelmates As Cities Burn, mewithoutYou, and Underoath later that month. Touring continued through 2006 as the band shared a national tour with P.O.D. in spring and garnered a spot in the Sounds of the Underground Tour with As I Lay Dying that summer. In June 2006, Beiser and Harbin stepped down and {{were replaced by}} bassist Dan Eaton and guitarist Jon Terry respectively. The <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> been longtime friends of the band.|$|E

5|$|Sinatra {{continued}} {{to perform at}} Caesars Palace in the late 1970s, and was performing there in January 1977 when his mother Dolly {{died in a plane}} crash on the way to see him. He cancelled two weeks of shows and spent time recovering from the shock in Barbados. In March, he performed in front of Princess Margaret at the Royal Albert Hall in London, raising money for the NSPCC. On March 14, he recorded with Nelson Riddle for the last time, recording the songs Linda, Sweet Loraine, and Barbara. The <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> a major falling out, and later patched up their differences in January 1985 at a dinner organized for Ronald Reagan, when Sinatra asked Riddle to make another album with him. Riddle was ill at the time, and died that October, before they had a chance to record.|$|E
5|$|Henry had a {{problematic}} relationship with Louis VII of France throughout the 1150s. The <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> already clashed over Henry's succession to Normandy and the remarriage of Eleanor, {{and the relationship}} was not repaired. Louis invariably attempted to take {{the moral high ground}} in respect to Henry, capitalising on his reputation as a crusader and circulating rumours about his rival's behaviour and character. Henry had greater resources than Louis, however, particularly after taking England, and Louis was far less dynamic in resisting Angevin power than he had been earlier in his reign. The disputes between the two drew in other powers across the region, including Thierry, the Count of Flanders, who signed a military alliance with Henry, albeit with a clause that prevented the count from being forced to fight against Louis, his feudal lord. Further south, Theobald V, the Count of Blois, an enemy of Louis, became another early ally of Henry. The resulting military tensions and the frequent face-to-face meetings to attempt to resolve them has led historian Jean Dunbabin to liken the situation to the period of the Cold War in Europe in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|With {{his wife}} Hadley Richardson, Hemingway first visited the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona, Spain, in 1923, {{where he was}} {{following}} his recent passion for bullfighting. The couple returned to Pamplona in 1924—enjoying the trip immensely—this time accompanied by Chink Dorman-Smith, John Dos Passos, and Donald Ogden Stewart and his wife. The two returned a third time in June1925 and stayed at the hotel of his friend Juanito Quintana. That year, they brought with them a different group of American and British expatriates: Hemingway's Michigan boyhood friend Bill Smith, Stewart, recently divorced Duff, Lady Twysden, her lover Pat Guthrie, and Harold Loeb. In Pamplona, the group quickly disintegrated. Hemingway, attracted to Duff, was jealous of Loeb, who had recently been on a romantic getaway with her; {{by the end of}} the week the <b>two</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> a public fistfight. Against this background was the influence of the young matador from Ronda, Cayetano Ordóñez, whose brilliance in the bullring affected the spectators. Ordóñez honored Hemingway's wife by presenting her, from the bullring, with the ear of a bull he killed. Outside of Pamplona, the fishing trip to the Irati River (near Burguete in Navarre) was marred by polluted water.|$|E
