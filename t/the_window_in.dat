5|$|A {{friend of}} Huseby helped {{the police in}} the negotiations. At 18:30, the {{aircraft}} was out of beer, so Huseby made an agreement that he would throw the gun out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> exchange for more beer. This was delivered by a civilian police officer. The aircraft was then immediately stormed by special forces and Huseby arrested. No-one was injured in the hijacking.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police. They waited for a tactical firearms group to arrive, which turned up at 5am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all {{the doors and windows}} to the house were shut, except for <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E

50|$|Built at {{the point}} when late Romanesque style was fading and Gothic rising, the {{rectangular}} prayer hall features a pair of Romanesque columns supporting groin vaults. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thick stone walls are simple gothic arches. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adjoining study hall, the so-called Rashi Shul, have rounded Romanesque arches. The women’s section of the prayer hall has Romanesque <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern wall, and gothic <b>windows</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western wall.|$|R

5|$|There is also {{a stained}} glass window showing a saint with a sword {{standing}} on a snake and crossed flags, commemorating those from World War II. Several other stained glass windows date from the Victorian era. <b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the tower was donated by a London goldsmith named Mattheson to commemorate the rebuilding {{of the church in}} 1863. The east window represents events in the life of Saint Andrew.|$|E
5|$|Verna Hellman {{was born}} in St. Louis, Missouri. She was the {{daughter}} of Selma (née Schwartz) and Samuel Hellman, who was then working as a journalist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the Saturday Evening Post. Sam Hellman subsequently moved his family to Hollywood, where he became a prolific screenwriter. Verna Hellman graduated from the University of Southern California with a B.A. in journalism. She then held several positions at 20th Century Fox, including being the assistant sound editor on Fritz Lang's 1944 film The Woman in <b>the</b> <b>Window.</b> <b>In</b> 1946, she married the film editor Sam Fields and stopped working. The Fields had two sons; one of them, Richard Fields, became a film editor. In 1954, Sam Fields {{died of a heart attack}} at the age of 38.|$|E
5|$|As {{the story}} begins, {{a woman named}} Emmy Altava is hired to be Professor Layton's {{assistant}} at the fictional Gressenheller University. Upon her introduction to him, he reveals that he is currently heading towards a town named Misthallery. According to a letter allegedly sent by his close friend, Clark Triton, a specter is attacking the village at night. As the pair reach Clark's house, though, they find that the letter was sent not by Clark, but by his son, Luke, who has learned how to predict the specter's attacks and wished to enlist Layton's help in {{putting an end to}} them. Luke sneaks out of his house to join Layton and Emmy's investigation. After they finish exploring Misthallery for the day, they go to spend the night at a local hotel. As they look out from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> their room, they hear the sound of a flute and see a large, shadowy figure emerge from the mist, which proceeds to forge a path of destruction through the town, including their hotel room, before vanishing without a trace.|$|E

5|$|In 1847–8 {{several of}} the old houses {{associated}} with the cathedral {{on the west side}} were demolished, and some minor changes were made to the boundary wall. Structural reinforcement of the ruin and some reconstruction work began in the early 20th century, including restoration of the east gable rose window in 1904 and the replacement of the missing form pieces, mullions, and decorative ribs in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the north-east wall of the chapterhouse (Fig. 15). By 1913, repointing the walls and additional waterproofing of the wall tops were completed. In 1924 the ground level was lowered and the 17th-century tomb of the Earl of Huntly was repositioned. Further repairs and restoration ensued during the 1930s, including the partial dismantling of some 19th century buttressing (Fig. 16), the reconstruction of sections of the nave piers using recovered pieces (Fig. 17), and the addition of external roofing to the vault in the south choir in 1939 (Fig. 18). From 1960 to 2000, masons restored the cathedral's crumbling stonework (Fig. 19) and between 1976 and 1988, the window tracery of the chapterhouse was gradually replaced, and its re-roofing was completed (Fig. 20). Floors, glazing, and a new roof were added to the south-west tower between 1988 and 1998 and comparable restoration work was completed on the north-west tower between 1998 and 2000 (Fig. 21).|$|E

25|$|Once in orbit, the {{spacecraft}} could be rotated in three directions: along its longitudinal axis (roll), {{left to right}} from the astronaut's point of view (yaw), and up or down (pitch).

For orientation, the pilot could look through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> front of him or from a screen connected to a periscope which could be turned 360°.|$|E
25|$|Traditional storm {{windows and}} screens are time {{consuming}} and very labor-intensive, requiring removal and storage {{of the storm}} windows in the spring, and reinstallation {{in the fall and}} storage of the screens. The weight of the large storm window frame and glass makes replacement on upper-stories of tall buildings a difficult task requiring repeatedly climbing a ladder with each window and trying to hold <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> place while securing retaining clips around the edges.|$|E

The bakery of the Galluccis had been attacked {{only a few months}} before when bullets smashed through <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>In</b> letters that were sent to the police, some informants claimed that Giosuè had been responsible for the killing of his brother.|$|E

Georges imagines that Anne is washing dishes in the kitchen and, speechless, he gazes {{at her as she}} cleans up and prepares to leave the house. Anne calls for Georges to bring a coat, and he complies, following her out the door.|$|E
25|$|The east window {{has been}} {{restored}} with glass from 1887. There are two windows in the north wall of the chancel; the eastern is mid-14th-century but the western is earlier, from the 13th century. The south wall has two windows, the eastern corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> the north wall. The other is a low side window of the late 13th century or early 14th century with one pointed light, set in a wide 14th-century recess. This window was probably unglazed with a wooden shutter {{and may have been}} used as a sanctus window through which the sanctus bell was rung at the Elevation of the host.|$|E

25|$|Suddenly his servant, Sancho Panza, climbs hurriedly through <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>In</b> pursuit {{are several}} angry {{women from the}} market from whom he has stolen bread and a chicken. Awakened by the commotion, Don Quixote sends the women away. Don Quixote tells Sancho that he is {{determined}} to seek adventures as a knight-errant, all the while searching for his beloved Dulcinea. He shows him the pasteboard helmet, which, with one sweep from his sword, becomes a shapeless mass on the floor. Antonina suggests that he should use a shaving basin instead, which would make a splendid helmet. Don Quixote enthusiastically agrees and, placing it on his head, orders Sancho to bring him his armour, sword and spear, and to make ready his horse, Rocinante.|$|E
25|$|Similar to Improv, {{formulas}} can {{be represented}} as icons in Numbers, allowing them to be dragged about the sheets. One noteworthy {{example of this is}} a sidebar which contains the sum, average and other basic calculations for the current selection in the active table. These serve a function similar to the sum that appears at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>in</b> Excel. However, the user can drag one of the function icons from the sidebar into the sheet to make the calculation appear in that location. In another nod to Improv, the Formula List shows all of the formulas in the spreadsheet in a separate area, and allows edits in place or easy navigation to their use in the sheets.|$|E
