Also a new formula for finding the closest point of <b>two</b> <b>planes</b> intersection to the given point is given.

30|$|Our stimuli {{consisted}} of arrays of randomly positioned circles, presented on <b>two</b> <b>planes</b> in depth defined by binocular disparity and occlusion. These stimuli, rather than complex naturalistic scenes, {{were used to}} provide simple disparity content which could be easily quantified and to minimize the contribution of pictorial depth cues. It should be noted, however, that some conflict between binocular and monocular cues for a typical stereoscopic display such as ours is inevitable. For example, both focus cues {{and the range of}} sizes of circles on the <b>two</b> <b>planes</b> were both consistent with there being no depth separation between the <b>two</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
