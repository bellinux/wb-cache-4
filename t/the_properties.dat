5|$|One {{must prove}} that this {{operation}} is well-defined, dealing with co-Cauchy sequences. Once that task is done, all <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of real addition follow immediately from <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of rational numbers. Furthermore, the other arithmetic operations, including multiplication, have straightforward, analogous definitions.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of {{an element}} are mostly {{determined}} by its electron configuration, <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> {{of the elements}} likewise show recurring patterns or periodic behaviour, some examples of which are shown in the diagrams below for atomic radii, ionization energy and electron affinity. It is this periodicity of properties, manifestations of which were noticed well before the underlying theory was developed, {{that led to the}} establishment of the periodic law (<b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of the elements recur at varying intervals) and the formulation of the first periodic tables.|$|E
5|$|Although the AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} {{is often}} useful for studying <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of black holes, {{most of the}} black holes considered {{in the context of}} AdS/CFT are physically unrealistic. Indeed, as explained above, most versions of the AdS/CFT correspondence involve higher-dimensional models of spacetime with unphysical supersymmetry.|$|E
50|$|Most notably, a {{property}} owner {{has a duty}} to warn persons on <b>the</b> <b>property</b> of various hazards, depending on the status of the person on <b>the</b> <b>property.</b> For example, <b>the</b> <b>property</b> owner must warn an anticipated or discovered trespasser of deadly conditions known to <b>the</b> <b>property</b> owner, but that would be hidden from <b>the</b> trespasser. <b>The</b> <b>property</b> owner must warn licensees of all known hazards (whether deadly or not), and must warn invitees of all dangers that <b>the</b> <b>property</b> owner can discover through a reasonable inspection of <b>the</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ferdynand Ruszczyc and {{his wife}} Anna Czechowicz {{developed}} <b>the</b> <b>property</b> further. They tended <b>the</b> <b>property</b> well, and conserved the wooden church on <b>the</b> <b>property</b> built during its ownership by the Pac family. The grandson of Ferdinand Ruszczyc was also given the name Ferdynand {{and he was the}} one to continue managing <b>the</b> <b>property</b> doing conservation work on <b>the</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R
50|$|Protective equity is {{calculated}} {{by taking the}} liquidated value of <b>the</b> <b>property</b> (<b>the</b> price at which <b>the</b> <b>property</b> could be sold quickly, usually ninety days), and then subtracting any outstanding debt related to <b>the</b> <b>property</b> in <b>the</b> form of existing loans or tax liens on <b>the</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R
5|$|An atom is the {{smallest}} constituent unit of ordinary matter that has <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).|$|E
5|$|Carrick has a {{large number}} of well-preserved 19th-century buildings. Fifteen {{properties}} in and around Carrick are listed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register.

50|$|Tax lien {{certificates}} {{are issued}} immediately upon {{the failure of}} <b>the</b> <b>property</b> owner to pay. These forms describe a lien on <b>the</b> <b>property.</b> <b>The</b> liens are generally in first position over every other encumbrance on <b>the</b> <b>property,</b> including liens secured by loans against <b>the</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>property</b> {{remained}} in <b>the</b> Cutmore family until 1974, when <b>the</b> <b>property</b> {{was acquired by}} Ian and Sarah McMaster, who changed the name of <b>the</b> <b>property</b> to Warrenilla. <b>The</b> present owners acquired <b>the</b> <b>property</b> in 1976, and it reverted to the former name of Burndale.|$|R
5|$|For example, the hardness, {{electrical}} and thermal conductivity {{are much higher}} within the planes than perpendicular to them. On the contrary, <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of c-BN and w-BN are more homogeneous and isotropic.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} plays {{a central}} role in modelling all these phenomena, and observations provide strong evidence for the existence of black holes with <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> predicted by the theory.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, the Russian {{government}} {{issued an}} edict to confiscate <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of the Armenian Church, including the treasures of Etchmiadzin.

50|$|George W. Young’s {{father-in-law}} bought <b>the</b> <b>property</b> in 1900 {{and died}} shortly thereafter. George {{and his family}} moved onto <b>the</b> <b>property</b> and he farmed <b>the</b> <b>property</b> until 1942.|$|R
5000|$|Conservation {{easements}} - <b>The</b> <b>property</b> owner adds a restriction to <b>the</b> <b>property</b> prohibiting future development. This effectively {{removes the}} development {{potential as a}} factor in <b>the</b> <b>property</b> taxes.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, part of <b>the</b> <b>property</b> {{was sold}} {{off when the}} owners were unable to sell <b>the</b> <b>property</b> as a whole.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>property</b> was {{initially}} established by Pierce and Gilmore who acquired the 200000 acre lease prior to 1901. They stocked <b>the</b> <b>property</b> with 1,000 sheep, 250 cattle and 50 horses. <b>The</b> <b>property</b> adjoined Ducie Downs at this time. Gilmore sold <b>the</b> 262000 acre <b>property</b> in 1926 to W. H. Nicholls. Sir Walter James then acquired <b>the</b> <b>property</b> in 1927.|$|R
50|$|James Hersey {{acquired}} <b>the</b> <b>property</b> in 1945, and ran it as a {{dairy farm}} until 1980. <b>The</b> <b>property</b> {{was taken over}} by his son, who raises cattle on <b>the</b> <b>property.</b>|$|R

50|$|Severe bushfires hit {{the area}} in 1952 and by 1954 <b>the</b> <b>property</b> was in <b>the</b> grip of drought with the Andersons {{preparing}} to ship their breeding stock from <b>the</b> <b>property.</b> <b>The</b> Anderson family sold <b>the</b> <b>property</b> in <b>the</b> 1980s.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>property</b> is {{situated}} approximately 870 km north of Winton and 130 km southeast of Hughenden. The ephemeral Werna Creek runs through <b>the</b> <b>property.</b> <b>The</b> <b>property</b> is predominantly Mitchell and Flinders grass country.|$|R
5|$|The above table {{reflects}} the hybrid nature of metalloids. <b>The</b> <b>properties</b> of form, appearance, and behaviour when mixed with metals {{are more like}} metals.

5|$|The {{centre of}} Navenby village is a {{designated}} conservation area; {{many of the}} stone and brick-built houses date back hundreds of years. More than 20 of <b>the</b> <b>properties,</b> {{as well as the}} 1935 red telephone kiosk in High Street, have listed building status.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>property</b> was {{purchased}} by Joe and Jackie Glynn in 1994. Over the next three years, the Glynns restored <b>the</b> <b>property</b> and opened <b>the</b> <b>property</b> to facilitate weddings and small events in 1997.|$|R
