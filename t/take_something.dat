25|$|Allen gave {{vaudeville}} {{itself a}} timeline of 1875–1925 in Much Ado About Me, but he actually left vaudeville {{a few years}} earlier, moving to work in such Shubert Brothers stage productions as The Passing Show in 1922. The show played well in its runup to Broadway but lasted only ten weeks at the Winter Garden Theatre.

[...] A Slime is a small blue blob, shaped like a water droplet, with a face. It has appeared in every Dragon Quest game and it is usually one of the first monsters the players encounter.

Prime had the addition of light bloom, and Echoes had difficulty tweaks to make it [...] "more accessible to those who were really intimidated early on". For Corruption, the code was examined to find ways to make it run faster and better than in the original Wii release.

500|$|Abrams {{selected}} Michael Kaplan {{to design}} the costumes because {{he had not seen}} any of the films, meaning he would approach the costumes with a new angle. For the Starfleet uniforms, Kaplan followed the show's original color-coding, with dark gray (almost black) undershirts and pants and colored overshirts showing each crew member's position. Command officers wear gold shirts, science and medical officers wear blue, and operations (technicians, engineers, and security personnel) wear red. Kaplan wanted the shirts to be more sophisticated than the originals and selected to have the Starfleet symbol patterned on them. Kirk wears only the undershirt because he is a cadet. Kaplan modelled the uniforms on Kelvin on science fiction films of the 1940s and 1950s, to contrast with Enterprise-era uniforms based on the ones created in the 1960s. For Abrams, [...] "The costumes were a microcosm of the entire project, which was how to <b>take</b> <b>something</b> that's kind of silly and make it feel real. But how do you make legitimate those near-primary color costumes?" ...|$|E
500|$|Edward James Olmos portrays Gaff. Olmos {{used his}} diverse ethnic background, and {{personal}} research, {{to help create}} the fictional [...] "Cityspeak" [...] language his character uses in the film. His initial address to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means, [...] "Horse dick ! No way. You are the Blade ... Blade Runner." [...] M. Emmet Walsh plays Captain Bryant, a hard-drinking, sleazy, and underhanded police veteran typical of the film noir genre. Joe Turkel portrays Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves. William Sanderson was cast as J. F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. J.F. sympathizes with the replicants, whom he sees as companions, and shares their shorter lifespan due to his rapid aging disease; Joe Pantoliano was considered for the role. James Hong portrays Hannibal Chew, an elderly geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes, and Hy Pyke portrays the sleazy bar owner Taffey Lewis with ease and in a single <b>take,</b> <b>something</b> almost unheard-of with Scott whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double-digit takes.|$|E

In a review for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield called the track [...] "yodel-trocious" [...] and argued that [...] "the problem isn't the Swiss Miss motif {{so much as the}} fourth-rate Neptunes track. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian was pleased with the track, describing the yodeling as [...] "off-her-head", and referred to the track as [...] "a pinnacle of madness". IndieLondon's Jack Foley noted [...] "Wind It Up" [...] as a highlight of The Sweet Escape and called it [...] "Stefani's gift that she can <b>take</b> <b>something</b> that, on paper, sounds cheesy and make it utterly, utterly cool." [...] USA Todays Ken Barnes, however, found the track [...] "campy" [...] and [...] "a tacky attempt at sexiness", adding that the combination of yodeling and the interpolation was [...] "awkward". Alex Miller of the NME also found the song campy, commenting that its [...] "dumb sexual bravado has all the sophistication of a teenage boy's wet dream", and compared the yodeling, interpolation, and [...] "erotic rap" [...] to [...] "a trench foot which screams for amputation from the tracklisting".|$|E

I wanted to make that environment float on a cloud. [...] I wanted to inspect little nuances, capture them, and paint with them." [...] While living in New York City, there was a point where Greenwald became bankrupt and wanted to create great-sounding tracks with no budget whatsoever without the need of using samples from a digital audio workstation or other computer software. While waiting for the train one day, he went to a Guitar Center store near Atlantic Terminal out of boredom. At the store, he heard someone playing a Green Day song on an electric guitar and noticed the instrument's poor tone: ...|$|E
500|$|For the 2009 {{version of}} Friday the 13th, effects artist Scott Stoddard took {{inspiration}} from Carl Fullerton's design in Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's work in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard {{wanted to make}} sure that Jason appeared human and not like a monster. Stoddard's vision of Jason includes hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face, but he attempted to craft Jason's look in a way that would allow for a more human side to be seen. Stoddard took inspiration from the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. The make-up artist managed to acquire an original set piece, which he studied and later sculpted. Although he had a model of one of the original masks, Stoddard did not want to replicate it in its entirety. As Stoddard explains, [...] "Because I didn't want to <b>take</b> <b>something</b> that already existed, there were things I thought were great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit, break them up." [...] In the end, Stoddard crafted six versions of the mask, each with varying degrees of wear.|$|E

500|$|For Jason's wardrobe, Mears {{was given}} a pair of combat boots and a [...] "high-priced t-shirt" [...] that allowed the special effects make-up to be seen through holes in the shirt. The jacket Jason wears in the film was created by {{combining}} a hunting jacket and a military jacket. Mears {{wanted to use the}} hunting jacket, but the creative team liked the way the military jacket billowed as he was making his [...] "kill movements." [...] The top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed {{over the top of the}} military jacket. Mears called it a [...] "giant Frankenstein jacket." [...] He describes Jason as leaner in this film because the character does not eat much. A leaner Jason was deemed more functional and allowed more emphasis to be placed on the hump on his back. Stoddard was inspired by the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. Using an original mold, Stoddard made six new versions of the mask. He said, [...] "Because I didn't want to <b>take</b> <b>something</b> that already existed. There [...] were things I thought were great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit.

500|$|... "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] was jointly written, composed, and {{produced}} by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis. Dennis and Davis {{had been brought}} together by British artist manager Simon Fuller, who wanted the duo {{to come up with}} a song for British pop group S Club 7. The song was recorded using Cubase music software, which Davis ran on his Mac computer. Davis began playing an acoustic guitar and ran a 125 beats per minute drum loop, on which Dennis, herself a singer who had enjoyed chart success in the United States, began singing the line [...] "I just can't get you out of my head" [...] in the key of D minor. After three and a half hours, the demo was recorded and the vocals were laid afterwards. Dennis called their recording setup for the song [...] "the most primitive set-up you could imagine! Different producers work in different ways. But it's good to be reminded you don’t have to be reliant on equipment. A song is about melody and lyrics and being able to <b>take</b> <b>something</b> away in your memory that is going to haunt you." [...] She also regarded their production as a [...] "very natural and fluid process," [...] saying: [...] "We know how hard we work sometimes to write songs and then spend months picking them to pieces, but this was the easiest process, the chemicals were all happy and working together." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{reviewed the}} episode, giving it high marks saying it [...] "proves yet again that 30 Rock {{is worthy of}} the Best Comedy Emmy" [...] and scored the episode a 9.2 out of 10. Sean Gandert of Paste magazine also reviewed [...] "Season 4", saying it did [...] "little to disappoint and in fact starts the show off on much stronger footing than the first couple episodes of season 3." [...] Gandert said the episode [...] "doesn't have quite as many truly classic moments as the show's peaks in seasons one and two" [...] but that [...] "it also never really hits a sour note." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed the economic crisis, cutbacks, and corporate bonuses theme in the episode, explaining {{that one of the}} reasons he loves the show [...] "is because it can <b>take</b> <b>something</b> that's in the news and make it the plot of an episode without it feeling weird or forced." [...] Sassone wrote that despite [...] "Season 4" [...] not being the best episode of 30 Rock [...] "it was still very good." [...] TV Guides Michael Anthony commented that Steve Buscemi is [...] "so weird and yet does it in such an endearing way." [...] Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times called Kenneth's strike one of the more hilarious strikes in history. Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons noted that this episode of 30 Rock had strong moments [...] "and was a solid start to the new season". David Zurawik, a contributor for The Baltimore Sun, liked the episode and enjoyed Buscemi's appearance, noting he [...] "brings just the right mix of sleaze and smiles to the role." [...] The Chicago Sun-Times Paige Wiser noted, [...] "...tonight's season premiere, the hype is warranted: 30 Rock is in all its glory." [...] Kevin Aeh of Time Out magazine wrote that the best part from [...] "Season 4" [...] was Tracy's storyline after being told to reconnect with his roots.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pictorial}} {{ideals of}} Roh's original magic realism attracted new generations of artists through the latter {{years of the}} 20th century and beyond. In a 1991 New York Times review, critic Vivien Raynor remarked that [...] "John Stuart Ingle proves that Magic Realism lives" [...] in his [...] "virtuoso" [...] still life watercolors. Ingle's approach, as described in his own words, reflects the early inspiration of the magic realism movement as described by Roh; that is, the aim is not to add magical elements to a realistic painting, but to pursue a radically faithful rendering of reality; the [...] "magic" [...] effect on the viewer comes from the intensity of that effort: [...] "I don't want to make arbitrary changes in what I see to paint the picture, I want to paint what is given.
