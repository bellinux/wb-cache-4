5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nice</b> were an English {{progressive}} {{rock band}} {{active in the}} late 1960s. They blended rock, jazz and classical music and were keyboardist Keith Emerson's first commercially successful band.|$|E
5|$|After {{over three}} decades of inactivity, <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> {{reformed}} in 2002 {{for a series of}} concerts. A three-CD set Vivacitas was released, with the third CD being an interview with Emerson, Jackson and Davison. Dave Kilminster guested on guitar at the concerts. Davison died on 15 April 2008 aged 65 in Horns Cross, Devon, from a brain tumour. Emerson died on 11 March 2016 in Santa Monica, California, of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.|$|E

Powers were strengthened again with <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> Treaty in 2001 giving the Presidents more power over the composition of their Commissions.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Enrico Tortonese {{examined}} <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> and Cayenne {{specimens of}} S. tudes (the Coromandel specimen having {{been lost in}} the interim) and concluded that they were not great hammerheads, but rather the same species as S. bigelowi. Carter Gilbert concurred in his 1967 revision of the hammerhead sharks, noting that while the lost Coromandel specimen was probably a great hammerhead, none of the existing material belonged to that species. Thus, Sphyrna tudes became the accepted name for the smalleye hammerhead, taking precedence over S. bigelowi because it was published earlier, and the great hammerhead received the next available name Sphyrna mokarran. Gilbert designated <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> specimen as the lectotype that would define S. tudes, having priority over the Cayenne specimen (the paralectotype). This was meant to stabilize the name, but had the opposite effect.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Jean Cadenat and Jacques Blache {{revisited}} {{the type}} specimens of S. tudes {{and found that}} the lectotype from Nice is likely not a smalleye hammerhead, but rather a fetal whitefin hammerhead (S. couardi, likely a synonym of the scalloped hammerhead, S. lewini). This would also explain the anomalous locality of <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> specimen, as the smalleye hammerhead is not otherwise known outside of the Americas. By the rules of binomial nomenclature, Sphyra tudes should then become the valid name for the whitefin hammerhead, taking precedence over S. couardi, and the smalleye hammerhead would revert to being Sphyrna bigelowi. Taxonomists, though, have been reluctant to change the names again, preferring to keep the smalleye hammerhead as S. tudes. For this solution to have official status would require a decision by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), to reject <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> specimen as the lectotype and designate the Cayenne specimen in its place. The relevant petition to the ICZN has not yet been put forth.|$|E
5|$|In {{a revised}} version of <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> model Jupiter trojans are {{captured}} when Jupiter encounters an ice giant during the instability. In this version of <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> model one of the ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost fifth planet) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by Jupiter causing the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to quickly separate. When Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during these encounters existing Jupiter trojans can escape and new objects with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new semi-major axis are captured. Following its last encounter the ice giant can pass {{through one of the}} libration points and perturb their orbits leaving this libration point depleted relative to the other. After the encounters end some of these Jupiter trojans are lost and others captured when Jupiter and Saturn are near weak mean motion resonances such as the 3:7 resonance via the mechanism of the original Nice model.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nice</b> briefly {{considered}} {{looking for}} a replacement, with Steve Howe trying out at an audition. Howe got on well {{with the rest of}} the band, but a week later had second thoughts and decided not to join. Emerson tried to learn guitar so he could cover some of O'List's old parts, but gave up after one gig.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Nice</b> were {{primarily}} a live band. Their stage performances were bold and violent, with Emerson incorporating feedback and distortion. He manhandled his Hammond L-100 organ, wrestling it and attacking it with daggers (which {{he used to}} hold down keys and sustain notes during these escapades). Emerson's playing was inspired by Jimi Hendrix, Billy Ritchie of Clouds, and Don Shinn as well as earlier figures such as pianist Jerry Lee Lewis.|$|E

5|$|A recent {{modification}} of <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> model has the Solar System begin with five giant planets, including an additional ice giant, {{in a chain}} of mean-motion resonances. About 400 million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System the resonance chain is broken. Instead of being scattered into the disc, the ice giants first migrate outward several AU. This divergent migration eventually leads to a resonance crossing, destabilizing the orbits of the planets. The extra ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and after a series of encounters is ejected from the Solar System. The remaining planets then continue their migration until the planetesimal disc is nearly depleted with small fractions remaining in various locations.|$|E

5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> model, {{after the}} {{formation}} of the Solar System, the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals. After 500–600million years (about 4billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn fell into a 2:1 resonance: Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits. This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets, possibly causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{concept is}} that they formed closer to the Sun, where the matter density was higher, and then subsequently migrated to their current orbits after {{the removal of the}} gaseous protoplanetary disc. This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured, due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-Neptunian region. The current most widely accepted explanation of the details of this hypothesis is known as <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of the San Theodoran carnival was drawn largely from images of <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> Carnival. Among the revelers, he included those dressed in the costumes of various different cartoon and film characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Asterix, Snoopy, Groucho Marx, and Zorro. Hergé also included a band known as the Coconuts into the carnival scene; these were not developed by Hergé himself but were rather the creations of his friend and colleague Bob de Moor, who had devised them for his own comic series, Barelli. The street that they were marching down, Calle 22 de Mayo, was named after Hergé's own birthday, 22 May.|$|E

5|$|The group's early {{sound was}} geared more towards {{psychedelic}} rock with only occasional classical influences. Following O'List's departure, Emerson's {{control over the}} band's direction became greater, resulting in more complex music. The absence of a guitar in the band and Emerson's redefining {{of the role of}} keyboard instruments in rock set <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> apart from many of its contemporaries. He used a combination of Marshall Amplification and Leslie speakers in order to project a full sound to compensate for the lack of a guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid {{form in the}} warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these would {{eventually}} form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very {{small fraction of the}} solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. <b>The</b> <b>Nice</b> model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.|$|E
