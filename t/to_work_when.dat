5|$|At the Quahog Gay Pride Day festivities, in a raffle {{sponsored}} by Weenie and the Butt, Brian wins tickets to see Celine Dion in Las Vegas. As they prepare to travel, Stewie convinces Brian {{to use the}} new teleportation device he has been working on instead. Stewie's device appears to have malfunctioned, and he believes it failed <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>when</b> it instead created a duplicate set of Brian and Stewie which was teleported to Vegas. The real Brian and Stewie then travel by plane to Vegas. As the duplicated pair check into the Bellagio hotel, their luck makes itself present immediately with the duplicated Brian winning a large jackpot at the slot machines near the entrance. The real Brian and Stewie arrive to find their room has been already taken. As the duplicated pair have the time of their lives, the real pair find themselves in a third-rate hotel. Trying their luck, they quickly lose all of the money they brought.|$|E

After Caesar has gone out, Violet flirts with Corky and asks her to help retrieve an earring that has fallen down her sink. After Corky extracts the earring, Violet admits she lost it on purpose in order to get closer to Corky, and starts to seduce her. They are interrupted by the arrival of Caesar and Corky goes back <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> <b>When</b> she leaves for the day, Violet follows her to her truck. They go to Corky's apartment and have sex. The next morning, Violet tells Corky that Caesar is a money launderer for the Mafia and they have been together for five years.|$|E

25|$|In what {{proved to}} be a dry run of the larger strike to follow, cotton mill workers in South Carolina's Horse Creek Valley struck to force {{employers}} {{to live up to the}} code, only to face special deputies, highway patrolmen and a machine-gun unit of the National Guard sent to keep the mills open. When the NIRA's special board came to Horse Creek, it did not respond to the workers' complaints, but urged them to return <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> <b>When</b> they attempted to do so, the mill owners not only refused to allow the workers back, but evicted them from company housing.

He adds that he was having a final look to try and understand the fundamental reasons why his approach could not be made <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>when</b> he had a sudden insight that the specific reason why the Kolyvagin–Flach approach would not work directly also meant that his original attempts using Iwasawa theory could be made to work, if he strengthened it using his experience gained from the Kolyvagin–Flach approach. Fixing one approach with tools from the other approach would resolve the issue for all the cases that were not already proven by his refereed paper. He described later that Iwasawa theory and the Kolyvagin–Flach approach were each inadequate on their own, but together they could be made powerful enough to overcome this final hurdle.|$|E
25|$|Mearsheimer's {{first book}} Conventional Deterrence (1983) {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how decisions to start a war depend on the projected outcome of military conflict. In other words, how do decision makers' beliefs about the outcome of war affect {{the success or failure of}} deterrence? Mearsheimer's basic argument is that deterrence is likely <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>when</b> the potential attacker believes that a successful attack will be unlikely and costly. If the potential attacker, however, has reason to believe the attack will likely succeed and entail low costs, then deterrence is likely to break down. This is now widely accepted to be the way the principle of deterrence works. Specifically, Mearsheimer argues that the success of deterrence is determined by the strategy available to the potential attacker. He lays out three strategies. First, a war-of-attrition strategy, which entails a high level of uncertainty about the outcome of war and high costs for the attacker. Second, a limited-aims strategy, which entails fewer risks and lower costs. And, third, a blitzkrieg strategy, which provides a way to defeat the enemy rapidly and decisively, with relatively low costs. For Mearsheimer, failures in the modern battlefield are due mostly to the potential attacker's belief that it can successfully implement a blitzkrieg strategy in which tanks and other mechanized forces are employed swiftly to effect a deep penetration and disrupt the enemy's rear. The other two strategies are unlikely to lead to deterrence failures because they would entail a low probability of success accompanied by high costs (war of attrition) or limited gains and the possibility of the conflict turning into a war of attrition (limited aims). If the attacker has a coherent blitzkrieg strategy available, however, an attack is likely to ensue, as its potential benefits outweigh the costs and risks of starting a war.|$|E

A dozen animators/puppeteers were put <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>when</b> {{production}} began, but that number had tripled {{by the end of}} production.

The puppets themselves, built by Mackinnon and Saunders, were typically about 17 inches tall and animated on sets built three to four feet off the ground with trap doors that allowed animators access to the sets' surfaces to manipulate the puppets. The three primary characters—Victor, Victoria and Corpse Bride—were fitted with heads the size of golf balls that contained special gearing to allow the animators to manipulate individual parts of the puppets' faces. The animators' work was spread over 25 to 35 individual setups/stages, each having its own Canon digital camera. A total of 32 cameras were used on the film. Each camera was outfitted with a [...] "grabber" [...] system that enabled the animators to capture frames and download them into a computer to assemble a short [...] "reel" [...] of the shot being produced to check their work.|$|E
