Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold <b>thinking.</b> <b>We</b> might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E
500|$|Whenever we work {{together}} she always sits with me and listens to the song, and says [...] "tell me what this song is about to you." [...] She's very methodical in her <b>thinking.</b> <b>We</b> talk about it, she writes down words that I say describing what the song's about and the sentiment that I'd like her to get out there, and then she goes away and she works on it. She writes it, she comes back. She does a version of it, we talk about it. It's a back and forth until she gets it right. It's a total collaboration.|$|E

The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E

30|$|For future research, we plan {{to analyze}} more detail about the {{characteristics}} of learners’ <b>thinking</b> processes. <b>We</b> would like to use a data-mining method, such as sequential data mining to discover learners’ action sequences while posing the problems and use the clustering method for grouping learners’ <b>thinking</b> processes. <b>We</b> {{also would like to}} explore methods to identify other significant actions. These are required to define learning support, depending on each learner’s cause of mistake and to develop an adaptive function for learning by posing problems.|$|R
500|$|The {{next season}} Villa {{did not start}} well {{and they were in}} mid-table at Christmas {{although}} the club was still in the European Cup. In the first round Villa beat Valur 70 on aggregate. In the second round they scored twice at Dynamo Berlin to achieve a 22 draw, which saw them go through due to the away goals rule. These victories were in contrast to their poor performance in the league. By February 1982, the club were lying 19th in the First Division and Saunders resigned. It was later disclosed that the then chairman, Ron Bendall, had offered him a revised, shorter term, contract, which he had refused to accept. Saunders' assistant Tony Barton was promoted in his place. When Barton took over, although Villa were in a poor league position, they were in the quarter-final of the European Cup. In the quarter-finals, they beat Dynamo Kiev over two legs. Gordon Cowans is quoted as saying, [...] "Once we got past Dynamo Kiev we began <b>thinking</b> <b>we</b> could go all the way." [...] In the semi-final, they played Anderlecht over two legs, with Tony Morley scoring to secure Aston Villa's place in the final.|$|E
500|$|William Bertram Turrill {{introduced}} the term [...] "alpha taxonomy" [...] {{in a series}} of papers published in 1935 and 1937 in which he discussed the philosophy and possible future directions of the discipline of taxonomy. … there is an increasing desire amongst taxonomists to consider their problems from wider viewpoints, to investigate the possibilities of closer co-operation with their cytological, ecological and genetical colleagues and to acknowledge that some revision or expansion, perhaps of a drastic nature, of their aims and methods, may be desirable … Turrill (1935) has suggested that while accepting the older invaluable taxonomy, based on structure, and conveniently designated [...] "alpha", it is possible to glimpse a far-distant taxonomy built upon as wide a basis of morphological and physiological facts as possible, and one in which [...] "place is found for all observational and experimental data relating, even if indirectly, to the constitution, subdivision, origin, and behaviour of species and other taxonomic groups". Ideals can, it may be said, never be completely realized. They have, however, a great value of acting as permanent stimulants, and if we have some, even vague, ideal of an [...] "omega" [...] taxonomy we may progress a little way down the Greek alphabet. Some of us please ourselves by <b>thinking</b> <b>we</b> are now groping in a [...] "beta" [...] taxonomy.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{edition of}} 27 October 2006 of Real Time with Bill Maher, he {{described}} conservatives and Republicans {{who refused to}} admit they had been wrong to support the Iraq War as [...] "cowards." [...] On 26 February 2008, he wrote on his blog: [...] "After 9/11, I was clearly blinded by fear of al Qaeda and deluded by the overwhelming military superiority of the US and the ease of democratic transitions in Eastern Europe into <b>thinking</b> <b>we</b> could simply fight our way to victory against Islamist terror. I wasn't alone. But I was surely wrong." [...] His reversal on the Iraq issue and his increasing attacks on the Bush administration caused a severe backlash from many hawkish conservatives, who accused him of not being a [...] "real" [...] conservative.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Rodgers {{played in}} the CFL {{and is now the}} {{assistant}} special teams coach for the Carolina Panthers after serving as the defensive coordinator at Holy Cross from 2005–11. Rodgers' son Richard Rodgers II became a tight end for the Green Bay Packers in 2014. On December 3, 2015, the younger Rodgers had heroics of his own, catching a Hail Mary from Aaron Rodgers with no time left to help them beat the Detroit Lions 27–23. The Hail Mary was quickly coined as [...] "The Miracle in Motown". After the game Richard Rodgers II admitted thinking about The Play his father was part of stating [...] "It's a really special moment for him and I was kind of thinking on the play before, when Aaron got the facemask, I was kind of <b>thinking</b> <b>we</b> would do something like that.

2500|$|An {{aim of the}} Tractatus is {{to reveal}} the {{relationship}} between language and the world: what {{can be said about}} it, and what can only be shown. Wittgenstein argues that language has an underlying logical structure, a structure that provides the limits of what can be said meaningfully. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: [...] "What we can say at all can be said clearly," [...] he argues. Anything beyond that—religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical—cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be. He wrote in the preface: [...] "The book will, therefore, draw a limit to thinking, or rather—not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts; for, in order to draw a limit to <b>thinking</b> <b>we</b> should {{have to be able to}} think both sides of this limit (we should therefore have to be able to think what cannot be thought)." ...|$|E
2500|$|Raymond v. Raymond mirrors Usher's 2004 Confessions, as a self-confessional album, {{with several}} {{recordings}} from the album inferring to Usher's marriage. Jive Records urban music president and album executive producer Mark Pitts also conceived the album as {{a return to}} the themes of the latter album; [...] "based on what happened with Confessions", Pitts wanted to reproduce its success. Pitts told The New York Times that [...] "Usher had a rough couple years", elaborating: [...] "The scrutiny of everything going on, he was worrying too much about what people were <b>thinking.</b> <b>We</b> felt like we had to get his swagger back. Dust off the bed and get it popping and young again." [...] Pitts noted that it was important Raymond v. Raymond addressed the rumors that circulated around Usher's marriage. The latter reiterated that the album is not specifically about his marriage, and that it is [...] "about the tug-of-war between man and woman, and the honesty a man has to have." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Clinton {{produced}} the next album, Freaky Styley (1985). Clinton combined various elements of punk and funk into the band's repertoire, allowing their music to incorporate {{a variety of}} distinct styles. The album featured Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley {{on many of the}} album's tracks. The band often indulged in heavy heroin use while recording the album, which influenced the lyrics and musical direction of the album. The band had a much better relationship with Clinton than with Gill, but Freaky Styley, released on August 16, 1985, also achieved little success, failing to make an impression on any chart. The subsequent tour was also considered unproductive by the band. Despite the lack of success, the band was satisfied with Freaky Styley; Kiedis reflected, that [...] "it so surpassed anything we thought we could have done that we were <b>thinking</b> <b>we</b> were on the road to enormity." [...] The band appeared in the 1986 movie Thrashin' (directed by David Winters and starring Josh Brolin) playing the song [...] "Blackeyed Blonde" [...] from Freaky Styley. During this time the band also appeared in the movie Tough Guys starring Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas performing the song [...] "Set It Straight" [...] at a Los Angeles nightclub.|$|E
