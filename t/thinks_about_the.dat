5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E
25|$|Contemplation is a {{very old}} and {{important}} meditation technique. The practitioner meditates deeply on subtle facts. In agnya vichāya, one contemplates on seven facts life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of karmas, and the final accomplishment of liberation. In apaya vichāya, one contemplates on the incorrect insights one indulges, which eventually develops right insight. In vipaka vichāya, one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of karma. In sansathan vichāya, one <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> vastness {{of the universe and}} the loneliness of the soul.|$|E
25|$|Sarah is {{the female}} {{half of the}} lizard couple, the mate of Leslie. Like her mate, Sarah is {{cautious}} and fearful around the humans. Yet like Nancy, she is curious about them and tries to make a connection. Though Sarah defers to Leslie much more than Nancy does to Charlie, she does play a buffer role between the couples. Leslie often consults Sarah on {{what he should do}} and what she <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> humans and the situation at hand. At first, Sarah urges wanness, but she also emphasizes the importance of contact.|$|E
50|$|As a witch, Tiffany {{possesses}} First Sight, {{the ability}} to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as 'the thoughts you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way you think'. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (<b>the</b> thoughts you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way you <b>think),</b> and Fourth Thoughts (<b>the</b> thoughts you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way you <b>think).</b> All these thoughts sometimes cause Tiffany to walk into door frames.|$|R

5000|$|The Little Thinker {{tapes were}} sold in toy stores around the United States and Canada in audio {{cassette}} format. The tapes {{were sold in}}dividually and in four collections. The first six tapes, All About Fun Poems, All About Manners and Morals, All About Safety, All About Animals, All About Outer Space, and All <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Sea, were all released in 1978 and anthologized in the box set Little Thinker Tapes Vol. 1. The second set of six appeared in 1979. It included <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Circus, <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> Dinosaurs, <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Weather, <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> Super-sites in America, <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> Ways to Travel, and <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> Sports. By <b>the</b> release of Little Thinker Tapes Vol. 3 in 1982, the series had grown popular enough to support a fan club. Members were called [...] "Thinkerniks," [...] a term that replaced [...] "Little Thinker" [...] as Nancy's pet name for her listeners. The last six tapes, anthologized in the third volume, were <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> Life on <b>the</b> Farm, <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Desert, <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Old West, <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> Planet Earth, <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> <b>the</b> World of Music, and <b>Think</b> <b>About</b> People on <b>the</b> Job. A final comprehensive set of Little Thinker Tapes was issued in 1983.

25|$|That night, {{the family}} stays {{at a hotel}} where they {{try to come up}} with a plan and Jules shows Sandspur to his girlfriend, Cindy. Based on the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Nick <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{possibility}} of asking the merfolk to lure the giants to the sea, since they seem to be hypnotized by a nixie's singing. The kids sneak out to the beach, where they find that the mermaids hate land-dwellers and kidnap Jules, promising to let him go and sing the giants to the sea if the kids bring them a fish that has never been in their sea. They steal a tropical fish from Cindy's father's aquarium and race back to the beach. The mermaids are amazed that they completed the task and return Jules. Keeping their promise but intending to trick the humans, the mermaids sing for only a little while and to no effect before disappearing. However, Nick manages to tape their song in a tape recorder, which they intend to use to lure the giants themselves.|$|E
25|$|Śrībhārgavamithilāgamanam (Sanskrit: श्रीभार्गवमिथिलागमनम्) In {{only her}} sixth year, Sītā's {{appearance}} {{is like that}} of a sixteen-year-old. Her beauty is described by the poet in 12 verses (13.9–13.20). Janaka realizes that his daughter is the Ādi Śakti of Rāma and no ordinary girl, as she can drag the onerous bow of Śiva as a child. He is concerned about Sītā getting a deserving husband. He <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> doctrine of Avatāra, having heard verses about it in the Vedas, but his intellect and rationalism make him not believe it. After much contemplation, he concludes that the doctrine must be true. Just then, a doorkeeper announces the arrival of Paraśurāma in Mithilā. Janaka bows down to Paraśurāma. Knowing Janaka to be a noble king, Paraśurāma does not consider him to be his enemy, unlike the despotic Kṣatriyas. Paraśurāma expresses his wish to see Sītā. Janaka leads him to the sacrificial assembly (Yajñaśālā), where Paraśurāma sees Sītā playing with the bow of Śiva by dragging it like a play-horse. Paraśurāma asks Janaka to hold a Svayaṃvara for Sītā in which the prince who breaks the bow of Śiva will have the right to marry Sītā. Paraśurāma further predicts that Rāma, the descendant of Raghu, will break the bow. Paraśurāma tells Janaka that he will arrive again in Mithilā, pretending to be angry, so that he can have an excuse of seeing both Sītā and Rāma. At the end of the canto Paraśurāma bows to the child Sītā and starts to praise her.|$|E

Crosby's fellow countryman and Olympic teammate, Rick Nash of the New York Rangers was questioned by the media about this, at one point saying, [...] "I think he's a tough guy to keep up with.

500|$|The Eternal World {{is a place}} {{similar to}} the afterlife where a person's [...] "other self" [...] awaits. Anyone can access it, though it is only {{accessible}} once one has lost his or her grounding in the real world. It {{may be necessary to}} form a pledge with someone in the real world as a guide to the Eternal World, but one's memories surrounding the pledge become vague. A grace period can be granted between when the pledge is made and when someone goes to the Eternal World. Once the process has started, nothing can prevent someone from going to the Eternal World, and returning to the real world is difficult. Someone about to leave to the Eternal World starts to be forgotten approximately one week before going, and the amount of time before someone forgets differs based on how much someone <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> person leaving. However, he or she is remembered the moment that person returns. If a strong emotional bond is established in the real world before leaving, a person in the Eternal World can be returned after approximately one year.|$|E
500|$|Whilst Gwen by {{the third}} series has become a more militant character, Rhys retains his everyman status and takes {{on the role of}} {{audience}} surrogate; press material describes him as [...] "the ordinary guy in the street" [...] and [...] "the normal person's eyes and ears" [...] who [...] "says what he <b>thinks</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situations Torchwood find themselves in, bringing the reality back to them". Paul Collins comments of the significance of Rhys having the first dialogue in the serial, remarking that this is Torchwoods [...] "determination to establish its domestic credentials before subverting them". Rhys becomes a reluctant hero; Kai Owen states that he [...] "would rather not get involved if he had the choice", but when faced with the life-or-death situations in the serial [...] "he doesn't run away from it" [...] because the character has [...] "seen so many things". This, in Owen's eyes, makes the Rhys seen in Children of Earth a [...] "very brave hero who has grown in stature". Rhys retains core character status for the fourth series, [...] Whilst Kai Owen explains that Rhys will always be at the forefront of [...] "Gwen's troubles or fights or adventures" [...] because of his concern for her, he remains unafraid to tell her when she has become too consumed by her job. Davies links the relationship between Gwen and Rhys in the fourth series to the show's continued exploration of human sexuality, stating that [...] "open sexuality has to include everything" [...] including [...] "a husband/wife great big crime-fighting team... happily in love".|$|E
