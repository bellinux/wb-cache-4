5|$|Beyond {{the ruins}} of old Phlan, the party enters the slum area—one of two quests {{immediately}} available to new parties. This quest requires the clearing of the slum block and allows a new party to quickly gain experience. The second quest is to clear out Sokol Keep, located on Thorn Island. This fortified area is inhabited by the undead, {{which can only be}} defeated with silver weapons and magic. The characters' adventure is later expanded to encompass <b>the</b> <b>outlying</b> areas of the Moonsea region. Eventually, the player learns that an evil spirit named Tyranthraxus, who has possessed an ancient dragon, {{is at the root of}} Phlan's problems. The characters fight Tyranthraxus the Flamed One in a climactic final battle.|$|E
5|$|Halo: The Flood {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2552. Humanity has colonized {{hundreds}} of worlds across the galaxy, using faster-than-light drives and cryonic sleep to travel between worlds. Without warning, a collective of alien races known as the Covenant began attacking <b>the</b> <b>outlying</b> colonies, brutally exterminating all life by vitrifying the surface of the planets. Humanity, outnumbered and outclassed by the alien's superior technology, wages a losing war against the enemy. After the human bastion of Reach falls to the Covenant, the human ship Pillar of Autumn jumps into Slipspace to lead the Covenant away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Menage {{returned}} to Minneapolis {{and entered the}} real estate business with partner H. C. Brackett. Menage gradually built an empire by purchasing farmland at {{the fringes of the}} city, platting and developing the property into residential neighborhoods, then financing the mortgages for people to purchase the homes. He also worked with Thomas Lowry, head of the city's streetcar system, to ensure that new lines were built to serve <b>the</b> <b>outlying</b> areas he was developing. Much of the present day Prospect Park neighborhood, and the areas surrounding Lake Harriet and Lake Calhoun, were developed by Menage and his companies.|$|E

5|$|In 498 BC, {{supported}} by troops from Athens and Eretria, the Ionians marched on, captured, and burnt Sardis. However, on their return journey to Ionia, they {{were followed by}} Persian troops, and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus. This campaign was the only offensive action by the Ionians, who subsequently went on the defensive. The Persians responded in 497 BC with a three pronged attack aimed at recapturing <b>the</b> <b>outlying</b> areas of the rebellion, but {{the spread of the}} revolt to Caria meant that the largest army, under Daurises, relocated there. While initially campaigning successfully in Caria, this army was annihilated in an ambush at the Battle of Pedasus. This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 BC and 495 BC.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} option, the North Vietnamese could avoid <b>the</b> <b>outlying</b> South Vietnamese {{installations}} and strike directly at their primary target of Ban Me Thuot. For the first option to be successful, the North Vietnamese had to secure Highways 14, 19, and 21 to isolate Ban Me Thuot, and stop potential South Vietnamese reinforcements. The North Vietnamese favoured the first option, {{because it would}} give the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and other support units little or no time to respond. At the same time, the first option would have enabled a quick victory without inflicting large-scale damage on the civilian population of Ban Me Thuot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of May, the {{situation}} for the 50,000 Arab inhabitants {{of the city and}} the 30,000–40,000 in <b>the</b> <b>outlying</b> neighbourhoods was no better. After the massacre at Deir Yassin and the Jewish offensive of April that triggered the large-scale exodus of the Palestinian Arabs in other mixed cities, the Arab population of Jerusalem was frightened and feared for its fate. With the departure of the British on 14 May, the Haganah launched several operations to take control {{of the city and the}} local Arab leadership requested King Abdullah of Jordan to deploy his army to come to their aid.|$|E

Declines were particularly significant in <b>the</b> <b>outlying</b> islands, some of which remain vulnerable to ongoing losses. Although Orkney is in many ways very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these trends are very similar to those experienced elsewhere. The archipelago's population grew by 11% in the decade to 2011 as recorded by the census. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E
