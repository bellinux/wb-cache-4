In 1983, an unprecedented voluntary busing plan was put into place, integrating the schools without a mandated plan being required.|$|E
5|$|Heavy cruiser {{development}} steadied between World War I and World War II thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of the Washington Naval Treaty and successor {{treaties and}} conferences, where the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Italy agreed to limit heavy cruisers to 10,000tons displacement with 8-inch main armament. Up until the Alaska class, US cruisers designed between the wars followed this pattern.|$|E

After returning from the second cruise, Kansas was decommissioned and sold for scrap in August 1923 according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E
5|$|The term {{is mostly}} used in {{historical}} contexts {{and not in}} daily speech. In Danish, Skånelandene is used more often. The terms have no political implications as the region is not a geopolitical entity but a cultural region, without officially established political borders. In some circumstances, the term Skåneland, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> Skånelandskapen and Skånelandene, {{can also be used}} as a figure of speech for the province Scania.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were {{concerned}} {{that they would not}} be able to defeat the Ionian fleet and, therefore, would not be able to take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians. This approach was initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp. These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.|$|E

5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> {{agreed in}} December 1974, the {{talks between the}} Rhodesian {{government}} and the UANC were to take place within Rhodesia, but in the event the black nationalist leaders were loath to attend a conference on ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians, however, were keen {{to adhere to the}} accord and meet at a Rhodesian venue. In an effort to placate both sides, Kaunda and Vorster relaxed the terms so that the two sides would instead meet aboard a train provided by the South African government, placed halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge, on the Rhodesian–Zambian border. The Rhodesian delegates could therefore take their seats in Rhodesia and the nationalists, {{on the opposite side of}} the carriage, would be able to attend without leaving Zambia. As part of the détente policy, Kaunda and Vorster would act as mediators in the conference, which was set for 26 August 1975.|$|E

Furthermore, Disney retained {{the rights to}} make sequels to any Pixar film, though Pixar retained the {{right of first refusal}} to work on these sequels. In 2004, when the contentious negotiations between the two companies made a split appear likely, Michael Eisner, Disney chairman at the time, put plans in motion to produce Toy Story 3 at a new Disney studio, Circle 7 Animation. Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz Lightyear, indicated a willingness to return, even if Pixar was not on board.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of the Treaty of Versailles, {{all four}} Helgoland-class battleships were {{disarmed}} and surrendered as prizes of {{war to the}} Allies as replacements for the ships scuttled in Scapa Flow. On 21–22 November 1918, Helgoland steamed to Harwich to retrieve the crews of U-boats that had been surrendered there. She was then removed from active service on 16December 1918. Helgoland and her sisters were stricken from the German navy on 5November 1919. Helgoland was formally {{handed over to the}} United Kingdom on 5August 1920. She was scrapped at Morecambe; work began on 3March 1921. Helgolands coat of arms is currently preserved in the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E

5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> {{of the new}} alliance, {{during the}} late summer, the Christian fleet {{assembled}} at Messina, {{under the command of}} Don John of Austria, who arrived on 23 August. By that time, however, Famagusta had fallen, and any effort to save Cyprus was meaningless. Before setting sail for the east, Don John {{had to deal with the}} mutual distrust and hostility among the various contingents, especially between the Venetians and the Genoese. The Spanish admiral tackled the problem by breaking the various contingents up and mingle ships from various states. Doria assumed command of the right wing, Don Juan kept the centre, the Venetian Agostino Barbarigo received the left, and the Spaniard Alvaro de Bazan the reserve. Unaware of Famagusta's fate, the allied fleet left Messina on 16 September, and ten days later arrived at Corfu, where it learned of the Ottoman victory. The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Müezzinzade Ali Pasha, had anchored at Lepanto (Nafpaktos), near the entrance of the Corinthian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the repatriation effort, Montana was transferred to the west coast of the United States. She arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Seattle on 16 August, where she remained until 2 February 1921, when she was decommissioned. During this period of inactivity, she was renamed Missoula on 7 June 1920 so her original name could be used for one of the planned South Dakota-class battleships, and she reclassified with the hull number CA-13. Though decommissioned in 1921, the ship remained in the Navy's inventory until 15 July 1930, when she was formally stricken from the naval register, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of the London Naval Treaty, which placed aggregate tonnage limits on the cruiser fleets of the signatory countries. She was sold to John Irwin Jr. on 29 September and was eventually broken up in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Although the United States Navy was {{prevented}} from developing fortifications on the Aleutian Islands due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of the Washington Naval Treaty, the Navy believed {{that at some}} point the United States' treaty obligations would no longer apply, and began to scout the Aleutians for possible naval bases. In 1923, two scouting ships investigated the possibility of establishing anchorages off the Islands, and attempted to claim the United States Army's bases on the Aleutians for the purposes of national security.|$|E

5|$|During the First World War, she {{was part}} of the Battleship Division Nine, which was {{attached}} to the British Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron. During the war, she was primarily tasked with patrolling in the North Sea and escorting convoys to Norway. She served in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets throughout the 1920s, and in 1931–1932, she was converted into a training ship according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of the London Naval Treaty of 1930.|$|E
5|$|Each {{breakdown}} or setback {{during the}} early years of Smith's premiership prompted press speculation that Harper might replace him. In 1966, when Smith brought a working document back from the HMS Tiger talks with the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, Harper led opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> in Cabinet, contributing to their rejection. Harper resigned from the Rhodesian Front in 1968, soon after Smith dismissed him from the Cabinet, reportedly because Harper had had an extramarital affair with a British agent. He subsequently became a vocal critic of the Prime Minister, greeting each step Smith made towards settlement with black nationalists during the Bush War with public indignation. By the time majority rule began in Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, following the Internal Settlement of the previous year, Harper had left for South Africa. He died in 2006 at the age of 90.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{a significant portion}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of the Armistice. Rheinland and her three sisters were not among the ships listed for internment, so they remained in German ports. However, a copy of The Times informed von Reuter that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Rear Admiral von Reuter came to the conclusion that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.|$|E
