However he has also been criticised for <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> his prose.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Army {{captured}} {{large numbers}} of German armored vehicles, including Panzer IVs (Russian designation T-4). Some of them were pressed into temporary service and some others were used for training. Sometimes, captured tanks were used in different temporary units or as single tanks. While captured Tigers and Panthers were only permitted to be used until they broke down, <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the Panzer IV and {{the large number of}} captured parts allowed for repair and continued use.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed in late May, co-directed by the singer and her {{production}} team, Haus of Gaga. The video is simple in contrast to much of Gaga's previous work, and portrays her dancing on a fire-escape and walking on a lonely street. Differences include the lack of intricate choreography and back-up dancers, as well as using only one outfit designed by Versace. Critics lauded <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the video, while comparing it to the works of Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson and Madonna. Gaga has performed the song in award shows, music festivals and her concert tours.|$|E

5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the scene.|$|E

The process is used primarily to weld iron and steels (including stainless steel) but aluminium, nickel and copper alloys can also be welded with this method.|$|E

5|$|In January 2009, Ubisoft {{announced}} that it had signed a licensing agreement with ABC Studios to develop a video game based on Grey's Anatomy. Designed for the Wii, Nintendo DS, and PC, Grey's Anatomy: The Video Game was released on March 10, 2009. The game lets the player {{assume the role of}} one of the main characters, making decisions for the character's personal and professional life, and competing in a number of minigames. It has been criticized by reviewers because of <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the mini-games and voice actors who do not play the same characters on the series, with Jason Ocampo of IGN giving it a 6.0/10 overall rating. The Wii release received mixed reviews, and the Windows release received generally unfavorable reviews.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} the game mechanics, Naka {{was inspired by}} Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.|$|E
5|$|Refined cuisine {{could be}} moralized {{as a sign}} of either civilized {{progress}} or decadent decline. The early Imperial historian Tacitus contrasted the indulgent luxuries of the Roman table in his day with <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the Germanic diet of fresh wild meat, foraged fruit, and cheese, unadulterated by imported seasonings and elaborate sauces. Most often, because of the importance of landowning in Roman culture, produce—cereals, legumes, vegetables, and fruit—was considered a more civilized form of food than meat. The Mediterranean staples of bread, wine, and oil were sacralized by Roman Christianity, while Germanic meat consumption became a mark of paganism, as it might be the product of animal sacrifice.|$|E

It was nominated for awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). Reviewers praised Flows visual and audio appeal, but noted <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> its gameplay; several considered it to be more of an art piece than a game.|$|E
5|$|Having {{published}} many novels, {{essays and}} short stories, Narayan {{is credited with}} bringing Indian writing {{to the rest of}} the world. While he has been regarded as one of India's greatest writers of the twentieth century, critics have also described his writings with adjectives such as charming, harmless and benign. Narayan has also come in for criticism from later writers, particularly of Indian origin, who have classed his writings as having a pedestrian style with a shallow vocabulary and a narrow vision. According to Shashi Tharoor, Narayan's subjects are similar to those of Jane Austen as they both deal with a very small section of society. However, he adds that while Austen's prose was able to take those subjects beyond ordinariness, Narayan's was not. A similar opinion is held by Shashi Deshpande who characterizes Narayan's writings as pedestrian and naive because of <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> his language and diction, combined with the lack of any complexity in the emotions and behaviours of his characters.|$|E
5|$|Song Reader, {{a project}} Beck {{released}} in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, {{in the hopes}} that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create <b>the</b> <b>simplicity</b> <b>of</b> the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.|$|E
