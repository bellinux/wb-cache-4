40|$|A {{subset of}} {{mitochondrial}} group II introns of flowering plants has, over evolutionary time, lost characteristic features and employs unconventional splicing pathways. Given {{the potential impact}} of cold treatment on RNA folding, as well as on enzymatic activity and import of nuclear-encoded splicing machinery, I have examined the physical excised forms of aberrant introns from wheat embryos subjected to 4 oC. My findings suggest a shift in biochemistry with cold treatment to novel splicing pathways that generate heterogeneous in vivo circularized forms for nad 1 intron 2, nad 2 intron 1 and the cox 2 intron, in contrast to predominantly linear excised intron forms at room temperature. Interestingly, the highly degenerate nad 1 intron 1, which due to DNA rearrangement has been broken into two halves that interact for splicing in trans, is excised exclusively by first-step hydrolysis at room temperature and under cold treatment. In this case, splicing culminates in two distinct linear half introns that appears correlated with an unusual 5 ’ <b>terminal</b> <b>insert.</b> This represents the first in vivo demonstration of hydrolytic trans-splicing. Based on northern analysis, cold treatment was further associated with reduced splicing efficiency for all introns surveyed. Moreover, study of precursor transcripts of the nad 1 a-intron 1 a locus suggests the efficiency of end-maturation, including processing of the cotranscribed tRNA-Pro gene, is also reduced in the cold. My findings demonstrate a temperature-sensitivity of transcript maturation, particularly for RNA splicing, providing new insight into the impact of cold growth conditions on plant mitochondrial gene expression...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMicrotubule {{associated}} protein tau, {{which is}} expressed in six alternatively spliced molecular isoforms in human brain, is abnormally hyperphosphorylated in Alzheimer disease and related tauopathies. Here, we show (i) that GSK- 3 α and neither GSK- 3 β nor cdk 5 can phosphorylate tau at Ser 262 and phosphorylation at Ser 235 by cdk 5 primes phosphorylation at Thr 231 by GSK- 3 α/β; (ii) that tau isoforms with two N-terminal inserts (τ 4 L, τ 3 L) are phosphorylated by cdk 5 plus GSK- 3 at Thr 231 markedly more than isoforms lacking these inserts (τ 4, τ 3); and (iii) that Thr 231 is phosphorylated ∼ 50 % more in free tau than in microtubule-bound tau, and the phosphorylation at this site results in the dissociation of tau from microtubules.

40|$|Recently, {{mutations}} {{within the}} tau gene {{have been associated}} with some familial forms of frontotemporal dementia. To investigate whether tau gene mutations are also associated with Pick's disease, we analyzed the tau gene in 30 cases of pathologically confirmed Pick's disease. Two coding mutations were identified in separate cases of Pick's disease. A glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon 389 was detected in 1 case and a lysine-to-threonine mutation at codon 257 was identified in another. Analysis of dephosphorylated tau from the brain of the patient with the codon 389 mutation revealed a prominent band representing tau, with four microtubule-binding domains and no amino <b>terminal</b> <b>inserts.</b> This is in contrast to Pick's disease without any tau gene mutations, which consist of tau with mainly three microtubule-binding domains and only a trace of tau, with four microtubule-binding domains. Functional analysis of tau with these two mutations demonstrated a reduced ability of tau to promote microtubule assembly. Surprisingly, these mutations increased tau's susceptibility to calpain I digestion, suggesting that this feature {{may be related to the}} formation of a Pick type of histology. Moreover, these data suggest that Pick's disease is not a separate entity but part of the frontotemporal dementia disease spectrum...|$|R

At an age of one week, homozygous mice began to retard compared to their wild type and heterozygous littermates. Two weeks after birth, animals started to progressively lose weight and die before weaning. Heterozygous mice showed a moderate increase of T-cells and granulocytes but survived to adulthood and were fertile. In homozygous and heterozygous mice Gfi 1 and Gcsf mRNA levels were upregulated, possibly explaining the increment in immature myeloid cells detected in these mice.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{insertion}} of axonally transported fucosyl glycoproteins into the axolemma of regenerating nerve sprouts was examined in rat sciatic motor axons at intervals after nerve crush.

The complete genome sequence of GX 0101 is 178, 101 nucleotides (nt) and contains only one REV-LTR insert at a site 267 nt upstream of the sorf 2 gene. Moreover, GX 0101 has 5 repeats of a 217 -nt fragment in its terminal repeat short (TRS) region and 3 repeats in internal repeat short (IRS) region, {{compared to the other}} 10 strains with only 1 or 2 repeats in both TRS and IRS. Marek’s disease virus (MDV) {{is a member of the}} Alphaherpes-virinae subfamily, and its genome contains a linear double-strand DNA of about 175 kb. MDV causes Marek’s disease in chickens with lymphomas (14). So far, the genome sequences of a total of 10 MDV strains have been analyzed (4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16). The GX 0101 strain in this report was the first recombinant MDV field strain containing the reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) long <b>terminal</b> repeat (LTR) <b>insert</b> (17), and it is a very virulent MDV with higher horizontal transmission ability (1, 12).

40|$|The lingual nerve {{injury is}} a serious {{neurological}} complication which may interfere with the patient’s daily activity, and adversely affect the psychological state of the patient. Aims: This study has three aims: (1) To determine the anatomical course and potential variations that may contribute to lingual nerve injury, (2) Assess {{the effectiveness of the}} ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting bur injury with reference to optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, and (3) Compare the amount of damage of the lingual nerve caused by using two different surgical burs. Materials and Methods: This cadaveric research involved the study of 14 hemi-mandibles for: (a) obtaining morphometrical measurements of the lingual nerve position to three landmarks on the alveolar ridge, and (b) determining the number of <b>terminal</b> branches <b>inserting</b> in the ventral surface of the tongue. In the subsequent part of the study, twelve lingual nerves were exposed to injury using two different types of burs (Carbide bur and Dentium bur). The amount of damage caused by the two burs was first measured using OCT. Subsequently, the same lingual nerves were scanned with ultrasound and MRI to assess their capability in detecting the lingual nerve injury. Result: The mean distance between the twelve lingual nerves and the alveolar ridge was 12. 32 mm, and they were located 11. 82 mm from the lower border of the mandible. These distances were varied when near the first molar (M 1), second molar (M 2) and third molar (M 3). The lingual nerve coursed {{on the floor of the}} mouth for approximately 25. 17 mm before it deviated toward the tongue anywhere between the mesial of M 1 and distal of M 2. Eleven lingual nerves were found to loop around the submandibular duct for an average distance of 6. 91 mm. Their looping occurred anywhere between the M 2 and M 3. In 72. 7 % of the cases the loop started around the M 3 region while it mostly ended at between M 1 -M 2 (63. 6 %). The lingual nerve gave out as many as 4 branches at its <b>terminal</b> end to <b>insert</b> in the ventral surface of the tongue, with 2 branches being the most common pattern. With regards to damage caused by surgical burs, at high speed (1500 rpm), the Dentium bur caused deeper [0. 22 (SE 0. 04) mm] and wider [1. 87 (SE 0. 25) mm] laceration than the Carbide bur. Statistically there was no significant different between the OCT recording of damage and the ultrasound reading, while the MRI failed to detect the lingual nerve. Conclusion: An awareness of the variations of the lingual nerve is important to prevent any untoward complications or nerve neuropathy. In addition, it appears to be more favorable to use a Carbide bur for surgical procedure (preferably at a low speed) as it minimizes damage to the lingual nerve. The ultrasound scanning capability in detecting the lingual nerve injury would provide an objective evaluation for the amount of nerve damage in-vivo. It is hoped that these findings will be useful for planning surgical procedures in the posterior floor of the oral cavity...|$|R

Over a 4 -year period, all patients with complete mandibular edentulism or irreparably compromised mandibular dentition, who will restore the masticatory function with a fixed mandibular prosthesis, were considered for inclusion in this study. The “Ball Welding Bar” (BWB) technique is characterised by smooth prosthetic cylinders, interconnected by means of titanium bars which are adjustable in terms of distance from ball <b>terminals</b> and are <b>inserted</b> in the rotating rings of the cylinders. All the components are welded and self-posing. Results.

40|$|One {{approach}} to gene therapy for AIDS is {{to block the}} replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) by inhibiting that tat gene, whose product activates the expression of all HIV- 1 genes. To accomplish this, we constructed an antitat gene expressing an RNA with dual (polymeric TAR and antisense-tat) function {{in an attempt to}} both sequester Tat protein and block its translation from mRNA. A minigene consisting of the antitat gene driven by the HIV- 1 long <b>terminal</b> repeat was <b>inserted</b> into a double-copy retrovirus vector, such that antitat expression would be upregulated only in HIV- 1 -infected cells. After transduction of a T-lymphocytic cell line (Molt- 3) the antitat gene inhibited HIV- 1 replication. This inhibition was inversely correlated with the virus infections dose. Virus replication was also inhibited for 5 months in two different T-cell lines after they had been infected at a high multiplicity of infection, suggesting that the antitat gene may be effective over long periods. Importantly, antitat blocked the replication and the cytopathic effect of HIV- 1 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and led to as much as 4, 000 -fold inhibition of the replication of an HIV- 1 field isolate as well as HIV- 1 prototypes maintained in culture.

The exploration of these reactions have {{led to the development of}} efficient syntheses of the important heterocycles coumarins and 2 -quinolones.; 3, 4 -Disubstituted coumarins are efficiently synthesized by the palladium-catalyzed annulation of internal alkynes by o-iodophenols in the presence of just one atmosphere of carbon monoxide. The use of a sterically unhindered pyridine base is essential to achieve high yields. The reaction accommodates a number of organic functional groups both on the alkyne and the o-iodophenol, thus affording a wide variety of coumarins in moderate to good yields. The main disadvantage of the process is formation of mixtures of regioisomers in reactions employing unsymmetrical alkynes.;The use of N-substituted o-iodoanilines as annulating agents provides an efficient synthesis of 3, 4 -disubstituted 2 -quinolones. In this process, the selection of the nitrogen protecting group is crucial for the success of the reaction. The best results are obtained utilizing alkyl carbamates, tosylamides and trifluoroacetamides. The major features of this process are similar to those of the coumarin synthesis.;These annulation processes are the first examples of the insertion of an alkyne into the arylpalladium bond occurring in preference to the insertion of CO. We have shown that the unusual order of insertion arises from the low reactivity of the initially formed acylpalladium complex towards internal alkynes.;Utilizing the reaction conditions developed for the carbonylative annulation of internal alkynes we have been able to affect the carbonylative annulation of terminal alkynes by o-iodophenols or o-iodoaniline derivatives to afford coumarins or 2 -quinolones, respectively, in modest yields. The formation of coumarins and 2 -quinolones in this process is in stark contrast with all previously described palladium-catalyzed carbonylative annulations of terminal alkynes, which have afforded chromones and 4 -quinolones. Moreover, under our reaction conditions <b>terminal</b> alkynes <b>insert</b> into the carbon-palladium bond instead of undergoing a Sonogashira-type coupling.

This study aims to understand the course of the lingual nerve from the molar area until its insertion into the tongue muscle.

The mean distance between the fourteen lingual nerves and the alveolar ridge was 12. 36 mm, and they were located 12. 03 mm from the lower border of the mandible.

The lingual nerve coursed {{on the floor of the}} mouth for approximately 25. 43 mm before it deviated toward the tongue anywhere between the mesial of M 1 and distal of M 2. Thirteen lingual nerves were found to loop around the submandibular duct for an average distance of 6. 92 mm (95 % CI: 5. 24 to 8. 60 mm). Their looping occurred anywhere between the M 2 and M 3.

40|$|We {{propose that}} the initial event in the {{secretion}} of proteins across membranes and their insertion into membranes is the spontaneous penetration of the hydrophobic portion of the bilayer by a helical hair-pin. Energetic considerations of polypeptide struc-tures in a nonpolar, lipid environment compared with an aqueous environment suggest that only a and 3,,, helices will be observed in the hydrophobic interior of membranes. Insertion of a polypeptide is accomplished by a hairpin structure composed of two helices, which will partition into membranes if the free energy arising from burying hydrophobic helical surfaces exceeds the free energy “cost ” of burying potentially charged and hydrogen-bonding groups. We suggest, for example, that the hydro-phobic leader peptide found in secreted proteins and in many membrane proteins forms one of these helices and is oriented in the membrane with its N terminus inside. In secreted proteins, the leader functions by pulling polar portions of a protein into the membrane as the second helix of the hairpin. The occurrence of all categories of membrane pro-teins can be rationalized by the hydrophobic or hydrophilic character of the two helices of the in-serted hairpin and, for some integral membrane proteins, by events in which a single <b>terminal</b> helix is <b>inserted.</b> We propose that, because of the distri-bution of polar and nonpolar sequences in the poly-peptide sequence, secretion and the insertion of membrane proteins are spontaneous processes {{that do not require}} the participation of additional specific membrane receptors or transport proteins...|$|R
40|$|Background. HIV- 1 {{integrase}} (IN) catalyses the retroviral integration process, removing two nucleotides {{from each}} long <b>terminal</b> repeat and <b>inserting</b> the processed viral DNA into the target DNA. It is widely {{assumed that the}} strand transfer step has no sequence specificity. However, recently, {{it has been reported}} by several groups that integration sites display a preference for palindromic sequences, suggesting that a symmetry in the target DNA may stabilise the tetrameric organisation of IN in the synaptic complex. Methodology/Principal Findings. We assessed the ability of several palindromecontaining sequences to organise tetrameric IN and investigated the ability of IN to catalyse DNA cleavage at internal positions. Only one palindromic sequence was successfully cleaved by IN. Interestingly, this symmetrical sequence corresponded to the 2 -LTR junction of retroviral DNA circles—a palindrome similar but not identical to the consensus sequence found at integration sites. This reaction depended strictly on the cognate retroviral sequence of IN and required a full-length wild-type IN. Furthermore, the oligomeric state of IN responsible for this cleavage differed from that involved in the 39 -processing reaction. Palindromic cleavage strictly required the tetrameric form, whereas 39 -processing was efficiently catalysed by a dimer. Conclusions/Significance. Our findings suggest that the restriction-like cleavage of palindromic sequences may be a general physiological activity of retroviral INs and that IN tetramerisation is strongly favoured by DNA symmetry, either at the target site for the concerted integration or when the DNA contains the 2 -LTR junction in the case of th...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that pathogenic, coagulaseopositive staphylococci are avidly phagocyfized by human leukocytes in in vitro systems in which pneumococci, streptococci, and Klebsiella are rarely ingested (25). These studies further demonstrated that such coagulase-posifive staphylococci may survive {{for long periods}} of time within the leukocyte. During the course of experiments on the disappearance of staphylococci from the blood stream of rabbits following a single injection of large numbers of microorganisms, an abrupt reduction in the rate of clearance was consistently noted 10 to 15 minutes following the injection of staphylococci. This abrupt slowing of the clearance rate resulted in a persistent low grade bacteriemla which could not be satisfactorily explained by saturation of known removal mechanisms. The studies to be reported in this paper indicate that coagulase-positive staphylococci are swiftly ingested by circulating leukocytes in the blood stream of rabbits, and that such intra-leukocytic residence may act to prevent their effective removal from the circulation. Materials and Methods Rabb/ts. [...] Healthy male rabbits of mixed stock weighing from 2. 8 to 3. 8 kilograms were in these experiments. Preparation oJ Rabb~s.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of transgenesisi in axolotls {{is crucial for}} studying development and regeneration, as it would allow for long-term fate tracing as well as gene expression analysis, therefore {{we were interested in}} both obtaining animals expresing the transgene with little mosaicism in F 0 generation and transgenesis. We demonstrate here that plasmid injection into one cell stage axolotl embryo generates transgenic animals that display germline transmission of a transgene. However, the efficiency of simple plasmid injection is very low, expression of the transgene is mosaic and seems to be promoter dependant. We have tested several methods of transgenesis developed in other systems. First we used Adeno-Associated Viral <b>Terminal</b> Repeats <b>inserted</b> into the injected construct to enhance the expression level of the transgene and reduce mosaicism. However, in the axolotl system we do not observe the enhancement of expression. Moreover, the expression appeared to be transient and disappeared after two months. Further, we tested the effect of the inclusion of ISceI meganuclease in the injections, succesful transgenesis method in the medaka system. It resulted in a higher percentage of F 0 animals displaying strong, stable expression throughout the body. This represents the first demonstration in the axolotl of germline transmission of the transgene. Using this technique we have generated a germline transgenic anima expressing GFP ubiquitously in all tissue examined. We have used this anima to study cell fate in the dirsal fin during development. We have discovered a contribution of somite cells to dorsal fin mesenchyme in the axolotl, which was previously assumed to derive solely from neural crest. We have also studied the role of blood during tail regeneration by transplanting the ventral blood-forming region from GFP+ embryos into unlabeled host. During tail regeneration, we do not observe GFP+ cells contributing to muscle or nerve, suggesting that during tail regeneration blood stem cells do not undergo significant plasticity. We are interested in characterization of pluripotency of blastema cells. Previously, {{it has been shown that}} neural progenitor cells form the spinal cord can transdifferentiate to muscle and other tissue types in the regenerating tail. To test if blastema cells have the potency of differentiating into a neural tissue, we transplanted GFP+ 4 day blastema into an injured spinal cord. Our result shows that blastema cells don't seem to contribute to the regenerating spinal cord...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: HIV- 1 {{integrase}} (IN) catalyses the retroviral integration process, removing two nucleotides {{from each}} long <b>terminal</b> repeat and <b>inserting</b> the processed viral DNA into the target DNA. It is widely {{assumed that the}} strand transfer step has no sequence specificity. However, recently, {{it has been reported}} by several groups that integration sites display a preference for palindromic sequences, suggesting that a symmetry in the target DNA may stabilise the tetrameric organisation of IN in the synaptic complex. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We assessed the ability of several palindrome-containing sequences to organise tetrameric IN and investigated the ability of IN to catalyse DNA cleavage at internal positions. Only one palindromic sequence was successfully cleaved by IN. Interestingly, this symmetrical sequence corresponded to the 2 -LTR junction of retroviral DNA circles-a palindrome similar but not identical to the consensus sequence found at integration sites. This reaction depended strictly on the cognate retroviral sequence of IN and required a full-length wild-type IN. Furthermore, the oligomeric state of IN responsible for this cleavage differed from that involved in the 3 '-processing reaction. Palindromic cleavage strictly required the tetrameric form, whereas 3 '-processing was efficiently catalysed by a dimer. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that the restriction-like cleavage of palindromic sequences may be a general physiological activity of retroviral INs and that IN tetramerisation is strongly favoured by DNA symmetry, either at the target site for the concerted integration or when the DNA contains the 2 -LTR junction {{in the case of the}} palindromic internal cleavage...|$|R
40|$|GX 0101, Marek’s disease virus (MDV) strain {{with a long}} <b>terminal</b> repeat (LTR) <b>insert</b> of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), was {{isolated}} from CVI 988 /Rispens vaccinated birds showing tumors. We have constructed a LTR deleted strain GX 0101 ∆LTR in our previous study. To compare the host responses to GX 0101 and GX 0101 ∆LTR, chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) cells were infected with two MDV strains and a gene-chip containing chicken genome {{was employed to examine}} gene transcription changes in host cells in the present study. Of the 42 368 chicken transcripts on the chip, there were 2199 genes that differentially expressed in CEF infected with GX 0101 compared to GX 0101 ∆LTR significantly. Differentially expressed genes were distributed to 25 possible gene networks according to their intermolecular connections and were annotated to 56 pathways. The insertion of REV LTR showed the greatest influence on cancer formation and metastasis, followed with immune changes, atherosclerosis and nervous system disorders in MDV-infected CEF cells. Based on these bio functions, GX 0101 infection was predicated with a greater growth and survival inhibition but lower oncogenicity in chickens than GX 0101 ∆LTR, at least in the acute phase of infection. In summary, the insertion of REV LTR altered the expression of host genes in response to MDV infection, possibly resulting in novel phenotypic properties in chickens. Our study has provided the evidence of retroviral insertional changes of host responses to herpesvirus infection for the first time, which will promote to elucidation of the possible relationship between the LTR insertion and the observed phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that NOD. c 3 c 4 mice develop spontaneous autoimmune biliary disease (ABD) with anti-mitochondrial Abs, histopathological lesions, and autoimmune T lymphocytes similar to human primary biliary cholangitis. In this article, we demonstrate that ABD in NOD. c 3 c 4 and related NOD ABD strains {{is caused by}} a chromosome 1 region that includes a novel mutation in polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (Pkhd 1). We show that a long <b>terminal</b> repeat element <b>inserted</b> into intron 35 exposes an alternative polyadenylation site, resulting in a truncated Pkhd 1 transcript. A novel NOD congenic mouse expressing aberrant Pkhd 1, but lacking the c 3 and c 4 chromosomal regions (NOD. Abd 3), reproduces the immunopathological features of NOD ABD. RNA sequencing of NOD. Abd 3 common bile duct early in disease demonstrates upregulation of genes involved in cholangiocyte injury/morphology and downregulation of immunoregulatory genes. Consistent with this, bone marrow chimera studies show that aberrant Pkhd 1 must be expressed in the target tissue (cholangiocytes) and the immune system (bone marrow). Mutations of Pkhd 1 produce biliary abnormalities in mice but have not been previously associated with autoimmunity. In this study, we eliminate clinical biliary disease by backcrossing this Pkhd 1 mutation onto the C 57 BL/ 6 genetic background; thus, the NOD genetic background (which promotes autoimmunity) is essential for disease. We propose that loss of functional Pkhd 1 on the NOD background produces early bile duct abnormalities, initiating a break in tolerance that leads to autoimmune cholangitis in NOD. Abd 3 congenic mice. This model is important for understanding loss of tolerance to cholangiocytes and is relevant to the pathogenesis of several human cholangiopathies...|$|R
40|$|Basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) {{proteins}} comprise one of {{the largest}} transcription factor families and play important roles in diverse cellular and molecular processes. Comprehensive analyses of the composition and evolution of the bHLH family in cotton are essential to elucidate their functions and the molecular basis of cotton development. By searching bHLH homologous genes in sequenced diploid cotton genomes (Gossypium raimondii and G. arboreum), a set of cotton bHLH reference genes containing 289 paralogs were identified and named as GobHLH 001 - 289. Based on their phylogenetic relationships, these cotton bHLH proteins were clustered into 27 subfamilies. Compared to those in Arabidopsis and cacao, cotton bHLH proteins generally increased in number, but unevenly in different subfamilies. To further uncover evolutionary changes of bHLH genes during tetraploidization of cotton, all genes of S 5 a and S 5 b subfamilies in upland cotton and its diploid progenitors were cloned and compared, and their transcript profiles were determined in upland cotton. A total of 10 genes of S 5 a and S 5 b subfamilies (doubled from A- and D-genome progenitors) maintained in tetraploid cottons. The major sequence changes in upland cotton included a 15 -bp in-frame deletion in GhbHLH 130 D and a long <b>terminal</b> repeat retrotransposon <b>inserted</b> in GhbHLH 062 A, which eliminated GhbHLH 062 A expression in various tissues. The S 5 a and S 5 b bHLH genes of A and D genomes (except GobHLH 062) showed similar transcription patterns in various tissues including roots, stems, leaves, petals, ovules, and fibers, while the A- and D-genome genes of GobHLH 110 and GobHLH 130 displayed clearly different transcript profiles during fiber development. In total, this study represented a genome-wide analysis of cotton bHLH family, and revealed significant changes in sequence and expression of these genes in tetraploid cottons, which paved the way for further functional analyses of bHLH genes in the cotton genus...|$|R
5000|$|After the incident, Duffy the {{administrator}} announces {{that all is}} safe and that mining operations will recommence soon. It is this that Professor Ingosol disagrees. He believes that they [...] "must evacuate immediately!" [...] to which Duffy replies, [...] "where to?" [...] "To KL-5." [...] KL-5 was the original set up ship to get to Io. It was designed to provide the colonists with all the systems necessary to begin the colony. However, the ship was also designed to {{not be used for}} long distance travel; most of the station has been gutted out to install the systems on Io. KL-5 is also a derelict station, not having been used for nearly 10 years. Michael talks his dad into taking up professor Ingosol to check out the station after hearing his and Duffy's exchange. Against his better judgment, they are soon jetting up to KL-5 on the tug with 2 stowaways, Michael and Kumiko. Due to the security system designed to monitor the colony and surrounding space, Duffy is alerted to an unauthorised tug takeoff. With this he tries to contact the tug. The explanation by the 'rogue pilot' is that he was giving the tug's engines a test fire. As they approach the station, the remote access system designed to reactivate the system does not respond. Professor Ingosol suggests that they go in through the garbage chute and reactivate the power. There's only one problem, it's too small for adults but just the right size for a pair of teenagers. Michael and Kumiko, who have now been discovered, become the reluctant explorers of the derelict station. There's also another catch: the power packs on the environmental suits are both very low; only 10 minutes of air is available. The location of the garbage chute is close to the stations hub so they should make it in time. Meanwhile, back on the colony, Carl and the other scientists run into the control station and explain to Duffy that the mining charges they were using to redirect the lava flow away from the main shaft have now fractured the substrata, and lava is now pouring into all of the tunnels. It is now just a race against time. Duffy recontacts the tug and orders them to reactivate the station. At this time, Michael and Kumiko have both made it into the station. However, the station was redesigned and no longer fits the layout as explained by Professor Ingosol. Just as they are about to turn back, Kumiko leads them following computer cables into the main hub. At this, the view screen back in the colony and in the tug of the operation is disrupted due to company security systems designed to secure the station. As they descend the stairs into the station, warning lights come on indicating that they only have 1 minute of air left. After getting to the main <b>terminal</b> and <b>inserting</b> the main boot disc, the system remains dead. After several tries, there is not much time left. Michael hits the computer and the station begins whirring to life. The station's magnificent solar sails open up to absorb the sunlight from the sun and to also restart the power and life systems. Soon the station has breathable oxygen and both Michael and Kumiko declare that [...] "KL-5 is ready for passengers." ...|$|R
