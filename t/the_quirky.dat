5|$|After {{multiple}} {{years and}} failed petitions, Mother 3 was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 within a Japanese television commercial for Mother 1+2, a port of Mother and Mother 2 to the Advance. The game kept its original story {{and received a}} graphical overhaul in a pixelated style similar to Mother 2. The game's themes included human physiology, renewal, and fungibility on the morality spectrum. Its music was composed by Shogo Sakai, and retained <b>the</b> <b>quirky</b> style of series composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Mother 3 was released on April 20, 2006 in Japan, whereupon it became a bestseller. It has not been released outside Japan.|$|E

A notable feature of the video was dancer Craig Allen Rothwell, known as Spazz Attack, whose signature dance move, a forward flip onto his back, drew him significant attention.|$|E

5000|$|In 2001's All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music, critic Chris Woodstra called Blaze of Glory [...] "a {{pleasant}} {{amalgam of}} '60s pure pop and <b>the</b> <b>quirkier</b> elements of new wave" [...] that [...] "only hinted at the band's potential." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{influence}} {{of popular music}} of the 1930s {{can be seen in}} Weinzweig’s work, especially his Divertimentos No.2 and 3, which mimic <b>the</b> <b>quirky</b> rhythms of this music. His Divertimento No. 8 and Out of the Blue exhibit elements of both blues and ragtime. Even his Violin Concerto and Wind Quartet show characteristics of blues in their melodies.|$|E
25|$|The {{messages}} were usually {{unrelated to the}} episodes. They were a humorous device that invited the viewer to return to <b>the</b> <b>quirky,</b> down-on-his-luck world of Jim Rockford. The messages usually {{had to do with}} creditors, deadbeat clients, or were just oddball vignettes. Numerous celebrities and well-known contemporary public figures were used in the recordings. Though a distinctive and clever entry device, the messages became difficult for the writers to create. Suggestions from staffers and crew were welcome and often used.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>quirky</b> scoring {{is part of}} the {{attraction}} of the game. While the maximum possible score is 20 (not including spotting truths accidentally included by the other panellists), contestants have many opportunities to lose points since they lose one for every incorrect challenge. The highest total score for any game was 9 by Lloyd Langford (in Series 13 Episode 2) and Graeme Garden (in Series 8 Episode 4), who also had the highest non-winning score of 6 (Series 1 Episode 6). The lowest game total was -6 in Series 4 Episode 4.|$|E

The text was written by the American author Ben Marcus.|$|R
25|$|In 1986, actor Chevy Chase {{bought the}} rights to Jay Cronley's novel Funny Farm. The story is a comedy about a couple from New York City that move to a small New England town, and <b>the</b> <b>quirky</b> {{troubles}} and encounters they have. Chase and his business partner Bruce Bodner hired Boam to adapt the book for film. The three spent several weeks developing the script. The screenplay was originally episodic, mirroring {{the structure of the}} novel. When George Roy Hill was hired as director, he insisted a new script be written, with a more definitive plot. Boam, Chase, and Bodner then spent the remainder of the year rewriting the screenplay.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} a {{homage to the}} cult {{television}} series Twin Peaks and features seven cast members of the series: Sherilyn Fenn, Sheryl Lee, Dana Ashbrook, Robyn Lively, Lenny Von Dohlen, Catherine E.

500|$|Reviewers also {{compared}} Firefly to Whedon's other series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Chocano {{noted that}} the series lacks the psychological tension of Buffy, and suggests {{that this might be}} attributable to the episodes being aired out of order. MSN, on the other hand, pointed out that after viewing the DVD boxed set {{it was easy to see}} why the program had attracted many die-hard fans. [...] "All of Whedon's fingerprints are there: the witty dialogue, <b>the</b> <b>quirky</b> premises and dark exploration of human fallacy that made Buffy brilliant found their way to this space drama".|$|E

500|$|The {{increasingly}} personal tone of {{her writing}} continued on 1989's The Sensual World. One of <b>the</b> <b>quirkiest</b> tracks on <b>the</b> album, touched by Bush's black humour, is [...] "Heads We're Dancing", {{about a woman}} who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the morning that he is Adolf Hitler.

500|$|GQ writer Dan Fierman said Parks and Recreation {{appeared}} to be [...] "approaching early Simpsons-levels in its absurdity and comic pacing". He suggested this {{could be due to}} the use of Mike Scully, a veteran comic writer with the animated series, as a consulting producer on Parks and Recreation. In an article reflecting on the Parks and Recreation second season, which became critically acclaimed following poor season one reviews, Slate magazine writer Jonah Weiner said the plot of [...] "The Camel" [...] "can be read as something of a Season 2 mission statement". Weiner compared Leslie's decision to submit <b>the</b> <b>quirky</b> collage rather than the safer bet as reflective of the Parks and Recreation writing staff's apparent decision [...] "to ride their zaniest whims rather than tamp them down for something more readily recognizable as a hit sitcom".|$|E
500|$|... "Time Capsule" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alex Strachan of the Montreal Gazette {{called it}} a [...] "near-perfect episode" [...] featuring brisk timing, laugh-out-loud jokes and heartwarming moments of civic unity. Strachan praised Michael Schur's script for being [...] "funny without being hurtful or vicious, heartwarming without being mawkish or sentimental". New York magazine writer Steve Kandell said the fact that Will Forte's character segued believably from a loon to a believable and sympathetic father {{was a sign of}} the script's strength. Kandell said, [...] "Could the character have been more over-the-top? Sure. But in the long run, it’s not just funnier, but more dramatic, that he’s not." [...] Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "Time Capsule", which she said highlighted how <b>the</b> <b>quirky</b> setting of Pawnee itself contributed a major part to the show's success. Busis said the town's eccentricities were on great display during the public scenes, but did not feel forced or over-the-top. Barry Hertz of the National Post praised both the episode and Forte, whose eccentric performance he said fit in well {{with the rest of the}} show. Hertz said, [...] "Every single element on this show is on fire right now, from Andy’s naive stupidity and infatuation with April to Ben’s continued surprise at what Pawnee has to offer." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rie Himukai (Himukai Rie) is <b>the</b> <b>quirkiest</b> of <b>the</b> GA-2 members. Her mother sells {{antiques}} {{and her father}} has a photocopy store. She has a night job as a fortune teller at night after work at GA-2 - and her predictions are never wrong. Her foresight often sparks an entire episode, depending on GA-2's interpretation on her prediction. Much of her comic appeal comes from her deadpan delivery.|$|R

500|$|Electra Heart {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 57, based on 16 reviews. Writing for AllMusic, James Christopher Monger compared the record to {{the works of}} American singers Kesha and Lady Gaga, and favourably summarised it as [...] "a brooding, sexy, desperate, overwrought, and infectious record that's both aware and unashamed of its contrivance." [...] Michael Cragg reviewed the album on behalf of BBC Music; {{he felt that the}} recurring concept of failed romance established [...] "a strange dichotomy" [...] that created a sense of cohesiveness, and elaborated that it [...] " [...] you sharply into her world." [...] He considered {{the second half of the}} disc to be mildly disappointing, although concluded that this was excusable because the overall record [...] " [...] the ironic and the heartfelt, <b>the</b> <b>quirky</b> and the mainstream, the real and the fake with remarkable aplomb." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly complimented Diamandis for her ability to [...] "rival Katy Perry for catchy hooks, command with the swagger of Gwen Stefani, and even come close to the ethereal vocal exhilaration of Florence Welch." [...] Stack opined that Electra Heart was a healthy combination of up-tempo recordings and genuinely-delivered ballads, and placed additional praise on the female archetypes explored throughout the album.|$|E
500|$|Last of the Summer Wine was set and {{filmed in}} and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England, and centred on a trio of old men and their {{youthful}} misadventures; {{the membership of the}} trio changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the mischievous and impulsive Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as easy-going everyman Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as uptight and arrogant Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by <b>the</b> <b>quirky</b> war veteran Walter [...] "Foggy" [...] Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert [...] "Truly of The Yard" [...] Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men never seem to grow up, and they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming reluctantly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakoffee has {{received}} a generally positive reception and is known mostly for its desserts and for offering a unique experience to guests. After noting its status {{as one of the}} oldest coffeehouses in Portland, Fodor's said in a Pacific Northwest guide that it remains [...] "one of the best", specifically complimenting the desserts. In her travelogues of Portland, Rachel Dresbeck noted the coffeehouse's uniqueness and recommended the mocha fudge cake and the ice cream desserts known as [...] "Rasputin's Vice" [...] and [...] "Tsar Sulton Suite". Similarly, Portland Examiner contributor Dominique Dobson called the coffeehouse [...] "whimsical" [...] and wrote, [...] "this is a great evening stopoff for caffeine and dessert. It can sometimes be a bit crowded, but the mocha fudge cake is phenomenal with coffee, and <b>the</b> <b>quirky</b> clientele and (sometimes live) music can keep you lingering over that amazing cheesecake!" [...] In his 2010 Frommer's guide titled Portable Portland, Karl Samson noted the coffeehouse's loyal patrons, calling it [...] "Portland's favorite dessert hangout for more than 25 years." [...] Julian Smith wrote in a 2012 Frommer's guide, Portland Day by Day, that Rimsky-Korsakoffee is the [...] "most atmospheric" [...] of the city's coffee establishments, with [...] "fun and sassy" [...] waiters, desserts [...] "to die for" [...] and bathrooms [...] "you have to see to believe". Ari Shapiro, a journalist and White House correspondent for NPR who has performed with the band Pink Martini, was raised in Portland and worked at Rimsky-Korsakoffee.|$|E
50|$|The Bucket of Blood is {{a public}} house in Phillack, Hayle, Cornwall, owned by St Austell Brewery. It {{is thought to be}} named after an {{incident}} where the landlord brought up a bucket of blood from the building's well, as a murdered smuggler had been dropped there and the name has been recognised as one of <b>the</b> <b>quirkiest</b> in <b>the</b> country. The building dates from the 18th century, built from rubble with a slater roof. It was designated Grade II listed status on 14 January 1988.|$|R
50|$|According {{to local}} folklore, the Bucket of Blood {{got its name}} many {{years ago when the}} {{landlord}} went to the on-site well to get a bucket of water but found there to be just blood. Further investigation found there was the badly mutilated corpse of a local smuggler {{at the bottom of the}} well. An alternative theory is that the well on the grounds would provide red water due to run off from local tin mining The name was recognised as one of <b>the</b> <b>quirkiest</b> in <b>the</b> country in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Commentators {{observed}} a {{disparity between the}} albums that placed highly in the Poll of Polls and those that were the year's biggest-selling. Speaking about the 2008 chart, singer-songwriter Christopher Rees noted that [...] "when records are so popular in mainstream charts, they lose favour with <b>the</b> critics. <b>The</b> <b>quirkier</b> <b>the</b> sound, the cooler it becomes in their opinion." [...] Similarly, Jonathan Owen of The Independent contrasted the albums that had been featured in 2011's Poll of Polls against those that had sold the most that year in the UK. Although Let England Shake had topped HMV's listing, Owen remarked that [...] "hardly anyone would agree", as Harvey's album had, at the time, sold only 130,000 copies, compared with 3.5 million copies of the year's best-seller, 21 by Adele.|$|R
500|$|The large {{positive}} {{response to the}} alpha footage convinced the studio to develop Goat Simulator as a full title to Steam, putting more people on the title. The team, having no plans for a full release, debated on whether to approach a large publisher to receive funding {{to help make the}} title into something like Grand Theft Auto, but decided to stay with a small, inexpensive title that would be truer to the teaser video. Recognizing that the glitching was part of the game's appeal, Ibrisagic only sought to fix software bugs that might cause the game to crash, leaving in the other glitches and bugs associated with the physics engine as the results from these were [...] "really hilarious". They limited themselves to a short development time of four weeks without significant management oversight as to set an urgent but realistic goal to bring the game to a playable state. Ibrisagic felt it was important for the game to be supported on Steam, but initially feared that Valve Corporation would not accept <b>the</b> <b>quirky</b> title. He instead found Valve to be welcoming of the title, including a joking response from the company that stated [...] " [...] has started wearing a goat costume to work he’s so excited about this game". As part of its release, Coffee Stain added support for Steam Workshop which would let players modify the game, aware that players would likely create levels and scenarios that will glitch and crash the game for humorous results. While the physics engine allows for spectacular rendering of destruction of the game environment, which is a main feature of the game, Coffee Stain acknowledged the downside of this as [...] "it would synchronise terribly in multiplayer". They estimated that adding multiplayer would remove [...] "90 percent of the physics" [...] and many other features, and left the game as a single player title at launch. The studio considered that it only spent a couple months to complete the Windows version, and opted to outsource versions for OS X and Linux, with Ryan Gordon handling the porting.|$|E
2500|$|Since its release, {{the song}} {{has been held}} in low regard by several music critics and biographers. Some of these reviewers {{highlight}} the disparity between the serious message and <b>the</b> <b>quirky</b> musical backing. In line with Harrison's wishes, a demo of [...] "Save the World" [...] appeared as the sole bonus track on the posthumously reissued Somewhere in England in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{the band}} made an {{appearance}} playing their hit [...] "Dead Man's Party" [...] {{on stage in}} the film Back to School. In addition, they appeared in and performed several songs in <b>the</b> <b>quirky</b> 1984 Tom Hanks movie Bachelor Party, including [...] "Who Do You Want to Be?", [...] "Bachelor Party" [...] and [...] "Something Isn't Right". Then, starting with 1985's Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Danny Elfman began scoring major films with increasing frequency, including almost all of Tim Burton's films.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} fairly well {{received}} by most critics who praised its fun and good looks for an arcade game but wanted a longer game and disliked <b>the</b> sometimes <b>quirky</b> ball physics.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to developing a}} harder rock sound, Me Too incorporated more diverse elements into their sound while still remaining true to <b>the</b> lyrically <b>quirky</b> 3-minute, harmony-laden, melody-driven power pop sound of Moustache.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2005, Hebden Bridge {{was named}} <b>the</b> fourth <b>quirkiest</b> place in <b>the</b> world by High Life (the British Airways flight magazine) and was {{described}} as [...] "modern and stylish in an unconventional and stylish way".|$|R
