5|$|In 2004, the SS192 hollow-point {{cartridge}} {{was introduced}} <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> shooters alongside the new IOM {{variant of the}} Five-seven pistol. After being met with controversy, the SS192 variety was discontinued in the same year, and in 2005 the SS196SR variety was introduced using a 2.6 g (40grain) Hornady V-Max projectile. The SS196 was also quickly discontinued {{in favor of the}} newer SS195LF and SS197SR varieties, which are currently offered <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> shooters for use in 5.7×28mm firearms, followed by the SS198LF variety, which is currently produced but is restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E

5|$|Further {{development}} of the P90 {{led to the creation}} of the P90 TR model, which has a MIL-STD-1913 triple rail interface for mounting accessories. This model was introduced in late 1999 and continues to be offered alongside the standard P90. More recently, the P90 has been offered <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> shooters as the PS90, a semi-automatic carbine intended for personal protection and sporting use.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} home, Hinton {{initially was}} indecisive {{about what to}} do with his life. Like many of his fellow soldiers who had returned home, he struggled to adapt <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> life. He was also extremely uncomfortable with the public attention he received because of his status as a VC recipient. He eventually found work managing hotels on behalf of Dominion Breweries. He was initially based at the Thistle Hotel, a notorious drinking establishment in Auckland, for three years, during which he received a belated mention in despatches for his escape attempts while a POW. In December 1949 he moved to Hamilton to manage the Hamilton East Hotel. This was the first of many moves up and down the country to manage hotels.|$|E
5|$|After the war Morshead {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> life, {{becoming the}} Orient Steam Navigation Company's Australian general manager on 31 December 1947. He continued to receive honours for his military service, including a further mention in despatches in 1947 and the American Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm. He {{was president of}} the Bank of New South Wales, the chairman of David Jones, and director of several companies. From 1950 Morshead headed 'The Association', a secret organization similar to the New Guard movement with which he had been involved in the mid-1920s, and which was prepared to oppose communist attempts at subversion. It was quietly disbanded in 1952.|$|E

50|$|The kammerladers were {{phased out}} as more modern rifles were {{approved}} for use. They were either modified for rimfire cartridges, sold off <b>to</b> <b>civilians</b> or melted for scrap.

Today {{it is hard to}} find an unmodified kammerlader, and collectors often pay high prices for them.|$|R

5|$|Alfred Victor Verville (November 16, 1890– March 10, 1970) was an {{aviation}} pioneer and aircraft designer who contributed <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> and military aviation. During his forty-seven {{years in the}} aviation industry, {{he was responsible for}} the design and development of nearly twenty commercial and military airplanes. Verville is known for designing flying boats, military racing airplanes (such as the record breaking Verville-Sperry R-3 Racer), and a series of commercial cabin airplanes. His planes were awarded with the Pulitzer Speed Classic Trophy in 1920 and 1924.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} in protecting the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious nature of the work, and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously.|$|E

5|$|Areas of {{the coast}} near Exmouth, The Fleet at Weymouth and the beaches at Studland have also been used for {{training}} for war, but have since been returned <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> use. Parts {{of the coast}}, especially around Portland, can be dangerous, and shipwrecks have been {{a feature of the}} coast. In January 2007 the coast experienced its most environmentally damaging wreck when the MSC Napoli, a 2,400 capacity container ship, was beached at Branscombe near Sidmouth, losing oil and cargo.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of these}} and other successes, Lowe was {{authorized}} to build four additional balloons and the needed inflation equipment. However, Lowe's initial successes proved difficult to recreate in field conditions, and aside from limited successes, such as at the Battle of Seven Pines, the utility of the Balloon Corps was limited. In addition, jurisdictional squabbles arose between Lowe's civilian command and the military officers under whom he worked. By early 1863, Lowe had grown tired of dealing with military minutia and left the Corps, returning <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> research. The Balloon Corps fell to the command of less-capable individuals and was eventually eliminated in August 1863.|$|E
5|$|Bostock {{married his}} Australian fiancée, Gwendolen Norton, in Southampton on 6March 1919. The couple had two daughters, one of whom, Gwendolen Joan, {{would serve as}} a cipher officer in the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF) during World War II. Bostock retired from the RAF and {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>civilian</b> life in Australia that October. In September 1921, he joined the recently formed Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and was commissioned a flying officer. He became a friend and mentor to Flying Officer (later Air Marshal Sir) George Jones, another World War I veteran, who had flown with the Australian Flying Corps and had joined the Air Force in March. By mid-1922 Bostock had been promoted to flight lieutenant.|$|E
