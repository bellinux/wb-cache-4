5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical <b>twisting</b> of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the {{wavelength}} of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral <b>twisting</b> that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E
5|$|In {{a note on}} torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's {{treatment of}} climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the <b>twisting</b> makes the stems stiffer {{in the same way}} as the <b>twisting</b> of a rope; Thompson's view is that the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Twist</b> 1 a and <b>twist</b> 1 b are the {{principal}} components of <b>twists</b> that negatively regulate a number of cellular signaling events. Expression of runx 2 and downstream targets is essential for skeletal development and ventral organizer formation and specification in early vertebrate embryos, but what controls ventral activity of maternal runx 2 and how <b>twists</b> function in zebrafish embryogenesis still remain unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By studying the loss of <b>twist</b> induced by injection of morpholino-oligonucleotide in zebrafish, we found that <b>twist</b> 1 a and <b>twist</b> 1 b, but not <b>twist</b> 2 or <b>twist</b> 3, were required for proper skeletal development and dorsoventral patterning in early embryos. Overexpression of <b>twist</b> 1 a or <b>twist</b> 1 b following mRNA injection resulted in deteriorated skeletal development and formation of typical dorsalized embryos, whereas knockdown of <b>twist</b> 1 a and <b>twist</b> 1 b {{led to the formation}} of abnormal embryos with enhanced skeletal formation and typical ventralized patterning. Overexpression of <b>twist</b> 1 a or <b>twist</b> 1 b decreased the expression of runx 2 b, whereas <b>twist</b> 1 a and <b>twist</b> 1 b knockdown increased runx 2 b expression. We have further demonstrated that phenotypes induced by <b>twist</b> 1 a and <b>twist</b> 1 b knockdown were rescued by runx 2 b knockdown. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these results suggest that <b>twist</b> 1 a and <b>twist</b> 1 b control skeletal development and dorsoventral patterning by regulating runx 2 b in zebrafish and provide potential targets for the treatment of diseases or syndromes associated with decreased skeletal development...|$|R

5|$|Stereotyped and {{repetitive}} motor {{behaviors are}} a core {{part of the}} diagnosis of AS and other ASDs. They include hand movements such as flapping or <b>twisting,</b> and complex whole-body movements.

5|$|The {{chiral nematic}} phase {{exhibits}} chirality (handedness). This phase {{is often called}} the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules (i.e., those that have no internal planes of symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a <b>twisting</b> of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral <b>twisting</b> of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E

5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} lift in {{at least}} four ways at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle, generating high lift and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and vortex shedding. Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, flexing and <b>twisting</b> during each beat. Among the variables are wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, angle of attack, forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused <b>twisting</b> and distortion of the aircraft's structure.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>TWIST</b> 1 gene has diverse {{roles in}} {{development}} and pathologic {{diseases such as}} cancer. <b>TWIST</b> 1 is a dimeric basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor existing as <b>TWIST</b> 1 -TWIST 1 or <b>TWIST</b> 1 -E 12 / 47. <b>TWIST</b> 1 partner choice and DNA binding can be influenced during development by phosphorylation of Thr 125 and Ser 127 of the Thr-Gln-Ser (TQS) motif within the bHLH of <b>TWIST</b> 1. The significance of these <b>TWIST</b> 1 phosphorylation sites for metastasis is unknown. We created stable isogenic prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing <b>TWIST</b> 1 wild-type, phospho-mutants, and tethered versions. We assessed these isogenic lines using assays that mimic stages of cancer metastasis. In vitro assays suggested the phospho-mimetic <b>Twist</b> 1 -DQD mutation could confer cellular properties associated with pro-metastatic behavior. The hypo-phosphorylation mimic <b>Twist</b> 1 -AQA mutation displayed reduced pro-metastatic activity compared to wild-type <b>TWIST</b> 1 in vitro, suggesting that phosphorylation of the <b>TWIST</b> 1 TQS motif was necessary for pro-metastatic functions. In vivo analysis demonstrates that the <b>Twist</b> 1 -AQA mutation exhibits reduced capacity to contribute to metastasis, whereas {{the expression of the}} <b>Twist</b> 1 -DQD mutation exhibits proficient metastatic potential. Tethered <b>TWIST</b> 1 -E 12 heterodimers phenocopied the <b>Twist</b> 1 -DQD mutation for many in vitro assays, suggesting that <b>TWIST</b> 1 phosphorylation may result in heterodimerization in prostate cancer cells. Lastly, the dual phosphatidylinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) -mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor BEZ 235 strongly attenuated <b>TWIST</b> 1 -induced migration that was dependent on the TQS motif. <b>TWIST</b> 1 TQS phosphorylation state determines the intensity of <b>TWIST</b> 1 -induced pro-metastatic ability in prostate cancer cells, which may be partly explained mechanistically by <b>TWIST</b> 1 dimeric partner choice...|$|R
