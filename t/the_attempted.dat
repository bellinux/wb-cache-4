40|$|Solving the {{stochastic}} Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation numerically, {{we investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> frequency of magnetization in synthetic antiferromagnet (SyAF). <b>The</b> <b>attempt</b> frequency is estimated while varying the uniaxial anisotropy constant, the energy barrier and {{the geometry of}} a magnetic layer. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> frequency is decreased for the same magnetic volume by increasing the asymmetry of the geometry in the high damping region. Also, even for a constant height of energy barrier, <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> frequency can vary dramatically with uniaxial anisotropy constant...|$|R

5|$|All Islanders were {{required}} to work 30 hours each week, and up until the 1960s no wages were paid for this work. The catalyst for the strike was <b>the</b> <b>attempted</b> deportation of Indigenous inmate Albie Geia who committed the offence of disobeying the European overseer. The strike continued for five days and was broken with dawn raids to remove the families involved by boat to the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{collaboration}} with Foccart, Houphouët-Boigny took part in <b>the</b> <b>attempted</b> coup of 16 January 1977 led by famed French mercenary Bob Denard against the revolutionary regime of Mathieu Kérékou in Dahomey. Houphouët-Boigny, in order {{to fight against the}} Marxists in power in Angola, also lent his support to Jonas Savimbi's UNITA party, whose feud with the MPLA party led to the Angolan Civil War.|$|E

2500|$|... {{division}} is (in general) <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> to invert multiplication, but many examples, {{such as the}} introduction of implication in propositional logic, or the ideal quotient for division by ring ideals, can be recognised as <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> to provide an adjoint.|$|R
5|$|Black also {{identifies}} {{a mechanism}} Fleming uses in Casino Royale—and in subsequent Bond novels—which {{is to use}} the evil of his opponents both as a justification of his actions, and as a device to foil their own plans. Black refers to the episode of <b>the</b> <b>attempted</b> assassination of Bond by Bulgarian assassins which results in their own deaths.|$|E
5|$|Captain Glušica {{was given}} {{clearance}} to land, however, he suddenly aborted <b>the</b> <b>attempted</b> landing. The aircraft's throttle handle {{was found in}} the forward position, suggesting that the pilot had attempted to abort the landing and take off again. The co-pilot Ahluwalia had warned his commander three times to go around instead of landing; the first of these warnings had come 2.5 miles before the runway threshold.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Rand made {{notes for}} a proposed, but never written, novel titled The Little Street. Rand's notes for it contain {{elements}} that {{carried over into}} her work on The Fountainhead. David Harriman, who edited the notes for the posthumously published Journals of Ayn Rand (1997), described the story's villain as a preliminary version of the character Ellsworth Toohey, and this villain's assassination by the protagonist as prefiguring <b>the</b> <b>attempted</b> assassination of Toohey.|$|E

His mother also suggested that <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> was a bid for help. His grandmother suggested Sandford was attempting suicide by cop.|$|R

5|$|On 8 November 1939, Hitler {{went to the}} Bürgerbräukeller beer hall in Munich for {{the annual}} anniversary celebration of <b>the</b> <b>attempted</b> putsch of 1923. He began {{speaking}} around 8:10 pm, earlier than usual because he had urgent business in Berlin. He left the hall at around 9:07 pm. About thirteen minutes later, a time bomb which had been concealed inside a pillar behind the speaker's rostrum exploded, killing eight and injuring sixty-three.|$|E
5|$|Police {{surround}} {{the bank and}} Detectives Keith Frazier and Bill Mitchell {{take charge of the}} negotiations. Russell, the leader of the robbers, demands food and the police supply them with pizzas whose boxes include listening devices. The bugs pick up a language which the police identify as Albanian. They discover, however, that the conversations are in fact propaganda recordings of deceased Albanian communist dictator Enver Hoxha, implying that the robbers anticipated <b>the</b> <b>attempted</b> surveillance.|$|E
40|$|A summary {{is given}} of <b>the</b> <b>attempts</b> made to apply semidirect methods to the {{calculation}} of three-dimensional viscous flows over suction holes in laminar flow control surfaces. <b>The</b> <b>attempts</b> were all unsuccessful, due to either (1) lack of resolution capability, (2) lack of computer efficiency, or (3) instability...|$|R
50|$|The series gently mocks the {{constructed}} performance sometimes {{given by}} members of the general public when being interviewed for television vox-pops and documentaries. This includes <b>the</b> <b>attempts</b> to present a cogent but simple conclusive answer to a general question - a sound bite - and <b>the</b> <b>attempts</b> to present a cheery spin on a complex issue while <b>the</b> subject <b>attempts</b> to hide their personal issues and problems with the issue.|$|R

5|$|The alleged {{motive for}} <b>the</b> <b>attempted</b> {{assassination}} {{was a white}} supremacist belief that an African American should not be elected President of the United States. Gartrell was arrested August 24, 2008, and found to be in possession of rifles and other weaponry; Adolf and Johnson were arrested shortly thereafter. In a televised interview after his arrest, Johnson identified Adolf {{as the man who}} allegedly hatched the assassination plot and planned to be the shooter.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>attempted</b> {{expedition}} had {{a significant}} consequence. Wassmuss left Constantinople to organise the tribes in south Persia to act against British interests. While evading British capture in Persia, Wassmuss inadvertently abandoned his codebook. Its recovery by Britain allowed the Allies to decipher German communications, including the Zimmermann Telegram in 1917. Niedermayer led the group following Wassmuss's departure.|$|E
5|$|The {{disappearance}} of Nungesser and Coli has an extensive legacy, and {{is referred to}} in many films and museums. A street in Paris is named after the aviators, and a commemorative postage stamp was issued in 1967.

50|$|Escaping unharmed while {{counting}} coup {{was considered}} a higher honor than being wounded in <b>the</b> <b>attempt.</b> A warrior who won coup was permitted to wear an eagle feather in his hair.

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{also took}} the opportunity to re-film the wreck and survey her using techniques unavailable in 2001. As before, with the exception of <b>the</b> <b>attempted</b> retrieval of the ship's bell, a strict look-but-don't-touch policy was adhered to.|$|E
