5|$|Cardinal Rodrigo Borja {{was elected}} {{unanimously}} on the 4th ballot as Pope Alexander VI. The election is notorious for allegations that Borja bought <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> his electors, promising them lucrative appointments and other material gifts—a practice known as simony. Concerns about this conclave led Pope Julius II to create stronger rules against simony in 1503.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013, Maloney {{voted to}} reject the Farm Bill. The {{comprehensive}} farm bill failed in the House due largely in part to <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> 8 Democratic House members who joined the Republican majority to vote down the measure.|$|E

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> non-confidence in <b>the</b> Czech Republic. The main {{objective}} is to analyse functioning of the previous Czech governments and the causes that led to <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> non-confidence. From <b>the</b> theoretical point of view the work concerns the parliamentary systems as such, mutual functioning of the Parliament and the government and describes <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> confidence and non-confidence. The author compares situations during the Czechoslovak Republic (1918 [...] 1938) and the present Czech Republic in terms of <b>the</b> regulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> confidence and non-confidence in different constitutions. The empirical part focuses on the individual governments from 1992 {{to the present day}} and the events that led to request for <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> non-confidence. In conclusion, in Czech political practice are used all the controlling instruments such as question time or investigative committees, but <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> <b>of</b> non-confidence remains <b>the</b> most noticeable and is more of a tool for the rivalry over power than for resolving governmental problems...|$|R

He received <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> four delegates. He went on to actively support the Mondale–Geraldine Ferraro ticket, whose eventual landslide defeat bore some similarities to his own in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Eleanor lobbied {{behind the}} scenes for the 1934 Costigan-Wagner Bill to make lynching a federal crime, {{including}} arranging a meeting between Franklin and NAACP president Walter Francis White. Fearing he would lose <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> Southern congressional delegations for his legislative agenda, however, Franklin refused to publicly support the bill, which proved unable to pass the Senate. In 1942, Eleanor worked with activist Pauli Murray to persuade Franklin to appeal on behalf of sharecropper Odell Waller, convicted of killing a white farmer during a fight; though Franklin {{sent a letter to}} Virginia Governor Colgate Darden urging him to commute the sentence to life imprisonment, Waller was executed as scheduled.|$|E
5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E
5|$|Harrison placed fifth on {{the first}} ballot, with Sherman in the lead, and the next few ballots showed little change. The Blaine {{supporters}} shifted their support among candidates they found acceptable, and when they shifted to Harrison, they found a candidate who could attract <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> many other delegations. He was nominated as the party's presidential candidate on the eighth ballot, by a count of 544 to 108 votes. Levi P. Morton of New York was chosen as his running mate.|$|E

Hayes continued to vote with the majority in the 40th Congress on the Reconstruction Acts, but resigned in July 1867 to campaign for governor of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Remain in Light {{was named}} the best album of 1980 by Sounds, ahead of The Skids' The Absolute Game, and by Melody Maker, while The New York Times {{included}} it in its unnumbered shortlist of the 10best records issued that year. It figured highly in other end-of-year best album lists, notably at number two, behind The Clash's London Calling, by Robert Christgau, and at number six by NME. It featured at number three—behind London Calling and Bruce Springsteen's The River—in The Village Voices 1980 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, which aggregates <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> hundreds of prominent reviewers.|$|E

Secretariat {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> the Thoroughbred Racing Associations of North America and the Daily Racing Form, while La Prevoyante was chosen by the National Turf Writers Association.

Gore (2000), in which the Court ruled that no constitutionally valid recount of Florida's votes in the 2000 presidential election could be held within the needed deadline; the decision effectively secured Bush's victory in the disputed election. In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (2006), the Court ruled that House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's Texas redistricting plan intentionally diluted <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> Latinos and thus violated the Equal Protection Clause.|$|E
5|$|The Republican minor officeholders {{returned}} to the state courts with their case. Franklin County circuit court justice James E. Cantrill ruled against them, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the state's court of last resort, sustained Cantrill's ruling {{by a vote of}} 4–3. Republican Attorney General Clifton J. Pratt continued with legal challenges and finally was allowed to serve out his term. Though Cantrill's decision was based on the invalidation of Louisville's vote and <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> four counties in eastern Kentucky, none of the legislators from those areas were unseated.|$|E

However, the decision did not include how the line would be financed, and the politicians stated that they were hoping that the state would use national road funds to finance the project. This was partially ensured in December, when a political agreement was reached for Oslo Package 2, a financing plan for investments in public transport in Oslo and Akershus between 2002 and 2011.|$|E

Welensky himself gained more than 80% {{of the vote in}} the federal constituency of Broken Hill and was immediately promoted to Minister for Transport.|$|E
5|$|After World War I the Liberal Party {{began to}} disintegrate. As the Liberals {{splintered}} Labour emerged {{to become the}} party of progressive politics in Scotland, gaining a solid following among working classes of the urban lowlands, {{and as a result}} the Unionists were able to gain most of <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> the middle classes, who now feared Bolshevik revolution, setting the social and geographical electoral pattern in Scotland that would last until the late 20th century. With all the main parties committed to the Union new nationalist and independent political groupings began to emerge, including the National Party of Scotland in 1928 and Scottish Party in 1930. They joined together to form the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1934 with the goal of creating an independent Scotland, but it enjoyed little electoral success in the Westminster system.|$|E
5|$|Although {{electoral fraud}} was common, {{it was not}} ignored by the Emperor, {{politicians}} or observers of the time. The problem was considered a major issue and {{attempts were made to}} correct abuses, with legislation (including the electoral reforms of 1855, 1875 and 1881) repeatedly being enacted to combat fraud. The 1881 reforms brought significant changes: they eliminated the two-stage electoral system, introduced direct and facultative voting, and allowed <b>the</b> <b>votes</b> <b>of</b> former slaves and enfranchised non-Catholics. Conversely, illiterate citizens were no longer allowed to vote. Participation in elections dropped from 13% to only 0.8% in 1886. In 1889, about 15% of the Brazilian population could read and write, so disenfranchising the illiterate does not solely explain the sudden fall in voting percentages. The discontinuation of mandatory voting and voter apathy may have been significant factors contributing to the {{reduction in the number of}} voters.|$|E
