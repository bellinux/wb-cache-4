5|$|On {{his last}} day, after oversleeping, Homer {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{things on his}} list. He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing {{some of the things}} on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E
5|$|This was Chopra's first action role, and she {{was excited}} to the part, so she wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stunts by herself. After Chopra decided to perform her own stunts, Akhtar {{revealed}} that he was happy as it gave him the scope to film the fight sequences from different angles. Rampal, {{in the role of}} Jasjit, said that he approached his character in a way similar to how Pran had played it in the original but with an emotional graph. Boman Irani, who plays DCP DeSilva, a role performed by Iftekhar in the original film, revealed that he played the role according to what suited the script, but retained some of the dignity from that film.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the change}} in orders and {{shortage}} of attack and combat cargo vessels, all of the division's 2.5 ton trucks, M1918 155-mm howitzers and the sound and flash-ranging equipment needed for counter-battery fire had to be left in Wellington. Also, because the Wellington dock workers were on strike at the time, the Marines had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> load reconfiguration from administrative to combat configuration.|$|E

25|$|Compared to scuba diving, {{dressing}} the diver in is {{a relatively}} laborious process, as the equipment is bulky and fairly heavy, and several components are connected together by hoses. This is more so with helmets, and less so with light full-face masks. It is not usual for the diver <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> dressing in without {{the assistance of a}} diver's tender, who will also manage the umbilical during the dive.|$|E
25|$|After World War II Essex fell off, {{taking their}} first wooden spoon in 1950. During this period {{it was left}} to Trevor Bailey <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> pace bowling, and he was often {{unavailable}} due to Test calls, whilst spinner Peter Smith was frequently overbowled until he retired in 1951 – thus a strong batting line-up led by Bailey and Doug Insole could seldom win games. Not until 1957 did Essex come back into {{the top half of the}} table, but Bailey and Barry Knight never had support of sufficient class to permit them to reach the top of the table, even when Robin Hobbs became England's last successful leg-spinner late in the 1960s.|$|E

Lanying Lin studied very hard at this primary school and often got the best grade in the class. But she was still required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> washing and cooking. As soon as she went back home, she started doing housework. At night, after finishing all her housework, she finally began studying and slept after 12 a.m. every day. And at six in the morning, she got up to cook and then went to school. At the age of six, she could only sleep six hours a day and this continued for her whole life.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{mistakes}} of its commanders, Kaunitz {{with no more than}} 25,000 Coalition soldiers was able to defeat a 53,000-strong French army. On the 13th, Charbonnier's divisions baked bread at Fontaine-l'Evêque and stood idle at Mont-Sainte-Geneviève, leaving Desjardin and his 35,000 troops <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> fighting. Without attempting any maneuver, Desjardin and his generals threw their soldiers, with no shoes, wet powder and shabby uniforms into the assault against enemies well-protected by solid fieldworks. The French troops lacked support from heavy cannons and had to contend with the superior Austrian cavalry, so it was not surprising that they were beaten. Around mid-day on 15 May, Kaunitz launched an attack to recapture some positions on the south bank of the Sambre. After three hours of skirmishing and artillery duels, the thwarted Austrian general withdrew his forces.|$|E
25|$|VOC’s dire {{situation}} {{after the}} Battle of Tugu in July 1741 did {{not escape the}} king’s attention, but– like Amangkurat II– he avoided any open breach with VOC since his own kraton was not lacking of factions against him. He ordered Patih Natakusuma <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> dirty work, such as ordering the Arch-Regent (Adipati) of Jipang (Bojonegoro), one Tumenggung Mataun, to join the Chinese. In September 1741, the king ordered Patih Natakusuma and several regents to help the Chinese besiege Semarang and let Natakusuma attack VOC garrison in Kartasura, who were starved into submission in August. However, reinforcement from VOC’s posts in Outer Islands were arriving since August {{and they were all}} wisely concentrated to repel the Chinese around Semarang. In the beginning of November, the Dutch attacked Kaligawe, Torbaya around Semarang, and repulsed the alliance of Javanese and Chinese forces who were stationed in four separate fortress and did not co-ordinate with each other. At the end of November, Cakraningrat IV had controlled the stretch of east coast from Tuban to Sedayu and the Dutch relieved Tegal of Chinese rebels. This caused Pakubuwana II to change sides and open negotiations with the Dutch.|$|E

500|$|As {{guest actor}} Leonard Nimoy, who plays William Bell, was {{unavailable}} {{to shoot the}} brief conversation with Blair Brown's Nina Sharp, the producers knew {{they wanted to do}} something a little more creative for the scene. They talked to cartoonist Frank Miller and hired a special effects school <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> modeling, which they accomplished based on photos of Nimoy, because the actor could not come in to have his head scanned; he did some voicework however. The finished scene included an animated version of Nimoy's head, shown through the same window as the one used in [...] "Peter".|$|E
500|$|According to Clash and Gikow, Elmo's pet {{goldfish}} Dorothy and {{the members}} of the Noodle family were silent in order to allow Elmo <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> talking, and to give children the opportunity to respond to what they saw on the screen. [...] Dorothy's silence allowed children to fill in the blanks, and her curiosity, which was created and enhanced by Elmo's imagination, allowed the writers and researchers to insert the curriculum lessons they want to convey. Up to nine goldfish were used per episode, so they could be replaced when necessary. Several fish were needed each season, and the surviving Dorothys were given good homes afterwards.|$|E

500|$|Long-time writer Judy Freudberg came up {{with the}} concept of [...] "Elmo's World", and writer Tony Geiss and {{executive}} producer Arlene Sherman helped develop it.

The thing that sold The Ash Man more than anything was the aftermath shot: This half-disintegrated body with a pile of ash for the head on the ground.

Armstrong also said that [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] was in [...] "ER territory", adding: [...] "I do not watch Grey's Anatomy to get my ER fix." [...] Adam Bryant of TV Guide enjoyed this episode compared to the previous one, but disliked the possible romantic development between Karev and Adamson.

500|$|Konietzko {{said the}} ideas for songs began with {{individual}} sounds, which he then modified until {{he created a}} looped rhythm.

[...] He said he was inspired by touring with the band in Europe in support of Nihil in 1995. After creating the base tunes, the songs went to Günter Schulz, another longtime member, to add guitars. With the completed songs, Konietzko then allowed guest artists, such as Connelly, to pick songs they wanted to contribute to, and added their vocals or other instrumentation. [...] For Xtort, Konietzko used Macintosh products <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> synchronization.|$|E
