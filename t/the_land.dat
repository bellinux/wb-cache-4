5|$|A public {{hall was}} built on part of the Manor Farm site in 1965 and named Winston Churchill Hall. <b>The</b> <b>land</b> upon which it was built had been Barn Close and was bought by Councillor T.

5|$|At night, <b>the</b> <b>land</b> cools {{off more}} quickly than the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{reduction}} of <b>landing</b> gear noise of aircraft on {{approach has been}} a focus of the aerospace community for many years. The present paper describes a method that predicts the noise from <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear, accounting for local flow variations due to the wing ge-ometry, the interaction of <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear wake with high-lift devices, and a method for approximating the shielding of noise caused by <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear geometry. <b>The</b> prediction of <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear noise is performed using <b>the</b> <b>Landing</b> Gear Model and Acoustic Pre-diction code (LGMAP) developed at The Pennsylvania State University. A line of sight algorithm based on scattering by a two-dimensional cylinder approximates the effect of acoustic shielding caused by <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear. Two-dimensional FLUENT calculations of approximate wing cross-sections are used by LGMAP to compute the noise change due to the change in local flow velocity {{in the vicinity of}} <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear. A three-dimensional immersed boundary CFD calculation of isolated LGMAP representations of landing gear geometries provides relatively quick estimates of the mean flow features caused by <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear for <b>the</b> prediction of trailing edge noise associated with the interaction of <b>the</b> <b>landing</b> gear wake with the high lift devices. Comparisons with measurements show the accuracy of <b>the</b> predictions of <b>landing</b> gear noise levels and directivity.

5|$|Darwin {{experienced}} an earthquake in Chile and saw signs that <b>the</b> <b>land</b> {{had just been}} raised, including mussel-beds stranded above high tide. High in the Andes he saw seashells, and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as <b>the</b> <b>land</b> rose, oceanic islands sank, and coral reefs round them grew to form atolls.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's theory {{followed}} {{from his}} understanding that coral polyps {{thrive in the}} clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated, but can only live within a limited depth of water, starting just below low tide. Where {{the level of the}} underlying land stays the same, the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs, and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef. Where <b>the</b> <b>land</b> is rising, fringing reefs can grow around the coast, but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone. If <b>the</b> <b>land</b> subsides slowly, the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of dead coral, and form a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and <b>the</b> <b>land.</b> A barrier reef can encircle an island, and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues {{to keep up with the}} sea level, forming a central lagoon. Should <b>the</b> <b>land</b> subside too quickly or sea level rise too fast, the coral dies as it is below its habitable depth.|$|E

5|$|Ecgbert's {{problems}} with the monasteries in his diocese came from the secular practice of families setting up monasteries that were totally under their control {{as a way of}} making the family lands book-land and free from secular service.
