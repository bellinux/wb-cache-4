5|$|Fielding's seventh play, Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in His Own Trap, was a five-act comedic {{play that}} first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights. The play enjoyed some success {{until it was}} renamed The Coffee-House Politician and was altered to {{possibly}} update the play as it focused on mocking current news events. The play is a love comedy that incorporates a corrupt judge <b>that</b> <b>stands</b> in the lovers' way. Eventually, various characters attempt to stop the judge, but he prevails albeit in a comedic fashion. Fielding's focus in the play is to point out corruption in government and to attack those who abuse their power.|$|E
5|$|Gisborough Priory is characterised {{by a few}} {{highly visible}} remains.

Elsewhere on the site, {{the outline of the}} cloister is visible but is largely unexcavated, while the ruins of the west (or cellarer's) range constitutes the largest area of other remains above ground. A ruined gatehouse and a still-intact dovecote (the latter off-limits to visitors) stand on the western edges of the site.|$|E

The replica <b>that</b> <b>stands</b> in Constitution Square houses {{the offices of the}} Convention and Tourism Bureau and The Great American Brass Band Festival. When Boyle County took over Constitution Square, the fiscal court agreed to waive the rent paid by the Convention and Tourism Bureau in exchange for its in-kind services managing the park jointly with the Boyle County Industrial Foundation. Danville Mayor Bernie Hunstad opposed the arrangement, fearing that park management would dilute both organizations' primary missions of bringing jobs to the area. In March 2013, Hunstad resigned his ex-officio membership on the Boyle County Industrial Foundation in protest.|$|E

It has been the residency of a number of well known actors including; Edmund Kean, comedian Dan Leno, and the musical composer and performer Ivor Novello. From the Second World War, the theatre has primarily hosted long runs of musicals, including Oklahoma! (1947–1953), My Fair Lady (1958–1963), 42nd Street (1984–1989) and Miss Saigon (1989–1999), the theatre's longest-running show. The theatre is owned by the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.|$|E

5|$|King Memorial Fountain is a {{fountain}} erected in 1893 with a monumental bronze statue of Moses smiting the rock for water on Mount Horeb. Four figures of Israelite slaves around the statue {{on the side}} of the mountain represent the four stages of life: infancy, youth, adulthood, and old age. The fountain is in the center of formal gardens laid out by William S. Egerton. It was a gift from Rufus H. King and was sculpted by J. Massey Rhind, who also sculpted the Philip Schuyler statue <b>that</b> <b>stands</b> at the center of the intersection of Eagle Street and Washington Avenue in front of city hall. In 1988, the statue of Moses was cleaned and applied with a wax coating to protect it from the weather, and an arm was reattached to one of the four other statues on the fountain.|$|E
