25|$|It {{happens in}} every {{industry}} {{to millions of}} workers. Billions of dollars are stolen when employers pay less than minimum wage; refuse overtime pay; force workers <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off</b> the clock; hold back final paychecks; misclassify employees as independent contractors; steal tips; and fail to pay workers at all.|$|E
25|$|Amongst the work's {{innovations}} {{is one of}} {{the earliest}} descriptions of purgatory as the place where each soul would have <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off</b> its debts after death before entering heaven. Hildegard's descriptions of the possible punishments there are often gruesome and grotesque, which emphasize the work's moral and pastoral purpose as a practical guide to the life of true penance and proper virtue.|$|E

25|$|The Low Country {{was settled}} first, {{dominated}} by wealthy English men who became owners of {{large amounts of}} land on which they established plantations. They first transported white indentured servants as laborers, mostly teenage youth from England who came <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off</b> their passage in hopes of learning to farm and buying their own land. Planters also imported African laborers to the colony.|$|E
25|$|One alleged {{example of}} the Church's {{possible}} brainwashing tactics is the Rehabilitation Project Force, to which church staff are assigned <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off</b> alleged wrongdoings under conditions that many critics characterize as degrading. Some of these allegations are presented in Stephen Kent's Brainwashing in Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF). Articles that claim to rebut those charges include Juha Pentikäinen's The Church of Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force.|$|E
25|$|Other {{legislative}} initiatives by the Conservatives benefited {{its primary}} supporters, the planters and business class. Taxes {{across the board}} were reduced, and funding was cut for public social and educational programs that assisted poor whites and blacks. Oral contracts were made to be legally binding, breach of contract was enforced as a criminal offense, and those in debt to planters could be forced <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off</b> their debt. In addition, the University of South Carolina along with The Citadel were reopened to elite classes and generously supported by the state government.|$|E

25|$|If a debtor {{were seized}} for debt, he could {{nominate}} as mancipium, or hostage <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off</b> the debt, his wife, child, or slave.

If the mancipium died a natural death while in the creditor's possession, no claim could lie against the latter; {{but if he was}} the cause of death by cruelty, he had to give son for son, or pay for a slave. He could sell a slave-hostage, but not a slave-girl who had borne her master children; she had to be redeemed by her owner.|$|E
25|$|When Curtis was eight, he and {{his brother}} Julius were placed in an orphanage for a month because their parents could not afford to feed them. Four years later, Julius was struck and killed by a truck. Curtis joined a {{neighborhood}} gang whose main crimes were playing hooky from school and minor pilfering at the local dime store. When Curtis was 11, a friendly neighbor saved him from what he felt would have led to a life of delinquency by sending him to a Boy Scout camp, where he was able <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off</b> his energy and settle down. He attended Seward Park High School. At 16, he had his first small acting part in a school stage play.|$|E
25|$|Tatsuro Udo, battle {{programmer}} for Eternia, Rebirth and Graces, {{helped design}} the battle system. During {{the beginning of}} development, the team had to recreate the basic gameplay from the Xillia games <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off,</b> which proved a difficult task for the team. The battle system was intended to combine familiar elements from previous installments with new ideas intended to refresh the series. Creating the seamless transition between exploration and combat, as well as implementing Armitization, proved to {{be difficult for the}} team. The idea of encountering and fighting enemies in the same space as exploration was designed to help evoke a fresh sense of adventure for players, as the team felt the previous method of transferring to a separate battle arena was limiting the series' development. Until the battle system's completion, development of other systems related to it was slow. As part of this development, a completely new engine had to be developed for the game, rather than just modified their old engine {{as they did in the}} past. Because of a staff shortage, developing the game was harder than previous titles and took a longer time. The PlayStation 3 was chosen as the original platform of release as the next generation of gaming hardware had yet to take off in Japan in terms of sales, and Bandai Namco was unwilling to take the risk of releasing on platforms with low install bases.|$|E

25|$|With his description, it is {{seen that}} the {{out-of-date}} Chinese term for pestle and mortar (dui, tui) would soon be replaced with the Chinese term for the water-powered trip-hammer (Chinese: 水碓 Pinyin: shui dui; Wade–Giles: shui tui). The Han Dynasty scholar and poet Ma Rong (79–166 AD) mentioned {{in one of his}} poems of hammers 'pounding in the water-echoing caves'. As described in the Hou Han Shu, in 129 AD the official Yu Xu gave a report to Emperor Shun of Han that trip hammers were being exported from Han China to the Western Qiang people by way of canals through the Qilian Mountains. In his Rou Xing Lun, the government official Kong Rong (153–208 AD) remarked that the invention of the trip hammer was an excellent example of a product created by intelligent men during his own age (comparing the relative achievements of the sages of old). During the 3rd century AD, the high government official and engineer Du Yu established the use of combined trip hammer batteries (lian zhi dui), which employed several shafts that were arranged <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off</b> one large waterwheel. In Chinese texts of the 4th century, there are written accounts of men possessing and operating hundreds of trip hammer machines, such as the venerable mathematician Wang Rong (died 306 AD), Deng Yu (died 326 AD), and Shi Chong (died 300 AD), responsible for the operation of hundreds of trip hammers in over thirty governmental districts throughout China. There are numerous references to trip hammers during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD) and Song Dynasty (960–1279), and there are Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) references that report the use of trip hammers in papermills of Fujian Province.|$|E

If he was unable <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off</b> the tax, a rate of $0.625/day was assessed (equivalent to $ in [...] ). This road maintenance was performed {{under the guidance of}} the township road overseer, a separate elected township official, according to the wishes of his constituents, often without any county-level planning or coordination.

500|$|Moore {{described}} the recording process as challenging {{because she was}} provided with little visual aid, explaining, [...] "All I had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off</b> were a few sketches ... {{but it was also}} fun because it allows you to go into the depths of your imagination." [...] She also revealed that creating Rapunzel's voice was simply a process of [...] "let go". Moore was often required to re-record a single line a total of four times before the directors finally heard a version with which they were satisfied. After watching the completed film for the first time, Moore was disappointed with her own performance because she felt that her voice sounded [...] "shrill". According to composer Alan Menken, Moore's musical background made her [...] "a delight to work with". Moore found the practice of performing in character challenging in comparison to recording her own original music, explaining, [...] "I can't just be like Mandy and sing something the way that I want to necessarily, because you know, you sort of have to stick to certain guidelines." [...] She found recording [...] "When Will My Life Begin" [...] particularly difficult due to the speed at which she had to say certain words, and cites both Menken and discovering Rapunzel herself as a character with guiding her through the process.|$|E
500|$|After {{development}} of the original [...] was finished, the writer and director Shu Takumi's boss, Shinji Mikami, told him that they should make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. Development of the game began immediately when Takumi returned to work from his vacation: the producer, Atsushi Inaba, called him in to a meeting, and told Takumi that he wanted him to write the script for five episodes before the game went into full production, with a deadline of {{three and a half}} months. Takumi thought that this was [...] "completely insane", as it had taken him an average of more than a month to write each of the four episodes for the first Ace Attorney; additionally, he felt {{that he did not have}} any [...] "tricks" [...] left to use for mysteries or any story threads <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off</b> of. He wanted to protest, but still ended up having to do it. As soon as he returned to his desk, he drafted a work schedule: he scheduled two and a half month to write the dialogue, with half a month per episode, leaving him with a month to create the first prototype and figure out the [...] "tricks" [...] to be used in the mysteries. He doubted that he would be able to do it in time, but managed to write the whole script by the deadline. However, due to issues with memory on the game's cartridge, one episode ended up having to be cut from the game; it was later used as the third episode of the third game.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is divided}} into four acts, each taking place on November 2 on four {{consecutive}} years. Manuel [...] "Manny" [...] Calavera is a travel agent at the Department of Death {{in the city of}} El Marrow, forced into his job <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>off</b> a debt [...] "to the powers that be". Manny is frustrated with being assigned clients that must take the four-year journey and is threatened to be fired by his boss, Don Copal, if he does not come up with better clients. Manny steals a client, Mercedes [...] "Meche" [...] Colomar, from his co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the [...] "Number Nine" [...] luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life. After setting Meche on her way, Manny investigates further and finds that Domino and Don have been rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans. LeMans then sells the tickets at an exorbitant price to those that can afford it. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead, {{with the help of his}} driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. During the trip Manny encounters Salvador [...] "Sal" [...] Limones, the leader of the small underground organization Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who is aware of Hector's plans and recruits Manny to help. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there, and waits for her to show up.|$|E
