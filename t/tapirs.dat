5|$|Horses are {{odd-toed}} ungulates, {{or members}} of the order Perissodactyla. This order also includes the extant species of rhinos and <b>tapirs,</b> and many extinct families and species. Members of this order walk on either one toe (like horses) or three toes (like rhinos and <b>tapirs).</b> This {{is in contrast to}} even-toed ungulates, members of the order Artiodactyla, which walk on cloven hooves, or two toes. This order includes many species associated with livestock, such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows and camels, as well as species of giraffes, antelopes and deer.|$|E
5|$|Other notable mammal {{species in}} the zoo's {{collection}} include oriental small-clawed otters, Asian lions, meerkats, sun bears, Sumatran tigers, giant anteaters, binturong, African wild dogs, Gr√©vy's zebras, greater one-horned rhinoceros, banteng, red river hogs, swamp wallabies, striped skunks, pygmy hippopotamus, Scottish wild cats, Malayan <b>tapirs,</b> white-faced saki monkeys, ring-tailed lemurs, cottontop tamarins, geladas, chinese gorals, red panda, Siberian musk deer, Nile lechwe, grey kangaroo and Barbary macaques.|$|E
5|$|The koala is {{classified}} with wombats (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families (including marsupial <b>tapirs,</b> marsupial lions and giant wombats) in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order Diprotodontia. The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) and possums. The ancestors of vombatiforms were likely arboreal, and the koala's lineage was possibly {{the first to}} branch off around 40 million years ago during the Eocene.|$|E

50|$|Baird's <b>tapir</b> (Tapirus bairdii), {{also known}} as the Central American <b>tapir,</b> is a species of <b>tapir</b> native to Mexico, Central America and northwestern South America. It is one of four Latin American species of <b>tapir.</b>|$|R

5|$|The simple, low-crowned teeth {{indicate}} that Paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later rhinoceroses were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth. Studies of mesowear on Paraceratherium teeth confirm the creatures {{had a soft}} diet of leaves; microwear studies {{have yet to be}} conducted. Isotope analysis shows that Paraceratherium fed chiefly on C3 plants, which are mainly leaves. Like its perissodactyl relatives, the horses, <b>tapirs,</b> and other rhinoceroses, Paraceratherium would have been a hindgut fermenter; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat large volumes to survive. Like other large herbivores, Paraceratherium would have had a large digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} little {{opportunity}} to study epidemiology in the Sumatran rhinoceros. Ticks and gyrostigma were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century. The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease surra, which can be spread by horse-flies carrying parasitic trypanosomes; in 2004, all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre died over an 18-day period after becoming infected by the disease. The Sumatran rhino has no known predators other than humans. Tigers and wild dogs may be capable of killing a calf, but calves stay close to their mothers, {{and the frequency of}} such killings is unknown. Although the rhino's range overlaps with elephants and <b>tapirs,</b> the species do not appear to compete for food or habitat. Elephants (Elephas maximus) and Sumatran rhinos are even known to share trails, and many smaller species such as deer, boars, and wild dogs will use the trails the rhinos and elephants create.|$|E
5|$|Granger and Gregory {{argued that}} the large incisors were used for defence or for {{loosening}} shrubs by moving the neck downwards, thereby acting as picks and levers. <b>Tapirs</b> use their proboscis to wrap around branches while stripping off bark with the front teeth; this ability would have been helpful to Paraceratherium. Some Russian authors suggested that the tusks were probably used for breaking twigs, stripping bark and bending high branches and that, because species from the early Oligocene had larger tusks than later ones, they probably had a more bark than leaf based diet. Since the species involved are now {{known to have been}} contemporaneous, and that the differences in tusks are perhaps sexually dimorphic, the latter idea is not accepted today. Herds of Paraceratherium may have migrated while continuously foraging from tall trees, which smaller mammals could not reach. Osborn suggested that its mode of foraging would have been {{similar to that of the}} high-browsing giraffe and okapi, rather than to modern rhinoceroses, whose heads are carried close to the ground.|$|E
50|$|Tapirus kabomani (also {{known as}} the little black <b>tapir</b> or kabomani <b>tapir)</b> {{is one of five}} extant species of <b>tapir,</b> large {{browsing}} mammals similar in shape to a pig. It is the smallest <b>tapir</b> species, even smaller than mountain <b>tapir</b> (T. pinchaque), which had been considered the smallest. T. kabomani is found in the Amazon rainforest, where it appears to be sympatric with the South American <b>tapir</b> (T. terrestris). When it was announced in December 2013, T. kabomani was the first odd-toed ungulate discovered in over 100 years.|$|R

25|$|The Malayan <b>tapir</b> (Tapirus indicus), {{also called}} the Asian <b>tapir,</b> is {{the largest of the}} five species of <b>tapir</b> and the only one native to Asia. The {{scientific}} name refers to the East Indies, the species' natural habitat. In the Malay language, the <b>tapir</b> is commonly referred to as cipan, tenuk or badak tampung.|$|R
5|$|Conflicting {{reports have}} been made as to its {{preferred}} habitat; two papers suggest it preferred channels to floodplains, but another suggests it preferred the opposite. The possible preference for channels {{is based on the}} relative abundance of thescelosaur fossils in sandstones, representing channel environments, in comparison to mudstones, representing floodplain environments. No bonebeds or accumulations of multiple individuals have yet been reported. Dale Russell, in a popular work, noted that Thescelosaurus was the most common small herbivore in the Hell Creek Formation of the Fort Peck area. He described the environment of the time as a flat floodplain, with a relatively dry subtropical climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from angiosperm trees, to bald cypress, to ferns and ginkgos. Although most dinosaur skeletons from this area are incomplete, possibly due to the low preservation potential of forests, Thescelosaurus skeletons are much more complete, suggesting that this genus frequented stream channels. Thus when a Thescelosaurus died, it may have been in or near a river, making it easier to bury and preserve for later fossilization. Russell tentatively compared it to the capybaras and <b>tapirs.</b> Other dinosaurs that shared its time and place include the ceratopsids Triceratops and Torosaurus, hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus, ankylosaurid Ankylosaurus, pachycephalosaurian Pachycephalosaurus, and the theropods Ornithomimus, Troodon, and Tyrannosaurus. Thescelosaurus was also abundant in the Lance Formation. Toe bones from this genus are the most common finds after fossils of Triceratops and Edmontosaurus, and {{it may have been the}} most common dinosaur there in life, if the Lance Formation had a preservational bias against small animals.|$|E
5|$|Like all cats, the jaguar is an obligate carnivore, feeding only on meat. It is an {{opportunistic}} {{hunter and}} its diet encompasses at least 87 species. The jaguar can take virtually any terrestrial or riparian vertebrate found in Central or South America, with {{a preference for}} large prey. The jaguar {{is more of a}} dietary generalist than its Old World cousins: the American tropics have a high diversity of small animals but relatively low populations and diversity of the large ungulates which this genus favors. They regularly take adult caimans, deer, capybaras, <b>tapirs,</b> peccaries, dogs, zorros, and sometimes even anacondas. However, the cat will eat any small species that can be caught, including frogs, mice, birds (mainly ground-based species such as cracids), fish, sloths, monkeys, and turtles; a study conducted in Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, for example, revealed that the diets of jaguars there consisted primarily of armadillos and pacas. Some jaguars will also take domestic livestock. El Jefe, the only jaguar currently living within the territory of the United States, has also been found to kill and eat American black bears, as deduced from hairs found within his scats and the partly consumed carcass of a black bear sow with the distinctive puncture marks to the skull left by jaguars. This indicates that jaguars might have once preyed on black bears when the species was still present in the area. Spectacled bears are also known to avoid jaguars, possibly because they may constitute occasional prey items.|$|E
25|$|Although they {{frequently}} live in dryland forests, <b>tapirs</b> {{with access to}} rivers spend {{a good deal of}} time in and underwater, feeding on soft vegetation, taking refuge from predators, and cooling off during hot periods. <b>Tapirs</b> near a water source will swim, sink to the bottom, and walk along the riverbed to feed, and have been known to submerge themselves under water to allow small fish to pick parasites off their bulky bodies. Along with freshwater lounging, <b>tapirs</b> often wallow in mud pits, which also help to keep them cool and free of insects.|$|E

25|$|Malayan <b>tapirs</b> are {{primarily}} solitary creatures, marking out {{large tracts of}} land as their territory, though these areas usually overlap {{with those of other}} individuals. <b>Tapirs</b> mark out their territories by spraying urine on plants, and they often follow distinct paths, which they have bulldozed through the undergrowth.|$|E
25|$|In the wild, the tapir's diet {{consists}} of fruit, berries, and leaves, particularly young, tender growth. <b>Tapirs</b> will spend {{many of their}} waking hours foraging along well-worn trails, snouts {{to the ground in}} search of food. Baird's <b>tapirs</b> have been observed to eat around 40kg (85lb) of vegetation in one day.|$|E
25|$|The first tapirids, such as Heptodon, {{appeared}} in the early Eocene of North America. They appeared very similar to modern forms, but were about half the size, and lacked the proboscis. The first true <b>tapirs</b> {{appeared in}} the Oligocene. By the Miocene, such genera as Miotapirus were almost indistinguishable from the extant species. Asian and American <b>tapirs</b> were believed to have diverged around 20 to 30 million years ago; <b>tapirs</b> later migrated from North America to South America around 3 million years ago, {{as part of the}} Great American Interchange. For much of their history, <b>tapirs</b> were spread across the Northern Hemisphere, where they became extinct as recently as 10,000 years ago. T. merriami, T. veroensis, T. copei, and T. californicus became extinct during the Pleistocene in North America. The giant tapir Megatapirus survived until about 4,000 years ago in China.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of their}} size, <b>tapirs</b> have few natural predators, and even reports of killings by tigers are scarce. The main {{threat to the}} Malayan <b>tapirs</b> is human activity, {{including}} deforestation for agricultural purposes, flooding caused by the damming of rivers for hydroelectric projects, and illegal trade. In Thailand, for instance, capture and sale of a young tapir may be worth US$5500.00. In areas such as Sumatra, where the population is predominantly Muslim, <b>tapirs</b> are seldom hunted for food, as their physical similarity to pigs has made tapir meat a taboo, but in some regions they are hunted for sport or shot accidentally when mistaken for other animals. Protected status in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, which seeks to curb deliberate killing of <b>tapirs</b> but {{does not address the}} issue of habitat loss, has had limited effect in reviving or maintaining the population.|$|E
25|$|Lack {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} in tapir populations {{has become a}} major source of concern for conservationists. Habitat loss has isolated already small populations of wild <b>tapirs,</b> putting each group in greater danger of dying out completely.

25|$|<b>Tapirs</b> have brown eyes, {{often with}} a bluish cast to them, which has been {{identified}} as corneal cloudiness, a condition most commonly found in Malayan <b>tapirs.</b> The exact etiology is unknown, but the cloudiness may be caused by excessive exposure to light or by trauma.

40|$|This thesis tested {{hypotheses}} about {{the response of}} Baird‚Äôs <b>tapir</b> to rising anthropogenic pressure in Honduras. Baird‚Äôs <b>tapir</b> is the largest land mammal native to the Neotropics, and was previously abundant in all countries between Mexico and Ecuador. Patterns in Baird‚Äôs <b>tapir</b> occupancy in Honduras were modelled to test {{the effect of a}} range of environmental variables on the distribution and abundance of the species. Analyses of the genetic structure of Baird‚Äôs <b>tapir</b> in Honduras revealed very little genetic diversity at the mitochondrial genome. Only two haplotypes were identified from 69 samples successfully genotyped, representing a remarkably low level of diversity, which is likely to affect the viability of the species in the long-term. Occupancy and population estimates were generated for four protected areas, and for the remaining regions in Honduras where Baird‚Äôs <b>tapir</b> have been confirmed to remain. Occupancy was found to be associated with environmental variables relating to accessibility. Although the population estimates generated here exceed previous estimates, evidence of ongoing poaching and deforestation of <b>tapir</b> habitat suggests that Baird‚Äôs <b>tapir</b> populations in Honduras may not be viable outside of the protected areas of La Moskitia. Population Viability Analyses for the remaining areas of <b>tapir</b> occupancy in Honduras demonstrate the vulnerability of the species to habitat fragmentation and hunting pressure. Annual surveys in Cusuco National Park (PNC) from 2009 to 2012 investigated the conservation status of the species in this <b>tapir</b> stronghold over the duration of this PhD project. Patch occupancy analysis demonstrated that Baird‚Äôs <b>tapir</b> display a distribution bias in PNC associated with accessibility, and identified that Baird‚Äôs <b>tapir</b> are suffering a population decline that has the potential to cause the extirpation of the species from this Park within the next few years...|$|R
25|$|The Malayan tapir, {{the species}} most {{isolated}} geographically {{from the rest}} of the genus, has a significantly smaller number of chromosomes and has been found to share fewer homologies with the three types of American <b>tapirs.</b> A number of conserved autosomes (13 between karyotypes of Baird's tapir and the Brazilian tapir, and 15 between Baird's and the mountain tapir) have also been found in the American species that are not found in the Asian animal. However, geographic proximity is not an absolute predictor of genetic similarity; for instance, G-banded preparations have revealed Malayan, Baird's and Brazilian <b>tapirs</b> have identical X chromosomes, while mountain <b>tapirs</b> are separated by a heterochromatic addition/deletion.|$|E
