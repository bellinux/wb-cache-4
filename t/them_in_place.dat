5|$|An air-cuticle {{multilayer}} in {{the scales}} creates optical interference. Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that hold <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> and maintain an air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the wavelength of visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the proximal {{end of each}} scale, to about six layers at the distal end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain wavelengths of light, which {{are determined by the}} thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.|$|E
5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among frogs in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only frogs known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except L. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.|$|E
5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E

For example, components of the coverage concept are selectively recombined into new, different definitions of a coverage.|$|R

5|$|The Mysterium Tech (or MysTech) {{system allows}} players to use in-game objects collectively known as MysTech, {{and create new}} MysTech by using a {{configuration}} screen accessed through Elementor Host items. MysTech cannot be used until they are awakened after a certain story event. Eight basic colors of MysTech exist, representing different elements; for example, green represents poison. Players can use MysTech to inflict damage upon enemies, plague them with certain status effects (such as freezing <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>place),</b> or heal party members. Casting status effect-MysTech on party members will cure them if afflicted by enemy status spells. MysTech slabs and Elementor Hosts can be found as treasure in the game world or bought from shops. To create MysTech, players place colored bugs (found on small hills in several game locations) in empty slots on an Elementor Host. The color of bugs placed in the function slot determines the color of MysTech, while other slots modify the power and/or range of the spell. Players can add special bugs known as Cobalt Crawlers to make a spell target all enemies instead of one; a Host filled with eight Crawlers unlocks a secret spell. The effect of bugs can be amplified by feeding them petals from Lifeflowers, {{which can be found}} scattered throughout the world of Anachronox. Special types of Hosts with two or three different functions allow players to pick which MysTech function to use in battle.|$|E

This form of butt joint is rarely used in furniture making.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{structure}} of the university at the time, Thomas would have entered the Scots College there; the fact that the subscription was of Scottish officers indicates that that is the most likely possibility.

In response to some people wanting their existing amalgam removed for fear of mercury poisoning, these societies advise that the removal of fillings is likely to cause a greater exposure to mercury than leaving the fillings in place. These societies warn that removal of amalgam fillings, in addition to being unnecessary health care and likely to cause more mercury exposure than leaving <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> is also expensive.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Arms {{as shown}} above {{may only be}} used by the Queen herself. They also appear in courtrooms, since the monarch is deemed to be the fount of {{judicial}} authority in the United Kingdom and law courts comprise part of the ancient royal court (thus so named). Judges are officially Crown representatives, demonstrated by the display of the Royal Arms behind the judge's bench in all UK courts (with the exceptions of the magistrates' court in the City of London, where behind the Justices of the Peace stands a sword upright flanked by the arms of the City and the Crown). In Northern Ireland, the Royal Arms cannot be displayed in courtrooms or on court-house exteriors. There are a few exceptions, with the Royal Arms allowed to be displayed in the courtrooms of the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast and the courts in Armagh, Banbridge, Downpatrick, Magherafelt, or Omagh. They may be shown on the exterior of court buildings that had <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> prior to the 2002 law.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the band}} had {{historically}} been well-used to line-up changes, Cardiacs were profoundly {{affected by the}} multiple departures taking place between 1989 and 1991. A particular blow had been the departure of Drake, whose virtuoso keyboard skills and compositional input had {{made him one of}} the backbones of the band. Drake was considered irreplaceable and Cardiacs opted not to look for a new keyboard player, remaining as a quartet of two guitars, bass and drums (with Christian Hayes being replaced as second guitarist by Jon Poole who had previously played with the Cardiacs-inspired Milton Keynes band Ad Nauseam). While Cardiacs was still able to record more fully orchestrated music in the studio, a lack of suitable personnel (or the budget to keep <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>place)</b> meant that the live band had to change drastically. Abandoning several signature musical features (saxophone, assorted percussion and virtuoso keyboards), Cardiacs' live music shifted away from the wider instrumentation of the past and moved towards a more guitar-heavy, power-rock sound in line with the remaining quartet lineup. However, the music remained complex, if narrower in focus, and Smith recorded additional keyboard and percussion parts onto backing tapes for the band to play over.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} several decades of statehood, Rhode Island was governed in {{accordance}} with the 1663 colonial charter. Voting rights were restricted to landowners holding at least $134 in property, disenfranchising well over half of the state's male citizens. The charter apportioned legislative seats equally among the state's towns, over-representing rural areas and under-representing the growing industrial centers. Additionally, the charter disallowed landless citizens from filing civil suits without endorsement from a landowner. Bills were periodically introduced in the legislature to expand suffrage, but they were invariably defeated. In 1841, activists led by Thomas W. Dorr organized an extralegal convention to draft a state constitution, arguing that the charter government violated the Guarantee Clause in Article Four, Section Four of the United States Constitution. In 1842, the charter government and Dorr's supporters held separate elections, and two rival governments claimed sovereignty over the state. Dorr's supporters led an armed rebellion against the charter government, and Dorr was arrested and imprisoned for treason against the state. Later that year, the legislature drafted a state constitution, removing property requirements for American-born citizens but keeping <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for immigrants, and retaining urban under-representation in the legislature.|$|E

Such terms he classes uninterpretable terms; although elsewhere he has some instances of such terms being interpreted by integers.|$|R
