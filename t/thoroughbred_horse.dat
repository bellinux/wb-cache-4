5|$|The use of fast horse-drawn coaches, {{known as}} 'Flying Coaches', began in 1669. Travelling between London and Oxford by coach had {{involved}} an overnight stay at Beaconsfield, but Oxford University organised {{a project to}} allow completion of the journey between sunrise and sunset. The project succeeded, and was quickly copied by Cambridge University; {{by the end of}} Charles II's reign, in 1685, Flying Coaches ran three times a week from London to all major towns, in good conditions covering a distance of around fifty miles in a day. The <b>Thoroughbred</b> <b>horse</b> was developed from about this time, with native mares being crossbred to Arab, Turk and Barb horses to produce excellent racehorses; the General Stud Book, giving clear and detailed pedigrees, was first published in the 1790s, and the lineage of today's Thoroughbred horses can be traced with great accuracy to 1791. Horses running in races sponsored by the monarchy then carried weights of around , more than the usual weight of 8–10stone (51–64kg), indicating that horse racing, hunting and chasing partly originated in a need for military training.|$|E
