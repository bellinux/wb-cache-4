5|$|The Giants {{struggled}} in 2015, finishing 6-10 again {{and third in}} the NFC East due to the Giants defense blowing the lead in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minutes</b> in 6 of their 10 games.

As part of the team's preparation, they toured the United States and Australia.

As Hartlepool United, since December led by former Tranmere Rovers manager Ronnie Moore, won their home game against Exeter City, Tranmere lost their last chance to remain in the Football League.

Mikhailov skated across the Canadian net about 20 feet out, lured Dryden away from the net, then back-handed the puck into the net between his legs. The strategy of three lines, combined with the heat in the arena, had left the Canadians exhausted by then and the Soviets scored twice in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minutes</b> to finish with a 7–3 victory.|$|E
