The recognition algorithm is based onstate transitions triggered by <b>time-line</b> <b>analysis</b> of pitch angle andangular velocity of an orientation sensor. Currently the system candifferentiate between three postures successfully. We associatedeach posture with different contexts which are of interest forpedestrian navigation systems: investigation, navigation and idle.

40|$|The KNL {{processors}} offers unique features concerning {{memory hierarchy}} and vectorization capabilities. To improve tool support within these two areas, we present extensions to the Score-P measurement {{system and the}} Cube report explorer. KNL introduced a new memory architecture, utilizing MCDRAM and DDR. To help the user in the decision where to place data structures, we record a MCDRAM candidate metric. In addition we track all MCDRAM allocations through the hbwmalloc API, providing memory metrics like leaked memory or the high-watermark on a per-region basis. For <b>time-line</b> <b>analysis</b> per-process memory statistics are recorded via numastat. KNL's large vector processing unit needs to be utilized and utilized effectively. The metrics compute-to-data access ratio and VPU intensity are introduced to identify vectorization candidates on a per-region basis. Taking the hardware structure into account, {{the distribution of the}} KNL-specific metrics is visualized in the Cube report explorer...|$|E
40|$|With {{increased}} {{terrorist threats}} {{in the past}} few years, it is no longer feasible to feel confident that a facility is well protected with a static security system. Potential adversaries often research their targets, examining procedural and system changes, in order to attack at a vulnerable time. Such system changes may include scheduled sensor maintenance, scheduled or unscheduled changes in the guard force, facility alert level changes, sensor failures or degradation, etc. All of these changes impact the system effectiveness and can make a facility more vulnerable. Currently, a standard analysis of system effectiveness is performed approximately every six months using a vulnerability assessment tool called ASSESS (Analytical Systems and Software for Evaluating Safeguards and Systems). New standards for determining a facility's system effectiveness will be defined by tools that are currently under development, such as ATLAS (Adversary <b>Time-line</b> <b>Analysis</b> System) and NextGen (Next Generation Security Simulation). Although these tools are useful to model analyses at different spatial resolutions and can support some sensor dynamics using statistical models, they are limited in that they require a static system state as input. They cannot account for the dynamics of the system through day-to-day operations. The emphasis of this project was to determine the feasibility of dynamically monitoring the facility security system and performing an analysis as changes occur. Hence, the system effectiveness is known at all times, greatly assisting time-critical decisions in response to a threat or a potential threat...|$|E
40|$|This {{specification}} {{establishes the}} requirements, concepts, and preliminary {{design for a}} set of software known as the IGDS/TRAP Interface Program (ITIP). This software provides the capability to develop at an Interactive Graphics Design System (IGDS) design station process flow diagrams for use by the NASA Coal Gasification Task Team. In addition, ITIP will use the Data Management and Retrieval System (DMRS) to maintain a data base from which a properly formatted input file to the <b>Time-Line</b> and Resources <b>Analysis</b> Program (TRAP) can be extracted. This set of software will reside on the PDP- 11 / 70 and will become the primary interface between the Coal Gasification Task Team and IGDS, DMRS, and TRAP.

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} suggests associations between energy balance, eating frequency, macronutrient content, and macronutrient distribution with body composition. In particular, energy balance and protein intake have been conventionally evaluated in 24 -hr time blocks, consistent with dietary recommendations and general public understanding. However, {{there is a}} potential benefit to investigating energy balance and protein intake in smaller increments of time to account for dynamic changes that occur within-day. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate protein intake/distribution relative to energy balance fluctuations during the day and body composition in collegiate female basketball players. Methods: Subjects provided information on dietary intake and expenditure. Body composition was assessed by multi-current bioelectrical impedance. Energy balance (EB) and related protein distribution variables were determined with a Computerized <b>Time-Line</b> Energy <b>Analysis</b> procedure. Data were analyzed for associations between energy balance, protein intake and distribution, and body composition. Data are displayed as either traditional 24 -hr EB and total protein intake or dynamic protein variables in relation to real-time EB (ingestion within ± 400 kcal EB or 3 ̆e 0 kcal EB). Results: There was no relationship between net 24 -hr energy balance and percentage body fat. A statistically significant positive relationship was observed between total protein intake and body fat mass (R =. 597; p =. 031). No relationship was observed between protein distribution variables (g in ± 400 kcal EB, g in 3 ̆e 0 kcal EB) and percentage body fat. Protein eating occurrences (3 ̆e 10 g, ± 400 kcal EB) was inversely correlated with BMI (R = -. 650; p =. 016). Subjects with the greatest energy deficits presented with lower lean body mass (R= -. 736; p =. 004). Conclusion: These data suggest that within-day protein distribution relative to energy balance are associated with BMI, but not with percentage body fat. Those with the highest protein intake had the highest body fat mass, with no correlation between protein intake and total energy intake detected. In this group, no association between 24 hr intake net values or within-day intake values were found to be related to body fat percentage. However, the greatest energy balance deficit during the day was strongly inversely associated with lean body mass, indicative of potentially deleterious effects of energy restriction...|$|R
40|$|Mobile Augmented Reality {{applications}} base on navigation frameworks try {{to promote}} interaction beyond the desktop by employing wearable sensors, which collect user's position, orientation or diverse types of activities. Most navigation frameworks track location and heading {{of the user}} in the global coordinate frame using Global Positioning System (GPS) data. On the other hand, in the wearable computing area researchers studied angular data of human b o y segments in the local coordinate frame using inertial orientation trackers. We propose a combination of global and local coordinate frame approaches and provide a context-aware interaction framework for mobile devices by seamlessly changing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for pedestrians wandering in urban environments. The system is designed and tested on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) based handheld prototype mounted with a GPS receiver and inertial orientation tracker. It introduces a method to estimate orientation of a mobile user's hand. The recognition algorithm is based on state transitions triggered by <b>time-line</b> <b>analysis</b> of pitch angle and angular velocity of the orientation tracker. The prototype system can differentiate between three postures successfully. We associated each posture with different contexts which are of interest for pedestrian navigation systems: investigation, navigation and idle. Thus, we introduce the idea that once orientation trackers became part of mobile computers, {{they can be used}} to create natural interaction techniques with mobile computers. The prototype is tested successfully in two urban environments: Sabanci University campus area,. 9 th International Istanbul Biennial venues in Beyoglu, Istanbul...|$|E
