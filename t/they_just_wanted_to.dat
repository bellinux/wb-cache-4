500|$|Contrary to the accusations, {{the band}} have always denied {{the notion that}} they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video. Steve Harris has since commented that, [...] "It was mad. They {{completely}} got the wrong end of the stick. They obviously hadn't read the lyrics. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists." [...] Harris has also stated that [...] "The Number of the Beast" [...] song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching , and also influenced by Robert Burns' Tam o' Shanter. Furthermore, the band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born again Christian since 1999.|$|E
500|$|While {{the event}} is {{considered}} a memorable one by several critics, they also agree {{that it was not}} one of the Stones' best performances, and the guitars played during the concert were out of tune. In a 1971 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Keith Richards evaluated their performance, [...] "We played pretty bad until near the end, because we hadn't played for years ... Nobody minded, because <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hear us play again." [...] The Stones' portion of concert was filmed by Granada Television and broadcast that September. It has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray. In April 2013, the band announced their intention to play two return concerts on 6 and 13 July, although the performances were not free.|$|E

500|$|During production, the film's English {{title was}} changed from The Snow Queen to Frozen, a {{decision}} that drew comparisons to another Disney film, Tangled. Peter Del Vecho explained that [...] "the title Frozen came up independently of the title Tangled. It's because, to us, it represents the movie. Frozen plays {{on the level of}} ice and snow but also the frozen relationship, the frozen heart that has to be thawed. We don't think of comparisons between Tangled and Frozen, though." [...] He also mentioned that the film will still retain its original title, The Snow Queen, in some countries: [...] "because that just resonated stronger in some countries than Frozen. Maybe there's a richness to The Snow Queen in the country's heritage and <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> emphasize that." ...|$|E
500|$|The Neptunes told MTV News {{that the}} duo and Timberlake drove {{in a car}} {{listening}} to Earth, Wind & Fire albums for inspiration, with {{the background of the}} band's music what the production duo wanted to implement into Justified musical content. The production duo commented that despite not being content with sampling music, for inspiration, they also listened to both Off the Wall (1979) and Thriller (1982), albums by Michael Jackson. Their intentions were to create music that was similar to Jackson's work without [...] "recycling them". One of the two members of The Neptunes, Chad Hugo, commented that <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> re-create [...] "that sense of those timeless, classic songs, without any of the 'bling, bling, hit me on my two-way' style of the new R It has elements of the old and the new." [...] The producer further {{went on to say that}} people wanted Timberlake to be conformed to being part of boy band NSYNC, with the former insisting that the singer is an immaculate vocalist. Hugo acknowledged Timberlake's break-up with singer Britney Spears, saying that some of the album's music could be directed towards it.|$|E
500|$|Cacophonous being {{a secular}} label {{releasing}} material by {{a band that}} held Christian beliefs generated some interest in the metal scene. In an interview with Art for the Ears Webzine, published on December 12, 1998, Armoth said: [...] "We sent the CD and a short biography. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> sign us because of the music. And that's exactly {{what we wanted to}} do." [...] 2 years later in a 2000 interview with the Finnish The Christian Underground Zine issue 4, the fanzine's interviewer asked Antestor: [...] "However, you had a record deal with Cacophonous Records (ex-Cradle of Filth, Bal-Sagoth). What kind of experiences did you get from that?" [...] The band replied: [...] "Pretty bad, actually. I can not say they did anything else than released the album. No money, no royalties, nothing." [...] The interviewer also asked: [...] "Did the record company set any demands concerning your image?" [...] Antestor replied: [...] "Nothing like that. They just said that it is not recommendable for us to proclaim exactly everywhere that we are a Christian band, and they censored the words 'Lord' and 'Jesus' from our lyrics. We ourselves removed a few texts because {{we did not want to}} provoke unnecessarily." ...|$|E

500|$|Lonsdale's {{employer}} and landlord received {{phone calls from}} Scientology representatives who claimed {{that he was a}} religious bigot and dangerous. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology for a deposition in the fall of 2006, and the Church claimed that he belonged to an anti-Scientology group which had previously been barred from protesting in certain areas in downtown Clearwater, the Lisa McPherson Trust. Luke Lirot, the lawyer who defended Lonsdale in the matter, told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "I found him to be quite affable and truly a very intelligent man ... I certainly hope that a very thorough investigation is conducted." [...] In his deposition, Lonsdale stated he was unemployed and began to educate himself about Scientology while working on a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater. After reading more about Scientology, he decided to shed light on the organization and irritate Scientologists. Of the claims Scientology made that Lonsdale was affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, Lirot commented: [...] "It was obvious to everybody {{he had nothing to do}} with the trust, and the trust had been disbanded and dissolved many years prior ... <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> try to come up with a way to preclude him from exercising his right to picket in downtown Clearwater, and they were unsuccessful in doing that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Scorsese {{acted in}} a cameo role as Vincent van Gogh in the film Dreams by Japanese {{director}} Akira Kurosawa. [...] In 1994, Scorsese's cameo appearance in the Robert Redford film Quiz Show is remembered for the telling line: [...] "You see, the audience didn't tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> watch the money." [...] De Fina-Cappa was the production company he formed that same year with producer Barbara De Fina.|$|E
2500|$|The album's working {{title was}} Strawberries for Pigs, a name {{inspired}} by the reception the band's newer music received from some of their older fans. As Vanian explained, [...] "we were playing {{a lot of new}} material, and we had an audience that didn't want to hear about anything, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hear Neat Neat Neat and New Rose nothing else. And they wanted to just smash everything. And they weren't interested in hearing music at all.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, league rules changed {{to make the}} league more [...] "strictly baseball." [...] The bases were pushed back and {{pitchers}} began pitching overhand. Many of the existing female pitchers were {{not strong enough to}} pitch overhand so girls started to be pulled in from third base or the outfield to pitch, and pitchers were rotated to the outfield. If they were unsuccessful in the outfield many would try to pitch for a team in Chicago, where underhand pitching was still used. Thompson played in Chicago for a few years until she decided to retire from baseball and go home. She was disappointed by the way the league changed saying, [...] "They had a great game, and I don't know why they were never satisfied, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> improve and improve." ...|$|E

Before then they had never talked about reforming, <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get to know each other again. It was two months later that they decided to do a reunion concert, which led to a 102 date tour. [...] The 25-Year Silver Jubilee Reunion Celebration tour in 1993 was sufficiently successful that the group has continued to perform and record together, on and off, ever since. They staged several sell-out tours of Australia, New Zealand and the UK. The reformed group issued several albums, including new studio albums Future Road in October 1997 (which peaked at No.4 on the ARIA Albums Chart) and Morningtown Ride to Christmas (which reached the top20 in 2001). and both albums were certified platinum.|$|E
2500|$|In a July 30, 2002 {{editorial}} for the Gazette, retired West Virginia State College economist Aaron Metz {{identified two}} issues {{arising from the}} affair; {{freedom of speech and}} [...] "freedom from fear", writing [...] "Freedom of speech suffers in an environment of fear. Katie was afraid to go to school because law and order ceased to exist there." [...] Metz observed that the story had caught the attention of Poles, some of whom wanted Sierra to come and study in their country, and to the Japanese, whose response he called [...] "more irrational", saying they [...] "didn't want her; <b>they</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get that T-shirt in their hands" [...] and were [...] "making fun of West Virginia, a state 50th in education, for expelling a good student - a sort of sideshow using Katie and her T-shirt on TV for entertainment". In the context of adult control of adolescent expression, a December 2003 editorial in the Gazette wrote that the Sissonville High's administrators [...] "overreacted" [...] in Sierra's case, feeding a backlash against the student instead of [...] "taking advantage of her youthful energy and curiosity to craft meaningful civics lessons".|$|E

It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva did {{see this as a}} chance to work more as war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested to go. Carter did see it as an chance to fix some problems [...] "he felt trapped in". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and to [...] "get of the white pipe". [...] "Kevin was on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip". Marinovich wrote in the book. To pay for the travel Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have [...] "great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: [...] "The UN hoped to published the famine … Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for aid organizations to sustain funding".
