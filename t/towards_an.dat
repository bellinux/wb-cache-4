The case of a transgranular stage I crack that 'propagates' <b>towards</b> <b>a</b> grain oriented for multiple slip is considered. The values of the crack tip opening/sliding displacements are calculated for the crack located at different distances of the 'multiple slip' grain. Two multiple slip orientations are considered for this adjacent grain: a orientation and a orientation. Calculations show that the opening/sliding displacement at the crack tip is higher (up to a factor 1. 7) if the crack propagates <b>towards</b> <b>a</b> grain than <b>towards</b> <b>a</b> grain. This could imply that propagation <b>towards</b> <b>a</b> grain is more difficult than <b>towards</b> <b>a</b> grain...|$|R
5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organised}} sports for people with disabilities, and was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960. Both the rules for the sport and approval of classifications were the responsibility of the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA) until 1992, when the International Paralympic Committee took over the governance of classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving <b>towards</b> <b>an</b> evidence-based classification system.|$|E

It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it.
