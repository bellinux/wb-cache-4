5|$|Enemies {{can hear}} {{footsteps}} and other sounds. When Fiona is {{in a dangerous}} situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items {{can be used to}} calm her down. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some items are used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>over.</b> Some items are found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1877 flat season, Petrarch was offered for sale by Dupplin. He was bought by Lord Lonsdale and was moved across Newmarket to the Bedford Lodge stable of Joseph Cannon. On his first {{appearance}} of the year he carried the second highest weight of 125 pounds in the Lincolnshire Handicap on 21 March. Ridden by the champion jockey Fred Archer, he started at odds of 9/1 and finished eleventh of the thirty-three runners behind the filly Footstep. He was then allowed <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> in a race at Newmarket before winning the High Level Handicap at Epsom.|$|E
25|$|Robert the Devil's 1881 {{campaign}} {{began with}} an anti-climax as no owner entered a horse to oppose him in the Rosebery Plate at Newmarket, allowing him <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> to claim the prize money. On June 3,at the Derby meeting, Robert the Devil met Bend Or {{for the fifth time}} in the Epsom Gold Gup, over the Derby distance of one and a half miles. The Derby winner was in good form, having produced an impressive weight-carrying performance to win the City and Suburban Handicap in April. With other intended runners dropping out the race became a match, attracting extraordinary interest and provoking unprecedented scenes of excitement. Robert the Devil set off in front, and Archer followed close behind on Bend Or. Approaching the final furlong, Archer made his move, sending Bend Or into the lead. On this occasion, Robert the Devil could not respond and Bend Or appeared to have won rather more easily than the neck margin suggested.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} {{strategy of}} the northern two-lined salamander begins with an elaborate courtship. It may take place from September (in the southern parts of its range) to May (in the north). Observations of courtship in the species were made based on individuals held in captivity by Noble (1929), and a summary of these observations are: the male becomes restless, as if searching for a female. Upon finding the female, he will lift her by pushing his snout under her cloacal region or chest. The male adopts a distinct posture, bending his body laterally around her snout. The pair may remain in this position {{for an hour or}} more. The female eventually slips out of this posture and begins to straddle the male's tail with her fore limbs, while pressing her chin against the base of the male's tail. The male may undulate his tail from side to side in a slow and exaggerated manner, and the female moves her head from side to side, alternately from the male’s tail. This tail-straddling walk may last for over an hour, at which point the male deposits a spermatophore, leading the female <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> it, at which time she may either accept or reject the male’s sperm. The spermatophore of this species is described as conical, 2.5mm in height and with a colorless stalk that tapers towards the tip.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} precaution {{is to remove}} and reduce trash and rubbish from your property, such as woodpiles, boxes, plywood, tires, and trash cans—especially if they are stored {{right next to the}} house. With attached garages, block off house access by sealing cracks around doors and access holes for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under it. This minimizes chances that any spider can crawl onto the bed. Do not leave clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally worn should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. However, spiders' perched legs allow them <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> most pesticides, making the use of chemicals to eradicate the spiders impractical and unnecessarily toxic. A 2014 study indicates that fumigation may be more effective than previously believed. Sticky traps placed along floor boards offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure.|$|E
25|$|Macgregor was {{the subject}} of a huge public gamble for the Derby on June 1, and was made one of the shortest-priced favourites in the history of the race at odds of 4/9. Kingcraft on the other hand was almost {{forgotten}} and started a 20/1 outsider in a field of fifteen. According to a report in The Spectator the weather on Derby day was poor and the crowd smaller than usual. Ridden by Tom French, Kingcraft was saddled away from the main paddock and disappointed the crowd by failing to take part in the parade in front of the stands. The start of the race was delayed for some time by the behaviour of Cockney Boy who refused to line up with the other runners. When the race got under way French restrained Kingcraft at the back of the field in the early stages before making steady progress from half way. Approaching the turn into the straight, French pulled Kingcraft to the wide outside, avoiding the congestion and bumping along the rail. The outsiders Palmerston and Muster led the race in the straight from Macgregor, but two furlongs from the finish the favourite came under pressure and was soon beaten. French made his move on Kingcraft just over a furlong from the finish, took the lead from Palmerston and quickly pulled clear to win by four lengths. The win delighted the bookmakers who had heavy liabilities on Macgregor. Lord Falmouth had accepted a bet of sixpence on Kingcraft from the wife of his trainer Mathew Dawson. After Kingcraft won, he presented Mrs Dawson with a sixpence set in a £500 silver bracelet. Kingcraft was allowed <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> in the Great Surrey Foal Stakes at the same meeting.|$|E

The previously undefeated Yorkshire colt was strongly favoured in the betting, but Grey Momus won the two mile contest [...] "in a canter" [...] by two lengths. At the next meeting, Grey Momus claimed three more prizes without having to race. He was allowed <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> in a £50 race over three miles on 15 April.

2500|$|By the {{following}} season in 1979, Gwynn {{still had not}} heard from Aztecs baseball coach Jim Dietz about joining the team after the basketball season. However, an opportunity arose after two outfielders riding bicycles were struck by an automobile and injured, and Dietz {{was in need of}} replacements. Freshman shortstop Bobby Meacham, who played against Gwynn in high school, convinced the coach to give Gwynn a chance. Dietz had never seen Gwynn play, but contacted him mostly because he trusted Meacham. Vezie by then had been fired, and his successor, Smokey Gaines, allowed Gwynn to play baseball. Were it not for the accident, Gwynn doubted he would have ever played baseball with SDSU.

2500|$|Following the {{campaign}} a saying arose that the Generals [...] and [...] (January and February) defeated Napoleon, {{alluding to the}} Russian Winter.

In addition, it lacked the ability to forge caulkined shoes for the horses to enable them <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> roads that had become iced over. The most devastating effect of the cold weather upon Napoleon's forces occurred during their retreat. Hypothermia coupled with starvation led to the loss of thousands.
