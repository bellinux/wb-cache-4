5|$|In the rideability test, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> {{evaluated}} {{by a member}} of the studbook evaluation committee by being ridden at a walk, trot and canter. The horse's movement, balance and disposition are evaluated and given 4 to 10 points. The horse should express cooperation, gentleness, attentiveness, sensitivity to cues, and active effort. This test is required for riding-type horses, and optional for pony-sized horses in lieu of the driveability test.|$|E
5|$|The general {{drivability}} test {{is performed}} by trotter stallions. It is optional for draught type horses {{in lieu of}} the pulling test, and for pony-sized horses {{in lieu of the}} rideability test. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> driven by two different members of the studbook evaluation committee during this test, and asked to perform at a walk and trot. Its cooperation and disposition are evaluated on a scale of 4 to 10 points.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> {{owned by}} Michael Lauffer and W.D. Cubbedge. Lauffer was {{previously}} a {{co-owner of the}} filly Rachel Alexandra, prior to her 2009 Preakness win. Initially, Lauffer and Cubbedge had put Shackleford up for sale as a yearling at the Keeneland auction, but when the bids failed to reach the reserve price of $275,000, Cubbedge and Lauffer bought back the colt and kept him.|$|E
50|$|In 1952 <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> {{discovered}} on Takarajima by Shigeyuki Hayashida, {{a professor of}} Kagoshima University, and designated <b>the</b> Tokara <b>horse.</b> It <b>was</b> theorized that <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> brought to Takarajima from Kikaijima around 1900. In 1953, <b>the</b> Tokara <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> designated a natural monument of Kagoshima. When Professor Hayashida first discovered <b>the</b> <b>horses,</b> he counted 43. Their numbers gradually declined during the 1960s because of agricultural mechanization, however, and {{it was difficult to}} monitor the population on Takarajima. Therefore, some of <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> transferred to <b>the</b> Mt. Kaimon Natural Park and Iriki Farm, part of the agricultural department of Kagoshima University.|$|R
50|$|The tombs had {{all been}} robbed, but enough {{remained}} to determine that <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> all buried in an upright position. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> <b>were</b> buried with all their trappings.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, the 10-minute halt was introduced, {{to occur}} after the {{completion}} of phases A, B, and C. It took place in a marked out area (the 10-minute box), where <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> checked by two judges and one veterinary official who would make sure <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> fit to continue onto phase D. If <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> unfit, <b>the</b> panel would pull it from the competition.|$|R
5|$|In {{a popular}} oleograph {{representation}} of Khandoba, Mhalsa is seated {{in front of}} Khandoba on his white horse. Mhalsa is piercing a demon's chest with a spear, while a dog is biting his thigh and <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> hitting his head. The other demon is grabbing the reins of the horse and attacking Khandoba with a club as Khandoba is dismounting the horse and attacking the demon with his sword. In other representations, Khandoba is seen seated on a horse with the heads of demons trod under the horse's hooves or their heads under Khandoba's knees.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 {{plans were}} {{announced}} {{to create a}} stud book for the breed, a collaborative venture between the Marwari Horse Society of India and the Indian government. A registration process was initiated in 2009, {{when it was announced}} that the Marwari Horse Society had become a government body, the only government-authorized registration society for Marwari horses. The registration process includes an evaluation of the horse against the breed standards, during which unique identification marks and physical dimensions are recorded. After the evaluation, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> cold branded with its registration number and photographed. In late 2009 the Indian government announced that the Marwari horse, along with other Indian horse breeds, would be commemorated on a set of stamps issued by that country.|$|E
5|$|Varian {{was one of}} a {{very few}} experts in the 21st century who was still {{teaching}} about vaquero equipment, methods, and history. She had a strong interest {{in the history of the}} spade bit horse in California. The spade is an elaborate, complex bit that can only be properly used on a highly trained horse handled by a skilled rider. In the vaquero tradition, its use represents the highest level of trust and communication between horse and rider. The process of training the spade bit horse takes five to seven years to complete. Its emphasis has always been on producing a finely tuned working horse and partner, emphasizing quality rather than on how quickly the goal is reached. The conformation of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> also a factor; to become a spade bit horse, the animal must be bred to have a higher neck set and well-carried head. Varian compared the ride and handling of a horse trained in this manner to that of a Jaguar automobile.|$|E
30|$|When {{the age of}} <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>was</b> not {{classified}} (Table  6), a dependence for the storage of Se (liver) and Cd (renal cortex) on the age of <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>was</b> detected (P[*]<[*] 0.05).|$|R

50|$|There <b>are</b> {{currently}} seven <b>horses</b> in <b>the</b> MPU. <b>The</b> <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> all Standard Bred {{horses and}} range from 14 {{years of age}} to 4 years of age. Five of <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> fully trained and ready for deployment. <b>The</b> two newest <b>horses</b> <b>are</b> currently undergoing training before being certified for duty.|$|R
5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the rider}} should use half-halts as <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> raising {{its head and}} neck upward (during the {{suspension}} phase), because this is when <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> engaging its hindquarters.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that standing can also increase the chance of navicular disease (such as a horse that spends {{most of the day}} in a stall with little turnout, as with some racehorses and show horses). Blood flow to the hoof decreases when <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> not in motion. <b>The</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> also constantly applying pressure to the navicular bones (which is intermittent as the horse moves).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>horse's</b> armor <b>was</b> then discussed, with a frontlet, breastplate, and thigh-pieces. The {{belly of}} <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> also {{recommended}} {{to be protected}} with a saddle cloth. The limbs of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> should also <b>be</b> protected.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>the</b> 1950s <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> concreted over by Westbury Urban District Council, {{apparently}} {{as a way}} to save {{on long-term}} maintenance costs. Since then, the concrete has greyed over time, and it was thoroughly cleaned in 1993. In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> vandalised when [...] "Stop This War" [...] was written in yellow across <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> in capital letters in protest of the Iraq War. After the words <b>were</b> removed, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> noticeably grey with a white horizontal strip where the message had been. In November 2006, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> repainted and <b>the</b> 1950s damage was fully repaired, as was the white strip. <b>The</b> newly whitened <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> illuminated for a third time on the night the repairs were finished, this time by Second World War searchlights. In July 2010, the neck of <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>was</b> vandalised when <b>the</b> word [...] "wonkey" [...] was written across it. This part of the neck had to be rewhitened in 2010, leading to <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> having a whiter neck {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|R

25|$|When on the {{incorrect}} lead, <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> usually left unbalanced. In this case, correct riding {{can make}} the difference in the horse's performance. Good riding can keep the legs positioned correctly enough so that <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> still able to perform the turn. Poor riding will hinder rather than help the horse, and in extreme situations such as a tight turn at speed, the horse may lose its legs footing and fall.|$|E
25|$|A horse may be {{returned}} to work after {{it is no longer}} showing signs of ER, and is no longer on NSAIDswhich can hide signs of another bout of ER. If NSAIDs are needed to keep the horse comfortable, or if <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> reluctant to continue work, the animal is not yet ready for a return to his regular training program. Blood tests should reveal that the horse's CPK concentration and AST levels are normal before <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> returned to work.|$|E

25|$|The longe line {{traveling}} from {{the horse to}} the hand is held in the hand in which direction <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> moving (so if <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> <b>is</b> working clockwise to the right, the right hand is the leading hand). The extra longe line is folded, never coiled, in the other hand. If the horse were to take off, a coiled line could tighten around the trainer's hand, dragging the trainer and possibly leading to life-threatening injuries. Large loops could be stepped on or caught on something.|$|E
