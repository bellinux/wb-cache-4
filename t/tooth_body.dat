40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{results of}} experimental investigations {{in respect of}} denture removal processes using as models so natural teeth as well and this removal process presupposes destruction of fixing cement by ultrasound action. It has been established that the best conditions for separation of a denture from a <b>tooth</b> <b>body</b> are ensured while ultrasound is acting on non-removable denture structure in liquid phase (water). At the expense of sound-capillary effect water fills in porous structure of fixing cement at high speed and a cavitation that appears in it leads to intensive cement destruction (dispersion). </p...|$|E

50|$|The exact {{classification}} of therizinosaurs {{had in the}} past been hotly debated, since their prosauropod-like <b>teeth</b> and <b>body</b> structure indicate that they were generally herbivorous, unlike typical theropods. Beipiaosaurus, being considered to be a primitive therizinosauroid, has features which suggest that all therizinosauroids, including the more derived Therizinosauridae, to be coelurosaurian theropods, not sauropodomorph or ornithischian relatives as once believed.|$|R

5000|$|Biocompatibility {{refers to}} how well the {{material}} coexists with the biological equilibrium of the <b>tooth</b> and <b>body</b> systems.

Common problems with some of the current dental materials include chemical leakage from the material, pulpal irritation and less commonly allergy. Some of the byproducts of the chemical reactions during different stages of material hardening need to be considered.|$|R

50|$|This fish is {{generally}} up to 25 centimeters long, {{but it has}} been known to reach 72 centimeters. The maximum published weight is 5 kilograms. Like other snooks it has a large head with a long, pointed snout and large, laterally positioned eyes. The large mouth has bands of villiform <b>teeth.</b> The <b>body</b> is yellowish brown to brownish green in color. It has a silvery sheen on the sides and belly and a dark line along the lateral line.|$|R
50|$|With an {{elongated}} and tapered snout, numerous sharp <b>teeth,</b> long <b>body,</b> short legs, and a tail adapted for swimming, its general appearance {{was very similar}} to a modern gharial or gar, and it probably had a similar lifestyle as an ambush aquatic predator feeding on fish and other aquatic animals. A study on the closely related Archegosaurus shows {{that it had a}} heat balance, gas exchange, osmoregulation, and digestion more similar to that of fish than modern aquatic amphibians; the same probably applied to Prionosuchus as well.|$|R
50|$|Foureye {{butterflyfish}} are deep-bodied and laterally compressed, with {{a single}} dorsal fin and a small mouth with tiny, bristle like <b>teeth.</b> The <b>body</b> is light grey, sometimes with a yellowish hue, and dark forward-pointing chevrons. The ventral fins are yellow. The species gets its common name from a large dark spot on the rear portion of {{each side of the}} body. This spot is surrounded by a brilliant white ring, resembling an eye. A black vertical bar on the head runs through the true eye, making it hard to see.|$|R
40|$|Tooth size varies {{exponentially}} {{with body}} weight in primates. Logarithmic transformation of tooth crown area and body weight yields a linear model of slope 0. 67 as an isometric (geometric) baseline for study of dental allometry. This model is {{compared with that}} predicted by metabolic scaling (slope = 0. 75). Tarsius and other insectivores have larger <b>teeth</b> for their <b>body</b> size than generalized primates do, {{and they are not}} included in this analysis. Among generalized primates, tooth size is highly correlated with body size. Correlations of upper and lower cheek <b>teeth</b> with <b>body</b> size range from 0. 90 – 0. 97, depending on tooth position. Central cheek teeth (P 4 4 and M 1 1) have allometric coefficients ranging from 0. 57 – 0. 65, falling well below geometric scaling. Anterior and posterior cheek teeth scale at or above metabolic scaling. Considered individually or as a group, upper cheek teeth scale allometrically with lower coefficients than corresponding lower cheek teeth; the reverse is true for incisors. The sum of crown areas for all upper cheek teeth scales significantly below geometric scaling, while the sum of crown areas for all lower cheek teeth approximates geometric scaling. Tooth size can be used to predict the body weight of generalized fossil primates. This is illustrated for Aegyptopithecus and other Eocene, Oligocene, and Miocene primates. Regressions based on tooth size in generalized primates yield reasonable estimates of body weight, but much remains to be learned about <b>tooth</b> size and <b>body</b> size scaling in more restricted systematic groups and dietary guilds...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} of permanent human canines in cervical buccolingual and mesiodistal diameters was investigated through discriminant analyses. Measurements {{were recorded in}} 254 canines from 85 individuals in four populations and sex was estimated with multifactorial morphological methods. Age was similar assessed in order to rule it out as a factor. <b>Tooth</b> and <b>body</b> size were controlled for {{in three of the}} populations (56 individuals) by the greatest buccolingual diameter of the right first molar of the corresponding jaw and the coronal diameter of the right femoral head, respectively. Age and <b>tooth</b> and <b>body</b> size were statistically insignificant factor 2 s (p > 0. 05). Inter-observer error varied from 0. 04 to 0. 17 mm or 0. 7 - 3. 0 % and was largely insignificant. Student’s t-tests found jaw was significant (p 0. 05) so measurements for both sides were averaged to increase the sample size. Sexual dimorphism was statistically insignificant for all four diameters individually or grouped with the exception of mandibular buccolingual width. Accuracy values ranged from 49 - 73 % which, adjusted for a generous error margin from sexing techniques, became 39 - 58 %. These results indicate that the landmarks, assemblages, or both do not exhibit significant sexual dimorphism. Future work should consider similar populations with different landmarks and/or the same landmarks on a different assemblage, preferably one of known sex...|$|R

50|$|Hatha yoga teaches various {{steps of}} inner body {{cleansing}} with consultations of one's yoga teacher.

40|$|A {{new species}} of Rineloricaria Bleeker from the rio Vermelho, Araguaia basin, Goiás, Brazil is described.

Although eight genera of Loricariinae are known from the rio Araguaia basin, R. lanceolata was only species of Rineloricaria previously reported from that basin. Therefore, the discovery of the R. osvaldoi increases the scenery of diversity of Loricariinae within this drainage basin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It is now {{possible}} to carry out very accurate elastic mesh analysis in order to calculate the variation in elastic mesh deflection as gears go through a meshing cycle. The software, DU-GATES, combines finite-element analysis of a gear <b>tooth</b> and <b>body</b> with an analytical elastic mesh model, enabling very fast elastic mesh analysis and effective optimization of gear macro-and microgeometry for minimum transmission error and stress. Unlike other elastic mesh models, the software has been exhaustively validated on a large-scale 8 MW gear research rig. This article outlines the capabilities of this procedure in the testing of gears by way of correlation between predicted and measured dynamic excitation, which manifests itself {{in the form of}} gear noise...|$|R
