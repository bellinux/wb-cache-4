40|$|<b>Trihalomethanes</b> are {{predominantly}} formed during disinfection of water via {{reactions of the}} oxidant with natural organic matter. Even though chlorinated and brominated <b>trihalomethanes</b> are the most widespread organic contaminants in drinking water, when iodide is present in raw water iodinated <b>trihalomethanes</b> can also be formed. The formation of iodinated <b>trihalomethanes</b> can lead to taste and odor problems and is a potential health concern since they {{have been reported to}} be more toxic than their brominated or chlorinated analogs. Currently, there is no published standard analytical method for I-THMs in water. The analysis of 10 <b>trihalomethanes</b> in water samples in a single run is challenging because the iodinated <b>trihalomethanes</b> are found at very low concentrations (ng/L range), while the regulated chlorinated and brominated <b>trihalomethanes</b> are present at much higher concentrations (above μg/L). An automated headspace solid-phase microextraction technique, with a programmed temperature vaporizer inlet coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, was developed for routine analysis of 10 <b>trihalomethanes</b> i. e. bromo-, chloro- and iodo-trihalomethanes in water samples. The carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene fiber was found to be the most suitable. The optimization, linearity range, accuracy and precision of the method are discussed. The limits of detection range from 1 ng/L to 20 ng/L for iodoform and chloroform, respectively. Matrix effects in treated groundwater, surfacewater, seawater, and secondary wastewater were investigated and it was shown that the method is suitable for the analysis of trace levels of iodinated <b>trihalomethanes</b> {{in a wide range of}} waters.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{exposure}} of four <b>trihalomethanes</b> (chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane and bromoform) in drinking water of Okinawa Island and Samoa. <b>Trihalomethanes</b> compounds were determined in the drinking water samples that were collected from the selected consumption sites and treatment plants of both Okinawa and Samoa in 2003 - 2004. The Chatan and Nishihara Water Treatment Plants (Okinawa) uses both ozonation and chlorination for primary and secondary disinfection. For Samoa Water Treatment Plants only chlorination is used as primary disinfection. Results showed that the mean concentration of <b>trihalomethanes</b> from treatment plants in Okinawa ranged from 0. 30 ± 1. 81 µg/L to 11 ± 2. 68 µg/L and from the consumption sites ranged from 2. 08 ± 0. 32 µg/L to 19. 39 ± 100 µg/L. In comparison, the mean concentration of <b>trihalomethanes</b> from the treatment plants in Samoa ranged from 226 ± 81. 2 µg/L to 267 ± 92. 3 µg/L and from the consumption sites were in the ranges 212 ± 101 µg/L to 387 ± 125 µg/L. Brominated compounds were commonly seen in all samples collected in Okinawa. Among the <b>trihalomethanes</b> compounds, chloroform was the common detected <b>trihalomethanes</b> in the samples collected from Samoa.

40|$|The {{influences}} of contact time and pH {{value on the}} formation and distribution of four species of <b>trihalomethanes</b> and five species of haloacetic acids during chlorination {{in the presence of}} bromine were investigated. Results showed that the distribution of molar fraction of <b>trihalomethanes</b> varied with contact time due to the change of bromide ion concentration during chlorination. Most of the <b>trihalomethanes</b> comprising bromine-containing species and the favored products of the haloacetic acids were chlorine-containing species after 24 h of chlorination. The extent of bromine incorporation in <b>trihalomethanes</b> and haloacetic acids both decreased with time. The contact time also had influence on the formation rate of different species of haloacetic acids. The formation and distribution of <b>trihalomethanes</b> and haloacetic acids strongly depended on the chlorination pH value. All of the <b>trihalomethanes</b> species formation increased with the increase of pH value except the bromoform that had not been detected. The molar fraction of bromodichloromethane and dibromochloromethane containing bromine increased with pH value while chloroform without bromine decreased. Under the pH range studied in this experiment, the predominant haloacetic acids species were trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid which all decreased with the increase of pH value and the level of TCAA was higher than that of DCAA...|$|R

Concentrations of the four regulated <b>trihalomethanes</b> (trichloromethane – CHCl 3, tribromomethane – CHBr 3, tribromochloroomethane and bromodichloromethane) were analysed using Agilent gas chromatograph (GC) model 19091 - 413 with Chemstation software. From the study, only tribromomethane was detected immediately after chlorination while trichloromethane and bromodichloromethane were detected at storage in the booster station. Peak values of these analytes were also obtained at the booster station. Maximum permissible levels of the analytes are set only as total mean <b>trihalomethanes.</b> In the study, total mean <b>trihalomethanes</b> (TTHMs) values ranged from zero in the raw water and water after sedimentation to 1. 3140 E- 02 ± 1. 4614 E- 05 mg/L in the booster station water samples but decreased to 1. 0601 E- 02 ± 1. 6625 mg/L at household level.

50|$|The {{quantity}} of wastewater and the unpreparedness of sewage plants to treat wastewater, {{is an issue}} in Pennsylvania. The Associated Press has reported that starting in 2011, the DEP strongly resisted providing the AP and other news organizations with information about complaints related to drilling. When waste brine is discharged to surface waters through conventional wastewater treatment plants, the bromide in the brine usually is not captured. Although not a health hazard by itself, in western Pennsylvania some downstream drinking water treatment plants using the surface water experienced increases in brominated trihalomethanes in 2009 and 2010. Trihalomethanes, undesirable byproducts of the chlorination process, form when the chlorine combines with dissolved organic matter in the source water, to form the <b>trihalomethane</b> chloroform. Bromine can substitute for some chlorine, forming brominated trihalomethanes. Because bromine has a higher atomic weight than chlorine, the partial conversion to brominated trihalomethanes increases the concentration by weight of total trihalomethanes.|$|E
