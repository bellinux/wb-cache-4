5|$|Khanh {{returned}} to the palace and reported {{the result of his}} conversation to the Ngos. He recommended that Diệm resign due {{to the demands of the}} rebel forces and protestors outside the palace. Madame Nhu railed against Diệm agreeing to a power-sharing arrangement, asserting that it was <b>the</b> <b>destiny</b> <b>of</b> Diệm and his family to save the country. Madame Nhu's aggressive stance and persistent calls for Khanh to attack, prompted the general to threaten to leave. This forced Diệm to silence his sister-in-law, and Khanh remained with the president.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich von Treitschke's History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, {{published}} in 1879, has perhaps a misleading title: it privileges {{the history of}} Prussia over the history of other German states, and it {{tells the story of}} the German-speaking peoples through the guise of Prussia's destiny to unite all German states under its leadership. The creation of this Borussian myth (Borussia is the Latin name for Prussia) established Prussia as Germany's savior; it was <b>the</b> <b>destiny</b> <b>of</b> all Germans to be united, this myth maintains, and it was Prussia's destiny to accomplish this. According to this story, Prussia played the dominant role in bringing the German states together as a nation-state; only Prussia could protect German liberties from being crushed by French or Russian influence. The story continues by drawing on Prussia's role in saving Germans from the resurgence of Napoleon's power in 1815, at Waterloo, creating some semblance of economic unity, and uniting Germans under one proud flag after 1871.|$|E

5|$|The church faced {{internal}} {{dissent in}} 1991 over {{its decision to}} publish <b>The</b> <b>Destiny</b> <b>of</b> The Mother Church. Written and privately printed in 1943 by Bliss Knapp, {{former president of the}} Mother Church, the book suggested that Eddy was the Woman of the Apocalypse of the New Testament. Knapp and his family bequeathed $98 million to the church on condition that it publish and authorize the book by 1993; otherwise the money would go to Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The church published and made the book available in Christian Science reading rooms. One senior employee was fired for failing to support the church's decision, and 18 of the 21 editorial staff of the religious journals resigned. In the end the other parties disputed that making the book available in Reading Rooms constituted authorization, and the bequest was split three ways.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Ali {{spent his}} last years in Umbai, Malacca, and {{supported}} {{himself with a}} small monthly stipend which the British East India Company had granted him. He built a palace for himself and lived with his third wife, Cik' Sembuk {{until his death in}} June 1877, and was buried in a Mausoleum {{within the confines of the}} Umbai mosque. Shortly before his death, Sultan Ali willed the Kesang territory to Tengku Mahmood, his 11-year-old son with Cik' Sembuk. His decision was met with considerable disproval among the some Malays in Singapore, who felt that Tengku Alam should be the heir to the Kesang territory as he was the oldest son with Daing Siti, who was the daughter of a Bugis nobleman, while Cik' Sembuk was a commoner. At the time of Sultan Ali's death, custody of the Kesang territory lay in the hands of Ungku Jalil, Sultan Ali's elder brother. Ungku Jalil handed over the custodianship of the Kesang territory to Maharaja Abu Bakar, after the British government held an election for the Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar and the territory's chieftains to decide on <b>the</b> <b>destiny</b> <b>of</b> the Kesang territory, and voted unanimously for Maharaja Abu Bakar as their leader. The British Governor handed over administrative charge of the Kesang territory over to the Maharaja, which upset Tengku Alam and many of his supporters. Their continued claims to the Kesang territory led to the instigation of the Jementah Civil War in 1879.|$|E
