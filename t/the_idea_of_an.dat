5|$|Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{philosophy of}} mind {{for much of}} the 20th century, especially the first half. In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism. Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific. The way out, therefore, was to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.|$|E

It was John Knowles Paine, however, who became the first American composer to be accepted in Europe.

The ensuing investigation, chaired by Admiral James L. Holloway III, the retired Chief of Naval Operations, cited lack of command and control and inter-service coordination as significant factors in the failure of the mission. Since its activation on 16 April 1987, U.S. Special Operations Command has participated in many operations, from the 1989 invasion of Panama to the ongoing Global War on Terrorism.|$|E

During the period while the Nazi Party and its symbols were banned in Austria, from 1933 to 1938, Austrian Nazis resumed the earlier pan-Germanist tradition of wearing a blue cornflower in their buttonhole.|$|E

However, Tekuder's pro-Muslim stance was not popular, and in 1284, Abaqa's Buddhist son Arghun, {{with the support of}} the Great Khan Kublai, led a revolt and had Tekuder executed.

When the French Directory abandoned <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion of England, he was again deployed on the German front, this time as part of the Army of the Danube. After the French loss at the Battle of Ostrach, his Cavalry reserve protected the French retreat from Pfullendorf. A few days later, after failing to lead a timely charge at the Battle of Stockach, he was suspended on orders of the Army commander, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, who blamed d'Hautpoul for the defeat. Acquitted by a court-martial in Strasbourg, d'Hautpoul resumed his duties at the end of July 1799, having missed the critical actions at the First Battle of Zurich.|$|E
5|$|As Isma'il al-Azhari {{began to}} assert his power, both Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani and Sayyid Abd al-Rahman became {{concerned}} that they would lose their political influence. From October 1955 Sayyid Ali began to seek ways to oust Isma'il al-Azhari from power. A key issue was whether a plebiscite should be held to determine if Sudan was to be independent of Egypt, which Sayyid Ali supported and Isma'il al-Azhari opposed. To strengthen his position in parliament, Isma'il al-Azhari started making overtures to associates of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman to explore <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> NUP-Umma coalition. Sudan formally became independent on 1 January 1956. On 2 February 1956 Isma'il al-Azhari announced a new cabinet that included representatives of all political parties and factions.|$|E

Soon after, on 7 January 1977, Van der Byl announced the Rhodesian government's rejection of every proposal made in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Béla H.

With the active interest {{and support of the}} Monterey Bay Area Council executive staff and board, Bela continually improved his experimental program. In 1963 Maury Tripp and Fran Peterson were working closely with Bela. They also served on the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America and brought the White Stag program to their attention. In November 1963, Dr. John W. Larson, a staff researcher for the National Council, observed the program's annual Indaba at the Presidio of Monterey. Impressed with what he witnessed, he recommended that the national office conduct a detailed analysis of the White Stag program.|$|E

In Berlin he also met and befriended many other artists, most notably Kurt Schwitters, László Moholy-Nagy, and Theo van Doesburg. Together with Schwitters and van Doesburg, Lissitzky presented <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> international artistic movement under the guidelines of constructivism while also working with Kurt Schwitters on the issue Nasci (Nature) of the periodical Merz, and continuing to illustrate children's books. The year after the publication of his first Proun series in Moscow in 1921, Schwitters introduced Lissitzky to the Hanover gallery kestnergesellschaft, where he held his first solo exhibition. The second Proun series, printed in Hanover in 1923, was a success, utilizing new printing techniques. Later on, he met Sophie Kuppers, who was the widow of Paul Kuppers, an art director of the kestnergesellschaft at which Lissitzky was showing, and whom he would marry in 1927.|$|E

It {{is intended to}} show that Moll's life reveal <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman and to prove that <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman that Moll wants to reach ironically reflects <b>the</b> different <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman, since a gentlewoman may mean either an aristocratic woman or a prostitute woman. In relevant to this, the thesis writer pictures how Moll tries hard to achieve her own concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman, that is having high class woman and having a luxurious life. She uses any ways such as persuading or tempting man, and stealing. Ironically, in her attitude and thinking, Moll does not portray {{the quality of the}} denotative meaning of the word gentlewoman that is an aristocratic woman. On the other hand, she portrays the quality of the connotative meaning of the word gentlewoman, that is prostitute, because instead of having the quality <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aristocratic woman, she becomes a prostitute. Through the three different meanings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman, this thesis proves that although Moll achieves her concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentlewoman, that is becoming a high class woman and having a luxurious life, she still can be said that she does not achieve the denotative meaning of the word gentlewoman.
