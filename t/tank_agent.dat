40|$|Svenska kraftnät is the Swedish {{transmission}} system operator, {{responsible for the}} national electrical grid with power lines of 220 kV and 400 kV, and the electrical substations of the grid. In this master thesis an old substation located in a sensitive environmental area is inspected and its environmental risks defined and assessed. From this “worst case scenario” measures are recommended, that should be applicable on other existing substations, and for new constructed substations. This thesis {{is limited to a}} more detailed analysis on how oil spill can be handled. The insulating oil is used in different machines and equipment on the substation to avoid electrical charges. The inspected substation has a special feature; a pipe system that connects wells on the substation area, water pipes from the substation house, and transformer pits to an oil-water separation house. The oil pits are made of concrete and placed under machines with large amounts of oil to capture the oil in case of a breakdown or leakage. In the oil-water separation house oil is separated from water and the clean water is sent to a lake in the vicinity. The most severe environmental risks found are the filter in the oil-water separation house and the risk of oil leakage from the open water-cooling system of the synchronous generator. In addition, {{there is no way to}} catch oil spill from current and voltage transformers and it is not known if the pipe system that transports water and oil spills is completely sealed. Finally, there is no permanent installation to catch spills from tank filling areas and Svenska kraftnät does rarely follow up the environmental work of the entrepreneurs. Svenska kraftnät is recommended to use the products and services from the companies Qlean Scandinavia AB and TTL Miljöteknik AB to attend to the noted environmental risks. Qlean Scandinavia AB offers an environmental friendly cleaning procedure with ultraclean water and sealing of concrete, which can be used for the transformer pits and oil-water separation house. They also sell profile planks as a fire-extinguishing layer for transformer pits. These are considered better and safer than the conventional stones used. The price is almost the same, however the maintenance costs are lower for the profile planks, since they are easier to clean and do not require heavy transports to landfill. They also require less space than the stones, therefore a smaller transformer pit can be built, and cost savings can be made on concrete. TTL Miljöteknik AB has products based on environmental friendly oil solidifying polymers placed in different textiles and filters. They let water and other substances pass, but react with hydrocarbons, like oil, forming a tight rubberlike mass. These installations are new to Europe, but more than 12 000 installations have been made, mainly in the United States and Australia. For the inspected substation in this thesis it is recommended to manage oil spill at each machine and to clean the pipe system. An HFF-filter should be installed in cleaned and sealed transformer pits. The filter lets water from precipitation pass, but binds oil, thanks to the solidifying polymers. The clean water is further transported through the pipe system to the oil-water separation house and from there water is pumped to the lake. Wells must be sealed and the pipes from the substation house led to a septic <b>tank.</b> <b>Agent</b> X, a type of filter mat, should be placed on the substation area to catch oil spills from current and voltage transformers, since previous breakdowns show that oil can be spread over a large area. For plants without a pipe system the water will be released outside the transformer pits. For new constructions it is suggested that transformer pits are built with a polyvinyl mat in the bottom and a filter on the sides, which will capture the oil. A concrete fundament still needs to be built to support the machine; therefore the price will almost be the same as for the conventional transformer pit in concrete, although less concrete is needed. However, with this technique the transformer pit will not require any maintenance...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe main {{theories}} {{explaining the}} biological diversity of rain forests often confer a limited {{understanding of the}} contribution of interspecific interactions to the observed patterns. We show how two-species mutualisms can affect much larger segments of the invertebrate community in tropical rain forests. Aechmea mertensii (Bromeliaceae) is both a phytotelm (plant-held water) and an ant-garden epiphyte. We studied the influence of its associated ant species (Pachycondyla goeldii and Camponotus femoratus) on the physical characteristics of the plants, and, subsequently, on {{the diversity of the}} invertebrate communities that inhabit their <b>tanks.</b> As dispersal <b>agents</b> for the bromeliads, P. goeldii and C. femoratus influence the shape and size of the bromeliad by determining the location of the seedling, from exposed to partially shaded areas. By coexisting on a local scale, the two ant species generate a gradient of habitat conditions in terms of available resources (space and food) for aquatic invertebrates, the diversity of the invertebrate communities increasing with greater volumes of water and fine detritus. Two-species mutualisms are widespread in nature, but their influence on the diversity of entire communities remains largely unexplored. Because macroinvertebrates constitute an important part of animal production in all ecosystem types, further investigations should address the functional implications of such indirect effects...|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} portion of the stockpile of mustard agent in the United States was stored at the Edgewood Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Approximately 1,621 tons of mustard agent were stored in one-ton containers on the base under heavy guard. A chemical neutralization plant was built on the proving ground and neutralized the last of this stockpile in February 2005. This stockpile had priority because of the potential for quick reduction of risk to the community. The nearest schools were fitted with overpressurization machinery to protect the students and faculty {{in the event of a}} catastrophic explosion and fire at the site. These projects, as well as planning, equipment, and training assistance, were provided to the surrounding community as a part of the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program (CSEPP), a joint program of the Army and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Unexploded shells containing mustard agent and other chemical agents are still present in several test ranges in proximity to schools in the Edgewood area, but the smaller amounts of poison gas (four to 14 pounds) present considerably lower risks. These remnants are being detected and excavated systematically for disposal. The U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency oversaw disposal of several other chemical weapons stockpiles located across the United States in compliance with international chemical weapons treaties. These include the complete incineration of the chemical weapons stockpiled in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, and Oregon. Earlier, this agency had also completed destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile located on Johnston Atoll located south of Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. The largest mustard agent stockpile, of about 6,196 tons, was stored at the Deseret Chemical Depot in northern Utah. The incineration of this stockpile began in 2006. In May 2011, the last one-ton <b>tank</b> of mustard <b>agent</b> was incinerated at the Deseret Chemical Depot, and the last mustard agent artillery shells at Deseret were incinerated in January 2012.|$|R
40|$|Kontejnerska vozila predstavljaju novitet među vatrogasnim vozilima. Osnovna karakteristika ovih vozila je u tome da se vatrogasni kontejner postavlja na specijalno podvozje pomoću trajno ugrađenog hidrauličnog krana. Tako se vatrogascima omogućuje efikasna zašita ili gašenje požara sa samo jednim podvozjem i s nekoliko specijalnih kontejnera u vatrogasnoj postrojbi. Broj i vrsta kontejnera koji se mogu «navlačiti « na isto podvozje ograničeni su samo nosivošću podvozja i «navlakača», a određuju ih iskustvo stručnjaka postrojbe (sukladno procjeni ugroženosti od požara područja koje štiti postrojba) i vatrogasna znanja proizvođača. Kontejneri s opremom ili sredstvom za gašenje mogu biti trajno smješteni u postrojbi ili na mjestima očekivane vatrogasne intervencije. Također se mogu neposredno prije očekivane katastrofe premjestiti na poziciju koja vatrogascima najviše odgovara. Ovaj članak upravo predstavlja jednu takvu nadogradnju hrvatskog proizvođača vatrogasnih vozila ZIEGLER d. o. o. Hrvatska. Recently, roll on/off {{container}} vehicles {{have been}} increasingly included in firefighting vehicle manufacturing program given that they imply a new {{aspect of the}} vehicle design and construction. The basic feature of the roll on/off firefighting container vehicles distinguishing them from the standard firefighting vehicles is their mobile superstructure, which, according to its design and construction, is in short called ‘a container’. Therefore, the firefighting vehicle of this type basically includes a standard constructed truck chassis adequate capacity with loader crane for containers and a firefighter container. In relation to buyer’s demands, the container may incorporate different firefighting technical details, devices and equipment, thus determining each container’s technical and functional characteristics. Hence, depending on the equipment, roll on/off container vehicles {{may be used for}} both technical and firefighting interventions. Furthermore, the advantage of the roll on/off container vehicles over the standard firefighting vehicles is the chassis which can support a container of any type and purpose, so any firefighting intervention can be performed with only one chassis and several different containers. Roll on/off container vehicles are controlled by the German standard DIN 14505 : 2004 Fire fighting and rescue service vehicles - Vehicles for roller containers - General requirements. DIN 14530 - 21 : 2011 Firefighting vehicles - Part 21 : Pump water tanker TLF 4000 standard applies as well for the construction and design of roll on/off container vehicles. This container superstructure described herein is equipped with fire techniques and equipment with the sole purpose of fire extinguishing in refining plants. In addition this container with integrated water/foam monitor the kit included containers superstructure with foam pump and foam tank volume 15. 000 l. Bearing in mind special technical characteristics, the container of this vehicle includes fire techniques and equipment of higher technical quality than in most standard firefighting vehicles. Thus, there is strong Caterpillar diesel drive motor, designed for eternally operation, integrated in a separate, sound-insulated space of the container’s superstructure. This motor drives the KSB centrifugal pump flow 22. 500 l/min as well as the Edwards gear pump for foam agent. Foam agent dosage rate is proportional within the fixed water flow rate. Pipeline system is similar in design to the most firefighting vehicles and is equipped with ‘storz’ coupling adapters with female thread at the user endings. The coupling adapters are closed with sealed cap. Water/foam monitor of a special manufacturer Williams Ambasador is of high range and stream water and foam capacity. The article presents the construction and design of roll on/off container vehicles for water and foam fire extinguishing in refining plants, which is designed by manufacturer ZIEGLER d. o. o. Croatia, Zagreb in cooperation with company TOTAL. At the moment of the release of this article, the container with monitor and other containers with foam <b>agent</b> <b>tank</b> are in finally phase of construction and are in start production. The vehicles are being constructed for TOTAL company from Netherlands, and will be delivered under the name as Roll on/off extinguishing container with monitor (SBH Unit) and Roll on/off foam container (SVH Unit). The entire design and construction of the vehicle with all technical characteristics are owned by ZIEGLER d. o. o. The author of the article presented the above mentioned firefighting vehicle {{for the sole purpose of}} introducing the operational technical characteristics and application of the roll on/off container vehicles in firefighting. Ziegler d. o. o. and the author of this article agree to publish the full contents of the article. However, without written consent of Ziegler d. o. o., other persons and corporations are not allowed to copy the text or any part of the text or to publicly display any part of it...|$|R
