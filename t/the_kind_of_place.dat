All contributions made went towards the organization's mortgage payment fund that was matched by a committee, led by Eisenberg. [...] "It's an incredible collective," [...] Eisenberg told a reporter. [...] "It's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where the residents {{go through their}} wonderful program and end up working there. It's saved so many lives." ...|$|E
500|$|... "JJ" [...] {{was filmed}} in November 2008 {{in the same}} {{production}} block as the series' eighth episode, [...] "Effy". Ollie Barbieri did some research to help him in playing JJ, who has Asperger syndrome. He said that, in initial episodes, he played JJ as [...] "quite mad and I jumped around a lot", though by this episode his portrayal was [...] "watered down a bit". Charles Martin shot an unscripted scene that involved Barbieri destroying the set of JJ's bedroom; Martin believed this would help Barbieri to get into JJ's mindset. Barbieri was also able {{to learn more about}} his character by creating the collage in JJ's room himself, in which JJ has tried to organise his thoughts about his friends and his life. Martin said that he and Barbieri had a [...] "very involved director-actor relationship" [...] and that he enjoyed [...] "JJ" [...] the most out of all the episodes he directed in the series. According to runner Laurence Wigfield, JJ's clinic was described in the script as [...] "a desolate shabby place, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> you went to die", with the bracketed suggestion of Fishponds Studio, where the Skins offices are. Though Wigfield initially [...] "couldn't believe" [...] this, the studio was used for filming the scene, which Wigfield admitted [...] "worked quite well". The scene in which JJ and Emily bond after meeting at the clinic was filmed in Bristol's Brandon Hill Park, near Cabot Tower.|$|E

According to Shorter (as {{quoted in}} Don Heckman's liner notes), {{in writing the}} material for this album he was [...] "thinking of misty landscapes with wild flowers and strange, dimly-seen shapes — <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where folklore and legends are born. And then I was thinking of things like witch burnings too." [...] Fairy tales were also an inspiration: the bluesy [...] "Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum" [...] is titled after the trademark exclamation of the giant in Jack and the Beanstalk.|$|E

2500|$|A {{worker at}} DC Central Kitchen saw Tracht's apology on TV and heard {{his desire to}} show he was sorry. She thought that the [...] "Kitchen" [...] {{would be a good}} place for him to prove himself, and shared the idea with a co-worker who knew Rock Newman; he made a phone call. Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and {{cleaning}} bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: [...] "It's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I went in there like an idiot, and now I know how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eggleston {{was sent}} to the Webb School, a {{boarding}} establishment. Eggleston later recalled few fond memories of the school, telling a reporter, [...] "It had a kind of Spartan routine to 'build character'. I never knew what that was supposed to mean. It was so callous and dumb. It was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where it was considered effeminate to like music and painting." [...] Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. [...] "I never had the feeling that I didn't fit in," [...] he told a reporter, [...] "But probably I didn't." ...|$|E

This paper uses 3 design implementations to argue that architects and designers must reconstruct these ideas of placemaking in the evolving social, cultural, economic and technological context of our time. The projects are used as critical enquiries to explore how designers can integrate current social-economic and cultural thinking from design, business, and computing and show how evolving interactive connected technologies can lead to new ways of constructing located and connected place...|$|R

So he always sneaked back again later {{in the night and}} put the {{revolver}} in its place, deciding to drown himself instead. Yet every time that he walked down to the Trestle Bridge over the Ossawippi he found it was quite unsuitable for drowning--too high, and the water too swift and black, and the rushes too gruesome--in fact, not at all <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> for a drowning.|$|E

In spite of her {{lameness}} Miss Foster was attractive, which, perhaps, had its effect, though he was mainly actuated by compassion and the monotony of his track-laying task. He did not think the settlement, in which there were very few women, was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> in which she could comfortably remain, particularly if her means were exhausted. Presently he met the livery-stable keeper driving in his buggy and motioned to him to pull up.|$|E

40|$|Architecture is {{primarily}} the basic expression of humanity. Architecture creates places; because places {{have a great}} emotional bond with people.

60|$|By {{this time}} {{we had come to}} the house, where I found his room to be one just within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the courtyard.

Certain keys were hanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his patchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess.

60|$|About midday I came to where, in {{a secluded}} valley, there stood a single small cottage without any other {{building}} in sight. It was a neat little house, with a rustic porch {{and a small}} garden in front of it, with a swarm of cocks and hens. I lay down among the ferns and watched it, for {{it seemed to be}} exactly <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where I might obtain what I wanted. My bread was finished, and I was exceedingly hungry after my long journey; I determined, therefore, to make a short reconnaissance, and then to march up to this cottage, summon it to surrender, and help myself to all that I needed. It could at least provide me with a chicken and with an omelette. My mouth watered at the thought.|$|E
40|$|Taking the {{position}} that “critical pedagogy ” and “place-based edu-cation ” are mutually supportive educational traditions, this author argues for a conscious synthesis that blends the two discourses into a critical pedagogy <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> An analysis <b>of</b> critical pedagogy is pre-sented that emphasizes the spatial aspects of social experience. This examination also asserts the general absence of ecological thinking demonstrated in critical social analysis concerned exclusively with human relationships. Next, a discussion of ecological place-based ed-ucation is offered. Finally, a critical pedagogy <b>of</b> <b>place</b> is defined. This pedagogy seeks the twin objectives of decolonization and “reinhab-itation ” through synthesizing critical and place-based approaches. A critical pedagogy <b>of</b> <b>place</b> challenges all educators {{to reflect on the}} relationship between <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> education they pursue and <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> we inhabit and leave behind for future generations. “Place + people = politics. ”—Williams (2001, p. 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{prospect}} of obtaining domestically-produced biodiesel from algae has attracted wide investor interest. Although many analysts predict that economic production is {{five to ten}} years away, the production process involves such a wide range of environmental and land use issues that it is not premature to begin thinking about <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> in which “green biodiesel” could be efficiently made in the United States. Our land use and environmental laws were all drafted by people who never imagined the possibility that huge volumes of algae would be an important energy resource; nor could they have known that the location of algae farms would be dependent {{on a wide range of}} factors including terrain, climate and neighboring uses. This essay is a very preliminary examination of the potential legal issues posed by this potentially valuable resource...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{understand}} how the creation of tourist identity and local identity is impacted by the tourist experience and the conscious manipulation of the physical environment for the sake of tourism. The role of tourism in shaping how visitors and local community members create or affirm a sense of self or regional identity is investigated. The history and appeal of the Lake of the Ozarks in central Missouri is examined, which illuminates <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> and experiences tourists seek out as part of a process of conscious identity affirmation. Finally, this thesis concerns the perception of and attitude toward the natural environment and how it plays a role not only for recreational purposes, but the development of regional and personal relationships to nature, which in turn {{play a significant role in}} the identity formation and affirmation processes...|$|R
60|$|The {{house in}} which we lived was just <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> to foster such propensities. It was a venerable mansion, half villa, half farmhouse. The oldest part was of stone, with loop-holes for musketry, having served as a family {{fortress}} {{in the time of}} the Indians. To this there had been made various additions, some of brick, some of wood, according to the exigencies of the moment; so that it was full of nooks and crooks, and chambers of all sorts and sizes. It was buried among willows, elms, and cherry trees, and surrounded with roses and hollyhocks, with honeysuckle and sweetbrier clambering about every window. A brood of hereditary pigeons sunned themselves upon the roof; hereditary swallows and martins built about the eaves and chimneys; and hereditary bees hummed about the flower-beds.|$|E

60|$|Their {{manner of}} {{speaking}} also reminded Belding of Dick. They talked of the ride from Ash Fork down to the border, of the ugly and torn-up Casita, of the heat and dust and cactus along the trail. Presently Nell came in, now cool and sweet in white, with a red rose at her breast. Belding {{had never been so}} proud of her. He saw that she meant to appear well in the eyes of Dick's people, and began to have a faint perception of what the ordeal was for her. Belding imagined the sooner the Gales were told that Dick was to marry Nell the better for all concerned, and especially for Nell. In the general conversation that ensued he sought for an opening in which to tell this important news, but he was kept so busy answering questions about his position on the border, <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> Forlorn River was, the reason for so many tents, etc., that he was unable to find opportunity.|$|E

6000|$|One Sunday morning, in {{the late}} summer, during one of my visits to him, I was out walking {{in the woods and}} found a man of the village, a farm labourer, with his small boy hunting for hedgehogs. He had caught and killed two, which the boy was carrying. He told me he was very fond of the flesh of hedgehogs--"pigs," [...] he called them for short; he said he would not {{exchange}} one for a rabbit. He always spent his holidays pig-hunting; he had no dog and didn't want one; he found them himself, and his method was to look for <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> in which they were accustomed to live--a thick mass of bramble growing at the side of an old ditch as a rule.

Lisle, however, picked up the trail, and they followed it as rapidly as possible until, when Nasmyth was lagging some distance behind, there was a shout {{in front of him and}} his companion's rifle flashed. Making a last effort, he broke into a run and presently came to the brink of a steep descent covered with thick brush and scattered trees, with a wide reach of palely gleaming water at the foot of it. It was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> one would have preferred to climb down cautiously, but there was a sharp snapping and crackling below and Nasmyth knew that a hard-pressed deer will frequently take to the water.
