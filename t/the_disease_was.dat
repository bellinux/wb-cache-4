5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is achieved with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and blood tests. Treatment is by the timely correction of hormone deficiencies, {{and in many cases}} surgical decompression is required. Many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop pituitary hormone deficiencies and require long-term hormone supplementation. The first case of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> recorded in 1898.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> {{named after}} the Brazilian {{physician}} and epidemiologist Carlos Chagas, who first described it in 1909. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> not seen as a major public health problem in humans until the 1960s (the outbreak of Chagas disease in Brazil in the 1920s went widely ignored). Dr Chagas discovered that the intestines of Triatomidae (now Reduviidae: Triatominae) harbored a flagellate protozoan, a new species of the Trypanosoma genus, {{and was able to}} demonstrate experimentally that it could be transmitted to marmoset monkeys that were bitten by the infected bug. Later studies showed squirrel monkeys were also vulnerable to infection.|$|E
30|$|We {{calculated}} sensitivity, specificity, positive {{predictive value}} (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of p 300 where sensitivity is {{the probability that a}} test result will <b>be</b> positive when <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> present, specificity is the probability that a test result will <b>be</b> negative when <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> not present, and {{positive predictive value}} is the probability that <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> present when <b>the</b> test is positive. Negative predictive value will <b>be</b> negative when <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> not present. Positive predictive value is the probability that <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> not present when the test is negative. Accuracy is the overall probability that a patient will be correctly classified.|$|R

50|$|The {{extent of}} <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> still unknown {{as the two}} women are only 21. However, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> has had no {{apparent}} effect on their brains or personalities. Doctors {{do not know if}} <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> fatal and, if so, what the life expectancy of one with this <b>disease</b> <b>is.</b> If <b>the</b> cause of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> genetic, there is a chance that the twins could pass it on to their future children.|$|R
5|$|While in Egypt, Fairley {{investigated}} schistosomiasis (then {{known as}} bilharzia). <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> {{known to be}} caused by contact with fresh water inhabited by certain species of snails, and orders had been issued that prohibited bathing in fresh water, but the troops were slow to appreciate the danger involved. In its toxic phase, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> easily confused with typhus, so Fairley developed a complement fixation test for the disease {{along the lines of the}} Wassermann test. He studied its pathology, confirming that the worms in the circulatory system could be cured by intravenous tartaric acid. Fairley also studied, and later published papers on typhus, malaria, and bacillary dysentery.|$|E
5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
5|$|Doctors {{were the}} first to deal with the toll that AIDS would take in the United States. Some—like Marcus Conant, James Curran, Arye Rubenstein, Michael S. Gottlieb, and Mathilde Krim—would also realize their {{professional}} life's courses in dealing with patient after patient who showed up in their offices with baffling illnesses, most notably lymphadenopathy, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's Sarcoma, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidia, and other opportunistic infections that caused death by a grisly combination of ailments overtaxing a compromised immune system. With no information on how <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.|$|E
50|$|It is {{recommended}} {{as part of}} routine immunizations in countries where <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> a problem. One or two doses are given depending on the version of the vaccine. Extra doses are not typically needed in areas where <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> common. In those with HIV/AIDS or those who are pregnant an inactivated vaccine should be used. Immunization of travellers who plan to spend time outdoors in areas where <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> common {{is recommended}}.|$|R
30|$|Usually, in <b>the</b> {{study of}} <b>disease</b> spreading, <b>the</b> {{population}} <b>is</b> classified into {{three types of}} individuals: susceptible individuals (S), infective individuals (I), and recovered individuals (R). The basic epidemic models are as follows: SI models (<b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> difficult to cure); SIS models (<b>the</b> <b>disease</b> can <b>be</b> cured); SIR models (<b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> cured with lifelong immunity), and SIRS models (<b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> cured with temporary immunity). However, lots of diseases have temporary immunity, such as influenza, pertussis, gonorrhoea, and so on. Therefore, the SIRS epidemic models are important and significant for detecting the pathogenesis, spreading, and controlling of the epidemics.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{known for}} its subtle onset in patients, and few {{symptoms}} characterize vertebral osteomyelitis. Correct diagnosis of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> often delayed {{for an average of}} six to twelve weeks due to such vague, ambiguous symptoms.|$|R
5|$|Neuroblastoma is {{the most}} common cancer in babies and the third most common cancer in {{children}} after leukemia and brain cancer. About 1 in every 7,000 children is affected at some point in time. About 90% of cases occur in children less than 5 years old and it is rare in adults. Of cancer deaths in children about 15% are due to neuroblastoma. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> first described in the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|Polio was {{eliminated}} in the Americas by 1994. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> officially eliminated in 36 Western Pacific countries, including China and Australia in 2000. Europe was declared polio-free in 2002. Since January 2011, {{there were no}} reported cases of the disease in India, and hence in February 2012, the country {{was taken off the}} WHO list of polio endemic countries. In March 2014, India was declared a polio-free country.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789 and {{the virus that causes}} it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner. Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States. In the 20th century it {{became one of the most}} worrying childhood diseases in these areas. The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk. It is hoped that vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{similar in}} {{presentation}} to {{other forms of}} typhus, its pathogen is no longer included in genus Rickettsia with the typhus bacteria proper, but in Orientia. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> thus frequently classified separately from the other typhi.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Disease</b> as {{symptoms}}: <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{defined by}} <b>the</b> symptoms and signs that it produces. In fact, it can <b>be</b> said that <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> collection of them. It is the classical way {{to define a}} disease or a condition.|$|R
30|$|Diagnosis of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{costly and}} difficult. Moreover, even if <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{diagnosed}} correctly, monitoring {{the progression of}} <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> by a clinician over time further increases the cost. Thus, patients cannot visit clinicians frequently and what happens between the visits is largely unknown to clinicians.|$|R
5|$|Populations of C.australis were {{decimated}} in {{some parts}} of New Zealand because of Sudden Decline. In some areas, particularly in the north, no big trees are left. Although Sudden Decline often affects cabbage trees in farmland and open areas, trees in natural forest patches continue to do well. Trees in the southern North Island and northern South Island are generally unaffected with few dead branches and no symptoms of Sudden Decline. By 2010, there was evidence to suggest the severity of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> lessening.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{preventable}} with the polio vaccine; however, {{a number of}} doses are required {{for it to be}} effective. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and those who live in countries where the disease is occurring. Once infected there is no specific treatment. In 2016, polio affected 42 people, while there were about 350,000 cases in 1988. In 2014 <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus but it reoccurred in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The marked {{spread of}} dengue {{during and after}} the Second World War has been {{attributed}} to ecologic disruption. The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. This severe form of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> first reported in the Philippines in 1953; by the 1970s, it had become a major cause of child mortality and had emerged in the Pacific and the Americas. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first noted in Central and South America in 1981, as DENV-2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with DENV-1 several years earlier.|$|E

5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{thought in}} Victorian healthcare concerning {{the transmission of}} contagious diseases was the miasma theory, which held that most communicable diseases were caused by the inhalation of contaminated air. This contamination could {{take the form of}} the odour of rotting corpses or sewage, but also rotting vegetation, or the exhaled breath of someone already diseased. Miasma was believed by most to be the vector of transmission of cholera, which was on the rise in 19th-century Europe. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> deeply feared by all, because of the speed with which it could spread, and its high fatality rates.|$|E
5|$|The term malaria {{originates}} from Medieval —"bad air"; <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> formerly called ague or marsh fever due to {{its association}} with swamps and marshland. The term {{first appeared in the}} English literature about 1829. Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America, where it is no longer endemic, though imported cases do occur.|$|E
5|$|Though {{initially}} {{given only}} {{three to five}} years to live, by virtue of several new drug therapies and a bone marrow transplant in 2005, she would beat the disease's Stage1 survival mean of 62months by over a factor of two. Her advocacy helped make the new treatments approved and available for others as well. For much of the last decade of her life, Ferraro was not in remission, but <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> managed by continually adjusting her treatments.|$|E

30|$|Histologically <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> characterised by {{scattered}} fibroblastic foci with heterogeneous distribution that alternate interstitial {{inflammation and}} honeycombing. These findings coexist with normal lung areas. The prognosis of UIP is variable. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> influenced by <b>the</b> extent of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> and <b>the</b> severity of functional impairment {{at the time}} of diagnosis [11].|$|R
40|$|Human {{cases of}} gastric {{anisakiasis}} {{caused by the}} zoonotic parasite Anisakis pegreffii are increasing in Italy. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> caused by ingestion of larval nematodes in lightly cooked or raw seafood. Because symptoms are vague and serodiagnosis <b>is</b> difficult, <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> often misdiagnosed and cases are understimated...|$|R
5|$|Fleas {{arose in}} the early Cretaceous, most likely as ectoparasites of mammals, {{before moving on to}} other groups {{including}} birds. Each species of flea is more or less a specialist on its host animal species: many species never breed on any other host, though some are less selective. Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group: for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found only on armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae only on bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae only on elephant shrews. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium which causes bubonic plague. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> spread by rodents such as the black rat, which were bitten by fleas that then infected humans. Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world's population.|$|E
5|$|For some years, {{the cause}} of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> unknown, and {{hypotheses}} included tree ageing, fungi, viruses, and environmental factors such as an increase in ultra-violet light. Another hypothesis was that a genetic problem may have been induced in Northland and Auckland by the thousands of cabbage trees brought into the area from elsewhere and planted in gardens and parks. The Lands and Survey Department had a native plant nursery at Taupo in the central North Island, which was used to grow plants for use in parks, reserves and carparks. In many Northland parks, cabbage trees from the central North Island were growing and flowering within metres of natural forms. Any offspring produced might have been poorly adapted to local conditions. After nearly five years of work, scientists found the cause was a bacterium Phytoplasma australiense, which may be spread {{from tree to tree}} by a tiny sap-sucking insect, the introduced passion vine hopper.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Fairley {{received}} an appointment in London as Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Although he and Kellaway convinced the governors to delay Fairley's commencement until their major venom work was completed, he departed for London {{by the end}} of that year. He also opened a consulting practice in Harley Street. In London he encountered patients with filariasis and devised a test to diagnose the disease at an early stage; but when he went to write up his results he discovered that details of a similar test had already been published. In 1934, a sewer worker was referred to his ward with acute jaundice which Fairley diagnosed as caused by filariasis. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> revealed to be an occupational hazard of sewer workers, and steps were taken to protect the workers. Perhaps his most important work in this period was research into blackwater fever. Since malaria cases were uncommon in the United Kingdom, he made annual visits to the Malaria Research Laboratory of the League of Nations at the Refugee Hospital in Salonika. In the process, he described methaemalbumin, a previously unknown blood pigment. For his scientific accomplishments in London, Fairley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> now readily treatable with multi-drug therapy, which {{combines}} three drugs {{to kill the}} pathogen and cure the victim. [...] Disability and disfigurement can <b>be</b> avoided if <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> treated early. Unfortunately, individuals with leprosy are still shunned, isolated, and stigmatised, leading to the fear of leprosy being worse than <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> itself.|$|R
40|$|The {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome <b>is</b> a new <b>disease</b> whose cause <b>is</b> unknown but {{is almost}} surely due to a transmissible agent, most likely a virus. <b>The</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> clearly spread by sexual contact, particularly homosexual activity. Blood-borne transmission constitutes the other major recognized form of spread of <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> although it <b>is</b> highly likely that <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> not readily spread through casual, nonsexual, non-blood-borne routes. Although <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> still highly concentrated in the United States, it is now seen in several countries throughout the world. The common denominator of <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> a profound suppression of cell-mediated immunity, specifically a quantitative and qualitative defect in the T 4 inducer or helper subset of T lymphocytes. Hyperactivity of B lymphocytes is also characteristic. The clinical manifestations are those of severe and life-threatening opportunistic infections and unusual neoplasms, particularly Kaposi's sarcoma. The mortality may well approach 100 %, making {{this one of the}} most extraordinary transmissible diseases in history...|$|R
