5|$|On Boxing Day 1935, Tranmere faced Oldham Athletic at Prenton Park in the Third Division North. Oldham {{had beaten}} Tranmere 4–1 the {{previous}} day, but Tranmere won 13–4 in the return fixture, including nine goals by Bunny Bell. At the time Bell's feat was an individual record, but it stood for only {{four months before}} Joe Payne netted ten for Luton Town, on his debut against Bristol Rovers. However, <b>the</b> <b>aggregate</b> <b>of</b> 17 goals in one game remains a league record.|$|E

25|$|Whatever the {{political}} {{differences among the}} justices, the clash over {{the constitutionality of the}} New Deal initiatives was tied to clearly divergent legal philosophies which were gradually coming into competition with each other: legal formalism and legal realism. During the period c.1900 – c.1920, the formalist and realist camps clashed over the nature and legitimacy of judicial authority in common law, given the lack of a central, governing authority in those legal fields other than the precedent established by case law—i.e. <b>the</b> <b>aggregate</b> <b>of</b> earlier judicial decisions.|$|E
25|$|It is usual to {{say that}} Mill is {{committing}} a number of fallacies. He is accused of committing the naturalistic fallacy, because {{he is trying to}} deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do; the fallacy of equivocation, because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that it ought to be desired; and the fallacy of composition, because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that <b>the</b> <b>aggregate</b> <b>of</b> all persons will desire the general happiness.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{how long}} it takes the fielding team to recover the ball, the batsmen may run more than once. Each {{completed}} run increments the scores of both the team and the striker. The team's total score in the innings is <b>the</b> <b>aggregate</b> <b>of</b> all its batsmen's individual scores plus any extras. To complete a run, both batsmen must ground their bats behind the popping crease {{at the other end of}} the pitch. Attempting a run carries a risk factor because either batsman can be run out, and thereby dismissed, if the fielding side can break the wicket with the ball before the batsman has completed the run.|$|E

Bloomberg News reported that this event would likely be the first legal test of this law, according to a former House rail committee staffer who helped write the law, who predicted that given the number of casualties, the cap is almost certainly going to be an issue in pending litigation. An attorney representing two of the victims agreed, saying payouts could range from $5 million to $10 million per death or serious injury. Metrolink reportedly has insurance coverage totaling $150 million.|$|E
