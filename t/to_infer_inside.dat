40|$|In network tomography, we seek <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> link {{parameters}} <b>inside</b> {{a network}} (such as link delays) by sending end-to-end probes between (external) boundary nodes. The main challenge {{here is to}} estimate link-level attributes from end-to-end measurements. In this paper, {{based on the idea}} of combinatorial compressed sensing, we specify conditions on network routing matrix under which it is possible to estimate link delays from measurements of end-to-end delay. Moreover, we provide an upper-bound on the estimation error...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of the gene coding for trehalose- 6 -phosphate synthase (tps) was determined {{for the first time}} in Tardigrada in twelve species belonging to both Heterotardigrada and Eutardigrada. The tps gene was found in all semiterrestrial and anhydrobiotic species examined, correlating trehalose presence with anhydrobiotic ability. In contrast, tps was not detected in two limnic and desiccation intolerant species. The surprising {{presence of}} tps in another limnic and desiccation intolerant species, Dactylobiotus parthenogeneticus, allowed us <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> that in tardigrades trehalose could be produced and involved, not just in anhydrobiosis, but also in the regulation of other biological functions, such as encystment. Our findings, integrated with literature data, indicate that anhydrobiotic ability in tardigrades can depend on the combined action of numerous different molecules, only partially identified. With nucleotide tps sequences, it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> phylogenetic relationships <b>inside</b> the phylum Tardigrada, while amino acid sequences further support the relationship between Tardigrada and Pancrustacea...|$|R
40|$|Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) {{is based}} on {{alignment}} models which learn from bilingual corpora the word corre-spondences between source and target lan-guage. These models {{are assumed to be}} capable of learning reorderings. However, the difference in word order between two languages {{is one of the most}} important sources of errors in SMT. In this paper, we show that SMT can take advantatge of in-ductive learning in order to solve reorder-ing problems. Given a word alignment, we identify those pairs of consecutive source blocks (se-quences of words) whose translation is swapped, i. e. those blocks which, if swapped, generate a correct monotone translation. Afterwards, we classify these pairs into groups, following recursively a co-occurrence block criterion, in order <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> reorderings. <b>Inside</b> the same group, we allow new internal combination in or-der to generalize the reorder to unseen pairs of blocks. Then, we identify the pairs of blocks in the source corpora (both train-ing and test) which belong to the same group. We swap them and we use the mod-ied source training corpora to realign and to build the nal translation system. We have evaluated our reordering ap-proach both in alignment and translation quality. In addition, we have used two state-of-the-art SMT systems: a Phrased-based and an Ngram-based. Experiments are reported on the EuParl task, where en-couraging results are obtained. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{mechanism of}} deep earthquakes (depth > 300 km) remains enigmatic, partly because their rupture dimensions {{are difficult to}} estimate due to their low aftershock productivity and absence of geodetic or surface rupture observations. The two largest deep earthquakes, the recent Great 2013 Sea of Okhotsk earthquake (M[*] 8. 3, depth 607 km) and the Great 1994 Bolivia earthquake (M[*] 8. 3, depth 637 km), together provide {{a unique opportunity to}} compare their rupture patterns in detail. Here we extend a travel-time sub-event location method to perform full teleseismic P-waveform inversion. This new method allows us to explain the observed broadband records with a set of sub-events whose model parameters are robustly constrained without smoothing. We find that while the Okhotsk event is mostly unilateral, rupturing 90 km along strike with a velocity over 4 km/s, the Bolivia earthquake ruptured about half this distance at a slow velocity (about 1. 5 km/s) and displayed a major change in rupture direction. We explain the observed differences between the two earthquakes as resulting from two fundamentally different faulting mechanisms in slabs with different thermal states. Phase transformational faulting is <b>inferred</b> <b>to</b> occur <b>inside</b> the metastable olivine wedge within cold slab cores whereas shear melting occurs inside warm slabs once triggered...|$|R

Children were also tested on their ability <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> an agent's desires when the agents' past experiences were likely to lead to desires that conflicted with the children's own preference. Children succeeded at predicting agents' desires when no conflict existed between their own preferences and those of the agents, but could not do so when such a conflict was present, indicating that while children are able <b>to</b> <b>infer</b> desire based on both explicit and implicit information when it is consistent with their own desire, they have difficulty disengaging from their current mental states...|$|R
