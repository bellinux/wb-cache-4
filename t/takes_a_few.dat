5|$|Jerry {{inherits}} {{some old}} possessions {{of his grandfather}} Irving. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had, until George broke it. Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} methods of burial: the coffin may be laid {{in a cave}} or in a carved stone grave, or hung on a cliff. It {{contains}} any possessions that the deceased will need in the afterlife. The wealthy are often buried in a stone grave carved out of a rocky cliff. The grave is usually expensive and <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months to complete. In some areas, a stone cave may be found that {{is large enough to}} accommodate a whole family. A wood-carved effigy, called Tau tau, is usually placed in the cave looking out over the land. The coffin of a baby or child may be hung from ropes on a cliff face or from a tree. This hanging grave usually lasts for years, until the ropes rot and the coffin falls to the ground.|$|E
5|$|All bovids mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed by permission for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seconds.|$|E

25|$|Cramer's {{object is}} to {{showcase}} his encyclopedic knowledge of stocks and give callers a second opinion on their stock ideas. He takes as many calls as possible before a buzzer goes off to indicate {{the end of the}} round. When this happens, Cramer gets upset and usually <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more calls. After this, the Daktronics buzzer goes off at his signal, and the segment is over.|$|E
25|$|Traditional barbacoa {{involves}} {{digging a}} hole in the ground and placing some meat—usually a whole lamb—above a pot so the juices can be used to make a broth. It is then covered with maguey leaves and coal, and set alight. The cooking process <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours. Olaudah Equiano, an African abolitionist, described this method of roasting alligators among the Mosquito People (Miskito people) on his journeys to Cabo Gracias a Dios in his narrative The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano.|$|E

25|$|One common path {{of entry}} by {{contaminants}} {{to the sea}} are rivers. The evaporation of water from oceans exceeds precipitation. The balance is restored by rain over the continents entering rivers and then being returned to the sea. The Hudson in New York State and the Raritan in New Jersey, which empty at {{the northern and southern}} ends of Staten Island, are a source of mercury contamination of zooplankton (copepods) in the open ocean. The highest concentration in the filter-feeding copepods is not at the mouths of these rivers but 70 miles south, nearer Atlantic City, because water flows close to the coast. It <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days before toxins are taken up by the plankton.|$|E
25|$|Instead, a much smaller, less {{powerful}} generator may be included {{which will take}} much longer to generate the total energy needed. This lower power is only sufficient to accelerate a tiny amount of fuel per second, and would be insufficient for launching from Earth. However, over long periods in orbit {{where there is no}} friction, the velocity will be finally achieved. For example, it took the SMART-1 more than a year to reach the Moon, whereas with a chemical rocket it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. Because the ion drive needs much less fuel, the total launched mass is usually lower, which typically results in a lower overall cost, but the journey takes longer.|$|E
25|$|Foragers first go {{in search}} of water, which they collect in {{multiple}} trips. This water is then regurgitated {{on the surface of}} the nest material (typically plant fibers). The water serves as a type of glue, adhering the fibers of the nest material, beginning the formation of a ball. The water also serves to moisten and soften the fibers of the pulp so it is easier to manipulate for the formation of the nest. Using their mandibles, the foraging wasps remove the plant fibers (pulp) from its surface. This forms a ball of pulp, and the wasp will move around the immediate area in order to collect enough pulp (a ball that is about the size of its head, 2–4mm). This collection process only <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes. At this point, the forager returns to the nest, carrying the pulp mass. Either the forager or the queen wasp will take the pulp and apply it to the growing nest. The forager repeats this process multiple times in a day, usually for many hours. Interestingly, there is evidence that foragers collect the same foraging material on each trip. In nests that are made out of materials with distinct colors, researchers found that each forager collected only one of the colors in the nest, creating a colorful nest.|$|E

500|$|Globally, {{gray wolf}} diet is {{predominantly}} composed of large (...) and medium-sized (...) wild ungulates, with local population variations {{due to the}} mix of wild ungulates, smaller prey and domestic species consumed. All terrestrial mammalian social predators feed predominantly on terrestrial herbivorous mammals that have a body mass {{similar to that of}} the combined mass of the social group members. The gray wolf generally specializes in predating on the vulnerable individuals of large prey, with pack of timber wolves capable of bringing down a [...] moose. Digestion only <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours, thus wolves can feed several times in one day, making quick use of large quantities of meat.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, {{the film}} {{gathered}} positive reviews from top critics.

Like the original Scream, this movie is too good {{to be the end of}} the road. I have visions of my own". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film, saying [...] " [...] was playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing". Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film, saying [...] " [...] generates a respectable amount of suspense and <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> unexpected turns while covering familiar territory", while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said it was [...] "a terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong". Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun found the film [...] "fitfully thrilling", while Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide defined the film as [...] "serviceable enough, if you come to it with sufficiently modest expectations".|$|E

500|$|The {{second story}} recounts {{the tale of}} the [...] "girl-bird" [...] Gertrude McFuzz, who has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers. She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for {{something}} to make her tail grow. He tries to tell her that her tail is just right for her species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells her where she can find berries that will make her tail grow. The first berry makes her tail exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing her tail to grow to an enormous size. However, the added weight of too many feathers does not allow her to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, who hears her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out her tail feathers, which <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather left—as before—she now has [...] "enough, because now she is smarter." ...|$|E
500|$|Dynamite Headdy {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with some}} believing {{it to be}} one of the best games on the Genesis. Journalists repeatedly highlighted the game's creativity as a strong point. Rik Skews of Computer and Video Games said it [...] "breathes new life" [...] into the action-platform genre and stood up to the likes of the Sonic series. The staff at Mean Machines Sega found the game innovative and liked how each stage introduced new concepts to keep gameplay fresh. Tim Tucker at GamesMaster believed that Treasure was doing more innovation in the genre than any of its rivals. In addition to the game's originality, critics praised Treasure's programming expertise and Dynamite Headdys technical prowess. The staff of Electronic Gaming Monthly complimented the game's visual effects and colorful stages. Tucker said [...] "Dynamite Headdy is full of classic Treasure overstatement" [...] and cited the impressive colors, big explosions, large sprites, and rapidly changing backgrounds—which all together were perhaps a little too overwhelming. The Mean Machines staff believed that Dynamite Headdy followed in the footsteps of Treasure's previous games and therefore confirmed the studio's technical expertise. The gameplay drew some criticism, with Tucker finding it somewhat disjointed and [...] "patchy" [...] and Mean Machines stating that it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> stages to truly find its footing.|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{explained}} in a May 2009 interview that the scariest episode for her {{at the time was}} [...] "Unleashed". She described the episode's production, [...] "The props people had these big buckets of earth worms, but they were thicker and meatier and longer. They had teeny little bitty faces... So the guy's chest is cut open and he’s been in make-up for hours {{to make it look like}} he’s been torn open and he’s all bloody and stuff. So then they pour these worms and this goopy, syrupy stuff and this fake blood onto this guy’s chest... We had to zip him up in the body bag. It <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes to get to 'action' after he's zipped up. We unzip him and we see the worms and it’s so gross–and the look on his face. The worms are crawling up and their in his armpits and starting to crawl toward his face and he can’t move at all because he’s supposed to be dead." [...] Nicole continued that this scene had to be shot [...] "three or four times. We kept trying to get faster and faster but we were all laughing [...] It was like a Fear Factor episode with no chance of getting money... It was so gross but so much fun. The guy was such a trooper." ...|$|E

500|$|The Digital Fixs Ryan Poxon gave CRUSH3D a {{score of}} seven out of ten and called it a [...] "puzzle game that {{genuinely}} surprised me at how brain teasing the game actually is." [...] 411Mania's Adam Larck gave it {{a score of}} 6.6 out of 10 and said, [...] "For a puzzle game, Crush 3D {{is a good choice}} for 3DS fans. While the mechanic may not be as creative as it was a few years ago, it’s still a decent game to check out. If you never saw the PSP version or haven’t played games like Fez or Echochrome, I’d recommend checking this out to see what crushing is all about." [...] However, Digital Spys Liam Neeson gave it three stars out of five and stated: [...] "Despite the five-year gap between releases, Crush 3D <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> steps backwards in terms of visual style and presentation. Other than a rather limited and lacklustre selection of new levels and StreetPass features, it also offers very {{little in the way of}} brand new bonus content, making it difficult to recommend to anybody familiar with its PSP counterpart. Despite its shortcomings, however, Crush 3D gets it right where it counts." [...] In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40.|$|E
500|$|Amos Barshad from New York {{declared}} that the song reminded him of being drunk and dancing in a remote discothèque in Berlin. NMEs Dan Martin was {{of the opinion that}} [...] "Judas" [...] was the song that Gaga should have come back with. But he understood why she did not choose it as the lead single from Born This Way, {{given the fact that the}} song was characteristic of Gaga's music. Pointing the same thing, Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone wrote that the song played to Gaga's established musical sensibilities. He added that although [...] "Judas" [...] certainly had its own charms and [...] "at least three insanely catchy hooks it leans hard on Gaga's signature moves." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice summarized the song as a twin of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] describing its [...] "instantly memorable wordless vocalizing, a pummeling beat, lyrics about a romance that is, well, bad." [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey gave the song five out of five stars, commending the [...] "blasphemously camp" [...] chorus and comparing it to be worthy of Eurovision – [...] "a Scooch-meets-Lordi affair that, unsurprisingly, <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> listens to get your head around." [...] Mark Lepage from The Gazette praised the song and understood that as Gaga's music has progressed, so has her themes and inspirations, indicated by the conflicted relationship she has with the character Judas in the song. Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, compared it to [...] "'Like a Prayer' on steroids" [...] and gave it three out of five points. NME called the song [...] "Gaga's worst single so far".|$|E

[...] Scott Foundas of Variety wrote, [...] "If this is what the apotheosis of branded, big-studio entertainment has come to look like in 2015, we could be doing much worse. Unlike its title character, Age of Ultron most definitely has soul." [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times and giving the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, Richard Roeper said, [...] "Some day, an Avengers film might collapse under the weight of its own awesomeness. I mean, how many times can they save the world? But this is not that day." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Age of Ultron is a whole summer of fireworks packed into one movie.

[...] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars, stating that despite being [...] "bigger, louder and more disjointed" [...] than its predecessor, [...] "it’s also got more personality—specifically Whedon's—than any other film in the now seven-year-old franchise." [...] Helen O'Hara of Empire praised the interactions between the characters, the action set-pieces and Whedon's ability as a director in her review, stating that the film [...] "redefines the scale we can expect from our superheroes." ...|$|E
