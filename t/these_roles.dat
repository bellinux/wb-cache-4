The Seafire was a carrier-based adaptation of the Spitfire which served in the Fleet Air Arm from 1942 through to the mid-1950s.

As a consequence of this, the Spitfire's performance and capabilities improved over the course of its service life.|$|E

Southern Area Command was re-formed as Training Command in September 1953. On 28May 1958, No.1 AFTS relocated to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, where its Wirraways were replaced by deHavilland Vampire jet trainers, which required a runway longer than that at Point Cook. The school's place at Point Cook was taken by No.1 BFTS, which transferred from Uranquinty on 19December. By this time the RAAF had decided to commission all pilots and navigators, who would be selected for <b>these</b> <b>roles</b> upon induction into the service; navigators therefore went straight to the School of Air Navigation at East Sale, without attending flying training school. On 31December 1958, the Flying Training Squadron of RAAF College was disbanded, and the flight instruction component of the four-year cadet course became the responsibility of No.1 BFTS (for basic training) and No.1 AFTS (for advanced training). Previously, the cadets had used FTS aircraft under RAAF College instructors, but from 1959 their flight training was fully integrated with the FTS system.|$|E

In this paper, I report on measures of life satisfaction and emotional well-being (experienced utility) across groups of college-educated women based on whether they have a career, a family, both, or neither. The biggest premium to life satisfaction is associated with having a family; while there is also a life satisfaction premium associated with having a career, women do not seem to be able to “double up ” on these premiums. A qualitatively similar picture emerges from my analysis of the emotional well-being data. Among college-educated women with family, those with a career spent a larger share of their day unhappy, sad, stressed and tired compared to those that are staying at home. I Data I use two main sources of data. To document overall evaluation of life, I use the General Social Surveys (GSS), 1972 to 2010. I use answers to the question “Taken all together, how would you say things are these days- would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy or not too happy? ” I construct a dummy variable that equals 1 if the respond answers “very happy, ” 0 otherwise.
