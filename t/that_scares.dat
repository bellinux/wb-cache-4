5|$|The Queen Anne's Revenge {{heads for}} Whitecap Bay {{to find and}} harvest mermaid tears. After {{managing}} to lure in a mermaid named Tamara, she summons other mermaids to attack the crew before Jack causes an explosion <b>that</b> <b>scares</b> them away. A mermaid named Syrena is caught, but Philip Swift, a captive missionary, {{falls in love with}} her. Reaching Ponce de León's ship on an uncharted island, Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices. Jack locates the grounded, decaying vessel, only to find Barbossa there. Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices, after they are nowhere to be found on the vessel.|$|E
5|$|The film {{continues}} to be appreciated for its experimental nature, its camera angles and montage elements being treated in an unusual manner, while the fiction elements of the screenplay hint of magic realism. In this sense, {{it is important to}} mention that the days in the film are separated by Andrei's erotic dreams. In his dreams, the differences between him and Marilena are partially removed, either by lowering the rooftop on which the boy stands to ground level or by debarking the girl from a breast-shaped UFO <b>that</b> <b>scares</b> the neighbors away. Another fictional element is Marilena's capacity of provoking short circuits, in moments in which she is very emotionally active (e.g., when Andrei touches her in the bar's restroom, or when the whole neighborhood is cut from electricity when she cries near the high voltage electrical box).|$|E

When the pair see restaurant Il Gnosh on fire, Gilly rings for help whilst Steph runs into the burning building to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and her children. Gilly stands on a ladder outside and begs her to come out, however she tells him she's ready to die and walks back into the flames. Gilly deals with his grief by becoming angry that Steph has 'left' him. After Rhys tries to comfort him, Gilly goes into Steph's room and trashes it after seeing that she has still kept her photo of her and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) on their wedding day, placed on a table. Gilly argues with Steph's family as they blame him for not saving her and disagree on the funeral arrangements. Frankie then tells him that Steph had never loved him and that Max would have done anything to save Steph from the fire, making him further deeply upset and angry. He starts drinking heavily, causing trouble on many occasions.|$|E

They encounter various obstacles along the way, including a fire set by Carney's men <b>that</b> <b>scares</b> the cattle, resulting {{in the death of}} Flynn when the group tries to stop the cattle from stampeding over a cliff. Lady Sarah and Drover fall in love, and she gains a new appreciation for the Australian territory. The team drive the cattle through the dangerous Never Never desert. Then, when at last delivering the cattle in Darwin, the group has to race them onto the ship before Carney's cattle are loaded.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} statues is the Kindlifresserbrunnen (Bernese German: Child Eater Fountain but often translated Ogre Fountain) which is located on Kornhausplatz. The fountain was built in 1545–46 on the site of a fifteenth-century wooden fountain. Originally known as Platzbrunnen (German: Plaza Fountain), the current name dates to 1666. The statue is a seated giant or ogre swallowing a naked child. Several other children are visible in a sack at the figure's feet. There are several interpretations of what the statue represents; including that it is a Jew with a pointed Jewish hat or the Greek god Chronos. However, the most likely explanation is that the statue represents a Fastnacht figure <b>that</b> <b>scares</b> disobedient children.|$|E

But when people do that it usually means they are hiding some characteristic inside themselves <b>that</b> <b>scares</b> them. That is Mary's case.

While warming up, Robinson noticed that a Miami Northwestern lineman had taped a photograph of Robinson onto {{the front of his}} helmet. Robinson started laughing and told the player, [...] "You think <b>that</b> <b>scares</b> us?"

500|$|As part of {{the secrecy}} campaign, Benedict Cumberbatch denied that he was playing Khan during interviews, {{describing}} Harrison as simply a terrorist with his own purposes, as well as [...] "someone that's activated and manufactured in a way by Starfleet, and it's a scene that has {{come back to haunt}} him." [...] He discussed the character's moral ambiguity saying it fit the adage [...] "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter," [...] adding parallels to the current world order [...] "whether it's U.S. foreign policy or the actions of some terrorists." [...] Into Darkness writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman added that they used the character of Khan not just for his popularity with the fandom—"It’s so easy to fall into the trap of doing something because you {{think people are going to}} love it. You must come up with what the movie can be on its own and then, if it turns out the villain maybe can be Khan, then you can do it.

500|$|McIntee praises Alien as [...] "possibly the {{definitive}} combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings." [...] He notes, however, {{that it is}} a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. Alien, on the other hand, focuses on the plight of people being attacked by a monster: [...] "It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal." [...] Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the slasher film genre: [...] "The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is {{that it is a}} distillation of everything <b>that</b> <b>scares</b> us in the movies." [...] He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: [...] "Fans of Hitchcockian thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the hard science fiction trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{overwhelmingly}} positive British {{response to}} the film led to its critical and commercial success throughout Europe. Derek Malcolm of Cosmopolitan wrote, [...] " [...] is fast {{becoming one of the}} cult movies of the year ... The great virtue of the film is the way it grabs hold of its audience and simply refuses to let go. It exploits all our fears of irrational violence and unmotivated attack, {{and at the same time}} manages to laugh at itself without spoiling the tension - a very considerable feat. Carpenter, who is clearly a director with places to go, has succeeded in making a comedy <b>that</b> <b>scares</b> the pants off us. And don't think you're laughing at it. As a matter of fact, it's laughing at you." [...] Malcolm later wrote that he held some reservations about the film: [...] "I don't feel like going on and on about the movie, partly because I think it is in grave danger of being oversold anyway, and partly because it isn't much more to me than tremendous fun". The film broke one house record in the UK and was named one of the best films of the year by critics and moviegoers.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{behaviour}} continues, Arfwedson {{observed the}} character [...] "spiral out of control" [...] {{as she puts}} patients lives at risk, takes drugs and nearly burned down her flat. Zosia's mental state causes real concern for her father Guy. Zosia keeps a video diary where she discusses her thoughts and state of mind. He realises that she needs help and sends her to a rehab clinic. While there she is told that she has bipolar disorder but Guy refuses to believe it. Arfwedson stated that [...] "mentally unstable" [...] Zosia is [...] "terrified of her ability to lose control, but she doesn't want to admit she's got this problem; <b>that</b> <b>scares</b> her more." [...] She fears that her career is ruined and her dreams of being a psychiatrist herself will be unattainable. The actress add [...] "It leaves her wondering: 'How can I understand other people, if I can't understand myself?'" [...] When she is discharged he ignores a psychiatrist's advice that Zosia undergoes more intense treatment. Zosia insists that she is of sound mind to return to work. As the CEO, Guy is able to let her return and even invites her to work alongside him in the operating theatre. But while in there he notices that Zosia is still unwell. She behaves in a [...] "frenzied and disruptive" [...] manner and Guy struggles {{to concentrate on the}} procedure and has her removed from the theatre. The actress described her character as having [...] "waves of clarity where she feels almost super-human and everything makes sense". But then she start talking really fast, no one can understand her and she cannot understand why. At this point Guy accepts that he has been in denial and Zosia is ill. He lets Zosia remain at the hospital under the agreement that she takes her medication to control the health.|$|E
