500|$|Kanye West {{would be}} the first person to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> belongs on this list. The dude doesn't believe in false modesty, and he shouldn't [...] He fought for his place in the {{cultural}} pantheon with a purpose. In his debut album, over a decade ago, Kanye issued what amounted to a social critique and a call to arms (with a beat): [...] "We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think." [...] But Kanye does think. Constantly. About everything. And he wants everybody else to do the same: to engage, question, push boundaries. Now that he's a pop-culture juggernaut, he has the platform to achieve just that. He's not afraid of being judged or ridiculed in the process. Kanye's been playing the long game all along, and we're only just beginning to see why.|$|E
500|$|California Chrome {{shipped to}} New York on May 20 in a {{semi-trailer}} horse van together with Ride On Curlin. They had a police escort through New York City from the Throgs Neck Bridge to Belmont Park. The [...] press reported that Art Sherman believed the misspelled saddle cloths at the Derby and Preakness {{were a good}} luck charm, and that he specifically asked Belmont Park for another misspelled cloth along with a properly spelled version. The first week California Chrome spent at the Belmont track was generally uneventful, other than galloping past an opossum that wandered onto the track the morning of May 23. The horse {{paid little attention to}} it, but the press pounced on the story; the animal was labeled [...] "Dumb-Ass Possum", and someone created a Twitter account for the creature. Delgado commented, [...] "I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> loves this track, and I don't see him (having) any problem getting a mile and a half." [...] On May 31, Espinoza arrived to give the colt a short workout known as a [...] "breeze". Horse and jockey were greeted by a large contingent of fans and press at about 6:30a.m., and ran a [...] "sharp" [...] half-mile (...) officially clocked at 47.69 seconds. A clocker for the Daily Racing Form stated, [...] "He's going to be tough to beat. I think we're going to have a Triple Crown winner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carnegie Tech coach Walter Steffen said of Strong's performance: [...] "This is {{the first}} time in my career that one man was good enough to run over and {{completely}} wreck an exceptionally good team. I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> is better than Heston or Thorpe." ...|$|E
50|$|Logan will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>he's</b> an {{excellent}} skater {{if you ask}} him and even if <b>you</b> don't. <b>He</b> will also <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>he's</b> a movie star, a bio-physicist and that he can bench 350.He can talk {{his way out of}} anything which really helps during missions. Jax and Logan have small mutual crushes on each other.|$|R

2500|$|Monkees co-creator Bob Rafelson {{commented that}} Jones [...] "deserves {{a lot of}} credit, let me <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>He</b> may not have lived {{as long as we}} wanted him to, but he survived about seven lifetimes, {{including}} being perhaps the biggest rock star of his time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Truesdale {{had kind}} words for his successor, Peter J. Hurtgen. [...] "He's not an ideologue," [...] Truesdale said in October 2002. [...] "He {{came from a}} {{management}} background, and I guess he himself would <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> was a conservative Republican and a management-oriented person. But he was always very fair." ...|$|E
2500|$|Walter Steffen, also {{a member}} of the College Football Hall of Fame, said: [...] "I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> is easily the {{greatest}} football player I ever saw – and I've been around over twenty-five years [...] [...] [...] I can tell you honestly that since 1905 I've never seen a football player in his class for all-around stuff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. You wish {{to believe}} he {{committed}} the crime. You believe him capable of committing it. But your instinct <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> did not commit it. It <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> more--shall I go on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> {{know who}} <b>he</b> is--what he is?" [...] he asked. [...] "I will <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>He's</b> a spy--a damned Jacobite spy, whom {{a word from}} me will hang." ...|$|R

2500|$|The 'birds' {{are also}} {{mentioned}} in Homer's Odyssey : [...] "“ although I am no prophet really, and I {{do not know}} much about the meaning of birds. I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> will not long be absent from his dear native land, not if chains of iron hold him fast. He {{will find a way to}} get back, for he is never at a loss." ...|$|E
2500|$|Others {{were more}} rebellious. Veteran {{communist}} Gheorghe Vasilichi exposed himself by openly criticizing Gheorghiu-Dej, and also nominated Drăghici as a wrongdoer: [...] "we {{still have the}} cult of personality, we still have haughtiness, even though Comrade Drăghici will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> is not haughty". Drăghici also withstood an attack from Miron Constantinescu, the Marxist-Leninist ideologue, who challenged the politburo about the decade of repression and murder. Drăghici, again supporting Gheorghiu-Dej, informed Constantinescu {{that he was only}} incriminating himself, an assessment equally supported by Ceaușescu.|$|E
2500|$|His {{escape from}} English hands was aided by one Sir William Ramsay of Colluthie, also a {{prisoner}} of the English. In the presence {{of one of the}} guards, Ramsay pretended to be furious with Archibald and accused him of the theft of his cousin's armour. Furthermore, he stated that his cousin had been felled by an English arrow and had died as a [...] result of his lack of protection. Ramsay than insisted that Archibald take off his boots. Archibald concurred {{and by the time he}} had removed one, Ramsay started beating him around the head with it. One of the guards intervened to stop Ramsay, insisting that Archibald was the son of a great noble and should be respected. Ramsay retorted, [...] "Not he, I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>he</b> is a scullion and a rogue", then to Archibald, [...] "Go you rascal, and seek your master's body amongst the slain, so that we may at least give him a decent burial". Ramsay paid the fee of 40 shillings, the ransomable rate of an esquire. Ramsay cuffed Archibald round the head once more and bade him begone. Archibald made his way back to Scotland, and deprived the Black Prince's army of what would have been a considerable ransom.|$|E
