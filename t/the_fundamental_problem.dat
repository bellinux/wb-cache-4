25|$|<b>The</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> {{with the}} quality of American {{medicine}} is that we’ve failed to view delivery of health care as a science. The tasks of medical science fall into three buckets. One is understanding disease biology. One is finding effective therapies. And one is ensuring those therapies are delivered effectively. That third bucket has been almost totally ignored by research funders, government, and academia. It’s viewed as the art of medicine. That’s a mistake, a huge mistake. And from a taxpayer’s perspective it’s outrageous.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusive}} fitness theory {{provides a}} good overview of possible solutions to <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> of cooperation: its contradiction to natural selection. The theory {{is based on the}} hypothesis that cooperation helps in transmitting underlying genes to future generations either through increasing the reproductive successes of the individual (direct fitness) or of other individuals who carry the same genes (indirect fitness). Direct benefits can result from simple by-product of cooperation or enforcement mechanisms, while indirect benefits can result from cooperation with genetically similar individuals.|$|E

25|$|The {{theories}} and principles in the Drake equation {{are closely related}} to the Fermi paradox. The equation was formulated by Frank Drake in 1961 in an attempt to find a systematic means to evaluate the numerous probabilities involved in the existence of alien life. The speculative equation considers the rate of star formation in the galaxy; the fraction of stars with planets and the number per star that are habitable; the fraction of those planets that develop life; the fraction that develop intelligent life; the fraction that have detectable, technological intelligent life; and finally the length of time such communicable civilizations are detectable. <b>The</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> is that the last four terms are completely unknown, rendering statistical estimates impossible.|$|E
25|$|Gluck {{had long}} pondered <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> {{of form and}} content in opera. He thought both of the main Italian operatic genres – opera buffa and opera seria – had strayed too far from what opera should really be and seemed unnatural. Opera buffa had long lost its {{original}} freshness. Its jokes were threadbare and the repetition of the same characters made them seem no more than stereotypes. In opera seria the singing was devoted to superficial effects and the content was uninteresting and fossilised. As in opera buffa, the singers were effectively absolute masters of the stage and the music, decorating the vocal lines so floridly that audiences could no longer recognise the original melody. Gluck wanted to return opera to its origins, focusing on human drama and passions and making words and music of equal importance.|$|E
25|$|Decisions can be complex {{admixtures}} {{of facts}} and values. Information about facts, especially empirically-proven facts or facts derived from specialized experience, are more easily transmitted {{in the exercise of}} authority than are the expressions of values. Simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values. Following Lasswell, he states that “a person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group”. A person may identify himself with any number of social, geographic, economic, racial, religious, familial, educational, gender, political, and sports groups. Indeed, the number and variety are unlimited. <b>The</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> for organizations is to recognize that personal and group identifications may either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization. A specific organization has to determine deliberately, and specify in appropriate detail and clear language, its own goals, objectives, means, ends, and values.|$|E

25|$|When Watson came to Cambridge, Crick was a 35-year-old {{graduate}} student (due {{to his work}} during WWII) and Watson was only 23, but he already had a Ph.D. They shared an interest in <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> of learning how genetic information might be stored in molecular form. Watson and Crick talked endlessly about DNA {{and the idea that}} {{it might be possible to}} guess a good molecular model of its structure. A key piece of experimentally-derived information came from X-ray diffraction images that had been obtained by Wilkins, Franklin, and Gosling. In November 1951, Wilkins came to Cambridge and shared his data with Watson and Crick. Alexander Stokes (another expert in helical diffraction theory) and Wilkins (both at King's College) had reached the conclusion that X-ray diffraction data for DNA indicated that the molecule had a helical structure—but Franklin vehemently disputed this conclusion. Stimulated by their discussions with Wilkins and what Watson learned by attending a talk given by Franklin about her work on DNA, Crick and Watson produced and showed off an erroneous first model of DNA. Their hurry to produce a model of DNA structure was driven in part by the knowledge that they were competing against Linus Pauling. Given Pauling's recent success in discovering the Alpha helix, they feared that Pauling might also be the first to determine the structure of DNA.|$|E
500|$|These successes {{were not}} due to some revolutionary new paradigm, but mostly on the tedious {{application}} of engineering skill and on the tremendous power of computers today. In fact, Deep Blue's computer was 10 million {{times faster than the}} Ferranti Mark 1 that Christopher Strachey taught to play chess in 1951. This dramatic increase is measured by Moore's law, which predicts that the speed and memory capacity of computers doubles every two years. <b>The</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> of [...] "raw computer power" [...] was slowly being overcome.|$|E
500|$|All That Glitters debuted {{the week}} of April 18, 1977 on about 40 {{stations}} in late-night syndication. It was poorly critically received, with one reviewer {{going so far as}} to call the show's theme song [...] "blasphemous" [...] for suggesting that God was female and created Eve first. Time magazine sharply criticized the series, calling it [...] "embarrassingly amateurish", with [...] "flaccid" [...] and [...] "wearying" [...] jokes, flat writing, [...] "mediocre" [...] acting and [...] "aimless" [...] direction. The Wall Street Journal concurred, saying that while the series' role-reversal premise may have been adequate for a play or film, it was too limiting to serve as the basis for a continuing series. These limitations showed up most clearly, the Journal says, in the lead performances. Although praising the performers themselves as talented, they are cited for being [...] "unable to infuse much life into their roles". The Journal pegs <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> with All That Glitters as that [...] "its characters are not people at all, merely composites of the least attractive characteristics of each sex. The satire focuses not on the way real, recognizable people behave, but on stereotypes and cliches about masculine and feminine attitudes. Even when stood on their heads, they still remain stereotypes and cliches." ...|$|E

500|$|The Philadelphia Inquirer and the San Jose Mercury News both {{commented on}} <b>the</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> that Springsteen {{seemed to be}} facing on the tour. [...] The former said [...] "Bruce Springsteen may well have miscalculated {{earlier this year when}} he {{released}} Working on a Dream, one of the most hopeful and downright happy sounding albums of his career just as a cratering economy was rendering the songs of struggle and strife that are his stock in trade more resonant than they have sounded in years." [...] The latter said, [...] "As Don Rumsfeld might say, you don't go on tour with the album you wish you had, you go on tour with the album you've got. So Springsteen faces the tough task of hyping a new romantic pop record while simultaneously offering hope and support to a wounded nation – not an easy task." [...] Rolling Stone voiced a similar theory. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote that [...] "If there was a disappointment, it was that Springsteen didn’t make a stronger case for his latest album, Working on a Dream. I’m not a fan of the album, but I always look forward to how the singer reinvents his studio work on the stage. In this case, however, he barely touched the new material ..."

2500|$|Titanic {{was long}} {{thought to have}} sunk in one piece and, over the years, many schemes were put forward for raising the wreck.

2500|$|To measure this {{tangential}} alignment, it {{is necessary}} to measure the ellipticities of the background galaxies and construct a statistical estimate of their systematic alignment. [...] <b>The</b> <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> is that galaxies are not intrinsically circular, so their measured ellipticity is a combination of their intrinsic ellipticity and the gravitational lensing shear. [...] Typically, the intrinsic ellipticity is much greater than the shear (by a factor of 3-300, depending on the foreground mass). [...] The measurements of many background galaxies must be combined to average down this [...] "shape noise". The orientation of intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies should be almost entirely random, so any systematic alignment between multiple galaxies can generally be assumed to be caused by lensing.|$|E
