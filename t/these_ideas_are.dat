5|$|<b>These</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> {{reflected}} in the arrangement and composition of the album, which lead to a sound of dread and dissonance. The band used a number of less common instruments to achieve this sound; {{in addition to the}} orchestra and choir, Neon Bible features a hurdy-gurdy, mandolin, accordion and pipe organ. Win Butler has said that in conceiving the album he hoped for a more stripped-down sound but the songs demanded further instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E

50|$|H.P. Blavatsky in her Theosophical {{writings}} {{presented a}} complex cosmology, {{in terms of}} a sevenfold series of cosmic planes and subplanes, and a detailed sevenfold system of cycles and sub-cycles of existence. <b>These</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> adapted by later esotericists like Rudolf Steiner (Anthroposophy), Max Heindel, Alice Bailey, and Ann Ree Colton, and some of <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> included in New Age thought.|$|R
5|$|Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic {{ideal of}} self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and {{universal}} love. William Borman {{states that the}} key to his satyagraha is rooted in the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas. Gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood {{in the context of the}} Hindu terminology of Dharma and Ṛta.|$|E
5|$|The poem also {{contains}} many of Southey's {{views on the}} Catholic Church and how it influenced his political views. Part of this comes from Southey's trip to Lisbon and Madrid in 1795 where he was exposed to what he believed as Catholic superstition. He believed that {{the church and the}} Catholic leaders kept the people ignorant, and he believed that the Muslims that were cast out of Spain were more tolerant. Many of <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> repeated in a speech within the work by Henry V, and the character attributes ignorance and vice to oppression. Southey believed {{that the only way to}} escape from these problems was for people to believe they were part of one universal family. His enemies later described Southey's as holding Jacobin belief and claimed he supported the extremism of Robbespierre, when his sympathies laid to a larger extent with the Girondins that were replaced by the Jacobins. However, the poem is still subversive since it described a French patriot fighting against the English that parallels the strife during Southey's time.|$|E

25|$|There is much rabbinic {{material}} {{on what happens}} to the soul of the deceased after death, what it experiences, and where it goes. At various points in the afterlife journey, the soul may encounter: Hibbut ha-kever, the pains of the grave; Dumah, the angel of silence; Satan as the angel of death; the Kaf ha-Kela, the catapult of the soul; Gehinom (purgatory); and Gan Eden (heaven or paradise). All classic rabbinic scholars agree that these concepts are beyond typical human understanding. Therefore, <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> expressed throughout rabbinic literature through many varied parables and analogies.|$|E

25|$|Hinduism's Rigveda makes {{references}} to reincarnation in the Brahmanas layer. Though these early textual {{layers of the}} Vedas, from 2nd millennium BCE, mention and anticipate the doctrine of Karma and rebirth, the idea is not fully developed. It is in the early Upanishads, which are pre-Buddha and pre-Mahavira, where <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> more explicitly developed in a general way. Detailed descriptions first appear around the mid 1st millennium BCE in diverse traditions, including Buddhism, Jainism and various schools of Hindu philosophy, each of which gave unique expression to the general principle.|$|E
500|$|According to Dennis Dalton, it was {{the ideas}} that were {{responsible}} for his wide following. Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by [...] "brute force and immorality", contrasting it with his categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by [...] "soul force and morality". Gandhi {{captured the imagination of}} the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning [...] "hate with love". <b>These</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> evidenced in his pamphlets from the 1890s, in South Africa, where too he was popular among the Indian indentured workers. After he returned to India, people flocked to him because he reflected their values.|$|E
500|$|The {{theory and}} {{practice}} of Yoga, in different styles, {{has been a part of}} all major traditions of Hinduism, and Shiva has been the patron or spokesperson in numerous Hindu Yoga texts. These contain the philosophy and techniques for Yoga. <b>These</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> estimated to be from or after the late centuries of the 1st millennium CE, and have survived as Yoga texts such as the Isvara Gita (literally, [...] "Shiva's song"), which Andrew Nicholson – a professor of Hinduism and Indian Intellectual History – states have had [...] "a profound and lasting influence on the development of Hinduism".|$|E

500|$|Rowson {{also notes}} that Black's chances {{increase}} markedly by playing good openings, {{which tend to be}} those with flexibility and latent potential, [...] "rather than those that give White fixed targets or that try to take the initiative prematurely." [...] He also emphasizes that [...] "White has 'the initiative', not 'the advantage'. Success with Black depends on seeing beyond the initiative and thinking of positions in terms of 'potential'." [...] <b>These</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> exemplified by the Hedgehog, a dynamic modern system against the English Opening that can arise from various move orders. A typical position arises after 1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 b6 4.Bg2 Bb7 5.0-0 e6 6.Nc3 Be7 7.d4 cxd4 8.Qxd4 d6 9.e4 a6. White has a spatial advantage, while Black often maneuvers his pieces on the last two ranks of the board, but White [...] "has to keep a constant eye on the possible liberating pawn thrusts ...b5 and ...d5." [...] Watson remarks, [...] "Black's goal is to remain elastic and flexible, with many options for his pieces, whereas White can become paralyzed at some point by the need to protect against various dynamic pawn breaks." [...] He also observes that, [...] "White tends to be as much tied up by Black's latent activity as Black himself is tied up by White's space advantage." [...] Moreover, attempts by White to overrun Black's position often rebound disastrously. An example of this is the following grandmaster game: ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{some areas}} of module theory, a flat {{resolution}} must satisfy the additional requirement that each map is a flat pre-cover of the kernel of the map to the right. [...] For projective resolutions, this condition is almost invisible: a projective pre-cover is simply an epimorphism from a projective module. [...] <b>These</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> inspired from Auslander's work in approximations. [...] <b>These</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> also familiar from the more common notion of minimal projective resolutions, where each map is required to be a projective cover of the kernel of the map to the right. [...] However, projective covers need not exist in general, so minimal projective resolutions are only of limited use over rings like the integers.|$|E

25|$|One {{component}} of Aristotle's theory of dreams introduces <b>ideas</b> that <b>are</b> contradictory to previously held beliefs.

Aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations. <b>These</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> contradictory to what had been believed about dreams, but at the time in which he introduced <b>these</b> <b>ideas</b> more thinkers <b>were</b> beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena.|$|R
