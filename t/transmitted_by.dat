Most are <b>transmitted</b> <b>by</b> arthropods (mosquitoes or ticks), and are therefore also referred to as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).|$|E

5|$|HIV is <b>transmitted</b> <b>by</b> {{three main}} routes: sexual contact, {{significant}} exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission). There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood. It {{is possible to}} be co-infected {{by more than one}} strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Dr. Carlos Finlay, a Scottish {{physician}} practising in Havana, {{theorized that}} yellow fever was <b>transmitted</b> <b>by</b> a specific mosquito, later designated Aedes aegypti.

This was the first scientific proof of a disease being transmitted exclusively by an insect vector, and demonstrated that control of such diseases necessarily entailed control or eradication of its insect vector.|$|E

5|$|Reversion is {{a serious}} disease <b>transmitted</b> <b>by</b> the {{blackcurrant}} gall mite Cecidophyopsis ribis. It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents. Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ("big bud") in winter, each housing thousands of microscopic mites. As pest control has limited effectiveness, severely infected bushes should be destroyed. All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free.|$|E

This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis), and advanced scarring (cirrhosis). In some cases, those with cirrhosis go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.|$|E

5|$|Viruses {{spread in}} many ways. Just as many viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are <b>transmitted</b> <b>by</b> the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is <b>transmitted</b> <b>by</b> bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects.|$|E

5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus <b>transmitted</b> <b>by</b> the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) and the other a white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E

Lesbians are not included in a category of frequency of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission, although transmission is possible through vaginal and cervical secretions.
