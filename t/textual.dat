5|$|John 1:28 – The second {{corrector}} made unique <b>textual</b> variant Βηθαραβα. This <b>textual</b> variant {{has only}} codex 892, syrh {{and several other}} manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|It {{belongs to}} the <b>textual</b> Family 1 with manuscripts 118, 131 and 209. Classification in this <b>textual</b> family was {{supported}} by the Claremont Profile Method, but it examined with this method only in Luke 1, Luke 10 and Luke 20.|$|E
5|$|According to the Claremont Profile Method it {{represents}} the <b>textual</b> family f13 in Luke 1, Luke 10, and Luke 20, as a core member.|$|E
5|$|Although {{aware that}} historians had criticized the witch-cult {{hypothesis}} of Margaret Murray, Martello stood by her claims, {{believing that the}} cult had been passed through oral tradition and thus evaded appearing in the <b>textual</b> sources studied by historians.|$|E
5|$|As {{the text}} came from several {{different}} traditions, {{different parts of}} the codex are not of equal <b>textual</b> value. The text has been edited several times since the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|In <b>textual</b> references, Shashthi {{is often}} {{depicted}} as closely connected to Skanda. An early <b>textual</b> reference dating to 8th–9th century BCE relates Shashthi {{to the six}} Krittikas who nurtured and nursed Skanda. Sometimes regarded as {{an aspect of the}} goddess Durga (identified with Parvati – the mother of Skanda), she is also called Skandamata ("Skanda's mother"). The 3rd to 5th century text Yajnavalkya Smriti describes Shashthi as the foster-mother and protector of Skanda.|$|E
5|$|Lectionary 299 in Mark 6:33 has <b>textual</b> reading ἐκεῖ καὶ προῆλθον αὐτούς {{along with}} Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus, 0187 (omit εκει), 892, ℓ 49, ℓ 69, ℓ 70, ℓ 303, ℓ 333, ℓ 1579, (ℓ 950 αυτους), itaur, vg, (copsa, bo).|$|E
5|$|Luke 9:10 {{it has the}} <b>textual</b> variant εις πολιν καλουμενην Βηθσαιδα (to a city called Bethsaida), as do codices B, L, and 33; {{but later}} hand-written in the margin εις τοπον ερημον πολεως καλουμενην Βηδσαιδα (into a deserted place {{belonging}} to the city called Bethsaida).|$|E
5|$|No other {{examples}} of owls in an iconographic context exist in Mesopotamian art, nor are there <b>textual</b> references that directly associate owls with a particular god or goddess.|$|E
5|$|<b>Textual</b> {{critics and}} palaeographers like Johann Jakob Wettstein, Constantin von Tischendorf, Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener and Caspar René Gregory dated the {{manuscript}} to the 10th century. Henri Omont and Kirsopp Lake dated {{it to the}} 12th century, and Dean Burgon to the 12th or 13th century. It is dated by the Institute for New Testament <b>Textual</b> Research to the 12th century because the frequent occurrence of enlarged letters, rounded breathing marks, flourishes and ligatures seem to eliminate earlier dates.|$|E
5|$|The labour {{spent by}} Dr. Scrivener upon <b>Textual</b> Criticism {{is well known}} from his admirable Introduction to the Science, a {{handbook}} which leaves hardly anything, if anything, to be desired.|$|E
5|$|These {{additions}} effectively {{transformed the}} photographs into {{a work of}} fiction. Subsequent posters expanded upon the character, adding their own visual or <b>textual</b> contributions.|$|E
5|$|A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament: For the Use of Biblical Students {{is one of}} {{the books}} of Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener (1813–1891), biblical scholar and <b>textual</b> critic. In this book Scrivener listed over 3,000 Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, as well as manuscripts of early versions. It was used by Gregory for further work.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{scientific}} fame, Newton's {{studies of the}} Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on <b>textual</b> criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cultural}} critic, Said {{is known for}} the book Orientalism (1978), {{a critique of the}} cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism—how the Western world perceives the Orient. Said’s model of <b>textual</b> analysis transformed the academic discourse of researchers in literary theory, literary criticism, and Middle-Eastern studies—how academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied. As a foundational text, Orientalism was controversial among the scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature.|$|E
5|$|As {{an example}} of the <b>textual</b> content the section on the British Isles {{mentions}} (amongst other things): alternative names; the etymology of British and its relation to woad painted tribes; climate; lack of snakes; the seemly manners of the populace; coroners and ecclesiastical courts; lists of counties, bishoprics and universities; the structure of aristocracy; and much more, even a list of recommended reading.|$|E
5|$|Fenster {{notes that}} until the {{introduction}} of the Maxwell House Haggadah, American families purchased new and different Haggadahs each year for their Passover Seder guests. The easy availability and <b>textual</b> consistency of each year's Maxwell House Haggadah made it ideal for expanding the family's Haggadah collection.|$|E
5|$|Further {{scattered}} details can {{be found}} in Pausanias's Description of Greece, while the Byzantine Suda dictionary of the 10th century AD preserves some anecdotes found nowhere else. Minor sources for the period include the works of Pompeius Trogus (epitomized by Justinus), Cornelius Nepos and Ctesias of Cnidus (epitomized by Photius), which are not in their original <b>textual</b> form. These works are not considered reliable (especially Ctesias), and are not particularly useful for reconstructing the history of this period.|$|E
5|$|H. Deane, a paleographer, in 1876 dated the {{manuscript}} to the 8th century, Tischendorf and Gregory to the 9th century; Doedes and Tregelles to the 10th century. As of 1995, it is dated by the Institute for New Testament <b>Textual</b> Research (INTF) to the 9th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1 John 5:6 it has <b>textual</b> variant δι' ὕδατος καὶ αἵματος καὶ πνεύματος (through {{water and}} blood and spirit) {{together}} with the manuscripts: Codex Alexandrinus, 104, 424c, 614, 1739c, 2412, 2495, ℓ 598m, syrh, copsa, copbo, Origen. Bart D. Ehrman says this was a corrupt reading from the orthodox party, although this is widely disputed.|$|E

5|$|Kannada {{literature}} {{during this}} period consisted of writings relating to the socio-religious developments of the Jain and Veerashaiva faiths, {{and to a lesser}} extent that of the Vaishnava faith. The earliest well-known brahmin writers in Kannada were from the Hoysala court. While most of the courtly <b>textual</b> production was in Kannada, an important corpus of monastic Vaishnava literature relating to Dvaita (dualistic) philosophy was written by the renowned philosopher Madhvacharya in Sanskrit.|$|E
5|$|Kym Gynell (Keith Faure), Alex Dimitriades (Victor Brincat) and Ian Bliss (Thomas Hentschel) are now fully {{credited}} in {{the episodes}} {{in which they}} starred, with the <b>textual</b> explanation given that their characters could not be named {{at the time of}} production but can now be named as of 2011, due to the end of their related trials. They are still unnamed in the dialog of each episode.|$|E
5|$|Luke 4:17 {{it has the}} <b>textual</b> variant καὶ ἀνοίξας τὸ βιβλίον (and {{opened the}} book) {{together}} with the manuscripts A, B, L, W, 33, 892, 1195, 1241, ℓ 547, syrs, h, pal, and copsa, bo, against variant καὶ ἀναπτύξας τὸ βιβλίον (and unrolled the book) supported by א, Dc, K, Δ, Θ, Π, Ψ, f1, f13, 28, 565, 700, 1009, and 1010.|$|E
5|$|Most playwrights of {{the period}} {{typically}} collaborated with others at some point, and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same, mostly early and late in his career. Some attributions, such as Titus Andronicus and the early history plays, remain controversial while The Two Noble Kinsmen and the lost Cardenio have well-attested contemporary documentation. <b>Textual</b> evidence also supports the view {{that several of the}} plays were revised by other writers after their original composition.|$|E
5|$|Sima Daad {{from the}} Department of Comparative Literature at the University of Washington {{feels that the}} {{creative}} merit of Kiarostami's adaptation of Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad's poems extends the domain of <b>textual</b> transformation. Adaptation {{is defined as the}} transformation of a prior text to a new text. Kiarostami's adaptation arrives at theoretical realm of adaptation by expanding its limit from inter-textual potential to trans-generic potential.|$|E
5|$|<b>Textual</b> {{critics have}} had a {{challenging}} task in classifying the Codex, the exact relationship to other known texts and families is still disputed. The Greek text of the codex is of mixed text-types. It is {{a representative of the}} Byzantine text-type in the Gospels - the oldest examples of the type - {{and the rest of the}} New Testament books are of the Alexandrian text-type, with some Western readings. Kurt Aland placed it in Category III in the Gospels, and in Category I in rest of the books of the New Testament. The Byzantine text of the Gospels has a number of Alexandrian features, it has some affinities to the <b>textual</b> Family Π. Soden associated the text of the gospels with Family Π, though it is not a pure member of this family. According to Streeter, it is the earliest Greek manuscript which gives us approximately the text of Lucian the Martyr, but a small proportion of the readings seem to be earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Greek text of this codex is a {{representative}} of the Alexandrian text-type, but with a large number of Byzantine readings. According to Lagrange the text {{is similar to that of}} Codex Vaticanus. It is one of the witnesses for the Euthalian recension of the Pauline epistles.

5|$|The {{creator of}} the {{familiar}} literary persona of Arthur was Geoffrey of Monmouth, with his pseudo-historical Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain), written in the 1130s. The <b>textual</b> sources for Arthur are usually divided into those written before Geoffrey's Historia (known as pre-Galfridian texts, from the Latin form of Geoffrey, Galfridus) and those written afterwards, which could not avoid his influence (Galfridian, or post-Galfridian, texts).|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} contains text of {{the four}} Gospels with unusual grammar forms and numerous errors. Textually it {{does not belong to}} any of the main text-types, {{and is a member of}} the <b>textual</b> family Family 13, known also as Ferrar Group. The lacunose manuscript is housed at the University of Michigan.|$|E
5|$|The text of {{the codex}} {{represents}} {{the majority of the}} text (Byzantine text-type), but with numerous alien readings (non-Byzantine). Some of its readings do not occur in any other manuscript (so called singular readings). According to the present <b>textual</b> critics its text is not a very important manuscript, but it is quoted in all modern editions of the Greek New Testament.|$|E
5|$|This {{vulnerability}} as {{it relates}} to low working memory capacity individuals and seductive details within <b>textual</b> information can also be seen as a difference between children and adult learners. Because adults, on average, having a higher working memory capacity than children, adults are less affected by seductive details than children.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, its {{original}} provenance remains unknown. The relief was not archaeologically excavated, and thus {{we have no}} further information where it came from, or in which context it was discovered. An interpretation of the relief thus relies on stylistic comparisons with other objects for which the date and place of origin have been established, on {{an analysis of the}} iconography, and on the interpretation of <b>textual</b> sources from Mesopotamian mythology and religion.|$|E
5|$|In John 1:1–8:38 Codex Sinaiticus {{differs from}} Vaticanus {{and all other}} Alexandrian manuscripts. It is in closer {{agreement}} with Codex Bezae {{in support of the}} Western text-type. For example, in John 1:4 Sinaiticus and Codex Bezae are the only Greek manuscripts with <b>textual</b> variant ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἐστίν (in him is life) instead of ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ᾓν (in him was life). This variant is supported by Vetus Latina and some Sahidic manuscripts. This portion has a large number of corrections.|$|E
5|$|McColley knew of {{only one}} {{surviving}} copy of the first edition, held at the British Museum (now British Library C.56.c.2), which {{was the basis for}} his 1937 edition of The Man in the Moone and Nuncius Inanimatus, an edition criticised by literary critic Kathleen Tillotson as lacking in <b>textual</b> care and consistency. H. W. Lawton's review published six years earlier mentions a second copy in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, V.20973 (now RES P- V- 752 (6)), an omission also noted by Tillotson.|$|E
5|$|Paper cup {{and paper}} napkin: Paper cups have been {{documented}} in imperial China, alongside paper napkins. Paper cups were known as chih pei and {{were used for the}} serving of tea. They were constructed in different sizes and colors, and were adorned with decorative designs. Paper napkins, or chih pha, accompanied tea cups and were folded into squares. <b>Textual</b> evidence of paper cups and napkins appears in a description of the possessions of the Yu family, from the city of Hangzhou.|$|E
