5|$|Independent {{companies}} {{also provide a}} battery replacement service, returning the original unit with new battery but original case. Alternatively {{it is possible for}} a <b>technically</b> competent user to buy and install a new battery. The task does not require soldering, but is <b>technically</b> challenging.|$|E
5|$|Betances {{was also}} a {{government}} representative {{for some of the}} governments of Haiti while in Paris. He was also <b>technically</b> a diplomat for the United States of America once.|$|E
5|$|Fraud in the naturalization process. <b>Technically,</b> {{this is not}} a loss of {{citizenship}} but rather a voiding of the purported naturalization and a declaration that the immigrant never was a citizen of the United States.|$|E
5|$|However, in locally {{advanced}} tumours, surgery may not routinely {{provide the}} best chance of cure and is often not <b>technically</b> feasible to perform. In these cases radiotherapy, including brachytherapy, offers the only chance of cure.|$|E
5|$|However, {{not all of}} Alkan's {{music is}} either lengthy or <b>technically</b> difficult; for example, many of the Op.31 Préludes and of the set of Esquisses, Op.63.|$|E

5|$|Orangutans {{are very}} <b>technically</b> adept nest builders, making a new nest each evening in only 5 to 6 minutes and {{choosing}} branches which they know can support their body weight.|$|E
5|$|The TEC Awards is {{an annual}} program to honor <b>technically</b> {{innovative}} products {{as well as}} companies and individuals who have excelled in sound for television, film, recordings and concerts. Madonna has won one award from four nominations.|$|E
5|$|This section indexes {{official}} specials and recap episodes {{that were}} made specifically by the Lost team. <b>Technically</b> these episodes are clip shows but to distance them from the negative stereotypes clip shows receive, they are described as recap specials.|$|E
5|$|Ties were <b>technically</b> {{possible}} in baseball until several rule changes beginning in 2007; however, ties were rare in practice {{due to the}} extra-innings rules.|$|E
5|$|Trudy {{gave birth}} to a daughter, Molly Evans, on January 2, 1983. Had she not been adopted out and Trudy not murdered, this would <b>technically</b> make Adrian Molly's stepfather.|$|E
5|$|Tube {{shooters}} feature craft {{flying through}} an abstract tube. <b>Technically,</b> most tube shooters are also fixed shooters, because the player is still constrained to left/right movement, but it's mapped {{to the shape}} of the tube.|$|E
5|$|V: <b>Technically,</b> the Federal Diet {{only has}} 598 members; the {{additional}} thirty-two seats are overhang seats {{resulting from the}} 2013 election.|$|E
5|$|VIII: <b>Technically,</b> the House of Representatives {{only has}} 65 members; the {{additional}} two seats are overhang seats {{to ensure a}} majority of MPs for the party which gained the most votes in the 2017 election.|$|E
5|$|A {{division}} occurred among US naval planners in {{the early}} years of the 20th century over whether to have <b>technically</b> superior ships or many less expensive ones, with President Theodore Roosevelt among those supporting the former and Admiral of the Navy George Dewey along with Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan supporting the latter approach.|$|E
5|$|A monumental and <b>technically</b> complex border {{protection}} area gord of over 3 hectares in size was built around 770–780 in Trzcinica near Jasło {{on the site}} of an old Bronze Age era stronghold, probably the seat of a local ruler and his garrison. Thousands of relics were found there, including a silver treasure of 600 pieces. The gord was set afire several times and ultimately destroyed {{during the first half of}} the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|Also {{aiding the}} B-1's {{survivability}} is its relatively low radar cross-section (RCS). Although not <b>technically</b> a stealth aircraft {{in a comprehensive}} sense, thanks to the aircraft's structure, serpentine intake paths and use of radar-absorbent material its RCS is about 1/50th of the similar sized B-52's RCS; this is about 26ft² or 2.4m², roughly equivalent to the RCS of a small fighter aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{situated}} in New York City, the land occupied by the United Nations Headquarters and the spaces of buildings that it rents are under the sole administration of the United Nations and not the U.S. government. They are <b>technically</b> extraterritorial through a treaty agreement with the U.S. government. However, in exchange for local police, fire protection and other services, the United Nations agrees to acknowledge most local, state, and federal laws.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{performance}} capture data which were transferred {{directly to the}} computers, numerous reference cameras gave the digital artists multiple angles of each performance. A <b>technically</b> challenging scene was {{near the end of}} the film when the computer-generated Neytiri held the live action Jake in human form, and attention was given to the details of the shadows and reflected light between them.|$|E
5|$|By 1883, most coins on {{the islands}} were American, due to the close {{economic}} integration between islands and mainland. The laws of Hawaii reflected this, making gold American coins legal tender for an unlimited amount and American silver coins legal tender to $50. In 1879, the kingdom issued its first currency notes, <b>technically</b> certificates of deposit, redeemable in silver coin and with denominations ranging from $10 to $500.|$|E
5|$|Clayman (IGN) {{reported}} that the game had no major technical issues, which was a major concern in the protracted run-up to the game's release. He also found that most of its levels {{did not appear to}} leverage the Xbox 360's advances in areas apart from graphics. Bramwell (Eurogamer), on the other hand, fought the controls and camera throughout the game. He lamented a particular issue in which the camera would spin 180 degrees when Kameo was hit, which made the path of retreat harder to see. Theobald (GameSpy) also lamented the camera. Kasavin (GameSpot) found Kameo to be <b>technically</b> outstanding, and praised its automatic game save features, short loading times, steady frame rates, and detailed display on both standard- and high-definition televisions. Pfister (1UP.com) wrote that Kameo was <b>technically</b> impressive to the point of overwhelming the gameplay.|$|E
5|$|D: Paul Muni's {{performance}} in Black Fury was not {{nominated for an}} Oscar. For two years only, the Academy allowed a write-in vote. <b>Technically,</b> this meant that any performance was eligible for the award. The decision was made the previous year {{in response to the}} controversy surrounding Bette Davis's failure to receive a nomination for Of Human Bondage. Muni came 2nd in the vote; however, the Academy does not recognize Davis or Muni as nominees in these years.|$|E
5|$|Donald Fagen of Steely Dan has {{favored the}} sound of the Rhodes over the Wurlitzer Electric Piano, because he felt it was a <b>technically</b> {{superior}} instrument. Steely Dan has featured the Rhodes in almost all of their albums after 1975, and Fagen has also used the Rhodes in all of his solo albums and continues to play it at every one of his touring performances since 1994.|$|E
5|$|During their {{marriage}} {{she was known}} as Heather Mills McCartney, but after her divorce she reverted to Heather Mills, although she should still be correctly referred to as Lady McCartney; as the former wife of a knight, she <b>technically</b> retains that title. She was addressed as such by Lord Justice Leveson, during the Leveson Inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Early {{intervention}} {{helped to}} ensure that the Nationalist faction survived the initial stages of the war; German involvement then steadily expanded. The training they provided to Nationalist force proved as valuable, if not more so, than direct actions. Approximately 56,000 Nationalist soldiers were trained by various German detachments in Spain, who were <b>technically</b> proficient; these covered infantry, tanks and anti-tank units, air and anti-aircraft forces, and those trained in naval warfare.|$|E
5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but <b>technically</b> more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the kabuki theater {{tradition}} in Japan employs ritualized representations of {{violence on the}} stage. While kabuki is <b>technically</b> theater and not dance, the movements, for example, of the sword-fighting termed tachimawari in kabuki are gymnastic to the point even of employing somersaults, and elaborate fight scenes are so deliberate and stylized that they provide at least an area of overlap between theater and dance.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{power is}} {{exercised}} by Her Majesty's Government, which comprises Ministers, primarily the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, which is <b>technically</b> {{a committee of}} the Privy Council. They have {{the direction of the}} Armed Forces of the Crown, the Civil Service and other Crown Servants such as the Diplomatic and Secret Services (the Queen receives certain foreign intelligence reports before the Prime Minister does).|$|E
5|$|Freitas {{considers}} {{that even if}} an extraterrestrial being were to be afforded legal personhood, problems of nationality and immigration would arise. An extraterrestrial being {{would not have a}} legally recognized earthly citizenship, and drastic legal measures might be required in order to account for the <b>technically</b> illegal immigration of extraterrestrial individuals.|$|E
5|$|General fund. <b>Technically,</b> {{there is}} just one general fund, {{under the control of}} the United States Treasury Department. However, each federal agency {{maintains}} its own self-balancing set of accounts. The general fund is used to account for receipts and payments that do not belong to another fund.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{recession}} of the mid-1990s resulted in Highway 407 being truncated in Markham temporarily. Slightly revised plans for the links appeared on the June 2007 <b>Technically</b> Recommended Route Report for the extension of Highway407 to Highway35/115, which was submitted {{as part of the}} environmental assessment (EA) for the extension, but had been announced earlier that year on March7 by the Government of Canada, as part of an investment in Greater Toronto Area infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, Austria {{called for}} Prussia {{to hand over}} {{administration}} of Schleswig-Holstein, which had until that point been jointly administered by the two powers, to the Duke of Augustenberg. Prussia refused, and Otto von Bismarck sent troops into Austrian-administered Holstein. This provoked war between Austria and Prussia, with Hesse siding with the Austrians, <b>technically</b> making Alice and her sister Victoria enemies.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged CHXR 73 b (left), {{an object}} {{orbiting}} a young companion star {{at a distance}} of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus <b>technically</b> a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star suggests it could not have formed inside the small star's protoplanetary disc, and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from gravitational collapse.|$|E
5|$|In eastern-central Europe, the Kingdom of Hungary was {{established}} in AD 1000 following the Christianisation of the Magyars. The kingdoms of Poland and Bohemia were established within the Holy Roman Empire in 1025 and 1198, respectively. In Eastern Europe, the Kievan Rus' consolidated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which did not <b>technically</b> claim the status of kingdom until the early modern Tsardom of Russia.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944 {{the prisoners}} had counterfeited {{the reverse of}} the dollar, and the obverse by January 1945. Twenty samples of the $100 note were produced—without the serial number, whose {{algorithm}} was still being examined—and shown to Himmler and banking experts. The standard of engraving and printing was considered excellent, although the paper used was <b>technically</b> inferior to the genuine notes.|$|E
