40|$|Abstract—Prohibitive {{simulation}} {{time with}} pre-silicon design models and unavailability of proprietary target applications make microprocessor design very tedious. The framework proposed {{in this paper}} is the first attempt to automatically generate synthetic benchmark proxies for real world multithreaded applications. The framework includes metrics that characterize the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>workloads</b> in <b>the</b> shared caches, coherence logic, out-of-order cores, interconnection network and DRAM. The framework is evaluated by generating proxies for <b>the</b> <b>workloads</b> in <b>the</b> multithreaded PARSEC benchmark suite and validating their fidelity by comparing the microarchitecture dependent and independent metrics to that of <b>the</b> original <b>workloads.</b> <b>The</b> average error in IPC is 4. 87 % and maximum error is 10. 8 % for Raytrace in comparison to <b>the</b> original <b>workloads.</b> <b>The</b> average error in the power-per-cycle metric is 2. 73 % with a maximum of 5. 5 % when compared to original <b>workloads.</b> <b>The</b> representativeness of the proxies to that of <b>the</b> original <b>workloads</b> {{in terms of their}} sensitivity to design changes is evaluated by finding the correlation coefficient between the trends followed by the synthetic and the original for design changes in IPC, which is 0. 92. A speedup of four to six orders of magnitude is achieved by using the synthetic proxies over <b>the</b> original <b>workloads...</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{content-based}} publish/subscribe (pub/sub) {{has become}} a popular paradigm to decouple content producers and consumers for Internet-scale content services. Many real applications show that <b>the</b> content <b>workloads</b> frequently exhibit very skewed distribution, and incur unbalanced <b>workloads.</b> To balance <b>the</b> <b>workloads,</b> <b>the</b> literature of content-based pub/sub adopted a migration scheme (Mis) to move (a subset of) subscription filters from overloaded brokers to under loaded brokers. In this way, the publications that successfully match the moved filters are then offloaded, leading to balanced <b>workloads.</b> Unfortunately, <b>the</b> Mis scheme cannot reduce <b>the</b> overall matching <b>workloads.</b> In <b>the</b> worst case, suppose that all brokers suffer from heavy workloads. Mis cannot find available brokers to offload <b>the</b> heavy <b>workloads</b> of those overloaded brokers, and fails to balance <b>the</b> <b>workloads.</b> To overcome <b>the</b> issue, the contribution {{of this paper is}} to develop a set of novel load balancing algorithms, namely a similarity-based replication scheme (Sir). The novelty of Sir is that it not only balances <b>the</b> <b>workloads</b> of brokers but also reduces <b>the</b> overall <b>workloads.</b> Based on both simulation and emulation results, the extensive experiments verify that Sir can achieve much better performance than Mis, in terms of 43. 1 % higher entropy value (i. e., more balanced workloads) and 46. 39 lower workloads. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

5|$|Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and Aurelius Hermogenianus—aided in {{regulating}} the flow and presentation of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept <b>the</b> <b>workload</b> heavy.

Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts {{in his name}} still surviving, and these probably represent {{only a small portion}} of the total issue. The sharp increase in the number of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has been read as evidence of an ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire on terms dictated by the imperial center.|$|E

In this study, we investigate a suite of workloads in bioinformatics on two multiprocessor systems with different configurations, and examine the effects of the configurations on the performance of <b>the</b> <b>workloads.</b> Our result indicates that the configurations of the multiprocessor systems have significant impact on the performance and scalability of <b>the</b> <b>workloads.</b> For example, a number of workloads have significantly higher scalability on one of the systems, but poorer absolute performance than on the other system. However, traditional scalability failed to capture the impacts of the system configurations on <b>the</b> <b>workloads.</b> We present insights on what kinds of workloads will run faster on which systems and propose new metrics to capture the impacts of multiple processor configurations on <b>the</b> <b>workloads.</b> These findings not only provide an easy way to compare results running on different systems, but also enable re-configuration of the underlying systems to run specific workloads efficiently. We also show how processor mapping and loop spreading may help map the workoads to the underlining multiprocessor configuration and achieve consistent scalability for these workloads. ...|$|R

5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} <b>the</b> <b>workload</b> of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon {{is also known as}} The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E
5|$|For {{the entire}} tour, Ring took 60 {{first-class}} wickets at a bowling average of 21.81, {{the most expensive}} among Australia's frontline bowlers. As England agreed {{to have a new}} ball available 55 overs after the start of each innings in the Tests—more frequently than usual—fast bowling dominated over spin, and Ring was used primarily in the non-Test tour matches. Outside the Tests, only Bill Johnston bowled more overs, and Ring was used to relieve <b>the</b> <b>workload</b> on Bradman's pace spearheads to keep them fresh for the Tests.

Johnson's most successful match with the ball was against Gloucestershire, in which he took match figures of 11/100. He was also more prolific with the bat outside the Tests, scoring 543 runs at 30.16, with a top-score of 113 not out against Somerset. He also made 80 against a Marylebone Cricket Club team that consisted almost entirely of Test players.
