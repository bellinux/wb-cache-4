40|$|AbstractSolar cell models {{implemented}} in simulation packages (for example Sentaurus TCAD) are typically restricted either {{to only one}} or two dimensions, or to small scales. They therefore neglect effects of local inhomogeneities or large scale phenomena such as lateral transport to fingers or busbars. In this paper, we use a distributed circuit model to investigate lateral inhomogeneity effects on silicon wafer solar cells. The circuit is constructed of different unit elements based on the one-diode model. To calculate the characteristics of the circuit, we use the freely available software LTspice IV (Linear Technology Corp). The presented model is used to simulate the distributed current flow in a solar cell. First, the design of the distributed circuit model is described. Then, the current-voltage characteristics obtained by the distributed circuit model are compared with those obtained from measurements. Finally, one kind of large-scale lateral effect, the voltage distribution across the solar cell area, is analysed. Due to lateral ohmic voltage drops, the electric potential at the cell surface is shown to be higher in the middle between <b>two</b> <b>busbars</b> or fingers than close to them...|$|E

The increase in power densities {{take the form of}} increased voltage (230 / 400 Vac, ± 270 Vdc) and/or decreased distances between conductors. The addition of these evolutions leads to higher probability of electric arc, which might be potentially more destructive.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{transfer}} load currents between parallel busbars {{is one of}} the main requirements for most disconnector switches in gas insulated as well as air insulated substations today. As such, the capability limits and testing methods are internationally standardized in IEC 62271 - 102. The test circuit dictated in this standard is the Thévenin equivalent of the high current, power frequency approximation of <b>two</b> parallel <b>busbars</b> supplied by an AC current source. This setup inevitably couples different factors influencing the bus-transfer switching process by directly specifying the pre-switching current through the disconnector switch and recovery voltage expected across it after successful switching. To facilitate a more detailed and direct investigation of bus-transfer switching processes, a different test method is suggested and consequently implemented as a proof of concept. The suggested method entails the use of an AC current source to drive a current through two parallel impedances representing different sections of a busbar. The disconnector switch under test is placed in series with one of the impedances. In order to analyze the feasibility of such a setup, a proof of concept current source along with two parallel impedances was built.

40|$|Today, IEC 62271 - 102 standardizes the {{determination}} of testing methods and capability limits of bus-transfer switching by disconnectors. The test circuit mandated by this standard uses a low-voltage, high-current AC voltage source in series to an impedance and the disconnector under test corresponding to the Thévenin equivalent of <b>two</b> parallel <b>busbars</b> in a typical substation. In a previous Cigré Session publication[1] the authors presented a non-standard alternative to this testing method which differs from the IEC standard in multiple ways. The proposed full bus-transfer setup employs two parallel impedances which are modelled after typical GIS substation busbar in terms of resistance and inductance. These impedances allow tests with busbar lengths ranging between 10 m and 600 m. In addition, the proposed setup makes use of a damped oscillating LC current source {{in order to provide}} the pre-switching current at power frequency while adding passive safety due to a decaying source current. A feature from which applications such as limit testing or post-failure analysis might benefit. Furthermore, the setup could be expanded toward bus-transfer testing at low-frequency or direct current conditions by modifying or exchanging the current source. After successfully demonstrating initial results of a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed setup, the variable parameters of pre-switching current and bus-transfer impedance were adjusted over large ranges with the aim to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} bus-transfer process in GIS disconnectors.

40|$|Abstract. Upgraded {{metallurgical}} grade (UMG) silicon {{has been}} researched both on the purification methods and its material properties for years, indicating {{that it is the}} most promising choice as low-cost feedstock for photovoltaics. In this work, UMG multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) prepared by cold crucible refining and electron beam melting was investigated. Solar cells based on such silicon wafers were fabricated in a 156 x 156 mm 2 production line and their photovoltaic properties were characterized. Compared with the conventional mc-Si solar cells fabricated in the same commercial production line, the UMG mc-Si solar cells with <b>two</b> <b>busbars</b> presented higher average open circuit voltage (Voc) and average fill factor (FF), which were 628 mV and 78. 6 % separately. Although the UMG mc-Si solar cells showed a lower shot-circuit current density (Jsc) of 32. 7 A/cm 2 in the average and an early reverse breakdown voltage at around 11 V which was due to higher impurities content. The average conversion efficiency of the UMG mc-Si solar cells reached 16. 14 %, and the highest conversion efficiency was up to 16. 31 %. In addition, the UMG mc-Si solar cells presented relatively low light induced degradation (LID) due to the material properties. Consequently, in consideration of low cost, our UMG mc-Si solar cells substantially met the requirements of commercial manufacturing and had a great potential application for photovoltaic industry...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In power electronics, {{the high}} speed {{switching}} transients within power electronic converters are strongly {{affected by the}} resistance and inductance of connections between components. During commutation the di/dt could be around hundred amperes per microsecond and if the inductance value of the connection loop {{is more than a}} hundred nanohenrys, an overshoot voltage may be generated which can damage power electronic components. The parasitic inductance of the busbar becomes an important factor {{and it has to be}} kept as low as possible to minimise overshoot voltages. In recent years, a new type of a busbar, a planar busbar is used in conjunction with fast semiconductor switching devices for high power applications to achieve low loop inductance. Increase of the busbar resistance during switching is another option to minimise the overshoot voltage at switching times. In this paper, a <b>two</b> layer planar <b>busbar</b> with different materials is proposed in order to increase the damping ratio at high frequency.

40|$|In recent years, {{multilevel}} converters {{are becoming}} more popular and attractive than traditional converters in high voltage and high power applications. Multilevel converters are particularly suitable for harmonic reduction in high power applications where semiconductor devices {{are not able to}} operate at high switching frequencies or in high voltage applications where multilevel converters reduce the need to connect devices in series to achieve high switch voltage ratings. This thesis investigated two aspects of multilevel converters: structure and control. The first part of this thesis focuses on inductance between a DC supply and inverter components in order to minimise loop inductance, which causes overvoltages and stored energy losses during switching. Three dimensional finite element simulations and experimental tests have been carried out for all sections to verify theoretical developments. The major contributions of this section of the thesis are as follows: The use of a large area thin conductor sheet with a rectangular cross section separated by dielectric sheets (planar busbar) instead of circular cross section wires, contributes to a reduction of the stray inductance. A number of approximate equations exist for calculating the inductance of a rectangular conductor but an assumption was made that the current density was uniform throughout the conductors. This assumption is not valid for an inverter with a point injection of current. A mathematical analysis of a planar bus bar has been performed at low and high frequencies and the inductance and the resistance values between the two points of the planar busbar have been determined. A new physical structure for a voltage source inverter with symmetrical planar bus bar structure called Reduced Layer Planar Bus bar, is proposed in this thesis based on the current point injection theory. This new type of planar busbar minimises the variation in stray inductance for different switching states. The reduced layer planar busbar is a new innovation in planar busbars for high power inverters with minimum separation between busbars, optimum stray inductance and improved thermal performances. This type of the planar busbar is suitable for high power inverters, where the voltage source is supported by several capacitors in parallel in order to provide a low ripple DC voltage during operation. A <b>two</b> layer planar <b>busbar</b> with different materials has been analysed theoretically {{in order to determine the}} resistance of bus bars during switching. Increasing the resistance of the planar busbar can gain a damping ratio between stray inductance and capacitance and affects the performance of current loop during switching. The aim of this section is to increase the resistance of the planar bus bar at high frequencies (during switching) and without significantly increasing the planar busbar resistance at low frequency (50 Hz) using the skin effect. This contribution shows a novel structure of busbar suitable for high power applications where high resistance is required at switching times. In multilevel converters there are different loop inductances between busbars and power switches associated with different switching states. The aim of this research is to consider all combinations of the switching states for each multilevel converter topology and identify the loop inductance for each switching state. Results show that the physical layout of the busbars is very important for minimisation of the loop inductance at each switch state. Novel symmetrical busbar structures are proposed for multilevel converters with diode-clamp and flying-capacitor topologies which minimise the worst case in stray inductance for different switching states. Overshoot voltages and thermal problems are considered for each topology to optimise the planar busbar structure. In the second part of the thesis, closed loop current techniques have been investigated for single and three phase multilevel converters. The aims of this section are to investigate and propose suitable current controllers such as hysteresis and predictive techniques for multilevel converters with low harmonic distortion and switching losses. This section of the thesis can be classified into three parts as follows: An optimum space vector modulation technique for a three-phase voltage source inverter based on a minimum-loss strategy is proposed. One of the degrees of freedom for optimisation of the space vector modulation is the selection of the zero vectors in the switching sequence. This new method improves switching transitions per cycle for a given level of distortion as the zero vector does not alternate between each sector. The harmonic spectrum and weighted total harmonic distortion for these strategies are compared and results show up to 7...|$|R
