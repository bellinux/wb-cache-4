Using data from the American Time Use Survey for the years 2003 - 2006, this paper finds that housework has {{a negative effect on}} wages for women that spans most occupations. There is strong evidence of a threshold effect, with a negative effect of housework on wages for both women and men spending one or more hours per day on housework. Neither omitted working conditions correlated with housework <b>time</b> <b>nor</b> <b>effort</b> is likely to explain the negative housework effect. The connection of housework time to the ‘lack of interest ’ argument proposed by defendants in class action discrimination cases is examined...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This paper reports on an eye-movement study of {{undergraduate}} mathematical reading behaviours. The eye movements of 38 undergraduate students were recorded as they read a multi-page textbook section on graph theory; participants {{then took a}} short comprehension test. This abstract reports basic results showing that neither reading <b>time</b> <b>nor</b> processing <b>effort</b> – measured via mean fixation durations – predicted comprehension test performance: students who read for longer or tried harder did not necessarily learn more. The conference report will include more detailed analysis of participants’ eye movements: it will explore their relative attention to {{different parts of the}} text {{and the extent to which}} they shift their attention back and forth during learning, and will analyse the extent to which these behaviours differ across more and less effective learners...|$|R

5000|$|Some time later, Forrest and {{the other}} prisoners are {{eligible}} for a work release program, {{to which they are}} put to work under a [...] "religious rehabilitation" [...] at Holy Land, a religious-based theme park, where all the attractions are based on Bible stories. Due to his size, Forrest is cast as Goliath in a daily reenactment of the famous fight, but he finds the work harmful as he is constantly hit with rocks from the guy who plays David, and [...] "keeps muttering about Jodie Foster." [...] Finally deciding he has had enough, Forrest one day takes matters into his own hand; throwing his rival across the arena. In doing so, he accidentally causes the park's circuitry to go haywire, resulting in mayhem and the reverend to be exposed having an affair with his secretary. Forrest is skirted away by a man, whom Forrest thinks is [...] "Mr. Bozoski", and put in a nice section of New York City. Forrest's new boss say he has been studying him for some time and wants him to push papers on Wall Street. Forrest is suspicious of making $250,000 a year just to sign papers, but figures he can take care of Little Forrest. While at one restaurant frequented by celebrities, Forrest and his son are talked up by one young celebrity filming Big who makes remarks such as [...] "life is a box of chocolates" [...] or [...] "stupid is as stupid does", which both Forrest Sr. and Forrest Jr. consider strange. Forrest is also given an attractive brunette secretary. Forrest fails to see the intended reason for his secretary, at first treating her as an employee, but eventually gives in to her advances when she plays herself as lonely. One night after lovemaking with his secretary, Forrest is visited by Jenny's ghost, who is not upset that he slept with another woman considering she is deceased, but in that he has not taken the <b>time</b> <b>nor</b> the <b>effort</b> to read what he is signing, and that trouble is ahead.|$|R
