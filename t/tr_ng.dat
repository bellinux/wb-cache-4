40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{relevant}} literature it was established that there was a need to conduct an investigation into the development of criteria of teacher effectiveness in two stages. Phase I of the expe ent. as designed to examine the effect of using a prepared evaluation inst nt (with and without training in its use) on students' self assessments, and tutors' and head-teachers' assessments of students in a teaching practice situation, and on the differences between the assessmen s nade by the three parties concerned. Early in their practice periods in three widely dispersed colleges, assessments were made by all participants on a defined scale (5 point: A, B, C, D, E without +'s and -'s). Two weeks later "control" g='Oups ('C') made further sUbjective assessments, "evaluation" groups eE') used the instrument, and "trained" groups ('T') used the same instrtoent after training involving the use of a simulated video taped teaching situation. Appropriate tests and analyses, including a factor analysis, were carried out leading to findings which supported (at an appropriate level of significance) the hypothesis that: differences in the assessment of practical teaching between head-teachers, tutors and students are reduced by the use of a common evaluation instrument, supported by a <b>tr</b> <b>ng</b> session using a video-tape of a classroom situation. Phase II of the experiment sought further clarification concerni 3 g those criteria of specific importance to students, teachers and tutors. A new sample associated with six teacher training institutions across the country, having shared in the common experience of assessmen of practical teaching using the instrument designed for Phase I, weighted the 15 sub-categories (i. e. criteria) on the instrument using a deii ed five-point scale. The data were processed, and resulting correla-;ion matrices and results of factor analyses tabulated to assist those involved in the planning, implementation and evaluation of professional studies courses in initial teacher training programmes. The co=pu erised results were interpreted to reveal five criteria: (i) a'Fre=. oh",ll, factor. (ii) a factor which emphasised the value of 'personal relationships with children'. (iii) (iv) and (v) a 'preparation and planning' factor. a factor drawing attention to the vital skills of 'organisation and teacher performance'. a 'discipline' factor. Due consideration was given to validity (content, construct, predictive and concurrent validity), and reliability of the evaluation instrument used in the experiment...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the more}} {{persistent}} gaps in our knowledge of prehistoric human adaptation to tropical environments {{is the lack of}} developed models of early forager mobility and site function in Southeast Asia. This situation has been perpetuated, partly by the practical constraints that working in the humid tropics places of identifying and excavating new and well preserved sites; but partly also on methodological grounds. In particular, there has often been a ‘cellular’ approach to tropical subsistence reconstruction – where ‐ by each site locale is assumed to express a complete and representative record of a whole foraging economy. The archaeological work being undertaken in Tràng An, Vietnam, is beginning to address this issue through its focus on reconstructing a foraging landscape. In this paper we present multi ‐ proxy data combining traditional and state ‐ of ‐ the ‐ art approaches to archaeological and palaeo ‐ environmental research to further elucidate the issue of tropical forager mobility and habitat use during the Late Pleistocene. Insights are drawn from the study of a new cave site, Hang <b>Tr</b> ố <b>ng,</b> and the way its record of occupation compares to that obtained by our project from a near ‐ by and chrono ‐ culturally overlapping site, Hang Boi. Through the evidence presented we reveal a more ‘compositional’ nature to prehistoric tropical foraging, where ‐ by different landscape locales represent integrated parts of early economic systems...|$|R
