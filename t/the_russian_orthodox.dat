50|$|In 1996 a {{group of}} <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> clergy and laity {{approached}} Patriarch Dymytriy of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC), to ask for assistance in restoring a hierarchy for {{what was to be}} named <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> True <b>Orthodox</b> Church. In June 1996, with the blessing of Patriarch Dymytriy, Archbishop Roman, and Bishop Mefodiy (later Metropolitan Mefodiy) of the UAOC, Hieromonk John was ordained a bishop of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> True <b>Orthodox</b> Church in order to restore apostolic succession. In December 1996 Bishops John and Mefodiy ordained Archimandrite Stefan a bishop for <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> True <b>Orthodox</b> Church.

5|$|Apologists for the OCA's autocephaly {{claim that}} the decree did not need the {{approval}} of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, as it was an internal matter for <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church to decide.

5|$|By 1917, the American diocese was {{the largest}} in <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church. It had grown from ten parishes in 1890 to more than 350.

5|$|According to {{the census}} of , 58.9% of all Belarusians adhere {{to some kind}} of religion; out of those, Eastern Orthodoxy (Belarusian Exarchate of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church) makes up about 82%. Roman Catholicism is practiced mostly in the western regions, and there are also {{different}} denominations of Protestantism. Minorities also practice Greek Catholicism, Judaism, Islam and Neopaganism.

5|$|In time, <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church Outside Russia was victorious {{and placed}} the relics in a church in Brookwood Cemetery in Woking, with the enshrinement {{ceremony}} occurring in September 1984. The St Edward Brotherhood of monks was organized there as well. The church is now named St Edward the Martyr Orthodox Church, and it is {{under the jurisdiction of}} a traditionalist Greek Orthodox community. However, while the bones are of approximately the right date, they are of a man in his late twenties or early thirties rather than a youth in his mid teens.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas II and Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse) were exhumed {{from their}} tombs in September 2015 to confirm {{links to other}} relatives.

The burial of what now are {{considered}} to be Maria's and Alexei's remains, to be with those of the family, was planned for 2015 but has been delayed mainly due to the insistence of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church on more DNA-testing.|$|E

5|$|On September 11, 2015 it was {{announced}} that the remains of Maria and Alexei, which had been in storage in the state archives for 8 years, are to be buried alongside their family on October 15, 2015.

5|$|The Russians, {{unlike the}} British and Americans, endeavoured {{to convert the}} natives to Christianity. Many Aleuts joined <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church. Russian missionaries founded a number of churches for the natives, such as the Church of the Holy Ascension in Unalaska. A notable Russian missionary was Saint Innocent of Alaska. For {{his work as a}} missionary, bishop, and later {{archbishop}} in Alaska and the Russian Far East he was canonized. One of the earliest Christian martyrs in North America was Saint Peter the Aleut. Other important Russian missionaries include Herman of Alaska and Joasaph Bolotov.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} vampiric {{generation}} were many and varied in original folklore. In Slavic and Chinese traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly {{a dog or}} a cat, was feared {{to become one of}} the undead. A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In Russian folklore, vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church while they were alive.|$|E

5|$|The {{period between}} All-American Councils {{is set at}} three years, {{although}} {{this is not always}} the case. The first thirteen Councils (held from 1907–1970) are referred to as All-American Sobors, reflecting the American Church's jurisdictional ties to <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church. The fourteenth Sobor (held in 1970) is jointly known as the 1st All-American Council, reflecting the autocephalous status of the OCA. The most recent All-American Council (18th) was held in July 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, {{with which it}} had communication and which was capable of governance had its American branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met. In reality, however, it was a fear of Communism and a belief that the patriarchate had been compromised which fueled the rebellion, paired with a desire {{on the part of the}} Metropolia to dissociate itself from <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) of which it had been part.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{declaration}} of self-governance, Kedrovsky and the Living Church were awarded the Church's diocesan cathedral in New York City. To prevent further loss of property, the diocese allowed individual parishes to take ownership of their properties, which made them effectively independent. This, combined with {{the increasing number of}} ethnic parishes aligning themselves with other Orthodox jurisdictions (as well as some non-Orthodox), led to a unique situation in Orthodox America whereby multiple jurisdictions overlapped geographically. The remainder of the American Church became known informally as the Metropolia (or {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Metropolitan). Following Patriarch Tikhon's death, <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church, led by Metropolitan Sergius, began cooperating with the Soviet government. In 1933, the Russian Church declared the Metropolia to be schismatic.|$|E

5|$|Her {{murder by}} {{communist}} revolutionaries on 17 July 1918 resulted in her being named as a passion bearer by <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church. She was a younger sister of Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia and an elder sister of Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia and Tsarevich Alexei of Russia. All sisters were falsely {{rumored to have}} survived the assassination and dozens of imposters claimed to be surviving Romanovs. Author Michael Occleshaw speculated that a woman named Larissa Tudor might have been Tatiana; however, all of the Romanovs, including Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia, {{were killed by the}} Bolshevik.|$|E
5|$|In Soviet Russia, a {{splinter}} {{group known as}} the Living Church gained official state recognition in place of <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church in 1922. In the United States, a group of Living Church clergy led by John Kedrovsky attempted to depose ruling American hierarch Bishop Alexander (Nemolovsky). Bishop Alexander, {{in addition to the}} political and ethnic struggles of his diocese, had also to deal with mounting Church debt {{as a result of the}} loss of funds from the Russian Church. He was forced to mortgage Church property to pay creditors, and was replaced in 1922 by Archbishop Platon (Rozhdestvensky), who had previously served as archbishop of the diocese from 1907 to 1914.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Erie had a {{significant}} Russian immigrant community, many members of which worked in the shipbuilding plants along the bayfront.

In 1983, most of this community united with <b>the</b> <b>Russian</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Church Outside Russia and became an Old Ritualist priest within the canonical Orthodox Church. Even today, the gold-domed Church of the Nativity, on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church and home parish to the famed iconographer Fr. Theodore Jurewicz.|$|E
