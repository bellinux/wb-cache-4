5|$|If Progress M1-5 had {{launched}} on 16 January, the Soyuz launch {{would have occurred}} on 10 February {{if it had been}} required. It was stood down around 22 February, after the decaying altitude of Mir made it <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> to send a crew to it.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal {{returned}} to base in Loch Ewe, {{where she and}} her crew were inspected by Winston Churchill. The sinking of U-39 was hailed as important to morale. However, the failed attack on Ark Royal, and the successful attack on Courageous on 17 September, convinced the Admiralty it was <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> to risk aircraft carriers in this way, and carrier-centred hunter-killer groups were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|At about 8:30pm, {{the men of}} the 5th and 6th regiments met at Camden Station {{along with}} some 200 police. As {{reported}} by The Sun, Governor Carroll and Mayor Latrobe were present at the station, along with B vice president King, General Herbert and his staff, and a number of police commissioners. Here they decided that conditions were <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> to send any troops away to Cumberland.|$|E

5|$|Attalus was at {{that time}} {{corresponding}} with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> to leave alive. Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} levels of {{radioactive}} contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> to handle. Even her cookbook is highly radioactive. Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and {{those who wish to}} consult them must wear protective clothing. In her last year, she worked on a book, Radioactivity, which was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, {{camouflage}} {{was partially}} abandoned; for example, glossy anti-flash white was used on aircraft as protection from nuclear flash, including high-flying Royal Air Force nuclear weapon-carrying V-bombers. When SAMs made high level attack <b>too</b> <b>dangerous,</b> {{the plans for}} RAF bombers changed to low level attack and camouflaged top surfaces returned.|$|E
5000|$|Founded in 2008, {{the company}} specializes in complex {{processes}} not previously automated. [...] Universal’s flagship intelligence software, Neocortex, enables robots to perform tasks <b>too</b> costly, <b>dangerous</b> or impossible {{for humans to}} undertake. The technology was funded by DARPA and NASA, and was originally co-developed through a 7-year partnership between NASA and Vanderbilt University and is employed in NASA’s Robonaut.|$|R
50|$|A strong {{advocate}} {{of freedom of}} the press, Wilson published material which other publishers found <b>too</b> politically <b>dangerous,</b> including works by Jeremy Bentham, whose utilitarian tendencies he shared. Other publications included works by William Godwin, Benjamin Disraeli and Robert Owen. After having been a passenger on the first train into London he founded Railway Magazine, the first railway-themed trade journal.|$|R

5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> and {{difficult}} for the explosion of vehicle traffic that occurred after World War II. Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central. However, by 1960 the use of the rails had declined so much that service was stopped. The tracks were lifted two years later.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan has {{recently}} begun {{a relationship with}} an old acquaintance, Nicola (Katherine Parkinson), who is opposed to his investigative career, believing it to be <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> an occupation.

To Jonathan's bemusement, Klaus invests in the 3D pornography industry and begins dating the porn actress Candy Mountains (Jemma Walker).|$|E

25|$|Commercial and {{industrial}} robots {{are now in}} widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans.

25|$|Agesilaus came {{to power}} by {{accident}} {{at the start of}} the 4th century BC. This accidental accession meant that, unlike the other Spartan kings, he had the advantage of a Spartan education. The Spartans at this date discovered a conspiracy against the laws of the city conducted by Cinadon and as a result concluded there were <b>too</b> many <b>dangerous</b> worldly elements at work in the Spartan state.|$|R
5|$|Some Overlords {{remain on}} Earth {{to study the}} {{children}} from a safe distance. When the evolved children mentally alter the Moon's rotation and make other planetary manipulations, it becomes <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> to remain.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} wreck, {{when the rain}} had subsided, Captain Holland sent members of the Rifle Corps and the York and Lancaster Regiment to {{retrieve}} some baggage from the ship, which was stuck on the rocks and had not sunk. The operation was called off at 10:00, when First Lieutenant St. John decided that the wreck was <b>too</b> <b>dangerous.</b> The baggage that had been recovered was taken to shore.|$|E
5|$|The SAR {{task force}} mission leader, Capt. Fred Boli in Sandy 01, called the rescue {{off for the}} time being because it was <b>too</b> <b>dangerous.</b> The {{remaining}} aircraft exited to the south across the Song Meiu Giang. The area was just too hot. Hambleton and Clark would have to spend another night behind the front lines. The North Vietnamese, alerted by the American's intense efforts to find the navigator, increased their efforts to find Hambleton.|$|E

5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition {{was marred by}} much argument between Crowley and the others, who {{thought that he was}} reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings that it was <b>too</b> <b>dangerous.</b> Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E
5|$|Following the attack, Sakonju judged {{that it was}} <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> to {{continue}} the raid as Behars distress message may have alerted the Allies to his force's presence. Accordingly, the Japanese turned back for the NEI that day. The heavy cruisers were again escorted through the Sunda Strait by Kinu, Ōi and five destroyers, and arrived back at the NEI on 15March. During this time, the Behar survivors were held in a small and extremely hot store room on board Tone, and were given little access to food and water, sanitary facilities and exercise.|$|E
5|$|Initial plans {{called for}} the United States Air Force to {{dispatch}} two transport aircraft to Mogadishu International Airport, but diplomats were unable to contact anyone in the Somali government to obtain clearance for the aircraft to land {{at the airport and}} it also became clear that it was <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> to travel from the embassy to the airport. Meanwhile, the USS Guam and USS Trenton began transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu with forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade.|$|E
5000|$|The colonists {{encountered}} {{many different}} types of creatures on Finisterre, but the small ones were often <b>too</b> numerous and <b>dangerous</b> to catalogue and were referred to generically as [...] "ghosties" [...] or [...] "spooks".|$|R

50|$|English {{interest}} languished {{after an}} explosion destroyed the Faversham factory in 1847. Austrian Baron Wilhelm Lenk von Wolfsberg built two guncotton plants producing artillery propellent, but it <b>too</b> was <b>dangerous</b> under field conditions, and guns that could fire thousands of rounds using gunpowder would {{reach the end}} of their service life after only a few hundred shots with the more powerful guncotton. Small arms could not withstand the pressures generated by guncotton.|$|R
5|$|MIND MGMT is a {{government}} agency of spies, formed during or after World War I, who have psychic abilities. Henry Lyme is recruited as a child, and becomes their greatest agent. The work exhausts him, and Lyme is retired to Zanzibar. While there, he has a breakdown and loses control of his abilities, causing the city's inhabitants to murder one another. Lyme decides MIND MGMT is <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> to exist, and flees. In an effort to cover his escape, he accidentally causes everyone aboard a plane with him to develop amnesia.|$|E
5|$|Palomino Sue {{hails from}} Abilene, Texas. Her {{father was a}} wagon master. She arrived at Boys' Ranch after a trip on the wagon her father was driving was intercepted by Indians. She was the only survivor. When expressing a desire to get {{involved}} in fighting, Clay Duncan insists that, because it's <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> for a woman, she must remain at the ranch. She agrees, but her acquiescence was a pretence, as she later joins the fray, offering opportune assistance. Similar scenes recur in her two subsequent appearances in issues #5 and 6.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war with}} Japan began, Wau became an {{evacuation}} centre, receiving refugees from Lae and Salamaua. Non-native {{women and children were}} evacuated while men of military age were called up for service in the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles, the local militia unit. Initially, civilians were evacuated by civilian aircraft but as the Japanese drew closer—bombing Wau on 23 January 1942—it became <b>too</b> <b>dangerous</b> to fly without fighter escort, which was unavailable. This left some 250 European and Asian men stranded. These refugees made a hazardous journey over the Owen Stanley Range on foot by way of Kudjeru and Tekadu to Bulldog, a disused mining settlement where there was an aerodrome, and thence down the Lakekamu River to the sea.|$|E

30|$|Retirement {{is often}} {{looked upon as}} good, a gift, or as a chance of {{escaping}} from the trade-off between income or leisure. In practice, retiring <b>too</b> early is <b>dangerous</b> for the NYO. They are exposed to various risks related to social exclusion.|$|R
