500|$|A Dream Play is {{positioned}} at the median of Strindberg's series of portrayals {{of his own}} marriage, the Bosse role imbued with both light and darkness. With its associative dream structure, this play is a milestone of modernist drama, described by Strindberg as a lawless reflection of The Dreamer's (Strindberg's) consciousness, limited only by his imagination which [...] "spins and weaves new patterns… on an insignificant basis of reality". Agnes, played by and representing Bosse, {{is the daughter of}} the Vedic god Indra, descending to earth to observe human life and bring its disappointments to the attention of her divine father. [...] The [...] "Oriental" [...] aspect of the play is based on Bosse's dark, exotic looks. [...] Yet she is also drawn into mere humanity and into a claustrophobic marriage to The Lawyer, one of the versions of The Dreamer and, <b>thereby,</b> <b>of</b> Strindberg. [...] Shut up indoors by a possessive husband, Agnes can not breathe; she despondently watches the servant working to exclude light and air from the house by pasting insulating strips of paper along the windows' edges. Recognizably, the [...] "insignificant basis of reality" [...] of Agnes' marriage to The Lawyer is the frustration of the newly married Bosse, yearning for fresh air, sunshine, and travel but fobbed off with a Baedeker.|$|E

2500|$|To defeat France Britain put heavy {{pressure}} on the Americans, seizing merchant ships suspected of trading with France, and impressing sailors born in Britain, regardless of their claimed American citizenship. [...] British government agents armed Indian tribes in Canada that were raiding American settlements on the frontier. [...] The Americans felt humiliated and demanded war to restore their honor, despite their complete unpreparedness. The War of 1812 was a minor sideshow to the British, but the American army performed very poorly, {{and was unable to}} successfully attack Canada. In 1813, the Americans took control of Lake [...] Erie and <b>thereby</b> <b>of</b> western Ontario, knocking most of the Indian tribes out of the war. [...] When Napoleon surrendered {{for the first time in}} 1814, three separate forces were sent to attack the Americans in upstate New York, along the Maryland coast (burning Washington but getting repulsed at Baltimore), and up the Mississippi River to a massive defeat at the Battle of New Orleans. [...] Each operation proved a failure with the British commanding generals killed or in disgrace. The war was a stalemate without purpose. A negotiated peace was reached at the end of 1814 that restored the prewar boundaries. [...] British Canada celebrated its deliverance from American rule, Americans celebrated victory in a [...] "second war of independence," [...] and Britain celebrated its defeat of Napoleon. [...] The treaty opened up two centuries of peace and open borders.|$|E
2500|$|Golwalkar, {{who became}} {{the leader of the}} RSS in 1940, {{continued}} and further strengthened the isolation from the independence movement. In his view, the RSS had pledged to achieve freedom through [...] "defending religion and culture" [...] and not by fighting the British. Golwalkar even lamented the anti-British nationalism, calling it a [...] "reactionary view" [...] that had had disastrous effects upon the entire course of the freedom struggle. It is believed that Golwalkar did not want to give the British any excuse to ban the RSS. He complied with all the strictures imposed by the Government during the Second World War, even announcing the termination of the RSS military department. The British Government stated that the RSS was not at all supporting any civil disobedience against them, and as such their other political activities could be overlooked. The British Home Department took note of the fact that speakers at Sangh meetings urged its members to keep aloof from the anti-British movements of the Indian National Congress, which instruction was duly followed.The Home Department was <b>thereby</b> <b>of</b> the opinion that the RSS did not constitute a menace to law and order in British India.The Bombay government, in a report, appreciated the RSS by noting that the Sangh had scrupulously kept itself within the law and refrained from taking part in the disturbances (Quit India Movement) that broke out in August 1942. It also reported that the RSS had not, in any way, infringed upon government orders and had always shown a willingness to comply with the law. The same Bombay Government report further noted that in December 1940, orders had been issued to the provincial RSS leaders to desist from any activities that the British Government considered objectionable, and the RSS, in turn, had assured the British authorities that [...] "it had no intentions of offending against the orders of the Government".|$|E
