During this time Lazzell produced white-line prints and flower monoprints and she taught painting and block printing classes.|$|E

5|$|At age 37, Mary <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> {{attention}} to finding {{a husband and}} producing an heir, which would prevent the Protestant Elizabeth (still next-in-line {{under the terms of}} Henry VIII's will and the Act of Succession of 1544) from succeeding to the throne. Edward Courtenay and Reginald Pole were both mentioned as prospective suitors, but her cousin Charles V suggested she marry his only son, Prince Philip of Spain. Philip had a son from a previous marriage and was heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World. As part of the marriage negotiations, a portrait of Philip, by Titian, was sent to her in September 1553.|$|E

5|$|Between 1925 and {{the late}} 1940s, she logged over 600,000 air-miles {{traveling}} throughout the world, speaking and fund raising {{for the creation of}} a Jewish state. Even during World War II, she received special permission to travel into war-torn areas to evaluate conditions. At the war's end, Silverman <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> efforts toward building infrastructure in the new nation of Israel, but was also involved in philanthropy in her home state of Rhode Island, raising funds for hospitals and mental health organizations.|$|E
5|$|Hollis is {{very much}} aware of Black's {{reputation}} and eager to prove her worth as an investigator. Intrigued by Frank's abilities as an investigator, she strives to learn as much from him as she can, while Frank also learns to recognize her strengths as an FBI agent. The respected, independent, ambitious young Bureau Agent formed a close relationship with Frank Black—and then <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> back on him to join the Millennium Group, which had agreed to cure her father of Alzheimer's.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 1950s, Carson <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> {{attention}} to conservation, especially some problems {{that she believed}} were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, {{which led to a}} nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that {{led to the creation of}} the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter.|$|E

Coulson finds Morrow, to see him attempt an experiment on himself. An energy blast from the experiment makes Coulson, Robbie, and agent Leo Fitz disappear, and Morrow successfully displays the ability to create matter.|$|E
5|$|Marrash {{was famous}} for the salon she held in the home she shared with her husband. She had {{travelled}} to Europe once, and was impressed by what she saw of life there. As related by Joseph Zeidan:Upon her return in Aleppo, Maryana Marrash <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> house into a gathering place {{for a group of}} celebrated writers who met there on a regular basis to cultivate each other's friendship and discuss literature, music, and political and social issues.|$|E
5|$|San {{hunter and}} gatherers, {{ancestors}} of the Khoisani peoples, were the first known inhabitants of the region that is now Mozambique, followed in the 1st and 4th centuries by Bantu-speaking peoples who migrated there across the Zambezi River. In 1498, Portuguese explorers landed on the Mozambican coastline. Portugal's influence in East Africa grew throughout the 16th century; she established several colonies known collectively as Portuguese East Africa. Slavery and gold became profitable for the Europeans; influence was largely exercised through individual settlers {{and there was no}} centralised administration and, in the meantime, Portugal had <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> attention to India and Brazil.|$|E

5|$|She and Leopold {{married in}} a {{religious}} ceremony five days before his death, though their failure to perform a civil ceremony rendered the marriage void under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline numerous properties, items of high material value, Congolese bonds, and other valuable sources of income – all of which <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> into a multimillionaire. For years the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters attempted to recover some of this wealth, with their success varying depending on the case. Caroline died on 12 February 1948 in Cambo-les-Bains, France.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} junking process was halted and the BBC {{established}} its Film and Videotape Library {{for the purpose}} of storage and preservation, archive selector Sue Malden began to audit what material remained in the BBC's stores. When investigations revealed large gaps in the collection, Malden <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> inquiries to the National Film and Television Archive – which promptly returned three full Second Doctor serials– The Dominators, The Krotons, and The War Games, adding seven more episodes and completing two of those serials. These all were standard 16mm film telerecordings with the exception of The Dominators Episode 3, which was a 35mm print.|$|E
5|$|Volia was {{surrendered}} to the Germans in 1918, but {{they were forced to}} turn her over to the British by the terms of the Armistice. The British <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> over to the White Russians in 1919 and they used her to help evacuate the Crimea in 1920. She was interned in Bizerte by the French and ultimately scrapped by them in 1936 to pay her docking fees. Her guns were put into storage and were later used by the Germans and Finns for coastal artillery during World War II. The Finns and the Soviets continued to use them throughout the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Behind this combat, {{other ships}} of the centre {{division}} struck the French line, HMS Valiant under Thomas Pringle passing close to Patriote which pulled away, her crew suffering from contagion {{and unable to}} take their ship into battle. Valiant instead <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> attention on Achille, which had already been raked by Queen Charlotte and Brunswick, and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division. HMS Orion under John Thomas Duckworth and HMS Queen under Admiral Alan Gardner both attacked the same ship, Queen suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Both ships bore down on the French Northumberland, which was soon dismasted and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast. Queen was too slow to engage Northumberland as closely as Orion, and soon fell in with Jemmappes, both ships battering each other severely.|$|E
5|$|French women {{welcomed the}} design but the Catholic Church, some media, and a {{majority}} of the public initially thought the design was risqué or even scandalous. Contestants in the first Miss World beauty pageant wore them in 1951, but the bikini was then banned from the competition. Actress Brigitte Bardot drew attention when she was photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the Cannes Film Festival in 1953. Other actresses, including Rita Hayworth and Ava Gardner, also gathered press attention when they wore bikinis. During the early 1960s, the design appeared on the cover of Playboy and Sports Illustrated, giving it additional legitimacy. Ursula Andress made a huge impact when she emerged from the surf wearing what is now an iconic bikini in the James Bond movie Dr. No (1962). The deer skin bikini Raquel Welch wore in the film One Million Years B.C. (1966) <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> into an international sex symbol and was described as a definitive look of the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|It {{was late}} on 1 August when the British fleet {{appeared}} in the bay, and the French were at anchor in a strong defensive position. The French commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers, did not expect a night attack, but Nelson ordered his ships to form up and attack {{the head of the}} French van, taking advantage of a favourable wind which allowed his ships to drift down the line, while preventing the French rear from reinforcing the van and centre. Bellerophon was the eighth ship in the British line, and as the battle began, Darby <b>turned</b> <b>her</b> towards the French centre, eventually coming to anchor at 7 pm. Possibly due to some error {{on the part of the}} crew or because the anchor had dragged, Bellerophon came to rest alongside the French flagship, the 120-gun Orient.|$|E
