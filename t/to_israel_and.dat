5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Greece {{almost all the}} Jews of Rhodes {{were sent to the}} Auschwitz concentration camp; as a result, most members of Etz Ahayem had close family members who were killed in the Holocaust.

All this, combined with the new regime's general hostility toward religion, made reconstruction of the synagogue nearly impossible.|$|E
