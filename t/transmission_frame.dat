50|$|In 1964, the Tempest was {{redesigned}} as a more-conventional {{vehicle and}} enlarged from a compact to an intermediate-sized {{car with a}} 115 in wheelbase and an overall length of 203 in. The unibody, curved driveshaft and transaxle were gone; they were replaced by a traditional front engine, front <b>transmission,</b> <b>frame</b> and solid rear axle design used by all of GM's other cars, {{with the exception of}} the Corvette and Corvair. Together with its sister cars (the Oldsmobile F-85/Cutlass and Buick Special/Skylark), the Tempest/Le Mans moved to the new A body platform shared with the new Chevrolet Chevelle, and all three cars received updates and modifications standardizing them throughout—including the wheels—by GM edict. The Le Mans name was discontinued as a separate series, so now the cars were, in ascending order, base Tempest, Tempest Custom, and Tempest Le Mans.|$|E

30|$|In the {{approach}} in [2 – 4], the AP centrally coordinates the ACK or NACK <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> of the recipients by transmitting the RAK (Request for ACK) or RNAK (Request for NACK) polling frames to the recipients. For example, {{according to the}} BMMM (Batch Mode Multicast MAC) protocol in [3], the AP coordinates the ACK <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> by transmitting the separate RAK frames to the recipients. In {{the approach}} in [5], the AP reserves the wireless channel for the ACK <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> of the recipients and coordinates the ACK <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> of the recipients in a strictly sequential order. For the channel reservation for the ACK <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions,</b> {{it is assumed that}} the AP knows each ACK <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> time beforehand. However, this assumption cannot be realized generally because the STAs can choose their ACK transmission rates differently according to the wireless channel state. Other approaches in [2, 4, 6 – 8] not based on the AP's polling have also been proposed for the reliable multicast transmission.|$|R

3000|$|For example, {{the phase}} k= 2 {{represents}} the <b>transmission</b> of RTH <b>frames</b> {{and it means}} helper node selection competition. Thus, D_E^ 2 refers to the required time delay for complete failure of the helper node selection procedure. This delay consists of a busy tone signal, HC and EC contention periods, RC slots, and two short CTH <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> in the HC and EC contentions, respectively. Then, the average time delay from the CCTS <b>frame</b> to complete <b>transmission</b> failure can be expressed as a weighted sum of consumed time delays until complete transmission failure in each phase. If complete failure occurs at the phase k= 4, then, <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> at phases 1, 2, and 3 should be successful. Thus, the time delay from the CCTS frame to DATA <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> failure is D_S^ 1 + D_S^ 2 + D_S^ 3 + D_E^ 4. Therefore, the average time delay from the CCTS frame to any <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> failure corresponds to Eq. (21). □ [...]...|$|R
