5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{was shocked}} to learn of the high {{attrition}} rate due to well-trained German snipers. It was common for British regiments to lose five men a day to snipers; he learned that one battalion lost eighteen in a single day. The German snipers could not be located, leaving <b>them</b> <b>free</b> to continue shooting from their place of concealment. He was also dismayed by the poor quality of marksmanship amongst the British troops.|$|E

5|$|The band's {{record deal}} was {{relatively}} poor for the time: a £5,000 advance over five years, low royalties and no free studio time.

5|$|In 1972, Duncan Wood, the BBC's Head of Comedy, {{watched a}} comedy on {{television}} called The Misfit. Impressed by writer Roy Clarke's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom, Wood offered Clarke {{the opportunity to}} write a sitcom. Clarke nearly turned the job down as {{he felt that the}} BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was a dull concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving <b>them</b> <b>free</b> to roam around like adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E
5|$|In July 2013 the Sevenstone project, which {{aimed to}} {{demolish}} and rebuild {{a large part}} of the city centre, and had been on hold since 2009, was further delayed and the company developing it was dropped.

5|$|Washington {{refused to}} allow his slaves to be sold without their permission. This policy was {{economically}} inefficient, resulting in an unnecessarily large work force. In his will, he provided that his slaves should be freed {{after the death of}} his wife. However, Martha chose to free them at the end of 1800, fearing that her life was not safe in their hands because her death would make <b>them</b> <b>free.</b> Most of the former slaves were unable to find suitable work after being freed and lived in poverty. Part of this was due to Virginia passing laws against educating blacks and restricting the rights of free blacks.|$|E

5|$|As summer approached, Đujić's Chetniks {{captured}} Drvar {{from the}} Ustaše. By early summer, he and Chetnik commander Stevo Rađenović had contacted the Italians {{and asked them}} to put a halt to the Ustaše mistreatment of Serbs, enable the return of Serb refugees, and repeal a decree that enabled the confiscation of Serb-owned property in the NDH. The Italians obliged in the hope that doing so would win the Chetniks over to collaboration and seriously weaken any future uprising in the area, which would have further disrupted rail traffic along the Split–Karlovac line. On 13 August, at a meeting in the village of Pađene, Đujić and several other Serb nationalists agreed to collaborate with the Italians. They secretly signed a pact of non-aggression with the Italian military, and in exchange, the Italians acquiesced to Đujić's 3,000 Chetniks operating in and around Knin. On 31 August, at a Drvar assembly, Đujić was given the task of stopping the Italian advance on the town. Immediately afterwards, he made an agreement with the Italians granting <b>them</b> <b>free</b> passage.|$|E

5|$|Hugh was {{suspected}} {{of involvement in}} the Young King's revolt in 1173. He {{does not seem to have}} taken an active part, but King Henry II suspected him of supporting the rebellion. When King William the Lion of Scotland invaded northern England in the spring of 1174, Hugh either connived at the invasion or helped the rebels and the Scottish king. Suspicion fell upon the bishop because he was cautious in defending against the Scottish raids. Hugh also concluded truces with the Scots that allowed <b>them</b> <b>free</b> passage through the ecclesiastical lands in return for no damage being done to those lands. Lastly, the bishop's nephew Hugh IV de Puiset, who was Count of Bar in France, brought an armed force to Hartlepool, supposedly to help defend Hugh, but King Henry feared that this was an attempt to aid the rebellion of the Young King. After the revolt had been put down, King Henry II ordered Hugh's castle of Northallerton destroyed. Hugh also was required to surrender his other castles.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson County War, {{with its}} overtones of class warfare {{coupled with the}} {{intervention}} ordered by the President of the United States to {{save the lives of}} a gang of hired killers and set <b>them</b> <b>free,</b> is not a flattering reflection on the American myth of the west. The Johnson County War {{has been one of the}} best-known range wars of the frontier. It has been a popular feature of the Western genre of fiction, which includes literature, films and television shows. The Banditti of the Plains, written in 1894 by witness Asa Shinn Mercer, is the earliest record of the Johnson County War. The book was suppressed for many years by the WSGA, who seized and destroyed all but a few of the first edition copies from the 1894 printing; they were rumored to have hijacked and destroyed the second printing as it was being shipped from a printer north of Denver, Colorado. The book was reprinted several times in the 20th century and most recently in 2015. Frances McElrath's novel 1902 The Rustler, took inspiration from the Johnson County War, and was sympathetic to the perspective of the small ranchers.|$|E
