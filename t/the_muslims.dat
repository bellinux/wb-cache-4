5|$|In March 624, Muhammad {{led some}} three hundred warriors in {{a raid on}} a Meccan {{merchant}} caravan. <b>The</b> <b>Muslims</b> set an ambush for the caravan at Badr. Aware of the plan, the Meccan caravan eluded <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b> A Meccan force was sent to protect the caravan {{and went on to}} confront <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> upon receiving word that the caravan was safe. The Battle of Badr commenced. Though outnumbered more than three to one, <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> won the battle, killing at least forty-five Meccans with fourteen Muslims dead. They also succeeded in killing many Meccan leaders, including Abu Jahl. Seventy prisoners had been acquired, many of whom were ransomed. Muhammad and his followers saw the victory as confirmation of their faith and Muhammad ascribed the victory as assisted from an invisible host of angels. The Quranic verses of this period, unlike the Meccan verses, dealt with practical problems of government and issues like the distribution of spoils.|$|E

40|$|The Contextualization of KH.

The diversity of <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> community {{has become a challenge}} for its application. In Indonesian, the diversity of mainstream school of thoughts, organizations, and parties have given rise to disintegration of <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> society. <b>The</b> internal conflicts that come out from various reasons is an evident of that disintegration. This paper analyzes KH. Hasyim Asyari’s view concerning <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> unity. <b>The</b> authors find that the idea of <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> unity should be based upon faith and anti-fanatism. It reflects the concordance of faith and could be realized in anti-fanatism attitude in <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> society. <b>The</b> idea of KH Hasyim Asy`ari is perceived of utmost important, for it may become an alternative solution for the social problems...|$|R

5|$|Muhammad had preached the {{religion}} of Islam in Mecca from 613 to 622. He had attracted a small community of followers, but also drew staunch opposition {{from the rest of}} the Quraysh, the tribe that ruled Mecca and to which he belonged. <b>The</b> <b>Muslims</b> fled Mecca in 622 after years of persecution and established themselves at Medina (formerly known as Yathrib; Medina means City). The Quraysh had seized the properties and families of Muslims in Mecca and dispatched caravans to Damascus which <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> intercepted and raided. The Meccans sent out a small army to punish <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> and stop their raiding. At the Battle of Badr in 623, a small Muslim force defeated the much larger Meccan army.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> encamped at the Yarmouk plain, the Byzantine army, preceded by the lightly armed Ghassanids of Jabalah, moved forward and {{established}} strongly fortified camps {{just north of the}} Wadi-ur-Ruqqad.|$|E
5|$|After their {{expulsion}} from Mecca, <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> fought the Meccan Quraysh at the Battle of Badr in 624, {{and at the}} Battle of Uhud in 625. Although <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> neither won nor were defeated at the Battle of Uhud, their military strength was gradually growing. In April 626 Muhammad raised a force of 300 men and 10 horses to meet the Quraysh army of 1,000 at Badr for the second time. Although no fighting occurred, the coastal tribes were impressed with Muslim power. Muhammad also tried, with limited success, to break up many alliances against the Muslim expansion. Nevertheless, {{he was unable to}} prevent the Meccan one.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{territorial}} gains produced by his {{defeat of the}} Persians were lost to the advance of <b>the</b> <b>Muslims,</b> Heraclius still ranks among the great Roman Emperors. His reforms of the government reduced the corruption which had taken hold in Phocas's reign, and he reorganized the military with great success. Ultimately, the reformed Imperial army halted <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> in Asia Minor and held on to Carthage for another 60 years, saving a core from which the empire's strength could be rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Muslim</b> force, now {{numbering}} around 700, {{was stationed}} {{on the slopes}} of Uhud, facing Medina with the rear being protected by the towering mount itself. Before the battle, Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the West side of <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> camp. This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of <b>the</b> outnumbered <b>Muslim</b> army; <b>the</b> archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated {{on the east side of}} <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> camp. Protecting <b>the</b> flanks of <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> camp, and thus <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.|$|R

5|$|Despite his {{contacts}} with the imperials, Euphemius was now willing to serve as their guide, evidently hoping that <b>the</b> <b>Muslims,</b> humbled by their failure and without the strong will of Asad to guide them, could now be made to serve his purposes. After Mineo surrendered, the Muslim army divided in two: one part took Agrigento in the west, while the other, along with Euphemius, attacked Enna. The garrison of Enna began negotiations, offering to acknowledge Euphemius' authority, but when Euphemius with a small escort met with their emissaries, he was murdered. It is unknown what happened to Euphemius' supporters after his death, whether they dispersed or continued fighting alongside <b>the</b> <b>Muslims.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the duels, general {{engagement}} {{between the}} two armies commenced. Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> swept through their ranks. The Meccan army was pushed back, and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were negated by the Muslim archers. Enjoying {{the best of these}} early encounters, <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> pierced through the Meccan lines, with victory appearing certain. However, it was the detachment of the Muslim archers, disobeying Muhammad's strict orders to remain stationary, that would shift the outcome of the battle, as they ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|In 837, a Muslim army under Abd al-Salam ibn Abd al-Wahhab {{attacked}} Enna, but {{was defeated}} by the Byzantines, and Abd al-Salam himself was taken prisoner. <b>The</b> <b>Muslims</b> responded by reinforcing their position around Enna, which they placed under siege. During the following winter, one of the besiegers discovered an unguarded path leading to the town, allowing <b>the</b> <b>Muslims</b> to take the entire lower town. The Byzantines however managed to maintain control of the citadel, and after negotiations secured a Muslim withdrawal {{in exchange for a}} large ransom.|$|E
50|$|On 24 January 1946, the Coalition Government {{declared}} both <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> National Guard and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh illegal organizations.

Ghazarfar Ali opposed the Government decision contending that a ban on <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> National Guard was {{a ban on the}} most important activities of <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> League. On 14 August 1946, two days before the Direct Action Day started in Kolkata, the members of <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> National Guards were called upon to assemble at <b>the</b> <b>Muslim</b> Institute at 8-30 A.M. in the morning.

5|$|In October 1942, Popovac {{issued an}} appeal to Muslim Partisans, urging them to join the Chetniks and turn against the Ustaše.

5|$|In {{the same}} period, the Sicilian Muslims also {{established}} footholds in the Italian mainland. <b>The</b> <b>Muslims</b> {{were asked to}} assist the beleaguered Duchy of Naples against Sicard of Benevento in 839, but then they sacked Brindisi and, following Sicard's murder and the outbreak of {{civil war in the}} Principality of Benevento, seized Tarentum in 840 and Bari in 847, which they made their bases.
