5|$|Dietrich's other {{argument}} {{was that the}} <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> should have used discretionary powers and granted an adjournment until Dietrich was able to provide counsel himself, and that the {{failure to do so}} caused a miscarriage of justice. Dietrich had asked the <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> for an adjournment during the trial, but the judge said that since more than a year had passed since the offence occurred, it was {{in the interests of the}} community that the matter be dealt with promptly.|$|E
5|$|If the <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> erroneously {{permits the}} {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If the <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The {{race of the}} defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E
5|$|The court {{concluded}} that the <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> had erred in not exercising his discretion to bar the evidence from being admitted, {{although it was not}} necessary to decide the point.|$|E

[...] The sentencing decisions of California <b>trial</b> <b>judges,</b> just as those of federal <b>trial</b> <b>judges,</b> were subject to review for [...] "reasonableness." ...|$|R

5|$|The <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> has an {{obligation}} to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire {{on the subject of the}} juror's potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, the <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two unlisted witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E

5|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision, the three judges {{decided that the}} appeal should be allowed (more specifically, that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal heard and allowed instanter– at once), {{on the basis that}} the 8March 2003 interview was not voluntary and so was inadmissible, and by admitting it the <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> had made an error of law resulting in a miscarriage of justice.|$|E
5|$|Taw {{appealed to}} the High Court against his {{conviction}} on two main grounds. The first involved the admissibility of evidence for his corruption, and, additionally, inconsistencies of such evidence. The second concerned constitutional issues. With regard to the evidential issue, the Court held that the <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> made an error in accepting GIC's statements as admissible, and thus ordered Taw's convictions to be set aside.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} first {{heard in the}} District Court. The appellants contended {{by way of a}} {{preliminary}} objection that Order 123 was ultra vires, or beyond the powers, of the UPA and contravened Article 15(1) of the Constitution of Singapore, which enshrines the right to freedom of religion. The <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> dismissed the preliminary objection, holding that Order 123 was valid and constitutional, as the order concerned the public interest and was permitted under s 3(1) of the UPA. Accordingly, the appellants were convicted for possession of the banned publications. They appealed to the High Court against the trial judge's decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{defendants}} argued: (1) {{that the}} indictment {{should have been}} quashed because {{of the absence of}} women from the grand jury; (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court; (3) that the indictment was duplicitous, inconsistent, and vague; (4) that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict; (5) that the <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> should have granted a continuance, rather than appoint Stewart to represent Kretske; (6) that Roth should have been severed from the other defendants; (7) that the reports of the Alcohol Tax Unit were hearsay; (7) that the two government exhibits not admitted into evidence were sent to the jury during its deliberations; (8) that Glasser had been cross-examined on matters not pertinent to the charge and not within the scope of his direct examination; (9) that the cross-examination of U.S. Attorney Campbell had been unduly restricted; (10) that evidence beyond the scope of the bill of particulars had been introduced; (11) that there was insufficient corroboration of the accomplice testimony against Kretske; (12) that certain testimony of Alexander Campbell was erroneously admitted; (13) that the admission of various prejudicial evidence had the cumulative effect of denying the defendants a fair trial; (14) that the trial judge's cross-examination of witnesses and other comments crossed the line into advocacy; and (15) that the <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> should have granted a new trial because of the exclusion of women from the jury pool.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} in the High Court decided that {{although there was no}} right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, in some cases representation is appropriate to ensure a fair trial. Although judges no longer have the power to appoint counsel for an accused, since that function has been largely taken over by legal aid agencies, a <b>trial</b> <b>judge</b> should use their power to adjourn a case if it is in the interests of fairness that an accused have representation, which would encourage the legal aid agencies to provide counsel.|$|E
5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had already been involved, Napier as {{presiding}} judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the <b>trial</b> <b>judge.</b> This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias {{from the likes of}} the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and that it could have shaken public confidence on the fairness of the hearing.|$|E
5|$|At trial, crucial {{testimony}} {{came from}} Chi Omega sorority members Connie Hastings, who placed Bundy {{in the vicinity}} of the Chi Omega House that evening, and Nita Neary, who saw him leaving the sorority house clutching the oak murder weapon. Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds Bundy had inflicted on Lisa Levy's left buttock, which forensic odontologists Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to castings of Bundy's teeth. The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979 of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first degree murder (for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary. <b>Trial</b> <b>judge</b> Edward Cowart imposed death sentences for the murder convictions.|$|E
