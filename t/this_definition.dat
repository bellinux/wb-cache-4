5|$|The first {{academic}} {{accounts of}} the Nanking Massacre included as massacre victims all Chinese who {{were killed by the}} Japanese Army in and around Nanking, including Chinese soldiers who were killed in action. <b>This</b> <b>definition</b> was supported by Hora and other early scholars. In 1986 Ikuhiko Hata became the first historian to call <b>this</b> <b>definition</b> into question. Hata argued that Chinese troops killed on the battlefield were part of the Battle of Nanking rather than Nanking Massacre, and that only civilians and disarmed POWs should be counted as massacre victims.|$|E

5|$|A broad {{operational}} definition is sometimes used {{to encompass the}} complexity of these diverse phenomena, where a gene {{is defined as a}} union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. <b>This</b> <b>definition</b> categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or RNA) rather than their specific DNA loci, with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions.|$|E

5|$|From 1927–28 onwards, {{one year}} after the NHL {{expanded}} to two divisions in 1926, the Cup was awarded to the winner of the Canadian Division, while the Prince of Wales Trophy was awarded to the winner of the American Division.

5|$|The CGS {{absolute}} unit {{of electric}} current, the abampere, had been {{defined in terms}} of the force between two parallel current-carrying wires in 1881. In the 1940s, the International Electrotechnical Commission adopted an MKS variant of <b>this</b> <b>definition</b> for the ampere, which was adopted in 1948 by the CGPM.|$|E
5|$|There {{is another}} {{concrete}} definition of evenness: if {{the objects in}} a set can be placed into two groups of equal size, then the number of objects is even. <b>This</b> <b>definition</b> {{is equivalent to the}} first one. Again, zero is even because the empty set can be divided into two groups of zero items each.|$|E

5|$|A further twelve bodies, pending {{refinements}} {{of knowledge}} regarding their physical properties, were possible candidates {{to join the}} list under <b>this</b> <b>definition.</b> Some objects in this second list were more likely eventually to be adopted as 'planets' than others. Despite what had been claimed in the media, the proposal did not necessarily leave the Solar System with only twelve planets. Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna and Eris, has said that at least 53 known bodies in the Solar System probably fit the definition, and that a complete survey would probably reveal more than 200.|$|E
5|$|Another {{definition}} sees {{language as}} a formal system of signs governed by grammatical rules of combination to communicate meaning. <b>This</b> <b>definition</b> stresses that human languages {{can be described as}} closed structural systems consisting of rules that relate particular signs to particular meanings. This structuralist view of language was first introduced by Ferdinand de Saussure, and his structuralism remains foundational for many approaches to language.|$|E
5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ardhacheda {{has been defined as}} the number of times a given number can be divided evenly by two. <b>This</b> <b>definition</b> gives rise to a function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it is different for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, the International Conference on Weights and Measures {{redefined the}} meter {{in terms of}} a red cadmium {{spectral}} line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths). <b>This</b> <b>definition</b> has since been changed (see krypton). At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the length of a meter until 1960, when at the General Conference on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.|$|E
5|$|In a {{revision}} of basal Dinosauria, Padian and May (1993) discussed {{the definition of the}} clade, and redefined it as the latest common ancestor of Triceratops and birds. They also discussed what <b>this</b> <b>definition</b> would do to the most basal taxa, such as Herrerasauridae, and Eoraptor. Padian and May considered that since both Herrerasauridae and Eoraptor lack many diagnostic features of Saurischia or Ornithischia, that they could not be considered inside Dinosauria.|$|E

5|$|In clade-based phylogenetic taxonomy, Ceratopsia {{is often}} defined {{to include all}} marginocephalians {{more closely related to}} Triceratops than to Pachycephalosaurus. Under <b>this</b> <b>definition,</b> the most basal known ceratopsians are Yinlong, from the Late Jurassic Period, along with Chaoyangsaurus and the family Psittacosauridae, from the Early Cretaceous Period, all of which were {{discovered}} in northern China or Mongolia. The rostral bone and flared jugals are already present in all of these forms, indicating that even earlier ceratopsians remain to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Specialised {{terms are}} used in taxonomic research. Primary {{homology}} is the initial hypothesis made by a researcher based on similar structure or anatomical connections, inferring that two characters share an ancestry. Secondary homology is implied by parsimony analysis, where a character that only occurs once on a tree is taken to be homologous. As implied in <b>this</b> <b>definition,</b> many cladists consider homology to be synonymous with synapomorphy, a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of a transition metal, as given by IUPAC, is an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell.

The IUPAC definition therefore excludes group 12, comprising zinc, cadmium and mercury, from the transition metals category.|$|E
