5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sailor</b> {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. <b>The</b> <b>sailor</b> explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. <b>The</b> <b>sailor</b> climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E

5|$|The later {{accounts}} of Prester John borrowed heavily from literary texts concerning the East, including the great body of ancient and medieval geographical and travel literature. Details were often lifted from literary and pseudohistorical accounts, {{such as the}} tale of Sinbad <b>the</b> <b>Sailor.</b> The Alexander romance, a fabulous account of Alexander the Great's conquests, was especially influential in this regard.|$|E

5|$|In November 1922, U.S. Customs Service agents, {{seized a}} cache of Colt {{magazine}} guns aboard President Arthur. The entire crew was questioned but all denied any knowledge of the eight weapons found stowed behind a bulkhead.

The ship's doctor and nurse attended to <b>the</b> <b>sailor</b> but were unable to save him.|$|E
5|$|Je Me Souviens was {{published}} in 1910, after Vivien's death. That same year, Barney published Actes et Entr'actes (Acts and Interludes), {{a collection of short}} plays and poems. One of the plays was Equivoque (Ambiguity), a revisionist version on the legend of Sappho's death: Instead of throwing herself off a cliff for the love of Phaon <b>the</b> <b>sailor,</b> she does so out of grief that Phaon is marrying the woman she loves. The play incorporates quotations from Sappho's fragments, with Barney's own footnotes in Greek.|$|E

5|$|The film {{is based}} on an American sailor who comes to the Yamaki family after his ship wrecks in the ocean. <b>The</b> <b>sailor</b> (Borzage) falls in love with the {{daughter}} (Aoki) of the family, unaware {{of the fact that she}} is cursed by God, such that if she marries, a nearby volcano will erupt and destroy the entire island on which the family lives. Writer and producer Thomas H. Ince got the idea for the film from the volcanic eruption on the island of Sakura-Jima in 1914. Hayakawa was paid $500 a week, the highest paid of all oriental stars at the time.|$|E
5|$|Tragedy did strike Marblehead {{though in}} November 1942.

5|$|After the Copts {{converted}} to Christianity {{in the first}} centuries AD, their Coptic Christian literature became separated from the pharaonic and Hellenistic literary traditions. Nevertheless, scholars speculate that ancient Egyptian literature, perhaps in oral form, influenced Greek and Arabic literature. Parallels are drawn between the Egyptian soldiers sneaking into Jaffa hidden in baskets to capture {{the city in the}} story Taking of Joppa and the Mycenaean Greeks sneaking into Troy inside the Trojan Horse. The Taking of Joppa has also been compared to the Arabic story of Ali Baba in One Thousand and One Nights. It has been conjectured that Sinbad <b>the</b> <b>Sailor</b> may have been inspired by the pharaonic Tale of the shipwrecked sailor. Some Egyptian literature was commented on by scholars of the ancient world. For example, the Jewish Roman historian Josephus (37â€“c. 100 AD) quoted and provided commentary on Manetho's historical texts.|$|E
50|$|From {{that point}} on, <b>the</b> <b>Sailors</b> demise began. They played one more {{season in the}} IHL before {{dropping}} to the amateur ranks in the OHA Senior A Hockey League.

5|$|After {{trekking}} {{across the}} desert and nearly dying of dehydration, Tintin and Haddock are rescued and taken to a French outpost, where they hear on the radio the storm sunk the Karaboudjan. They travel to a Moroccan port, {{and along the way}} are attacked by Tuareg tribesmen, defending themselves with French MAS-36 rifles. At the port, members of his old crew kidnap the Captain after he recognises their disguised Karaboudjan. Tintin meets Thomson and Thompson who got his message, and they learn that the wealthy merchant Omar ben Salaad sold the crab tins; Tintin tells Thomson and Thompson to discreetly investigate. Tintin tracks down the gang and saves the Captain, but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains. Haddock chases a gang-member from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in Salaad's house. Upon sobering up, Tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the now-subdued owner of the wine cellar, Omar ben Salaad, and realizes that he {{is the leader of the}} drug cartel. Allan steals a boat and tries escaping, but Tintin captures him. The police arrest the gang and free the Japanese man, who introduces himself as Bunji Kuraki, a police detective who was trying to warn Tintin of the group he was up against. He had been investigating <b>the</b> <b>sailor</b> on Haddock's crew who drowned; <b>the</b> <b>sailor</b> was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated. Turning on the radio, Tintin learns that, thanks to him, the entire organisation of the Crab with the Golden Claws is behind bars.|$|E
5|$|At the Corporatie, Vandersteen met a {{colleague}} whose wife worked at Bravo, a weekly Flemish comics magazine that appeared since 1936 {{and had a}} French-language version since 1940. Due to the war conditions, they were desperately in need of local artists to replace the American comics they used to publish. Led by established Walloon illustrator Jean Dratz, a young team was gathered, with artists like Edgar P. Jacobs and Jacques Laudy. Vandersteen joined in 1943, and here his comics career really took off. First he created Tori, a reprise of the prehistoric Tor, and {{a few weeks later}} his new comic Simbat de Zeerover (Simbat <b>the</b> <b>Sailor)</b> was published on the cover and in colour, a first for Vandersteen.|$|E
5|$|The {{flooding}} on Mangaia {{was regarded}} as the worst in almost 50years, as nearly the entire island was affected. According to locals, the ocean surrounding the island became red at one point due {{to the amount of}} soil being washed out to sea. Despite initial reports that the local water supply was contaminated, the International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) stated that it was safe to drink and there was a sufficient amount for all of the islands' 744 residents. Offshore, a sailboat was severely damaged by large swells produced by the storm and {{was on the verge of}} sinking. <b>The</b> <b>sailor</b> managed to secure the vessel and make it safely to shore.|$|E

50|$|With <b>the</b> <b>sailors</b> driven back, <b>the</b> Quakers {{retreated into}} the Courthouse, bolting the doors behind themselves. The Anglicans, {{apparently}} believing {{one or more}} of <b>the</b> <b>sailors</b> was being held hostage, regrouped to attack the Courthouse.|$|R
5|$|The mutineers {{issued a}} lengthy list of demands, {{that ranged from}} longer periods of leave to and end to the war, based on the United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. The {{following}} day, many of the mutinous ships abandoned the effort and rejoined loyalist forces in the inner harbor; first the light cruisers {{and most of the}} torpedo boats escaped from the guns of the mutineers, followed by several of the other larger vessels. By late in the day, only the men aboard Sankt Georg and a handful of destroyers and torpedo boats remained in rebellion. Only on the morning of 3 February, after the arrival of the s of the III Division, were the last of the mutineers convinced to surrender. Trials on the ringleaders commenced quickly, and four men were executed, including <b>the</b> <b>sailor</b> who had shot Sankt Georgs commander.|$|E
5|$|After the action, {{one of the}} English privateers quarrelled {{with one}} of his French shipmates and stabbed him in the back, killing him. Before a riot between the French and English sailors could begin, Morgan arrested the English sailor, and promised the French sailors that the man would be hanged on his return to Port Royal. Morgan kept his word and <b>the</b> <b>sailor</b> was hanged. After {{dividing}} the spoils of the conquest of Puerto Principe, Morgan announced a plan to attack Porto Bello (now in modern-day Panama). The city was the third largest and strongest on the Spanish Main, and on one of the main routes of trade between the Spanish territories and Spain. Because {{of the value of the}} goods passing through its port, Porto Bello was protected by two castles in the harbour and another in the town. The 200 French privateers, unhappy with the division of the treasure and the murder of their countryman, left Morgan's service and returned to Tortuga. Morgan and his ships briefly landed at Port Royal before leaving for Porto Bello.|$|E
5|$|Broke himself led {{a charge}} against {{a number of}} the Americans who had managed to rally on the forecastle. Three American sailors, {{probably}} from the rigging, descended and attacked him. Taken by surprise, he killed the first, but the second hit him with a musket which stunned him, whilst the third sliced open his skull with his sabre, knocking him to the deck. Before <b>the</b> <b>sailor</b> could finish Broke off, the American was bayoneted by a British Marine named John Hill. Shannons crew rallied to the defence of their captain and carried the forecastle, killing the remaining Americans. Broke sat, dizzied and weak, on a carronade slide, and his head was bound up by William Mindham, who used his own neckerchief. One of Shannons lieutenants, Provo Wallis, believed that Broke's three assailants were probably British deserters. The desperate and violent attempt on Broke's life made by these men may have been motivated {{by the fact that they}} faced the death penalty under the Royal Navy's Articles of War as deserters. Meanwhile, Shannons First Lieutenant, Mr George T. L. Watt, had attempted to hoist the British colours over Chesapeakes, but this was misinterpreted aboard Shannon, and he was hit in the forehead by grapeshot and killed as he did so.|$|E
60|$|Now {{that the}} danger {{was over the}} lads found that they were hungry, and called upon <b>the</b> <b>sailors</b> to bring out what food the craft afforded.

Jasper, the 'pot boy' at the local inn, serves drinks to some of <b>the</b> <b>sailors.</b> Jasper is very {{interested}} in Pineapple Poll, but she haughtily rejects his proferred love.|$|R
50|$|The fourth {{movement}} of the cantata depicts a sea voyage bringing Nicolas to Palestine. During this voyage, a mighty storm assails the ship, perhaps as punishment to <b>the</b> faithless <b>sailors</b> who have mocked the pious saint. The storm is terrifying, and <b>the</b> <b>sailors</b> despair. Amidst <b>the</b> violent winds, waves, and rain, Nicolas gathers <b>the</b> <b>sailors</b> in prayer, and the storm subsides.|$|R
