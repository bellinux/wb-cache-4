40|$|Evolution {{of remote}} sensing sensors {{technologies}} is presented, {{with emphasis on}} its suitability in observing the polar regions. The extent of influence of polar regions on the global climate and vice versa is the spearhead of climate change research. The extensive cover of sea ice has major impacts on the atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial and marine ecosystems of the polar regions in particular and teleconnection on other processes elsewhere. Sea ice covers vast areas of the polar oceans, ranging from ~ 18 × 10 6 km 2 to ~ 23 × 10 6 km 2, combined for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. However, both polar regions are witnessing contrasting rather contradicting effects of climate change. The Arctic sea ice extent is declining {{at a rate of}} 0. 53 × 10 6 km 2 ·decade – 1, whereasAntarcticaexhibits a positive trend at the rate of 0. 167 × 10 6 km 2 ·decade – 1. This work reviews literature published in the field of sea ice remote sensing, to evaluate and access success and failures of different sensors to observe physical features of sea ice. The chronological development series of different sensors on different satellite systems, sensor specifications and datasets are examined and how they have evolved to meet the growing needs of users is outlined. Different remote sensing technology and observational methods and their suitability to observe specific sea ice property are also discussed. A pattern has emerged, which shows that microwave sensors are inherently superior to visible and infrared in monitoring seasonal and annual changes in sea ice. Degree of successes achieved through remote sensing techniques by various investigators has been compared. Some technologies appear to work better under certain conditions than others, and it is now well accepted that there is no algorithm that is ideal globally. Contribution of Indian remote sensing satellites is also reviewed in the context of polar research. <b>This</b> <b>review</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>different</b> primary datasets for further research on sea ice features (sea ice extent, ice type, sea ice thickness, etc.). This work also examines past achievements and how far these capabilities have evolved and tap into current state of art/direction of sensor technologies. Effective monitoring and syntheses of past few decade s of research pinpoint useful datasets for sea ice monitoring, thereby avoiding wastage of resources to find practical datasets to monitor these physically inaccessible regions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular {{functions}} {{are controlled by}} neural factors, temperature, hormones, etc., Of these, neural factors primarily concern the autonomic nervous system, which {{plays a major role}} in maintaining and regulating cardiac functions, e. g., blood pressure and heart rate. Prāṇāyāma is one of the most important yogic practices. There are various review articles on Yoga and its effects but, though Prāṇāyāma is a part of yoga, there is lack of review articles. To the best of our knowledge there is no known review article on effect of various Prāṇāyāma on cardiovascular and autonomic variables. To provide a general overview about the effect of various prāṇāyāma (breathing techniques) on cardiovascular and autonomic variables. A narrative review was performed based on the available scientific literature. An electronic data search was performed in Medline/PubMed database to review relevant articles, using keywords such as “Prāṇāyāma, Yogic breathing techniques, Unilateral nostril breathing, Alternate nostril breathing, Kapalbhati, Bhastrika and Bhramari Pranayama”. All the relevant articles published from 1988 to 06 - 04 - 2016 were included in <b>this</b> <b>review.</b> Slow type of yogic breathing technique was reported to produce beneficial effect on cardiovascular and autonomic variables while fast breathing techniques do not produce such effects. There is lack of consistency in the results of specific nostril yogic breathing techniques and the mechanisms behind the effects of various prāṇāyāma. <b>This</b> <b>review</b> <b>suggests</b> that <b>different</b> types of Prāṇāyāma techniques produce different effects and the mechanisms behind these effects are not fully understood...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{replacement}} therapy {{has been tested}} clinically in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD), epilepsy, spinal cord injury, and stroke. The clinical outcomes have been variable, perhaps {{partly because of the}} differing levels of preclinical, basic experimental evidence that was available prior to the trials. The most promising results have been seen in PD trials, with encouraging ones in HD. A common feature of most trials is that they have concentrated on the biological and technical aspects of transplantation without presupposing that the outcomes might be influenced by events after the surgery. The growing evidence of plasticity demonstrated by the brain and grafts in response to environmental and training stimuli such as rehabilitation interventions has been mostly neglected throughout the clinical application of cell therapy. <b>This</b> <b>review</b> <b>suggests</b> that a <b>different</b> approach may be required to maximize recovery: postoperative experiences, including rehabilitation with explicit behavioral retraining, could have marked direct as well as positive secondary effects on the integration and function of grafted cells in the host neural system. The knowledge gained about brain plasticity following brain damage needs to be linked with what we know about promoting intrinsic recovery processes and how this can boost neurobiological and surgical strategies for repair at the clinical level. With proof of principle now established, a rich area for innovative research with profound therapeutic application is open for investigation...|$|R

40|$|SummaryIntroductionDespite {{widespread}} prescription, {{the efficacy}} of short-burst oxygen therapy has not been established. AimTo systematically review the available evidence for short-burst oxygen therapy in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). MethodRetrieval of randomized-controlled trials comparing short-burst oxygen (oxygen for breathlessness at rest, before exercise and after exercise) with placebo in patients with COPD. Data were extracted and, where possible, outcome measures were combined using RevMan analyses 4. 2. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed using the PEDro scale. ResultsStudies differed in the type of exercise test used, the amount of oxygen delivered and in the length of time for pre- or post-dosing. Quality of the included studies as rated by the PEDro scale was good. For many outcome measures, data could not be pooled for meta-analysis. Short-burst oxygen is primarily indicated for the symptomatic relief of breathlessness, and the bulk of evidence from <b>this</b> <b>review</b> <b>suggests</b> that short-burst oxygen therapy does not reduce breathlessness. For secondary outcome measures (exercise capacity, oxygen saturation [SaO 2], other ventilatory parameters), the results are not consistent. ConclusionThe studies in <b>this</b> <b>review</b> <b>suggest</b> that the widespread prescription of short-burst oxygen is not evidence-based. If prescription is to continue, the scientific rationale for short-burst oxygen therapy must be established...|$|R
