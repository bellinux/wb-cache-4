50|$|After his {{competition}} career, Salazar {{moved into}} coaching. By 1996 this included middle distance runner Mary Decker, {{who at the}} age of 37 qualified for the 5000 meters at the Atlanta Olympics. However, a urine test taken in June at the Olympic Trials showed a <b>testosterone</b> <b>to</b> <b>epitestosterone</b> (T/E) <b>ratio</b> greater than the allowable maximum of six to one. While Decker and her lawyers contended that the T/E ratio test is unreliable for women in their late 30s who are taking birth control pills, she was eliminated in the heats at the Olympics. In June 1997, the IAAF banned Decker from competition. Later reinstated by a USATF panel, the IAAF cleared her to compete but took the case to arbitration. In April 1999, the arbitration panel ruled against her, after which the IAAF through a retroactive ban stripped her of a silver medal she had won in the 1500 meters at the 1997 World Indoor Championships.|$|R
40|$|Profiling androgens in urine samples {{is used in}} doping {{analysis}} {{for the detection of}} abused steroids of endogenous origin. These profiling techniques were originally developed for the analysis of testosterone, mostly by means of the <b>ratio</b> of <b>testosterone</b> <b>to</b> <b>epitestosterone</b> (T/E <b>ratio).</b> A study was performed on the influence of alcohol consumption on the T/E ratio. The applied dose increased the ratio of both males and females and it showed that, under the studied conditions, the risk of a positive doping test was realistic during the first 12 hours after the start of consumption. Today, profiling techniques based on androgens are also applied for the analysis of so-called food supplement steroids. The increasing number of steroids marketed as food supplement or occurring as impurity in supplement formulations, increases the need for analytical methodology to identify the administered substance with adequate sensitivity and specificity. This study shows that profiling oxygenated steroids can provide such specificity, as illustrated for the model compounds dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androst- 4 -ene- 3, 17 -dione. The same methodology could be applied for other food supplement steroids...|$|R

Candidate mechanisms include disruptions of brain networks with {{high concentrations of}} androgen receptors and critically involved in emotional and cognitive regulation. Here, we tested the effects of AAS on resting-state functional brain connectivity in the largest sample of AAS-users to date. We collected resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data from 151 males engaged in heavy resistance strength training. 50 users tested positive for AAS based on the <b>testosterone</b> <b>to</b> <b>epitestosterone</b> (T/E) <b>ratio</b> and doping substances in urine. 16 previous users and 59 controls tested negative. We estimated brain network nodes and their time-series using ICA and dual regression and defined connectivity matrices as the between-node partial correlations. In line with the emotional and behavioral consequences of AAS, current users exhibited reduced functional connectivity between key nodes involved in emotional and cognitive regulation, in particular reduced connectivity between the amygdala and default-mode network (DMN) and between the dorsal attention network (DAN) and a frontal node encompassing the superior and inferior frontal gyri (SFG/IFG) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), with further reductions as a function of dependency, lifetime exposure, and cycle state (on/off) ...|$|R
40|$|Background. Doping {{involves}} the use of substances and methods prohibited by international and national sports institutions. The use of certain substances and methods is harmful to the human organism, so all sports organisations are trying to protect athletes from the harmful side effects of such substances and methods. Methods. The article deals with special protocol, which is used in the case, when the testosterone/epitestosterone ratio in urine is higher than 6 and less then 10.  When establishing the use of testosterone or analogues, ketoconazol is used. If after the application the presence of a <b>testosterone</b> (T) <b>to</b> <b>epitestosterone</b> (E) <b>ratio</b> is greater than six (6) to one (1), there is an evidence of doping offence. Conclusions. In the case of T/E greater than 6, it is mandatory that the relevant medical authority conducts an investigation before the sample is declared positive. A full report should be written and should include a review of previous tests, subsequent tests and any results of endocrine investigations. </p...|$|R
40|$|The steroid module of the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP), {{the newest}} {{innovation}} in doping testing, {{is currently being}} finalized for implementation. Several factors, other than doping, can affect the longitudinal steroid profile. In this study we investigated the effect of hormonal contraceptives {{as well as the}} effect of three polymorphisms on female steroid profiles in relation to doping controls. The study population consisted of 79 female elite athletes between the ages of 18 to 45. Hormonal contraceptives were used by 32 % of the subjects. A full urinary steroid profile was obtained using World Anti-Doping Agency accredited methods. In addition all subjects were genotyped for copy number variation of UGT 2 B 17 and SNPs in UGT 2 B 7 and CYP 17. Subjects using hormonal contraceptives excreted 40 % less <b>epitestosterone</b> as compared <b>to</b> non-users (p = 0. 005) but showed no difference in testosterone excretion. When removing individuals homozygous for the deletion in UGT 2 B 17, the <b>testosterone</b> <b>to</b> <b>epitestosterone</b> (T/E) <b>ratio</b> was 29 % higher in the hormonal contraceptives group (p = 0. 016). In agreement with previous findings in men, copy number variation of UGT 2 B 17 had significant effect on female urinary testosterone excretion and therefore also the T/E ratio. Subjects homozygous for the T allele of CYP 17 showed a lower urinary epitestosterone concentration than the other CYP 17 genotypes. It is of great importance that the athlete’s steroidal passport can compensate for all possible normal variability in steroid profiles from women. Therefore, considering the large impact of hormonal contraceptives on female steroid profiles, we suggest that the use of hormonal contraceptives should be a mandatory question on the doping control form...|$|R

The ranges of mean T/E values for the four urines estimated by peak area (PA) were 0. 32 - 0. 42, 0. 72 - 0. 94, 0. 91 - 1. 14 and 3. 19 - 5. 48. The analyses of variance for these data and for the peak height (PH) data were significant for the laboratory factor (p < 0. 0001). In addition there was a significant interaction between the urine factor and the laboratory factor which indicates the complexity of the analysis. T/E calculated using PA was not significantly different from that using PH. For within-laboratory precision all values for PH and PA were < 8. 3 %, and for between-laboratory precision all values were < 11. 7 % except for one (20. 1 %).

A value greater than six indicates possible T administration or a naturally elevated ratio. It has been shown previously that the carbon isotope ratio of urinary T changes after T administration. In this study a potential confirmation method for T abuse was optimized. Gas chromatography/combustion/carbon isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS) was used to analyze two T precursors (cholesterol and 5 -androsten- 3 beta, 17 beta-diol) and two T metabolites (5 alpha- and 5 beta-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol) in addition to T itself in each of 25 blind urines collected from eight healthy men before, during or after T administration. The carbon isotope ratios of T and the metabolites were lower after T administration. The relationships among the variables were studied using multivariate analysis and beginning with principal components analysis; cluster analysis revealed that the data are composed of two clusters, and classified the samples obtained after T administration in one cluster and the remainder in the other; discriminant analysis correctly identified T users.

40|$|Human {{chorionic}} gonadotrophin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone which {{is produced in}} large amounts during pregnancy and also by certain types of tumour. The biological action of hCG is identical to that of luteinizing hormone, although the former has a much longer plasma half-life. Some male athletes use pharmaceutical preparations of hCG <b>to</b> stimulate <b>testosterone</b> production before competition and/or to prevent testicular shutdown and atrophy during and after prolonged courses of androgen administration. Testosterone administration can be detected by measuring the ratio of concentrations of <b>testosterone</b> <b>to</b> <b>epitestosterone</b> (T/E). An athlete is often considered to have failed a drug test if the urinary T/E ratio is greater than 6. In contrast, hCG administration stimulates the endogenous production of both testosterone and epitestosterone without increasing the urinary T/E ratio above normal values. Although the administration of hCG was banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1987, no definitive test for hCG has {{been approved by the}} IOC. Currently, the only way of measuring small concentrations of hCG is by immunoassay, and this does not have a discriminating power as great as gas-liquid chromatography with mass-spectrometry which is necessary to satisfy IOC requirements.

Our previous studies reveal that carbon isotope ratio helps to determine the origin of the urinary T because the values for T and its metabolites decrease after the administration of exogenous T. In this study, we present a rapid and efficient screening sample preparation method based on three successive liquid-solid extractions, deconjugation with E. coli beta-glucuronidase after the first extraction, acetylation after the second extraction, and a final extraction of the acetates. The 13 C/ 12 C of two T metabolites (5 beta-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol and 5 alpha-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol) and one pregnanediol as endogenous reference (5 beta-pregnane- 3 alpha, 20 alpha-diol) was measured by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) on 10 ml of urine collected from 10 healthy men before and after T administration. Following T administration, the 13 C/ 12 C of 5 beta-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol diacetate and 5 alpha-androstane- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol diacetate declined significantly from - 26. 2 per thousand to - 30. 8 per thousand and from - 25. 2 per thousand to - 29. 9 per thousand, respectively and the 13 C/ 12 C of 5 beta-pregnane- 3 alpha, 20 alpha-diol diacetate was unchanged. In addition, the ratio of androstanediols to pregnanediol increased in the post-T urines. We propose a new screening method for testosterone (T) doping in sport.

40|$|A {{detection}} method for testosterone administration was developed using radioimmunoassay {{to measure the}} urinary <b>ratios</b> of <b>testosterone</b> (T) <b>to</b> <b>epitestosterone</b> (E) and <b>to</b> luteinizing hormone (LH). A comparative study of the effect on these ratios of a single intramuscular injection of testosterone heptanoate followed by stimulation with human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) in three normal men was undertaken. To allow immediate investigation, a commercially supplied epitestosterone antiserum was used. This study showed that both T/E and T/LH ratios could be used <b>to</b> detect <b>testosterone</b> administration, the latter also being an indicator of HCG use due to cross-reactivity with the LH antiserum. Subsequently, an epitestosterone antiserum of superior specificity was raised and used in a study to demonstrate the insignificant effect of exercise on these ratios. Finally, an intramuscular injection of a combined preparation of testosterone/epitestosterone heptanoates resulted in raised ratios of T/LH but not of T/E. This demonstrated {{the importance of the}} T/LH ratio in circumstances where the T/E ratio can be easily circumvented...|$|R
50|$|On July 27, 2006, {{four days}} after the Tour had finished, the Phonak Cycling Team {{announced}} Floyd Landis had a urine test come back positive, having an unusually high ratio of the hormone <b>testosterone</b> <b>to</b> the hormone <b>epitestosterone</b> (T/E <b>ratio)</b> after the epic performance in Stage 17. Landis denied having doped and placed faith in a test using his backup sample. Phonak stated that he would be dismissed should the backup sample also test positive. It did, and Landis was suspended from professional cycling and dismissed from his team. Landis's personal physician Arnie Baker later disclosed that the test had found a T/E ratio of first 12:1, later 11:1, in Landis, far above the maximum allowable ratio of 4:1. The test on Landis's Stage 17 A sample had been performed by the French government's anti-doping clinical laboratory, the National Laboratory for Doping Detection (LNDD). LNDD is a division of the Ministry of Youth, Sport, and Social Life and is accredited by WADA, the World Anti-Doping Agency. The B sample confirmed the A sample, and also tested positive for an unnatural source of testosterone.|$|R
