Policy makers and planners design programmes and projects to integrate the peasantry into the free market economy which emphasizes productivity, technology and cash returns. On the other hand, peasant farmers, particularly women, with their primordial responsibility for domestic reproduction, are faced with the need to feed their families and provide social supports not available through the market system. Poor women have little or no influence over the impact of the application of administrative policies which produce strain on the subsistence system, with which the population must cope by calling on the social regime which sustains them, albeit inadequately {{in the face of a}} restructured economy...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{theoretical}} linguistics is {{the discovery of}} facts that are crucial for determing the underlying structure of language and hidden abstract principles and laws" (Shaumyan, 1984 : 239). There is a twofold relationship between facts and theory: on the one hand, a theory {{makes it possible to}} identify facts and to classify them into categories, {{but on the other hand}} there exist so-called symptomatic facts, which cannot be incorporated within the framework of an obsolete scientific para­ digm, but have a constructive value with respect to a new theory, since in the ways in which these facts appear they disclose abstract principles and laws which would ot­ herwise have remained hidden. In the development of science, the discovery of such facts is of exceptional importance. A new scientific paradigm originates from <b>the</b> <b>contradiction</b> <b>which</b> occurs <b>between</b> <b>the</b> discovery of a symptomatic fact (the latter presenting a previously hidden aspect of the phenomenon concerned) and the use of the explanatory methods of the old paradigm. The paradox lies in the fact that the symptomatic fact is opposed to these very, obsolete explanatory procedures, and, by its existence, reduces their validity. For this reason, such symptomatic facts are usually  reduced  to  "an  execption  which proves  the  rule".  Thus,  for  instance, Chomsky discovered the existence of deep structure by studying pairs of sentences such as John is easy to please, John is eager to please. But he described them in terms of the surface structure. It was only later that Fillmore (1968) introduced the basic concepts of deep-structure description by proving that, through the role of the surface structure subject, various semantic roles can be expressed, such as agent, pa­ tient and instrument...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Rationality as both key to {{and highly}} {{problematic}} in modern social organisation {{is a central}} topic for sociology <b>which</b> veers <b>between</b> analysing it at the levels of social action and social system. A Marxist interactionist approach shows that analysis of action must lead to concern for social relations and processes. Both the rationality and irrationality of social subjects are variously limited or expanded by the social environment, which in turn operates as a system of social relations in which sub-systems contribute to the rationality of the societal system. Moving between these levels reveals the processual character of social rationality and adds to the understand-ing of contemporary qualitative change in society and <b>the</b> <b>contradictions</b> <b>which</b> are involved...|$|R

40|$|Because {{foster parent}} role {{ambiguity}} {{has been viewed}} primarily as a micro-level phenomenon, efforts to reduce its negative consequences have emphasized ameliorist solutions which attempt to alter the be-havior of individuals.

The paper argues that the multitasking culture of cultural entrepreneurs is not only a pragmatic necessity but is also an essential component in their creative abilities and identities. Cultural entrepreneurs move between the worlds of art and commerce and their sense of identity is formed in <b>the</b> tensions and <b>contradictions</b> <b>which</b> lie <b>between</b> these two spheres of influence. These implicit contradictions remain a powerful source of motivation and creativity but resurface more problematically in attitudes to business and business growth. This in turn presents challenges for management and policy in the commercial creative sector. Finally it also raises challenges for organisational research in the cultural sector. In order to adapt cultural policy and management to an increasingly entrepreneurial cultural sector, researchers need first to identify the subjective self-perceptions and identity myths of the cultural entrepreneur...|$|R

Research into female misogyny and women’s negative intra-relations offers alternative understandings as to why senior women in organizations are blamed for not supporting other women in their careers and why senior women are often perceived as ‘too male’ and/or the wrong type of career role models for other women.
