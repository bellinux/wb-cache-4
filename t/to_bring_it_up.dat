5|$|In January 1941, {{with the}} threat of {{invasion}} of England reduced, it was decided to send the 2nd AIF units there to the Middle East and the battalion arrived in Egypt in March 1941. Following this the battalion moved to Palestine where it undertook further training and received a draft of reinforcements which enabled it to raise a fourth company in order <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to establishment. Having been transferred to the 7th Division, the battalion took up defensive positions around Mersa Matruh before taking part in the Syria-Lebanon campaign, during which it took part in several battles.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of new Soviet tanks {{such as the}} T-80B during the late 1970s and early 1980s demanded {{the development of new}} technologies and weapons to counter the threat posed to Western armor. The T-80B had increased firepower and a new composite ceramic armor. The T-72 also went through a modernization program in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the standards of the T-80B. In 1985 the new T-72B version entered production, with a new laminate armor protection system; its turret armor, designed primarily to defeat anti-tank missiles, surpassed the T-80B's in protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the fort was artificially raised by the Romans, using earth dug from the foundation ditch, <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{to the level of}} the projecting step on the back of the wall. No evidence of significant buildings within the fort has been found by excavators. A number of Roman hearths are situated at regular intervals in the centre of the fort's interior, suggesting that they may have been the site of wooden barrack blocks. The buildings are conjectured to have been largely timber-framed wattle and daub structures which have left little trace.|$|E

25|$|An {{interlocking}} system was {{installed at the}} station on 22 January 1971. The station became unmanned from 1 January 1989. The passing loop was disabled on 22 May. The station building was renovated by Rom Eiendom in 2014 for a cost of 2.5 million Norwegian kroner. In addition <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> modern standards, the work restored the window and door designs from 1882. This {{was part of a}} project to make the station a cultural heritage site. Eidsberg is the only station along either of the Østfold Lines which has received such a renovation.|$|R
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 3 was realigned {{to follow the}} entire length of the Route S3 freeway. In addition, Route 3 in Secaucus was shifted off the Paterson Plank Road to the newly built Secaucus Bypass. The {{original}} alignment of Route 3 became Route 153. Only the section west of Paterson Plank Road was state-maintained after the renumbering, and the entire route was eliminated by the 1990s. In the mid-1950s, Route 3 was planned as one of the original routes of the Interstate Highway System; however, the New Jersey State Highway Department had deemed it too expensive <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to Interstate Highway standards and Interstate 280 was favored instead. In 1959, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was designated as Interstate 495 and Route 3 was truncated back to U.S. Route 1/9 in North Bergen.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur and Kenney did prevail on Washington {{to provide}} more troop carrier aircraft. In July, SWPA was given a high {{priority}} for transport aircraft, with six additional squadrons earmarked <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to two groups. They were scheduled to arrive in November and December, but their movement was expedited, and the first new squadron, the 6th Troop Carrier Squadron, reached Port Moresby on 14 October. Part of the 33rd Troop Carrier Squadron was held up in the South Pacific Area, which also had urgent needs. In the meantime, ten DC-3s were converted into C-49s and C-50s at the Sacramento Air Depot and flown out to Australia, where they were allocated to the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron in September. Ten C-60 Lodestars were also despatched, which joined the 22nd Troop Carrier Squadron.|$|E
5|$|With the {{creation}} of the Interstate Highway System in 1956, the approach to the Lincoln Tunnel was planned to become an Interstate Highway along with present-day Route 3, which itself {{was not included in the}} Interstate Highway System because New Jersey thought it would be too expensive <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to Interstate Highway standards. However, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was included in the Interstate Highway System and in 1959, it was renumbered from Route 3 to I-495 despite the fact it does not meet Interstate Highway standards. Shortly after the road became I-495, the western portion of the road was brought up to Interstate Highway standards with the improvements of the interchanges with the New Jersey Turnpike and Route 3. I-495 was intended to connect with New York's I-495 by way of the Mid-Manhattan Expressway; however, this proposed freeway through Manhattan was canceled in 1971 due to strong opposition to the road running through the heart of Midtown Manhattan. Because of the fact that New Jersey's I-495 would not be connected to New York's, NJDOT started referring to the route as Route 495 in 1979. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the decommissioning of I-495 between I-95 and Pleasant Avenue/Park Avenue in Union City in 1980. In 1986, AASHTO approved the decommissioning of the rest of the I-495 designation in New Jersey.|$|E

50|$|The John Cordes Prioleau House in Charleston, South Carolina, {{was built}} on {{property}} acquired in 1808 by John Cordes Prioleau from his father, the third generation of the Prioleau family to own the land. By 1816, Prioleau was living in his new house. In 1821, the property was expanded with {{the purchase of the}} adjacent lot to the south along Ropemaker Lane. In 1855, the house began being used as a school. In 1894, William Bachman Chisolm bought the house and made several alterations <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the taste of the 1890s.|$|R

25|$|Following the battle, China {{gained control}} {{over all of}} the Paracel Islands. South Vietnam protested to the United Nations, but China, having veto power on the UN Security Council, blocked any efforts <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> The remote islands had little value militarily, but diplomatically the {{projection}} of power was beneficial to China.|$|E
25|$|In the 1840s {{the fort}} {{underwent}} an extensive remodeling program <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{to the standards}} of the third generation of coastal fortifications. Work crews constructed 88 permanent gun platforms (though the first guns were not emplaced until 1846), increased the height of the east wall, rebuilt the drawbridge, strengthened the powder magazines, and added a caponniere to protect the approaches from Piscataway Creek.|$|E

25|$|It is envisaged that {{achieving}} {{the aim of}} a 2000-watt society will require, amongst other measures, a complete reinvestment in the country's capital assets; refurbishment of the nation's building stock <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to low energy building standards; significant improvements in the efficiency of road transport, aviation and energy-intensive material use; the possible introduction of high-speed maglev trains; the use of renewable energy sources, district heating, microgeneration and related technologies; and a refocusing of research into new priority areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{battalion}} {{had just}} arrived at Perham Down on Salisbury Plain on 2 August 1914 for its annual training when the order to mobilise was received, and it immediately returned to Camberwell. Within four days sufficient volunteers had been recruited <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to full strength, and the battalion marched to billets in St Albans for intensive training. A few officers were left at Flodden Road to form the nucleus of a reserve battalion, which was fully recruited {{before the end of}} September. The two battalions were later designated 1/21st and 2/21st Londons.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, time had {{taken its toll}} on Craven Park stadium, {{following}} the Bradford City stadium fire, capacity was restricted {{and the cost of}} safety work spiraled. Major renovations were needed <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to scratch. Large amounts of money were spent on the ground each year repairing sections but once one section was repaired another would fall into disrepair. In 1988/89, their last full season at Craven Park, Rovers were relegated to the 2nd Division and Millward decided to stand down as coach. Wright Properties Ltd purchased Craven Park from the club and the final game was played there on 9 April 1989.|$|E

25|$|As {{time passed}} the {{proposal}} for the TTT Co scheme was eventually shelved, {{largely due to the}} outbreak of World War I and due to the considerable objections being made by the Rotorua Chamber of Commerce. The line would have required considerable improvements <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to NZR standard as it was only built to carry timber and it consequently had very tight curves, narrow cuttings and light rails. It was not a fast railway line at all and the passengers that the TTT Co trains carried were noted to be able to climb off the train and walk alongside the train as it slowly crawled along.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Malaysia {{undertook}} a major program {{to expand and}} modernise its armed forces. However, budgetary constraints imposed by the 1997 Asian financial crisis held many of the procurements. The recent economic recovery may lead to relaxation of budgetary constraints on the resumption of major weapons purchases. In October 2000 the Defence Minister also announced a review of national defence and security policy <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to date. The review addressed new security threats that have emerged {{in the form of}} low intensity conflicts, such as the kidnapping of Malaysians and foreigners from resort islands located off the east coast of the state of Sabah and risk rising territory dispute with several neighbour countries. Currently, 1.4% of Malaysia's GDP is spent on the military, which employs 1.23% of Malaysia's manpower. Dr Kogila Balakrishnan {{is the head of the}} Defence Industry.|$|E
25|$|After this, the half-strength {{unit was}} {{reinforced}} and rebuilt in Darwin, where the unit remained until January 1943, continuing {{to support the}} 23rd Brigade. After being relieved by the 2/13th Field Ambulance, the 2/12th moved to the Wollongong–Illawarra area, to support the 9th Brigade while more personnel were posted into the unit from the 1st Division's medical units <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to full strength. Finally, the unit was ready to deploy overseas and on 10 May 1943, the 195 members of the 2/12th boarded hospital ship Centaur to be transported to New Guinea, where they were scheduled to relieve the 3rd Field Ambulance in Port Moresby. On 14 May 1943, at 4:00a.m., Centaur was torpedoed by Japanese submarine I-177, and sank {{in less than three}} minutes. Of the 332 aboard, there were only 64 survivors, including 15 members of the 2/12th. It was 13 hours before they were rescued by USS Mugford.|$|E

25|$|In 1826, the Granite Railway {{became the}} first {{commercial}} railroad in the nation. In 1830 the legislature chartered three new railroads—the Boston and Lowell, the Boston and Providence, and most important of all, the Boston and Worcester. In 1833 it chartered the Western Railroad to connect Worcester with Albany and the Erie Canal. The system flourished and western grain began flowing to the port of Boston for export to Europe, thereby breaking New York City's virtual monopoly on trade from the Erie Canal system. Much of the construction work was done by Irish Catholic work gangs. They lived in temporary camps but many settled in the new industrial cities along the line, where the gang bosses became leaders in the Democratic Party. Some of their work is still in use. For example, the stone Canton Viaduct at Canton, Massachusetts, built in 1835, is still in use by Amtrak's high-speed Acela Express along the Boston–Washington, Northeast Corridor. The viaduct required only minor changes <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to late-20th-century standards.|$|E
