40|$|We here {{present an}} ongoing {{research}} project about an integrated real time mobility assistant, {{which has been}} developed for the call “Personal Integrated Mobility ” of the EU framework program. The assistant is aimed to support personal mobility in a near future scenario, where green, shared or public transports are replacing the current private, carbon <b>transportation</b> system. The <b>assistant</b> handles itineraries, {{which are based on}} goals of time, energy/pollution and cost, and supports users both before and during the trip. The service will gather and interpret any relevant source of information on transport resources and their availability. Information includes user generated content and social data. Given the globalization of users and the hourly peaks of mobility, the assistant is a cloud service, which integrates existing technologies; however a global extension requires a federation of clouds and, above all, the interpretation and validation of social data. These can be considered major research challenges...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} a pharmacy delivery design problem with {{two types of}} human resources: pharmacy assistants and transporters within a hospital. Each medical unit of the hospital has amobile medicine closet which is conveyed each week by transporters to the central pharmacy for inventory assessment and refill by <b>assistants.</b> <b>Transportation</b> is carried out by foot, by tractor or by truck depending on the location. The problem consists in creating a transportation and supply planning for {{each day of the}} week in order to balance workloads for both transporters and assistants while ensuring the availability of medicine to each medical service. A two-step approach using mixed-integer linear programming formulation is proposed to determine a near optimal schedule. Numerical results are given to assess its efficiency. The proposed approach is then combined with a simulation model to redesign the delivery process of the pharmacy department of a French university teaching hospital. Methodology of this real-life reengineering study is presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Despite their {{widespread}} use and presence {{at all levels}} of government, public commissions and boards are rarely given much attention, by the general public, academia, or surprisingly by public policy and agency experts. As a state infrastructure governing entity transportation commissions often deal with controversy, but do we really understand the roles and responsibilities of these important oversight mechanisms of typically massive state transportation agencies? And more importantly, do the usually volunteer members of these important policymaking and activity monitoring boards know what {{they are supposed to be}} doing? How would a transportation commission chair know her commission is carrying out their statutorily mandated duties in an efficient and effective way? To answer these questions, and to collect basic data about the current state of our transportation commissions nationally, this essay analyzes the time management practices of one state transportation commission, reviews existing literature on public and corporate governance, and considers the results of a nation-wide survey of state <b>transportation</b> commission administrative <b>assistants.</b> The results support the prevailing conclusion that there is a lack of literature on public commission government and that because of their often un-distinguished role in relation to the agency, a profound lack of independence and identity exists which ought to be corrected if the intent of these boards is to provide policy leadership and accountability to the citizens they represent and serve. By reconsidering how they run their regular meetings, focusing on the key agency-commission relationships, and devoting time to consider their own performance and expectations, transportation commissions can better assert themselves in their necessary public duty of ensuring efficient and effective government. This essay sheds light on the present condition of our transportation commissions and considers how transportation commissions ought to manage their time for effective public policy creation and oversight...|$|R
