Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E

5|$|From the {{day that}} Speaker arrived in Cleveland, manager Lee Fohl rarely made an {{important}} move without consulting him.

One day, Fohl misread Speaker's signal and brought in a different pitcher than Speaker had intended. To avoid the appearance of overruling his manager, Speaker let the change stand. Pitcher Fritz Coumbe lost the game, Fohl resigned <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> Speaker became manager. Uhle said that Speaker felt bad for contributing to Fohl's departure.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 3 October 1944, the Partisan 28th Slavonia Division {{assaulted}} a squadron of the reconnaissance battalion at Janja close to the Drina on the eastern boundary of the security zone. As they broke out of the encirclement to the north, {{the rest of the}} reconnaissance battalion drove south from Bijeljina and stopped the Partisan advance at heavy cost. Rushing towards Janja from the east, III/27 came into contact with Partisans around Modran, reaching the Janja garrison at 10pm <b>that</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> received artillery reinforcement by 3/AR 13 during the night. At dawn the following day, an additional four Partisan brigades attacked the garrison in Janja, with fighting continuing throughout the day before the Partisans withdrew to the south. Jagdkommandos were sent after the fleeing enemy but were not able to inflict significant losses on them as they had already crossed the Drina into the German-occupied territory of Serbia. Following this battle, Army Group F concluded that the division's overall combat value was minimal.|$|E
