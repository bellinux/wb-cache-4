Whilst respecting the unique organisational and institutional features of credit unions, {{the present study}} also accepts the need for rigorous efficiency assessment. Using a sample of 233 Australian credit unions the study uses nonparametric techniques to measure efficiency, followed by parametric techniques to attribute variation in efficiency. The results indicate {{that a large number}} of credit unions are best-practice efficient, and any efficiencies found appear to flow from X-inefficiencies, rather than from the selection of an inappropriate scale of operations.

40|$|International audienceResearch on the {{determinants}} of the issue content of parliamentary activities is recent but offers clear empirical results: opposition status, media salience and party issue ownership are the main predictors of MPs' questioning in the parliament. In this paper, we argue that integration into international markets and into the European Union should also affect issue attention by constraining national governments' abilities to influence the economy. All <b>things</b> <b>being</b> held <b>equal,</b> we thus expect economic integration to provide MPs incentives to deempha-size economic issues, who should then prefer to stress non-economic issues in the Parliament. To test this assumption, we selected the French case because integration within the world markets has significantly increased since the eighties, eventually providing us with a good case study. Using data from the Comparative Agenda Project (CAP) which provides oral questions and interrogations in the French Parliament from 1988 to 2007, {{we are able to}} look at the variation over time of parliamentary questioning on both economic and non-economic matters.

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{comparison}} of soft-gluon resummation in SCET vs. direct QCD (dQCD), using Higgs boson production in gluon fusion as a case study, {{with the goal of}} tracing the quantitative impact of each source of difference between the two approaches. We show that saddle-point methods enable a direct quantitative comparison {{despite the fact that the}} scale which is resummed in the two approaches is not the same. As a byproduct, we put in one-to-one analytic correspondence various features of either approach: specifically, we show how the SCET method for treating the Landau pole can be implemented in dQCD, and how the resummation of the optimal partonic scale of dQCD can be implemented in SCET. We conclude that the main quantitative difference comes from power-suppressed subleading contributions, which could in fact be freely tuned in either approach, and not really characteristic of either. This conclusion holds for Higgs production in gluon fusion, but it is in fact generic for processes with similar kinematics. For Higgs production, every- <b>thing</b> else <b>being</b> <b>equal,</b> SCET resummation at NNLL in the Becher-Neubert implementation leads to essentially no enhancement of the NNLO cross-section, unlike dQCD in the stan- dard implementation of Catani et al. ...|$|R

Among the determinant of child health, the role of school was pinpointed especially teaching practices. Objectifs: This communication aims to provide knowledge on the process which conducts a teacher to take into account health promotion issues into his teaching practice. Valeurs et principes sous-jacents: Health promotion values and principles Fondement de connaissance/Fondement de preuve: Our framework is based on health promotion effectiveness and health promoting school (Barnekow & al., 2006; St Leger & al., 2007). Contexte d'intervention/projet/travail: This study is based on the analysis of a health promoting programme based on teacher training and school staff support, which was implemented in 22 French primary schools (2003 - 2007), involving 116 teachers. Méthodes: The investigation tool is a questionnaire entitled: practice and representation in the field of health education (HE). A first study based on the data collected during the third year of the programme was done (Simar & Jourdan, 2009). It showed that three factors were significantly linked to health promoting practices: training, collaborative work and high level of individual interest in the field of HE. The present work aims at identifying the way in which teaching practices have changed along the three years of the implementation. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) have been used in order to analyze repeated measures of discrete data. The dependant variable in this study is health promoting teacher practices(HPP). Résultats et Conclusions: All <b>thing</b> <b>being</b> <b>equal,</b> the GEE show that six variables are linked with HPP over the years. Among them, four factors are categorical variable: collaborative work (OR= 3, 13 /p-value= 1. 10 - 4), single grade class (OR= 2, 50 /p= 1, 6. 10 - 3), small school (OR= 5, 66 /p= 1, 1. 10 - 3) and length of teachers involvement in the programme (OR= 4, 29 /p= 3. 10 - 3). In addition, two factors are continuous variable; there are training (OR= 1, 07 /p< 10 - 4) and individual interests in the field of HE (OR= 1, 41 /p= 5. 10 - 3). The odds ratios were measured for one unit of training or one unit of individual interest. For example, it means if a teacher had completed the training (21 h) during the first year, he was 3. 82 times as likely to have HPP. This study gives us knowledge on the content of the training which should be delivered and some information on the way to manage a health promoting programme...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{real-time}} quantification of the hardness {{of a rock}} or similar material involves measurement of the temperature, {{as a function of}} time, of the tool bit of an ultrasonic/sonic drill corer (USDC) that is being used to drill into the material. The method is based on the idea that, other <b>things</b> <b>being</b> about <b>equal,</b> the rate of rise of temperature and the maximum temperature reached during drilling increase with the hardness of the drilled material. In this method, the temperature is measured by means of a thermocouple embedded in the USDC tool bit near the drilling tip. The hardness of the drilled material can then be determined through correlation of the temperature-rise-versus-time data with time-dependent temperature rises determined in finite-element simulations of, and/or experiments on, drilling at various known rates of advance or known power levels through materials of known hardness. The figure presents an example of empirical temperature-versus-time data for a particular 3. 6 -mm USDC bit, driven at an average power somewhat below 40 W, drilling through materials of various hardness levels. The temperature readings from within a USDC tool bit can also be used for purposes other than estimating the hardness of the drilled material. For example, they can be especially useful as feedback to control the driving power to prevent thermal damage to the drilled material, the drill bit, or both. In the case of drilling through ice, the temperature readings {{could be used as a}} guide to maintaining sufficient drive power to prevent jamming of the drill by preventing refreezing of melted ice in contact with the drill...|$|R

Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns numerical algorithms for solving these computational problems, or some of them, efficiently (i.e., in a practical time).
