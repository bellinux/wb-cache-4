5|$|During {{the events}} of Halo 4, the Ur-Didact is accidentally {{released}} from his Cryptum by the Master Chief and Cortana. He immediately retakes control of the Prometheans, forms an alliance with the Storm Covenant, and attacks the UNSC Infinity. After being repelled, the Didact uses his ship, the Mantle's Approach, to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>Composer</b> from the UNSC Station Ivanoff in orbit around Halo Installation 03, followed by the Master Chief and Cortana. After retrieving <b>the</b> <b>Composer,</b> the Didact heads to Earth. Though {{he is able to}} fire <b>the</b> <b>Composer</b> at mid-west North America, digitizing over seven million people, the Chief and Cortana are able to destroy his ship and <b>the</b> <b>Composer</b> with a Havok nuclear warhead. Before his ship explodes, the Didact is incapacitated and falls into a slipspace portal underneath <b>the</b> <b>Composer.</b>|$|E

5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether <b>the</b> <b>composer</b> follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case of}} Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, as in the case of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led <b>the</b> <b>composer</b> to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. <b>The</b> <b>composer</b> can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E

5|$|The {{film is a}} {{domestic}} thriller telling of a family's destruction {{by the introduction of}} a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. A composer has just moved into a two-story house {{with his wife and two}} children. When his wife becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family, <b>the</b> <b>composer</b> hires a housemaid to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely, catching rats with her hands, spying on <b>the</b> <b>composer,</b> seducing him and eventually becoming pregnant by him. The composer's wife convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident, the housemaid's behavior becomes increasingly more erratic. She kills the composer's son, and then persuades <b>the</b> <b>composer</b> to commit suicide with her by swallowing rat poison. The film ends with <b>the</b> <b>composer</b> reading the story from a newspaper with his wife.

5|$|After {{destroying}} the gravity well, Del Rio orders a retreat back to Earth, doubting the Chief and Cortana's testimony.

5|$|Chief and Cortana use {{a fighter}} {{to follow the}} Didact's ship through slipspace towards Earth. Aided by Infinity, now {{commanded}} by Lasky, and the UNSC home fleet, the Chief boards the Didact's ship with a nuclear warhead. Cortana inserts copies of herself into the Didact's computer systems to overwhelm the Didact's shield, but not before the Didact directs <b>the</b> <b>Composer</b> at Earth. With the help of Cortana, the Chief defeats the Didact, who falls into a slipspace portal generated underneath <b>the</b> <b>Composer.</b> The Master Chief activates the bomb but is saved by Cortana, who sacrifices herself. The Chief is found by a UNSC rescue team and is taken back to Infinity, where he, mourning the loss of Cortana, talks with Lasky about Earth, humanity, and what his duty as a soldier means.|$|E
