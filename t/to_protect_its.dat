5|$|John Muir climbed Mount Rainier in 1888, and {{although}} he enjoyed the view, he conceded that it was best appreciated from below. Muir {{was one of many}} who advocated protecting the mountain. In 1893, the area was set aside as part of the Pacific Forest Reserve in order <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> physical and economic resources, primarily timber and watersheds.|$|E
5|$|The Corn Store {{adjacent}} to the Chapel may originally {{have been used as}} accommodation for a gatekeeper or steward. By the late 17th century it had been converted into a grain store by raising the floor <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> contents from damp.

5|$|The Count of Caxias led a Brazilian army of 16,200 {{professional}} soldiers {{across the border}} between Rio Grande do Sul and Uruguay on 4 September 1851. His force consisted of four divisions, with 6,500 infantrymen, 8,900 cavalrymen, 800 artillerymen and 26 cannons, a little under half the total Brazilian army (37,000 men); while another 4,000 of his men remained in Brazil <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> border.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. was {{motivated}} {{by the desire to}} buy time for its withdrawal from Southeast Asia, <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> ally in South Vietnam, and {{to prevent the spread of}} communism to Cambodia. American and both South and North Vietnamese forces directly participated (at one time or another) in the fighting. The U.S. assisted the central government with massive U.S. aerial bombing campaigns and direct material and financial aid.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 20thcentury, major river-control {{projects}} {{had begun to}} take place. Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> downtown sector.

5|$|In {{response}} to its losses, UBS announced a CHF 15billion rights offering {{to raise the}} additional funds need to shore up its depleted reserves of capital. UBS cut its dividend in order <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> traditionally high Tier 1 capital ratio, seen by investors {{as a key to}} its credibility as the world's largest wealth management company. Marcel Ospel, who had been the architect of the merger that created UBS in 1998, also announced that he would step down as a chairman of the bank to be replaced by Peter Kurer, the bank's general counsel with virtually no banking experience. This ultimately proved very costly to UBS.|$|E

5|$|The F-22 {{cannot be}} {{exported}} under American federal law <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> stealth technology and other high-tech features.

In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales. Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to prepare a report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report on the effect of F-22 export sales on U.S. aerospace industry.|$|E
5|$|The company sells {{slightly}} {{different versions of}} the sandwich between international markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> investment in the product.|$|E

Adolf Hitler, leader of the party since 1921, ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his protection only instead of a suspected mass of {{the party in}} 1923. Originally the unit was composed of only eight men, commanded by Julius Schreck and Berchtold. It was designated the Stabswache ("Staff Guard"). Later that year, the unit was renamed Stoßtrupp-Hitler ("Shock Troop-Hitler").|$|E
5|$|Burger King markets the Original Chicken Sandwich under several {{different}} names globally, including the Long Chicken, BK Chicken and Chicken Royal {{in the international}} markets it does business. The company also produces other variants that are specifically tailored to meet local taste preferences or customs of the various regions and countries in which it does business. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants in the line that have different toppings or ingredients such as ham, Italian sausage or pulled pork. Being one of the company's major offerings, the Specialty Sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> investment in the products.|$|E
5|$|Common {{threshers}} are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} infrequent reports of them leaping {{completely out of}} the water. Like the fast-swimming sharks of the family Lamnidae, the common thresher has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently for long periods of time. In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain body heat. The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2°C (3.6°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation. Unlike the pelagic and bigeye threshers, the common thresher lacks an orbital rete mirabile <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> eyes and brain from temperature changes.|$|E

Other hospitals in the city include the Italian Hospital, Elisha Hospital (100 beds), Horev Medical Center (36 beds) and Ramat Marpe (18 beds). Haifa has 20 family health centers. In 2004, there were a total of 177,478 hospital admissions. Rambam Medical Center was in the direct line of fire during the Second Lebanon War in 2006 {{and was forced to}} take special precautions <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> patients.

5|$|On 9 July 1960, {{there was}} a Force Publique mutiny at Camp Massart at Elizabethville; five or seven Europeans were killed. The army revolt and {{resulting}} rumours caused severe panic across the country, and Belgium despatched troops and the naval Task Group 218.2 <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> citizens. Belgian troops intervened in Elisabethville and Luluabourg (10 July), Matadi (11 July), Leopoldville (13 July) and elsewhere. There were immediate suspicions that Belgium planned to re-seize the country while doing so. Large numbers of Belgian colonists fled the country. At the same time, on 11 July, Moise Tshombe declared the independence of Katanga province in the south-east, closely backed by remaining Belgian administrators and soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The church also {{established}} ties with {{local and national}} institutions, such as administrative courts, municipalities and tax authorities. In 1996 it asked Alain Gest, {{a member of the}} French Parliamentary Commission on cults, the reason for its cult designation. In his response Gest did not provide details on the content of the work by the Direction centrale des renseignements généraux used for the report, but advised Kennel to ask the Observatoire interministériel sur les sectes for more information. On 4June1997 the church's representatives met the president of the Observatoire, prefect Antoine Guerrier de Dumast, who advised the movement to integrate the FPF to clarify the situation. The church also appealed to the European Center of Law and Justice, a Christian-oriented organization, <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>its</b> freedom of religion and belief before the European Court of Human Rights.|$|E
