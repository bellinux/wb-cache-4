A truce was agreed to on April 23.|$|E

Throughout the war, the British were unable to project military power into the Illinois Country, which was on the remote western edge of the conflict.

5|$|The King and his {{advisers}} {{were concerned about the}} rise of socialism and the growing labour movement, which they mistakenly associated with republicanism. The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted a more democratic, inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class—a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate Labour party politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.|$|E
