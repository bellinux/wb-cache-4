5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> ran on a small budget. As {{president}} of <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest. Brundage believed the lobby of corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> left organising committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols. When Brundage retired <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> had US$2million in assets; eight years later <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> coffers had swelled to US$45million. This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights. When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> financially independent.|$|E
5|$|NOC representatives had {{met with}} Brundage and <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> {{executive}} board from time to time, but many NOC representatives felt that Brundage was taking no action in response to concerns expressed by the NOC attendees. In the early 1960s, many NOCs, led by Italian IOC member Giulio Onesti, sought to bypass Brundage and <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> by forming a Permanent General Assembly of National Olympic Committees (PGA-NOC), which Brundage strongly opposed and <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> refused to recognize. The PGA-NOC from 1965 demanded a share of television revenue; it also desired that the ISFs, not <b>the</b> <b>IOC,</b> set policy on amateurism.|$|E
5|$|Olympic {{sports are}} governed by {{international}} sports federations (IFs) recognised by <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at <b>the</b> <b>IOC.</b> There are sports recognised by <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> that are not included on the Olympic program. These sports are not considered Olympic sports, {{but they can be}} promoted to this status during a programme revision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games. During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the programme {{on the basis of a}} two-thirds majority vote of the members of <b>the</b> <b>IOC.</b> There are recognised sports that have never been on an Olympic programme in any capacity, including chess and surfing.|$|E

5|$|Chicago {{earned a}} general score of 7.0 during the Applicant phase, after a {{detailed}} study of the Applicant Files received by <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> Working Group on January 14, 2008. Between April 4 and 7, 2009, <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> Evaluation Commission, led by Nawal El Moutawakel, arrived in Chicago to assess {{the conditions of the}} city. The Commission attended technical presentations, participated in question-and-answer sessions about the Candidature File, and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city. Though considered a favorite entering the voting process, and despite personal appeals from such high-profile Chicagoans as U.S. President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey, Chicago was eliminated on the first ballot in IOC voting on October 2, 2009, with 18 votes in a three-round exhaustive ballot of <b>the</b> <b>IOC.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cold War {{politics}} forced <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> {{to debate}} the participation of China, Taiwan, North Korea and East Germany. In 1957 the United States government threatened to deny visas to athletes from Communist countries. <b>The</b> <b>IOC</b> responded with a threat to revoke Squaw Valley's right to host the 1960 Games. The United States conceded and allowed entry to athletes from Communist countries.|$|E

After the NOC for the German Democratic Republic was granted full recognition by <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> in 1968, East Germany (GDR) and West Germany (FRG) participated as two distinct teams at the Games of 1968-1988.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Wheeler and Ridlon {{established}} the Jim Thorpe Foundation and gained {{support from the}} U.S.Congress. Armed with this support and evidence from 1912 proving that Thorpe's disqualification had occurred after the 30-day time period allowed by Olympics rules, they succeeded in making the case to <b>the</b> <b>IOC.</b> In October1982, <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> Executive Committee approved Thorpe's reinstatement. In an unusual ruling, they declared that Thorpe was co-champion with Ferdinand Bie and Wieslander, although both of these athletes had always said they considered Thorpe {{to be the only}} champion. In a ceremony on January 18, 1983, <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> presented two of Thorpe's children, Gale and Bill, with commemorative medals. Thorpe's original medals had been held in museums, but they had been stolen and have never been recovered. Although Thorpe is listed as a gold medalist by <b>the</b> <b>IOC,</b> his results from 1912 have not been restored to the official Olympic records.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{candidate}} cities are selected, they must submit to <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> a {{bigger and more}} detailed presentation of their project {{as part of a}} candidature file. Each city is thoroughly analysed by an evaluation commission. This commission will also visit {{the candidate}} cities, interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites, and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC's final decision. During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that {{it will be able to}} fund the Games. After the work of the evaluation commission, a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of <b>the</b> <b>IOC,</b> which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running. <b>The</b> <b>IOC</b> members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city. Once elected, the host city bid committee (together with the NOC of the respective country) signs a Host City Contract with <b>the</b> <b>IOC,</b> officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, in the 121st International Olympic Committee voting, karate did {{not receive}} the {{necessary}} two-thirds majority vote to become an Olympic sport.

25|$|When London {{announced}} its bid {{to hold the}} 2012 Olympics, Coe became an ambassador for the effort {{and a member of}} the board of the bid company. With the May 2004 resignation of chairman Barbara Cassani, Coe became the chairman for the latter phase of the bid. As Coe was a well-known personality in Olympic sport, it was felt he was better suited to the diplomatic finesse needed to secure <b>the</b> <b>IOC's</b> backing. Coe's presentation at <b>the</b> critical <b>IOC</b> meeting in July 2005 was viewed by commentators as being particularly effective, against tough competition from Paris and Madrid, and the London bid won <b>the</b> <b>IOC's</b> blessing on 6 July.|$|R

5|$|Rio de Janeiro was shortlisted {{receiving}} a 6.4score, {{according to a}} study of its Application File delivered to <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> Working Group on January 14, 2008. As a Candidate city, Rio de Janeiro submitted its Candidature File to <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> on February 11, 2009. The dossier was analyzed by <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> Evaluation Commission, which arrived in the city on April 27, 2009, to assess the quality of the bid. Between April 29 and May 2, the Commission attended technical presentations and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city, giving a favorable assessment in its final report.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>IOC</b> {{originally}} resisted funding {{by corporate}} sponsors. It {{was not until}} the retirement of IOC president Avery Brundage, in 1972, that <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> began to explore the potential of the television medium and the lucrative advertising markets available to them. Under the leadership of Juan Antonio Samaranch the Games began to shift toward international sponsors who sought to link their products to the Olympic brand.|$|E
5|$|The International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially {{launched}} the bid {{process for the}} 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics on May 16, 2007. All then 203 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) were invited to submit {{the name of a}} city within their jurisdiction until September 13, 2007. On September 14, <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> recognized seven cities—Baku, Chicago, Doha, Madrid, Prague, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo—which had been put forward by their respective NOCs to bid. On October 1, 2007, the Rio de Janeiro bid committee paid the required fee of USD 150,000 to <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> and signed the Candidature Acceptance Procedure. Soon after, from October 15 to 19, Rio officials attended the 2016 Applicant cities' Seminar organized by <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, where they learnt more about technical areas that would be analyzed throughout the application process. On January 14, 2008, the seven Applicant cities returned documents, known as the Application Files, containing the answers and guarantees requested by the 2016 Candidature Acceptance Procedure, which provided to <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> an overview of each city's project. The responses were studied by <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> Working Group for months and served as the basis to the shortlist of Chicago, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and Madrid on June 4, 2008, becoming Candidate cities during a meeting of <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> Executive Board at the 2008 SportAccord Convention in Athens, Greece.|$|E

5|$|The {{sale of the}} Olympic brand {{has been}} controversial. The {{argument}} is that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised sporting spectacle. Specific criticism was levelled at <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares. <b>The</b> <b>IOC</b> {{indicated that they would}} address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games. Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; <b>the</b> <b>IOC</b> incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. <b>The</b> <b>IOC</b> also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income. Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments. Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.|$|E
