5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of <b>the</b> <b>supporting</b> structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings.

On the contrary, it sold well in Europe, accelerating PolyGram's decision to interrupt the publication of Doro's albums in America, where the commercial appeal of glam metal and classic rock acts was rapidly declining in favor of grunge and alternative rock. Doro concluded 1990 playing some dates in Germany, opening for Scorpions.|$|E

5|$|After a night-time advance, the 20th Battalion was {{positioned}} {{on the ridge}} in reserve behind the 18th and 19th Battalions. On daybreak, {{it was discovered that}} the advance had bypassed numerous strong points, leaving the German line in front of the ridge largely intact. <b>The</b> <b>supporting</b> British armour {{was nowhere to be seen}} and <b>the</b> <b>supporting</b> artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger had difficulty with his radio communications and made a dash through enemy lines to make contact with the British armour. On reaching one of the British brigades, its commanding officer resisted Kippenberger's entreaties to advance and it was not until a passing British general authorised the move that the British mounted up. By the time the armoured support arrived, the flanking battalion of the 5th Brigade had been overrun, leaving the battalions of the 4th Brigade even more exposed and receiving fire from the enemy.|$|E

5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>supporting</b> roles, {{one of the}} highest-profile {{pieces of}} casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the {{production}} could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban {{as part of the}} first block of filming, as opposed {{to the rest of the}} production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who rarely did television work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an analysis in attachment spacing of tower cranes. Both <b>the</b> <b>support</b> spacing under <b>the</b> rigid <b>support</b> and <b>the</b> flexible <b>support</b> are obtained for this purpose. For deriving <b>the</b> rigid <b>support</b> spacing, differential equation is used. The principle {{is used for}} calculating <b>the</b> <b>support</b> spacing, which <b>the</b> extended segment has the same Euler critical force with the independent segment. <b>The</b> flexible <b>support</b> distance is obtained by setting the integrated stiffness matrix zero, which is equivalent to structural instability. The order of the overall stiffness matrix is big when the tower crane is attached many times. In order to calculate more convenient for solving the matrix determinant, a transfer matrix method is adopted. To verify {{the influence of the}} flexibility caused by <b>the</b> <b>support</b> device, an example is carried out by both rigid and flexible support situations for this purpose, and <b>the</b> <b>support</b> spacing is computed numerically. Numerical results for <b>the</b> <b>support</b> distances of a tower crane will be presented and discussed...|$|R
