5|$|Adam Williams (James Nesbitt) {{breaks up}} with another {{in a long line}} of girlfriends and spends the evening at the pub with his friend Pete Gifford (John Thomson). Pete arrives home late, which annoys his wife Jenny (Fay Ripley), who {{calculated}} that night to be the best time for them to conceive a child. She becomes even more frustrated when she sees Pete has brought Adam back; he missed his last bus home. Rachel Bradley's (Helen Baxendale) boyfriend Simon Atkinson (Stephen Mapes) breaks up with her over dinner after taking a job in Hong Kong. Rachel angrily leaves the restaurant and telephones her friend Karen Marsden (Hermione Norris), who has just asked her husband David (Robert Bathurst) if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> nanny to take care of their son Josh.|$|E

This type of installment payment is often made through investment in government-backed securities. Online lotteries pay the winners through their insurance backup.

The owner, Jimmy, agrees, {{but he does not}} wish to pay them with money; instead he gives them a free pop and {{a sandwich}} each day. Miranda, Annemarie, and Colin discover a Fred Flintstone bank in the back of sandwich shop. Colin, wanting {{to see more of the}} bank, is pulled way by Annemarie insisting that Jimmy could find them. The next day, Jimmy fires the three workers, thinking that one of them stole the Flintstone bank, when it was actually the laughing man who stole it. The workers write a card, give it to Jimmy and insist that they did not steal the bank. Jimmy believes them and let them work at the sandwich shop. He then tells them that he figured out who stole the bank. He thinks that it is Julia, a classmate in their class, and a best friend to Annemarie. He [...] thinks she did it because she is African American. This upsets Annemarie greatly and she immediately quits her job.|$|E
500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> lot of people who think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers {{want to be in a}} rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman who did that [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ibrahimović has {{additionally}} {{engaged in}} multiple incidents while {{with the national}} team. After Sweden's 1–0 victory over the Faroe Islands in October 2012, Faroes captain Fróði Benjaminsen accused Ibrahimović of foul play and insults, describing him as [...] "arrogant", [...] "childish", [...] "ignorant", and a [...] "dirty player". In December 2015, French sports daily L'Équipe branded Ibrahimović and Cristiano Ronaldo the [...] "most arrogant" [...] footballers in the world. Ibrahimović was additionally caught on camera kicking teammate Christian Wilhelmsson during training. In 2013, he came under fire from the Sweden women's national team for an interview published on Christmas Day by tabloid Expressen, {{in which he had}} commented about the disparity of achievements by, and the treatment of, male and female footballers. His former teammate Anders Svensson had been rewarded with a car for becoming Sweden's most-capped player that year, but Therese Sjögran had received no such reward for doing likewise for the women's team, despite owning 41 more caps (187 to 146) than Svensson at the time. Ibrahimović's response to the issue was that Sweden would be [...] "devaluing" [...] Svensson [...] "by comparing him with the ladies' individual achievements. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> bike with my autograph on it and then we're good." [...] Coach Pia Sundhage replied that his comments were [...] "sad and unfortunate" [...] and epitomised [...] "failings in the basic values of male football", while Sjögran said, [...] "I understand him when he says that the men's national team brings in more money and exposure. That's true. But this is about respect." ...|$|E

50|$|Interest-only {{loans are}} {{sometimes}} generated artificially from structured securities, particularly CMOs. A pool of securities (typically mortgages) is created, and divided into tranches. The cashflows that are {{received from the}} underlying debts are spread through the tranches according to predefined rules, an Interest-only (IO) loan is one type of tranche that can be created, it is generally created in tandem with a principal only (PO) tranche. These tranches will cater to two particular types of investors, {{depending on whether the}} investors are trying to increase their current yield (which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> from <b>an</b> IO), or trying to reduce their exposure to prepayments of the loans (which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> from <b>a</b> PO).
