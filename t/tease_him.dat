2500|$|As a {{selector}} Barrington watched some 80 days {{of county}} cricket {{each year to}} check new talent and help choose the team. From 1976 he was the manager or assistant-manager in every England tour. In those days a manager led the social side of the tour with speeches and dinners, which initially caused him some difficulty, relations with the local cricketing authorities, umpires and the TCCB as well as coaching and training the side.

While he did not coach bowlers so well he could guide them through the weaknesses of the opposition batsmen and general strategy. Although he often grumbled to his team and off the cuff to the English press he was always diplomatic in his official statements. He was an avuncular figure popular with the England players who held him in great respect and called him 'the Colonel', but could also <b>tease</b> <b>him</b> and [...] "eagerly awaited the traditional Barrington reaction of hands on hips, eyes cast {{in the air and}} a resigned shake of the head".|$|E
