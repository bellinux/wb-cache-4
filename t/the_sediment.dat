5|$|Bivalve fossils {{are formed}} when <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the {{impression}} made by the valves remains as the fossil rather than the valves. During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in <b>the</b> <b>sediment.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, it is {{more common}} to find Ediacaran fossils under sandy beds {{deposited}} by storms or high-energy bottom-scraping ocean currents known as turbidites. Soft-bodied organisms today rarely fossilize during such events, but the presence of widespread microbial mats probably aided preservation by stabilising their impressions in <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> below.|$|E
5|$|In {{almost all}} layers {{arthropods}} {{are the most}} abundant and diverse group of fossils in the GPB, followed by sponges. 69.2% of GPB individuals and 63.9% of species lived {{on the surface of}} the sea bed; within this group, mobile deposit feeders that extracted food particles from <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> accounted for 38.2% of the total number of individuals and 16.8% of the total species; the smallest sub-group was mobile hunters and scavengers; and the rest were sessile suspension feeders. Animals that lived in <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> made up 12.7% of the species and 7.4% of the individuals; the largest sub-group was mobile hunters and scavengers. Bottom-dwelling animals capable of swimming comprised 12.7% of species and 7.4% of individuals. Organisms that spent their whole life swimming were very rare, accounting for only 1.5% of individuals and 8.3% of species.|$|E

50|$|Nivo-aeolian sediments are {{fine-grained}} deposits {{that have}} been transported by wind and deposited on or mixed with snow. When snow melts <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> are redeposited. Usually <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> {{are made up of}} silt.|$|R
5|$|Oil spills have {{devastating effects}} on the environment. Crude oil {{contains}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which {{are very difficult to}} clean up, and last for years in <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> and marine environment.

5|$|A {{long period}} of uplift and erosion was {{concurrent}} with and followed the above events, creating a major unconformity. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in Colorado and are now famous for their dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age volcanic rock around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> into the Cretaceous Seaway that longitudinally divided North America to the east.|$|E
40|$|The {{concentration}} of iron, manganese, and zinc of <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> and of {{two species of}} macroinvertebrates were examined at depths of 15 and 26 m in Arbuckle Lake. The {{concentration of}} manganese was extremely high in <b>the</b> <b>sediments,</b> while <b>the</b> concentration of iron and zinc were low. Iron decreased in <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> in summer. Populations of Chaoborus punctipennis and Chironomus tentans accumulated iron and zinc, but did not concentrate manganese...|$|R

5|$|In deep seawaters the isotope 230Th {{make up to}} 0.04% {{of natural}} thorium. This is because its parent 238U is soluble in water, but 230Th is {{insoluble}} and precipitates into <b>the</b> <b>sediment.</b> Uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the 230Th isotope, since 230Th {{is one of the}} daughters of 238U. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Microbial mats {{are areas}} of {{sediment}} stabilised {{by the presence}} of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> particles. They appear to migrate upwards when covered by a thin layer of sediment but this is an illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. If too thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it, parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and tubercular texture.|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} is {{primarily}} related to {{the evaluation of the}} distribution, correlation, source apportionment, contamination, and risk assessment of the heavy metals in surface sediments from Khanpur Lake, Pakistan. The study shows significantly divergent metal levels for most of the cases in <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> during summer and winter. Most of the metals exhibit random distribution and diverse correlations in <b>the</b> <b>sediments.</b> Extremely severe enrichment is noted for Cd and Pb, while Zn shows severe enrichment. Moderate pollution is associated with Pb levels; strong to extreme pollution is shown by Cd, which is also associated with very high risk. On the whole, RI shows low to very high risk of contamination in <b>the</b> <b>sediments.</b> Multivariate PCA and CA manifest dominantly anthropogenic contributions of Pb, Cd, Cr, and Zn in <b>the</b> <b>sediments.</b> Comparison of heavy metal contents in <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> with quality guidelines indicates adverse biological effects to the surrounding flora and fauna due to elevated levels of the metals. The m-ERM-Q study reveals 21 % probability of toxicity due to the metals in <b>the</b> <b>sediments.</b> <b>The</b> potential toxicity, mobility, and bioavailability manifest that Cd and Pb are more mobile and available to the benthic flora and fauna. The present investigation clearly indicates that <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> from freshwater reservoir are contaminated with some toxic heavy metals. Consequently, there is a dire need to reduce/regulate the anthropogenic sources of pollution in the study area.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate the adsorption behaviour of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) on marine sediments collected from five different sites in Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong. DBP adsorption can be well described by the Langmuir isotherm. The maximum DBP adsorption capacity (Qmax) of <b>the</b> marine <b>sediments</b> ranges from 53 to 79 mg g- 1, which has a positive correlation with their organic content. Around 90 % of the organic can be removed from <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> with treatment by H 2 O 2 oxidation, and the Qmax then decreases to a range between 13 and 22 mg g- 1. The black carbon content of <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> has a much greater DBP adsorption capacity than does the natural organic matter of <b>the</b> <b>sediments.</b> <b>The</b> amount of DBP adsorbed on <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> increases as <b>the</b> salinity of the marine water increases. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|For {{the thermal}} {{conductivity}} in Soultz, the values are 3.1 W m^- 1 K^- 1 in the granites and 2.1 W m^- 1 K^- 1 in <b>the</b> <b>sediments.</b> <b>The</b> thermal conductivity increases at <b>the</b> interface between <b>sediments</b> and granitic basement. Then, its value remains constant {{in the whole}} granitic basement.

5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in <b>the</b> <b>sediment,</b> burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E
5|$|The {{bivalves}} are {{a highly}} successful class of invertebrates found in aquatic habitats throughout the world. Most are infaunal and live buried in sediment on the seabed, or in <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> in freshwater habitats. A large number of bivalve species {{are found in the}} intertidal and sublittoral zones of the oceans. A sandy sea beach may superficially appear to be devoid of life, but often {{a very large number of}} bivalves and other invertebrates are living beneath the surface of the sand. On a large beach in South Wales, careful sampling produced an estimate of 1.44 million cockles (Cerastoderma edule) per acre of beach.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek, {{including all}} of the streams and wetlands, has been significantly modified by both historical and modern land uses in the area.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sediments</b> are {{typically}} germanotype in character, i.e. {{very similar to}} the Triassic succession in Germany. In the north of the Aquitanian plateau, only a continental Upper Triassic is preserved. In <b>the</b> south, <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> are marine and show their full development. The Triassic marine transgression probably invaded the southern Aquitaine Basin from the southeast or from the south (from the Tethys) via the then still immersed Pyrenean region. <b>The</b> <b>sediments</b> indicate a restricted shallow marine environment with drying-up periods that created evaporites. <b>The</b> Triassic <b>sediments</b> can attain a maximum thickness of 1,000 m and reach as far north as the line Garonne estuary - Brive.|$|R
5|$|The land {{on which}} Worlds End State Park sits has {{undergone}} tremendous change over the last 350million years. It was once part of the coastline of a shallow sea that covered a great portion {{of what is now}} North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a buildup of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel. Tremendous pressure on <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> caused the formation of the rocks that are found today in the Loyalsock Creek drainage basin: sandstone, shale, conglomerates, coal, and limestone.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{exposed in}} the park were formed between 370and 340million years ago, when the land {{was part of the}} {{coastline}} of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel.

5|$|The {{sea onion}} Paranthus rapiformis lives on subtidal mud flats and burrows into <b>the</b> <b>sediment,</b> holding itself {{in place by}} {{expanding}} its basal disc to form an anchor. If it gets washed out of its burrow by strong currents, it contracts into a pearly glistening ball which rolls about. Tube-dwelling anemones which live in parchment-like tubes, are in the anthozoan subclass Ceriantharia, and are only distantly related to sea anemones.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sediments</b> {{that are}} present within the {{environment}} cause increased turbidity and may smother some organisms.

5000|$|Soft-sediment {{deformation}} structures develop at deposition or shortly after, {{during the}} first stages of <b>the</b> <b>sediment's</b> consolidation. This is because <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> need to be [...] "liquid-like" [...] or unsolidified for the deformation to occur. These formations have also been put into a category called water-escape structures by Lowe (1975). The most common places for soft-sediment deformations to materialize are in deep water basins with turbidity currents, rivers, deltas, and shallow-marine areas with storm impacted conditions. This is because these environments have high deposition rates, which allows <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> to pack loosely.|$|R
50|$|During the Paleocene, the {{coastline}} roughly followed the line Arcachon-Toulouse. In the North Aquitaine Zone north of this line, <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> possess continental character - red mudstones, sands, and lacustrine limestones. The sea made a short-lived advance into this domain and left echinid-bearing limestones behind. In the Central Aquitaine Zone (northern {{half of the}} southern basin), a shelf built out to the line Audignon-Carcassonne. Farther south in the South Aquitaine Zone, deep water conditions prevailed in the west, shallowing out towards <b>the</b> east. <b>The</b> <b>sediments</b> in <b>the</b> Aturian Gulf (Golfe Aturién) in the west are pelagic limestones containing globigerinids, operculinids, and alveolinids. Near the Petits Pyrénées, <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> change into shallow-water facies rich in madreporians, echinids, and operculinids. Farther east in the Ariège and in <b>the</b> Corbières, <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> become totally continental and lacustrine.|$|R
5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E
5|$|Two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes: uranium–thorium dating, {{involving}} {{the decay of}} 234U to 230Th, and ionium–thorium dating, which measures the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. (The name ionium for 230Th is a remnant from a period when different isotopes were not recognised {{to be the same}} element and were given different names.) These rely on the fact that 232Th is a primordial radioisotope, but 230Th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of 238U. Uranium–thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of 234U and 230Th relative to the age of the Earth: it is also accompanied by a sister process {{involving the}} alpha decay of 235U into 231Th, which very quickly becomes the longer-lived 231Pa, and this process is often used to check the results of uranium–thorium dating. Uranium–thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral, because uranium is more soluble in water than thorium and protactinium, which are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor sediments, where their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. Ionium–thorium dating is a related process, which exploits the insolubility of thorium (both 232Th and 230Th) and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of 232Th to 230Th. Both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of 230Th to 232Th is a constant during the period when <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> layer was formed, that <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium, and that the thorium cannot migrate within <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> layer.|$|E
5|$|Westchester's postwar {{development}} {{led to more}} stormwater runoff, {{which often}} flooded and closed the parkway. By 1958, engineers were urging that the river be cleaned up to reduce flooding. Still, illegal dumping and overflows continued. For example, storm runoff gave the Yonkers section the river's highest concentrations of heavy metals, PCBs, and other chemicals, {{according to a study}} of the river in 1983, the year the city stopped using the Saw Mill as its primary water source. A decade later, <b>the</b> <b>sediment</b> in the Saw Mill had the highest concentration of metals in the United States Geological Survey's entire water-quality assessment program.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Major {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to evaluation the enrichment, accumulation, and potential ecological risk of cadmium (Cd) in <b>the</b> <b>sediments</b> of Love River mouth, Taiwan.
