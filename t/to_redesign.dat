5|$|In 1944, Republic Aviation's chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, {{began working}} on a turbojet-powered {{replacement}} for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early centrifugal compressor turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an axial compressor turbojet engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.|$|E

5|$|As of June 2012, {{current issues}} {{do not reflect}} the {{expansion}} of the European Union, as Cyprus is not depicted on current notes as the map does not extend far enough east and Malta is also missing as it does not meet the current series' minimum size for depiction. Since the European Central Bank plans <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> the notes every seven or eight years after each issue, a second series of banknotes is already in preparation. New production and anti-counterfeiting techniques will be employed on the new notes, but the design will be of the same theme and colours identical of the current series; bridges and arches. However, they would still be recognisable as a new series.|$|E
5|$|Brettingham was {{commissioned}} in 1742 <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> Langley Hall, a mansion standing {{in its own}} parkland in South Norfolk. His design {{was very much in}} the Palladian style of Holkham, though much smaller: a large principal central block linked to two flanking secondary wings by short corridors. The corner towers, while similar to those later designed by Brettingham at Euston Hall, were the work of a later owner and architect. The neoclassical entrance lodges were a later addition, by Sir John Soane. In 1743, Brettingham began work on the construction of Hanworth Hall, Norfolk, also in the Palladian style, with a five-bay facade of brick with the centre three bays projected with a pediment.|$|E
5|$|During {{its three}} years in production, several {{versions}} of Dishonored were developed. Before the creation of Dunwall—inspired by late nineteenth-century London and Edinburgh—the game was set {{to take place in}} medieval Japan and seventeenth-century London. During development, test players discovered methods of exploiting the available powers and abilities to achieve unexpected outcomes; instead of restricting these techniques, the designers attempted <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> levels to accommodate them. Dishonoreds music score was produced by composer Daniel Licht to represent London in the nineteenth century.|$|E

5|$|In August 2008, the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) {{announced}} a campaign <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> the {{buildings on the}} island, and six designs were submitted. One of the designs removed the existing buildings and piers to replace them with walking paths, and added a large curvilinear concrete building to the island. The design called for many windows in the building to create a large panorama of the surrounding seascape. In September 2010 Urban Splash placed the pier up for sale, citing a downfall in business caused by the recession as their reason.|$|E
5|$|Robert Blackman {{joined the}} crew {{prior to the}} start of the season as costume designer. He had been {{recommended}} by his predecessor, Durinda Rice Wood. He later recalled that he wasn't interested in the job and only took the interview as a favor, but he was so struck by producer David Livingston's enthusiasm that he accepted the post. One of his tasks was <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> the Starfleet costumes which had been used for the first two seasons. The previous versions were made of spandex and caused back problems in the cast. The new costumes cost $3,000, and were made out of a wool gabardine.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} plan for Tvrđa was drafted {{because of the}} need to reinforce the town walls, but did not include provisions <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> the interior and envisaged largely uncontrolled development. New plans for a fort on the right bank of the River Drava were drawn up by Maximilian Gosseau de Henef. Gosseau took over planning of the fort when construction was already under way. Starting in August 1712, Austrian engineers, supervised by the fort's commander, General Johann Stephan von Beckers, built barracks, staff headquarters, churches and monasteries, surrounded by system of moats, bastions and gun positions, respecting Gosseau's design. The design followed the model of lowland Dutch military fortifications of the period.|$|E

5|$|All of the spaceships in {{the film}} were miniatures, as visual effects {{supervisors}} believed CGI was not effective enough to create realistic spaceships. The USM Auriga was originally designed by artist Nigel Phelps and resembled a medical instrument. This design proved to be too vertical for the film's opening shot, in which the camera pans out to show the ship, and did not appear satisfactory {{in the film}}'s 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet rejected it. Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and concept artist Sylvain Despretz were tasked <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> the ship. Jeunet felt Martin's design was too much like a space station, while he accepted Despretz's design due to its streamlined and horizontal appearance.|$|E
5|$|Born in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman later {{moved to}} Mansfield, where {{he began a}} law career before {{entering}} politics. Initially a Whig, Sherman was among those anti-slavery activists who formed what became the Republican Party. He served three terms in the House of Representatives. As {{a member of the}} House, Sherman traveled to Kansas to investigate the unrest between pro- and anti-slavery partisans there. He rose in party leadership and was nearly elected Speaker in 1859. Sherman was elevated to the Senate in 1861. As a senator, he was a leader in financial matters, helping <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> the United States' monetary system {{to meet the needs of}} a nation torn apart by civil war. After the war, he worked to produce legislation that would restore the nation's credit abroad and produce a stable, gold-backed currency at home.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producers}} Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger contacted Chibnall {{and asked}} him to write a two-part episode involving Silurians and a drill. Moffat wished <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> the Silurians and worked together with Chibnall to create the idea of distinguishing prosthetics for their faces. Being in the fourth production block of the series, the episode was filmed in October and November 2009, with location filming in Llanwynno, Wales. McIntosh then returned in the series as a recurrent actress, portraying Madame Vastra, another Silurian character. The episode was watched by 6.49million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD and received mixed reviews from critics. While some praised the horror, some noted that the story was very simplistic, and critics disagreed about the redesigned Silurians.|$|E

5|$|Following {{unification}} {{of the greater}} part of the island under Merina rule in the 19th century, the palaces of the Rova served as the seat of power for successive sovereigns of the Kingdom of Madagascar, including King RadamaI (1810–1828), Queen RanavalonaI (1828–1861), King Radama II (1861–1863), Queen Rasoherina (1863–1868), Queen Ranavalona II (1868–1883) and lastly Queen Ranavalona III (1883–1895), who ruled from the Rova until Madagascar's annexation by France. During his successful 1817 military campaign to pacify the east coast, RadamaI—son and successor of Andrianampoinimerina—was favourably impressed by the houses he saw in Toamasina that had been built by newly arrived Creole merchants from Mauritius and Reunion. Radama invited one of them, a craftsman named Louis Gros, to return with him to Antananarivo <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> Bevato as a home for his principal wife, Rasalimo. The new Bevato reportedly featured two stories, much like the houses Radama had seen in Toamasina.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Director of the United States Mint Samuel Moore {{resigned}} his post, and Robert M. Patterson {{assumed the}} position. Shortly after, Patterson began an attempt <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> the nation's coinage. After Mint Chief Engraver William Kneass {{suffered a stroke}} later that year, Christian Gobrecht was hired as an engraver. On August 1, Patterson {{wrote a letter to}} Philadelphia artist Thomas Sully laying out his plans for the dollar coin. He also asked Titian Peale to create a design for the coin. Sully created an obverse design depicting a seated representation of Liberty and Peale a reverse depicting a soaring bald eagle, which were converted into coin designs by Gobrecht. After the designs were created and trials struck, production of the working dies began in September 1836.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt {{started to}} push for {{improvements}} to U.S. coins, and arranged for the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens <b>to</b> <b>redesign</b> coins which could be changed under the 1890 act. Before his death in 1907, the sculptor provided designs for the double eagle and eagle, though the double eagle required adjustment by Barber to lower the relief {{before it could be}} released as a circulating coin. Redesign of the smaller gold pieces, Lincoln cent, and Buffalo nickel followed between 1908 and 1913. By then, the dime, quarter, and half dollar were the only coins being struck which had not received a redesign in the 20th century. As the 1916 date approached when the Barber coins could be changed without an act of Congress, calls for a new design increased.|$|E
