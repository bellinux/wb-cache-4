25|$|The {{relationship}} between habitus and field is two-way. The field exists {{only insofar as}} social agents possess the dispositions and set of perceptual schemata {{that are necessary to}} constitute that field and imbue it with meaning. Concomitantly, by participating in the field, agents incorporate into their habitus the proper know-how <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> constitute the field. Habitus manifests the structures of the field, and the field mediates between habitus and practice.|$|E

25|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{is a consequence}} of a female-biased operational sex ratio. This means that at any given time, there are more females than males seeking to copulate. This occurs because males lose up to 11% of their body mass during mating and once they are done mating, they need time to sequester resources <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> deliver a spermatophore to the next female they mate with. On the contrary, females do not need time to prepare for their next copulation. Due to the unequal mating rates, males become valuable to females and female-to-female competition rises dramatically as a consequence.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Goodbye Stranger", Castiel {{has been}} {{completely}} brainwashed by Naomi and has killed thousands of copies of Dean ruthlessly. Castiel is sent to find the angel tablet and tortures and kills the demons also looking for it, drawing Sam and Dean's attention. Sam and Dean track down someone who knows the location of one of Lucifer's Crypts where the angel tablet is and in ensuing scuffle, Sam ends up in trouble. Castiel saves Sam and captures one of the demons, claiming under Naomi's orders that he is searching {{for the second half}} of the demon tablet and that the demons are searching for a parchment <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> translate it without a Prophet. Castiel tortures the demon who tells them where to find Meg, but kills her before she can reveal the truth to Sam and Dean. Castiel heads off alone and rescues Meg who explains what the demons really want. While Naomi initially wants her killed to prevent that, Castiel is able to make a case to keep her alive. The group then go to the warehouse where the crypt is and before heading inside with Dean, Castiel reveals that Sam is damaged by his trials on a level that even Castiel can't fix. Castiel and Dean locate the angel tablet and Castiel has to have Dean get it as it is warded against angels. However, Naomi orders Castiel to kill Dean and though he fights it, he has no control over his actions. As he is about to kill him, Dean manages to break through to Castiel's heart and he breaks free of Naomi's influence. He picks up the angel tablet which completely severs Naomi's connection to and control over him. Castiel heals Dean and explains what happened, but senses that he must now protect the tablet from everyone, even Dean. Castiel is later seen traveling on a bus to an unknown destination with the tablet. Despite losing the tablet, Naomi is somewhat satisfied as according to her, Castiel is doing what he is supposed to be doing. Naomi later comes to Dean. [...] In an attempt to gain his trust, presumably because she knows Castiel is one of his weak spots, she lies to Dean about Castiel and claims that he misinterpreted everything she has done and is still insane. Dean, of course, doesn't believe her. Despite this, Castiel is eventually captured by Naomi's forces, but the angel tablet is claimed by Crowley after one of Naomi's angels betrays their location, although this gives Castiel time to escape and reunite with the Winchesters after killing the angel guarding him.|$|E

2500|$|Homophobia in the Latino {{community}} is also prevalent within the United States. Many Latinos {{feel like a}} double minority for being both an ethnic minority and a sexual minority.

40|$|Objectives: {{to present}} a broad review of the known nursing roles and {{correspondent}} medical assistance practices with emphasis on collective health. Methods: literature review which includes 1741 articles along with their most prominent references, carefully chosen from specialized scientific magazines over the last decades.

Results: the nurse’s notable difficulty in both prioritizing their actions and elaborating solutions to complex chores undermine any possibility of tackling simple duties successfully. Conclusion: notwithstanding, in order to lay bare some old paradigms (biomedical, hegemonic) and to give nurses a better consciousness comprehension of their real importance in society, we ought to find new tools <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>allow</b> <b>them</b> not only reach autonomy as qualified professionals but also act motivated individuals...|$|R
