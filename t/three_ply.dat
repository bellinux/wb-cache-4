40|$|Advanced {{non-linear}} Finite Element {{models for}} the strength prediction of composite laminates normally result in long computing times that are not suitable for preliminary sizing and optimisation of structural details. Macro-mechanical analytical models, in spite of providing quick predictions, are based on properties determined from tests performed at the laminate level, making preliminary design and optimisation of composite structures still too costly in terms of testing requirements. To overcome these disadvantages, an analytical framework is proposed to predict the notched response of balanced carbon fibre-reinforced polymer laminates using only <b>three</b> <b>ply</b> properties as inputs: the longitudinal Young’s modulus, the longitudinal strength, and the R-curve of the 0 ° plies. This framework is based on invariant-based approaches to predict the stiffness {{and the strength of}} general laminates, and an analytical model to estimate the R-curve of balanced laminates. These laminate properties are then used in a Finite Fracture Mechanics model to predict size effects.

40|$|In this paper, a {{lamination}} parameter-based {{approach to}} weight optimization of composite aircraft wing structures is addressed. It is a bi-level procedure where {{at the top}} level lamination parameters and numbers of plies of the pre-defined angles (0, 90, 45 and − 45 °) are used as design variables, the material volume is treated as an objective function to be minimized subject to the buckling, strength and ply percentage constraints. At the bottom level the optimum stacking sequence is obtained subject to the requirements on blending and preservation of mechanical properties. To ensure composite blending, a multi-stage optimization is performed by a permutation genetic algorithm aiming at matching the lamination parameters passed from the top level optimization as well as satisfying the layup rules.

40|$|Recent roof {{failures}} in South Africa, of multiple ply nail plated trusses, have necessitated a rethink {{about the way}} in which timber trusses are analysed. The authors believe that the relative slip between plies caused by a torsional moment as a result of eccentric loading is a possible reason for some of the failures. The design assumption in South Africa and America is that all the plies share the applied load equally; Eurocode 5 (BS EN 1995 - 1 - 1 : 2004) does not cover the design of multiple ply trusses; and BS 5268 - 3 : 2006 recommends additional load factors to be applied to eccentrically loaded truss components with the outer ply being loaded more than the inner plies, {{as a result of the}} torsion induced by an out-of-plane eccentricity. In this paper, a matrix stiffness method is used to show that, by ignoring the eccentric loading and relative slip between the trusses, the member and plate force may be underestimated by a factor in excess of two for a <b>three</b> <b>ply</b> girder truss. A single three-ply girder truss test is used to illustrate the merits of the method.

40|$|The use of {{composite}} sandwich panels {{has increased}} in the aerospace industry. Prediction of a theoretical composite construction 2 ̆ 7 s flexural properties is important for efficient composite product designs. Utilizing the four point flexure geometry defined by Zodiac Aerospace, Santa Maria, CA, a mechanical model was derived to predict the flexural behavior of a theoretical honeycomb core sandwich composite using laminate tensile properties. The most common failure mode of Zodiac Aerospace’s four point bend test is a failure in tension of the bottom laminate. Given this information, ASTM D 3039 (Standard Test Method for Tensile Properties of Polymer Matrix Composite Materials) was chosen to test ply tensile properties. Based on the ASTM standard, a sample size of 30 specimens for each laminate was examined to account for any statistical variance. Specimen width was 1 inch, {{as suggested by the}} ASTM standard, and the thickness was 0. 01 inches per ply on average. A high strength epoxy was used to adhere medium density fiberboard tabs to the fiberglass specimen to ensure failure occurred within the gage length. The tensile strength of a phenolic woven-fiberglass laminate construction with 1 -ply, 2 -ply, and 3 -ply thicknesses was tested, inserted into the mechanical model, and compared to existing flexural data on sandwich panels tested by Zodiac Aerospace. The results indicate that the tensile strength increases as the number of plies are increased. The average tensile strength value for one, two and <b>three</b> <b>ply</b> are 38. 8 ksi, 64. 67 ksi and 71. 22 ksi respectively.

40|$|This {{study were}} {{investigate}} the adhesion and bonding characteristics of bamboo (Gigantochloa scortechinii) strips and laminates treated with permethrin-based preservative (Light Organic Solvent-Based (LOSP) and Water-Based (WBP)) formulations, Tributyl Tin Oxide (TBTO) and borax. The bomboo culm were cut into strips and treated with those selected chemicals. The bamboo strips were then glued {{edge to edge}} to form a bamboo veneers before fabrication of the <b>three</b> <b>ply</b> perpendicular bamboo laminates. In this research the properties studied include wettability, buffering capacity, shear strength and wood failure. Untreated strips and bamboo strips which were boiled in water (100 °C) were also tested for comparison purposes. Those strips treated with LOSP had higher contact angle (3 °- 9 °) which reflects that {{the surface of the}} treated strips is less readily wetted. Whereas, borax-treated strips had the highest wetting rate where the value is 1 °. In buffering capacity study shows that treated bamboo was more stable towards alkali. This is suggested that a buffering agent (Calcium carbonate) is required in the adhesive formulation to ensure sufficient curing of the resin. Preservative treatments on bamboo strips significantly affect shear strength and wood failure of the laminates. Shear and wood failure of the laminated bamboo were significantly reduced especially in the wet condition where, the range is 0 N mm - 2 (WBP treated) to 0. 65 N mm - 2 (boiled-treated) when compared to untreated bamboo laminates (0. 79 N mm - 2). While, in dry condition test, the glue bond strength of were range from 0. 64 N mm - 2 (WBP-treated) to 2. 04 N mm - 2 (borax-treated).

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} determination of the relationship between low velocity impacts and the failure by cracking of 420 mm square, 6. 4 mm thick, <b>three</b> <b>ply,</b> laminated glass. An hydraulic test rig has been constructed which allows tests involving impacts with pre-determined velocities, up to 7 m/s, and deflections, up to 4. 6 mm, to be conducted upon the glass samples. WeibuIl's approach to describing the failure of brittle materials has been adopted. A Weibull cumulative distribution, which relates the probability of failure to the applied stress, has been generated from the experimental data, and the Weibull modulus or flaw density parameter has been determined to be 3. 5. The stress intensity factor, K or fracture toughness value, is an indication of the toughness of a material. Glass, as a brittle material would be expected to have a low fracture toughness. Values for K can be determined experimentally, and as a material characteristic should not vary widely, however the value of 0. 46 MPa m" 1 "/" 2 for the fracture toughness, obtained dynamically in this work, appears to differ from those figures determined by others, using quasi-static loading, of between 0. 7 and 0. 8 MPa m" 1 "/" 2. If the value for K determined during quasi-static loading is applicable to this work, then the length of surface cracks in the glass is calculated to be between 55 and 72 x 10 "-" 6 m. The stresses generated during the dynamic loading of glass by an impact can be divided into two distinct elements, the stresses produced by the bending of the glass, Ind the stresses generated during the impact. However, although the resulting stresses can be described separately, they have a combined effect upon the glass. The stress combination factor f, is used to describe how the bending stresses and the impact stresses combine to occasion a micro-crack (which may be found on all exposed glass surfaces) to propagate and cause a fracture in the glass. The value of f is considered to be between 0. 7 and 0. 8.
