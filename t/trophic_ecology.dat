40|$|The habitat {{associations}} of species are vital in determining an organism's vulnerability to environmental and anthropogenic stress. In the marine environment, post-settlement {{processes such as}} ontogenetic shifts in habitat use can affect this vulnerability by subjecting a species to differing biological and environmental conditions at various life stages. This study documents the habitat {{associations of}} adult and juvenile butterflyfishes on an inshore reef of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to investigate if ontogenetic shifts in habitat use occur, and if such shifts relate to the <b>trophic</b> <b>ecologies</b> of species. Coral-feeding species displayed highly concordant distributions among adults and juveniles. In contrast, adults and juveniles of species with wider dietary selectivities (generalists) displayed significantly different distributions across reef zones. Juvenile generalist feeders were limited to the shallow, patchy areas of the reef flat whilst adult conspecifics displayed comparatively wide distributions. Butterflyfishes with a heavy reliance on corals for food appear to settle preferentially in areas with high abundances of adult conspecifics, which may partially explain why coral specialists are more vulnerable to localized depletion events. In contrast, generalist species utilize distinct habitats as adults and juveniles, suggesting that generalist butterflyfishes expand their ranges and are therefore subjected to changing environmental conditions as they reach adulthood...|$|R

The <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> of invaders might be affected by both their body size and the characteristics of their habitat due to variation in energy requirements and resource availability. Here, using stable-isotope analysis, we investigated the <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii in 15 populations in southwest France over a gradient of individual (crayfish body size), population (crayfish abundance) and ecosystem (lake size, productivity and predation pressure) characteristics. We predicted that population niche width, level of omnivory and trophic position of individuals would change with abiotic and biotic conditions, but that these relationships would vary with lake size. The trophic position of individual crayfish increased with body size in lakes with low productivity, but decreased with body size in more productive lakes. As crayfish abundance increased (and therefore potential intraspecific competition), individual trophic position and population niche width decreased. This was most apparent in smaller lakes, suggesting it related to an increase in encounter rates with conspecifics. Body size, population abundance, lake size and lake productivity influenced the <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> {{of invasive}} crayfish, which can affect their interactions with native species. Our results demonstrated that the <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> of invasive species can be variable across invaded landscapes, with implications for their ecological impacts on native communities.

40|$|Fishes {{are a major}} {{component}} of modern aquatic ecosystems where they regulate some key biological processes such as the proliferation of algae. Their diet is an important and highly variable aspect of their ecology and role in the environment. Yet fossil fishes are often interpreted as ecologically restricted to a single function. Fossil fishes from the order Pycnodontiformes are considered as specialised shell-crushers that drove the evolution of shelled animals in the escalation event known as the Mesozoic Marine Revolution. But this hypothesis is still untested for want of a reliable tool. The manner in which vertebrates wear their teeth provides a direct link between a resilient, easy to fossilise structure and their feeding ecology. It has recently become possible to quantify and compare the roughness of this wear at the microscopic scale. The potential of dental microtexture analysis as a tool to compare and make inferences of dietary preferences in fishes is further investigated here. Here we show that the technique can track subtle differences in diet between morphologically similar animals and correctly assign them to a relevant trophic niche in a taxon, size and environment-independent way. Dental microtexture analysis is applied to teeth from pycnodontiform fishes to test their role in Mesozoic foodwebs. The hypothesis that they were specialised shell-crushers is refuted. A broader range of realised <b>trophic</b> <b>ecologies</b> is highlighted in pycnodonts. They had more generalist or herbivorous habits and potentially were among the first major consumers of macroalgae, a key ecological role filled by extant analogues which allows light to reach zooxanthellate corals on modern reefs.

Varied metabolic strategies are required among the nematodes, with only 8 out of 51 pathway modules being completely conserved. Enzyme comparison based on topology of metabolic modules uncovered diversification between parasite and host that can potentially guide therapeutic intervention. Gene expression data from 4 nematode species were used to study metabolic dynamics over their life cycles. We report unexpected differential metabolism between immature and mature microfilariae of the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi. A set of genes potentially important for parasitism is also reported, based on an analysis of gene expression in C. elegans and the human hookworm Necator americanus. We illustrate how analyzing and comparing metabolism at the level of pathway modules can improve existing knowledge of nematode metabolic potential and can provide parasitism related insights.

In contrast, surface temperature and sea ice cover remain stable in other regions such as the Weddell Sea. Sea stars (Echinodermata: Asteroidea) are a key group of the Southern Ocean benthos, thought to be quite resistant to seawater temperature changes (Peck et al., 2008). Other, more indirect environmental changes, might induce important shifts in food web structure and fluxes, that may affect sea stars <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology.</b> In this context, the aim of this study was to use stable isotopes ratios of C, N and S to study sea stars <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> to characterise their trophic diversity and plasticity regarding food web changes. Sea stars were sampled during the austral summer in the South Georgia (sub-Antarctic) in 2011 and in the South Shetland (2006) and South Orkney Islands (2016), as well as in the Weddell Sea (2015 - 2016). Trophic diversity, i. e. differences of <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> between sea star species, and variability, i. e. differences of <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> between individuals of the same species, were investigated in each region by investigating isotopic dispersion and isotopic niche (proxy of the trophic niche) areas and overlap. Difference in niche width and overlap between the regions may be the result of different environmental conditions, including sea ice coverage and dynamics. For example, in the South Shetland, sea stars had small and poorly differentiated isotopic niches. This result indicate that they may exploit the same benthic communities relying on few common food sources such as organic matter released during sea ice melting (Isla et al., 2006) or sinking phytoplankton (Mincks et al., 2008). Whether this situation leads to competition or not depends on the resources availability. In contrast, isotopic niches were larger and better separated for sea stars from South Georgia. South Georgia is an oligotrophic environment with no sea ice (Korb et al., 2008). As available food items are more limited but, perhaps, more diversified, a higher trophic segregation may appear between species.

40|$|In {{order to}} capture the {{phenotypic}} variation of the internal skull structures, such as the sinuses or the brain, {{it is necessary to}} perform CT scans in a large number of specimens, which is difficult and expensive. Therefore, while the external morphology of the mammalian cranium {{has been the subject of}} many morphometric studies, the internal structures of the cranium have been comparatively less studied. Here, we explore how the variation of external shape reflects the morphology of internal structures. We use the family Ursidae (Carnivora, Mammalia) as a case study because bears have a wide variability of cranial morphologies in part associated with different <b>trophic</b> <b>ecologies.</b> To do this, we digitized a set of landmarks in 3 D with a Microscribe G 2 X from the external surface of the cranium in a wide sample of bears. Additionally, the crania of seven bear species were CT-scanned and prepared digitally to visualize the 3 D models of the external cranium morphology and of internal structures. Subsequently, we divided the landmarks into two modules, splanchnocranium and neurocranium, and we perform a two-block partial least squares analysis (2 B PLS) to explore the intraspecific (static) morphological changes associated with the covariation between them. These morphological changes were visualized using the morphing technique with the 3 D models, looking at both the external shape and the internal structures. In addition, we inferred the volume of the sinuses and of the brain in each hypothetical model. Our results show that the first two PLS axes are associated externally with changes in the basicranial angle, face length and cranium height and width. Concerning the internal structures, there are parallel changes in dorso-ventral and medio-lateral expansion of sinuses and brain, accompanied by their corresponding changes in volume. In contrast, the third PLS axis is related to opposite changes in the volume of sinuses and brain. These preliminary results suggest that the opposite relationship between sinuses and brain volumes in the bear cranium is not as evident as expected, at least at intraspecific level.

The analysis of trophic structure {{can be used to}} quantitatively describe communities. Stable isotope analysis is useful to describe trophic organisation, but statistical models that allow the identification of general patterns and comparisons between systems/sampling periods have only recently been developed. 2. Here, stable isotope-based Bayesian community-wide metrics are used to investigate patterns in trophic structure in five estuaries that differ in size, sediment yield and catchment vegetation cover (C 3 /C 4) : the Zambezi in Mozambique, the Tana in Kenya and the Rianila, the Betsiboka and Pangalanes Canal (sampled at Ambila) in Madagascar. 3. Primary producers, invertebrates and fish of different <b>trophic</b> <b>ecologies</b> were sampled at each estuary before and after the 2010 / 2011 wet season. Trophic length, estimated based on δ 15 N, varied between 3. 6 (Ambila) and 4. 7 levels (Zambezi) and did not vary seasonally for any estuary. Trophic structure differed the most at Ambila, where trophic diversity and trophic redundancy were lower than at the other estuaries. Among the four open estuaries, the Betsiboka and Tana (C 4 -dominated) had lower trophic diversity than the Zambezi and Rianila (C 3 -dominated), probably due to the high loads of suspended sediment, which limited the availability of aquatic sources. 4. There was seasonality in trophic structure at Ambila and Betsiboka, as trophic diversity increased and trophic redundancy decreased from the pre- to the post-wet season. For Ambila, this probably resulted from the higher variability and availability of sources after the wet season, which allowed diets to diversify. For the Betsiboka, where aquatic productivity is low, this was likely due to a greater input of terrestrial material during the wet season. 5. The comparative analysis of community-wide metrics was useful to detect patterns in trophic structure and identify differences/similarities in trophic organisation related to environmental conditions. However, more widespread application of these approaches across different faunal communities in contrasting ecosystems is required to allow identification of robust large-scale patterns in trophic structure. The approach used here may also find application in comparing food web organization before and after impacts or monitoring ecological recovery after rehabilitation. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2013 I {{utilized}} the ecological diversity {{displayed in the}} Cook Inlet adaptive radiation of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus species complex, hereafter 'stickleback') to examine the drivers of intra- and inter-population variation in total mercury (THg) concentrations. I examined the importance of sex, trophic position (TP), and habitat-specific foraging (measured as {{the proportion of the}} diet derived from benthic sources; a) in stickleback from Benka Lake, Alaska, a lake with both benthic and limnetic ecotypes. The results demonstrate that both sex and habitat-specific foraging are important determinants of THg concentrations in this threespine stickleback population. Specifically, male stickleback and stickleback foraging in limnetic habitats had higher THg concentrations than females or benthic foraging individuals. Further, I found that the relationships between THg concentration, TP, and a differed between the sexes such that TP and a were of approximately equal importance in female fish but TP was more important than a in male fish. I assessed the relative importance of these same factors in determining THg concentrations of stickleback from six lakes spanning a range of <b>trophic</b> <b>ecologies.</b> Across populations, I found sex and TP to be more important determinants of THg concentrations than reliance on benthic prey; however, there was substantial variation in the relative importance of these parameters in individual lakes. Across lakes I also found a positive correlation between THg concentrations in stickleback and the reliance on benthic prey, and my data suggest that differences in the bioavailability of Hg in the lakes were responsible for this relationship. I investigated temporal variation in the THg concentrations of Benka Lake stickleback. The temporal patterns observed in stickleback likely result from numerous physiological and ecological processes. I found that the importance and magnitude of these factors acting upon THg concentrations varied between sexes, ecotypes, or both, though the directions of the relationships were consistent across groups. Despite this variation, TP was consistently the most important determinant of Hg concentrations. Collectively, the results of this dissertation demonstrate that the ecological factors driving THg concentrations in stickleback are complex, likely integrate multiple confounding interactions, and often vary by sex, ecotype, and population (lake). To improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying Hg bioaccumulation, future research should utilize experimental studies and larger numbers of wild populations to examine the independent effects of these variables within the context of varying physiologies and ecologies...|$|R

Constraining this range of predictions is necessary for the development of informed policy and management. The direct biological impacts of acidification occur at the molecular and cellular level; however, it is the expression of these effects at the population and ecosystem level that is of societal concern. Here, we consider {{the potential impact of}} ocean acidification on fisheries with particular emphasis on approaches to scaling from physiological responses to population- and ecosystem-level processes. In some instances, impacts of ocean acidification may lead to changes in the relative species composition at a given trophic level without affecting the overall productivity, whilst in other instances, ocean acidification may lead to a reduction in productivity at a given tropic level. Because of the scale at which ecological processes operate, modelling studies are required. Here, ocean acidification is situated within ongoing research into the ecological dynamics of perturbed systems, for which many models have already been developed. Whilst few existing models currently explicitly represent physiological processes sensitive to ocean acidification, some examples of how ocean acidification effects may be emulated within existing models are discussed.

40|$|International audienceTrophically {{transmitted}} parasites {{are likely}} to strongly in␣uence food web-structure. The {{extent to which they}} change the <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> of their host remains nevertheless poorly investigated and ␣eld evidence is lacking. This is particularly true for acanthocephalan parasites whose invertebrate hosts can prey on other invertebrates and contribute to leaf-litter breakdown. We used a multiple approach combining feeding experiments, neutral lipids and stable isotopes to investigate the <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus roeseli parasitized by the bird acanthocephalan Polymorphus minutus. Infected compared to uninfected amphipods consumed as many dead isopods, but fewer live isopods and less leaf material. Infection had no in␣uence on the total concentration of neutral lipids. Contrary to what we expected based on laboratory ␣ndings, the nitrogen isotope signature, which allows for the estimation of consumer's trophic position, was not in␣uenced by infection status. Conversely, the carbon isotope signature, which is used to identify food sources, changed with infection and suggested that the diet of infected G. roeseli includes less perilithon (i. e. ␣xed algae on rocks, stones) but more terrestrial inputs (e. g. leaf material) than that of uninfected conspeci␣cs. This study shows evidence of changes in the <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> of P. minutus-infected G. roeseli and we stress the need to complement feeding experiments with ␣eld data when investigating top-down e␣ects of infection in an opportunistic feeder which adapts its diet to the available food sources...|$|E
40|$|Lipid and {{fatty acid}} (FA) {{analysis}} {{is commonly used}} to describe the <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> of an increasing number of taxa. However, the applicability of these analyses is contingent upon the collection and storage of sufficient high quality tissue, the limitations of which are previously unexplored in elasmobranchs. Using samples from 110 white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, collected throughout Australia, we investigated the importance of tissue type, sample quantity, and quality for reliable lipid class and FA analysis. We determined that muscle and sub-dermal tissue contain distinct lipid class and FA profiles, and were not directly comparable. Muscle samples as small as 12 mg dry weight (49 mg wet weight), provided reliable and consistent FA profiles, while sub-dermal tissue samples of 40 mg dry weight (186 mg wet weight) or greater were required to yield consistent profiles. This validates the suitability of minimally invasive sampling methods such as punch biopsies. The integrity of FA profiles in muscle was compromised after 24 h at ambient temperature (~ 20 °C), making these degraded samples unreliable for accurate determination of dietary sources, yet sub-dermal tissue retained stable FA profiles under the same conditions, suggesting it may be a more robust tissue for <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> work with potentially degraded samples. However, muscle samples archived for up to 16 years in − 20 °C retain their FA profiles, highlighting that tissue from museum or private collections can yield valid insights into the <b>trophic</b> <b>ecology</b> of marine elasmobranchs...|$|E

40|$|Subfossil biotic assemblages in lakes' surface sediments {{have been}} used to infer {{ecological}} conditions across environmental gradients. Local variables are usually the major drivers of assemblage composition, but in remote oceanic islands biogeographic filters may play a significant role. To assess the contribution of local and regional filters in the composition of subfossil diatom and chironomid assemblages in surface sediments, 41 lakes in Azores archipelago were studied and related to environmental variables. Ordination techniques were used to identify the forcing factors that best explain the composition of these assemblages. Both assemblages are influenced by multiple limnological variables (conductivity, pH and nutrients). However, diatom assemblages differed mainly in the proportion of planktonic versus benthic species along lakes' depth gradient while chironomids differed significantly among islands but not among lake depths. Thus, biogeographic filters {{play an important role in}} shaping islands' freshwater communities, particularly insect ones, more influenced by geographic variables. Results demonstrate the accuracy and potential of biotic remains in sediments for applied studies of lake <b>ecology,</b> <b>trophic</b> status, climatic trends and ecological reconstruction and evolution of lakes. In the Azores, the application of this information for the development of inference models is envisaged as a further step to accomplish these goals. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

40|$|International audienceThe use of low-polarity organic {{solvents}} {{is widespread}} in cleanup/extraction processes {{in order to}} carry compounds of interest, remove interferences and separate phases, among other uses. A large {{number of studies have}} used delipidation to remove excess of lipids to analyse carbon stable isotopes in biological tissues for <b>trophic</b> and behavioural <b>ecology</b> investigations. In this context, the primary aim {{of this study is to}} assess the influence of one delipidation process on the results of total mercury (Hg) analyses and the possible use of delipidated samples from previous analyses, such as for stable isotopes, in Hg level determination. Samples of vegetation (angiosperm, lichens and mosses), invertebrates (krill and limpets), fish (marbled and black rockcod), bird liver and eggs (Antarctic, Gentoo and Adélie penguins, kelp gull, Antarctic tern, cape petrel and giant southern petrel) and pinniped tissues (Weddell seal, crabeater seal, southern elephant seal and Antarctic fur seal) were analysed for Hg before and after delipidation by cyclohexane. The difference between the two measurements ranged individually from − 63 to 136 % (in the moss Sanionia uncinata) and the averages ranged from − 60 to 66 % (in pinniped tissues). The proportion of organic Hg, which presents considerable lipophilicity, but also high affinity for sulfhydryl groups in proteins, might be responsible for such variability. Given the limitations of our study, we think it is safe to say that delipidated samples could not be used to infer total Hg values in non-delipidated ones...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLarge {{terrestrial}} carnivores, e. g. wolves or bears, often {{play a key}} ecological role {{from their}} position {{at the apex of}} trophic systems. Changes to their populations reverberate through ecological communities; consequently their widespread decline in numbers and shrinking distribution due to human persecution has brought about a loss and reconfiguration of biological diversity in many systems. Although many large carnivore populations are now under conservation-minded management, political and economic constraints make compromises necessary. A common compromise is to permit limited harvests, with the premise of sustainability and the objective to increase tolerance and funding for carnivore recovery and conservation. Here we question whether a large carnivore that has to “look over its shoulder” for human hunters can still fully perform its ecological role at the apex of a trophic system. We use information about carnivore behavior, <b>ecology,</b> <b>trophic</b> interactions, and the effects of human exploitation to argue that exploitation of large carnivores, even if sustainable numerically, undermines the commonly expressed rationale for their conservation, namely the restoration and preservation of ecosystem functionality. Our argument centers around (i) the necessity of behavioral adjustments in large carnivores to anthropomorphic risk, which may limit their contribution to the “landscape of fear”, and (ii) the observation that many of the same features that put large carnivores at the apex of trophic systems also make them vulnerable to human exploitation and persecution, with implicit consequences for their ecological functionality and evolution. Although hunting large carnivores can improve public acceptance, managers must be aware of the trade-offs...|$|R
