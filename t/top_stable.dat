500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century women {{trainers}} were not unknown– Norah Wilmot was training horses for The Queen. But women trained in an unofficial capacity, and were forced to employ men to hold the training licence on their behalf, or to have licences in their husbands' names. Thus, beginning in 1932, the divorced Nagle employed Alfred Stickley, a licensed trainer, to work at her stables in the capacity of head lad. Mahwa, by Match III out of Media, was owned by Newton Deakin and was the first winning horse to be officially listed as trained by Nagle. [...] As late as 1975, she trained twelve horses and recommended feeding them some seaweed to provide iodine. She was also a great believer in the beneficial effects of fresh air, insisting that her horses' <b>top</b> <b>stable</b> doors were permanently left open. She was vehemently opposed to the vaccination of horses against equine influenza, and challenged a Jockey Club decision to make vaccination compulsory.

5000|$|After a few minutes, the top falls when air {{friction}} slows it {{below the}} critical speed. Air temperature, air currents, ground vibration, and power source interruptions also alter the delicate equilibrium {{necessary to keep}} the <b>top</b> <b>stable.</b> More expensive laboratory versions can sustain a levitating top indefinitely by sustaining the top rotation actively compensating for aberrations in rotation. The makers of the Levitron have developed a [...] "Perpetuator", which sits under the Levitron and sends out an additional magnetic pulse.

With a constant speed, and with the Levitron perfectly level, the Levitron top can spin {{for longer periods of}} time.|$|E
50|$|Despite the loss, Taylor rebounded by {{entering}} the first-ever Rey de Voladores tournament on April 22, 2007, defeating {{the likes of}} PAC, Ricochet, Retail Dragon {{en route to the}} finals of the tournament, where he defeated Lince Dorado. However, problems in the Kings of Wrestling arose as Chris Hero, the man he replaced at King of Trios, had split the Kings of Wrestling stable in two, with Hero, Sweeney, and Claudio Castagnoli comprising the Kings of Wrestling while Team F.I.S.T. (Taylor, Akuma, and Icarus) once again became a separate team. At the Aniversario! event in May, the Kings and F.I.S.T. met in a six-man tag team match, which F.I.S.T. won. Despite losing, the Kings reunited with F.I.S.T. and the Kings of Wrestling became the <b>top</b> <b>stable</b> in Chikara, later recruiting Mitch Ryder, Max Boyer and Shayne Hawke to their ranks. Using this momentum, Taylor {{went on to win the}} Young Lions Cup V, beating Cabana Man Dan, Lince Dorado, MosCOW the Communist Bovine, Player Uno, Ice Cream, Jr. and Amigo Suzuki on the first night and Arik Cannon in the semifinals on the second night, before beating longtime rival Ricochet in the finals.|$|E

50|$|Eric Guerin {{was born}} in Maringouin, Louisiana, in Cajun {{backwater}} country, twenty-four miles west of Baton Rouge. The son of an impoverished Cajun blacksmith, older cousin Norman Leblanc had become a jockey then a horse trainer and in 1938 the fourteen-year-old Guerin quit school {{to go to work}} for his cousin at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans. For two years, the teenager cleaned out horse stalls and began learning to ride by exercising horses. He then signed a contract to work for a Texas businessman's stable, a job that afforded him the opportunity to travel to racetracks around the country. Before long, his contract was sold to another stable owner, a common practise at the time, and Guerin {{began his career as a}} thoroughbred horse racing jockey in 1941 at the age of sixteen at Narragansett Park near Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Riding for a <b>top</b> <b>stable</b> proved to be Guerin's big break as a year later he was the United States' leading apprentice jockey. Within a few years, Eric Guerin was a highly regarded jockey on the East Coast racing circuit and in 1944 was involved in a racing rarity when he was part of a triple dead heat for first place in the Carter Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack.|$|E

50|$|On July 29, Hino {{entered a}} special tournament, which {{was set to}} {{determine}} a new <b>top</b> <b>stable</b> in Kaientai Dojo. In {{the first round of}} the tournament, Hino and Ayumu Honda were defeated by Shiori Asahi and Yuki Sato. As the winners of the match, Asahi and Sato were given the right to recruit one of the losers as part of their stable, and chose Hino to join them. Later that same event, Hino, Asahi and Sato were defeated in the semifinals by Hiro Tonai, Kaji Tomato and Jonathan Bada. Once again, the winners chose Hino to join their stable. In the finals, Hino, Tonai, Tomato and Bada defeated Crazy Mary, Ryuichi Sekine, Saburo Inematsu and Yoshiya to win the tournament, forming the new stable named Uchuu Puroresu Kyoukai. On October 7, Hino received a shot at the Strongest-K Championship, but his match with Daisuke Sekimoto ended in a double knockout, after neither man was able to continue. On October 14, Hino defeated Taishi Takizawa to earn another shot at Daisuke Sekimoto and the Strongest-K Championship. On November 13, Hino defeated Sekimoto in a rematch to win the Strongest-K Championship for the third time. Hino made the first successful title defense of his third reign against Shiori Asahi on December 24. That same day, Hino earned his second Wrestler of the Year award. On January 26, 2013, Hino teamed with Saburo Inematsu to unsuccessfully challenge Kengo Mashimo and Ryuichi Sekine for the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship. On April 14, Hino lost the Strongest-K Championship to Taishi Takizawa in the main event of evolution11. In September, Hino announced that he would undergo surgery on his right elbow following October 6, which would sideline him for the next few months. On October 6, Hino produced his own event, which celebrated his tenth anniversary in professional wrestling. During the event, Hino wrestled three times; first in the opening six-man tag team match, where he, Antonio Honda and Daisuke Sasaki were defeated by Hikaru Sato, Kengo Mashimo and Yukio Sakaguchi, and later in the scheduled main event, an Omega reunion match, where he, Makoto Oishi and Shiori Asahi defeated Hiroki, Ryota Chikuzen and Taka Michinoku. Following the main event, Hino also wrestled Quiet Storm to a five-minute time limit draw. Hino was expected to return for Kaientai Dojo's big New Year's Eve event, but on November 19, he announced that his surgery had not produced desired results, forcing him to remain sidelined.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Genomic studies {{measuring}} transcriptional {{responses to}} changing environments and stress currently {{make their way}} into the field of evolutionary ecology and ecotoxicology. To investigate a small to medium number of genes or to confirm large scale microarray studies, Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR (QRT-PCR) can achieve high accuracy of quantification when key standards, such as normalization, are carefully set. In this study, we validated potential reference genes for their use as endogenous controls under different chemical and physical stresses in two species of soil-living Collembola, Folsomia candida and Orchesella cincta. Treatments for F. candida were cadmium exposure, phenanthrene exposure, desiccation, heat shock and pH stress, and for O. cincta cadmium, desiccation, heat shock and starvation. Results Eight potential reference genes for F. candida and seven for O. cincta were ranked by their stability per stress factor using the programs geNorm and Normfinder. For F. candida the succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA) and eukaryotic transcription initiation factor 1 A (ETIF) genes were found the most stable over the different treatments, while for O. cincta, the beta actin (ACTb) and tyrosine 3 -monooxygenase (YWHAZ) genes were the most stable. Conclusion We present a panel of reference genes for two emerging ecological genomic model species tested under a variety of treatments. Within each species, different treatments resulted in differences in the <b>top</b> <b>stable</b> reference genes. Moreover, the two species differed in suitable reference genes even when exposed to similar stresses. This might be attributed to dissimilarity of physiology. It is vital to rigorously test a panel of reference genes for each species and treatment, in advance of relative quantification of QRT-PCR gene expression measurements. </p...|$|E
