UNCRO inherited personnel and infrastructure from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR).

5|$|Tharoor's {{career in}} the United Nations began in 1978 as a staff member of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva.

After a further stint at the UNHCR headquarters in Geneva, during which he became the first chairman of the staff elected by UNHCR personnel worldwide, Tharoor left UNHCR. In 1989 he was appointed special assistant to the Under-Secretary General for Special Political Affairs, the unit that later became <b>the</b> <b>Peacekeeping</b> Operations Department in New York.

50|$|At a UN donor {{conference in}} Brussels, Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer {{stated that the}} United States would not fund <b>the</b> AU <b>peacekeeping</b> force past September 2006.

5|$|The UN {{has also}} drawn {{criticism}} for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention {{are seen as}} having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in 1971, the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete <b>the</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> operations in 1992–93 during the Somali Civil War. UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi, and Ivory Coast. Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The Vance {{plan was}} {{designed}} to stop fighting in Croatia and allow negotiations to proceed without the impact of ongoing hostilities. It offered no political solutions in advance. The plan entailed the deployment of the 10,000-strong United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to the three major conflict areas designated as UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). The plan listed specific municipalities that were {{to be included in}} each UNPA, but the exact borders of each UNPA were not defined clearly because several municipalities were only to be partially included. The task of defining the exact borders of each UNPA was delegated to the UN liaison officers deployed in advance, in co-operation with authorities in each area. Creation of the UNPAs was necessary for acceptance of the plan by Milošević and Tuđman. The Serb-dominated authorities of Yugoslavia originally requested the deployment of a UN force along a zone between Serb and Croatian areas, reflecting the Serb desire to see <b>the</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> force securing the confrontation lines. Croatia wanted the UN force deployed along its international borders. The UNPAs served to formally satisfy both parties.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the overall}} command of Australian Major General Peter Cosgrove, INTERFET began {{arriving}} on 12 September 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security, protecting and supporting UNAMET, and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations. With {{the withdrawal of}} the Indonesian armed forces, police and government officials from East Timor, UNAMET re-established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September. On 19 October 1999, Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN peacekeeping force, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) was established, becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence. The hand-over of command of military operations from INTERFET to UNTAET was completed on 28 February 2000. Australia continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1,500 and 2,000 personnel, as well as landing craft and Blackhawk helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to <b>the</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> mission. During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro-Indonesian militia and {{on a number of occasions}} Indonesian forces as well, especially along the border with West Timor. Significant actions occurred in Suai, Mota'ain and at Aidabasalala in October 1999. However, with the security situation stabilised the bulk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005. Two Australians died from non-battle related causes, while a number were wounded in action.|$|E

25|$|A growing {{critique}} of peacekeeping {{is the lack}} of engagement between <b>the</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> officials and the local populace.

Additionally, it creates a reinforcement mechanism for <b>the</b> <b>peacekeeping</b> officials, because the officials on the ground report that their plan was successfully implemented, but, in reality, it had adverse effects.
