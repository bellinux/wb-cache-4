5|$|By {{the time}} Beatty regained {{control over his}} ships, after having boarded , the German ships had <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> lead for the British to catch them; at 13:50, he broke off the chase. Kaiser Wilhelm II was enraged by the {{destruction}} of Blücher and the near sinking of Seydlitz, and ordered the High Seas Fleet to remain in harbor. Rear Admiral Eckermann was removed from his post and Admiral Ingenohl was forced to resign. He was replaced by Admiral Hugo von Pohl.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on {{opposition}} to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into {{institutions of higher}} learning argued that education was <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.|$|E

5|$|The various deceptions {{to fulfil}} the Mediterranean portion of Bodyguard {{were given the}} codename Zeppelin, with follow up {{subsidiaries}} called Vendetta and Turpitude. Its initial overall aims were to tie down German defensive forces in the region, but without suggesting <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> threat to Southern France (until the Allies had decided {{whether or not to}} conduct landings there).|$|E
5|$|However, {{another major}} reason for rising costs was {{the need to develop}} a {{separate}} variant for the photo-reconnaissance mission when the underwing pods caused <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> performance penalty. The differences between the IIIS and the IIIRS (as the reconnaissance version was designated) resulted in only 36Mirage IIIS fighters and 18IIIRS reconnaissance aircraft actually built by the Federal Aircraft Factory at Emmen. Twelve were allocated to a reconnaissance squadron, three to a training group and the rest to two fighter squadrons. It was found that such a small number was insufficient to provide the multi-role capacity deemed essential for the new doctrine. The Mirage IIIS went into service in 1967, and the IIIRS in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E

5|$|Much of Bloodlines {{criticism}} {{focused on}} technical problems {{when it was}} released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted errors which closed the game and typographical errors in on-screen text. Others cited frequent, sometimes-lengthy load times encountered while moving between hubs and entering or exiting buildings and areas. GameSpot called the game's artificial intelligence poor, often causing enemies to rush at an armed player, fire at them from <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> distance to be effective or become immobilized {{while waiting for the}} player's next attack. IGN noted that stealth broke the AI, allowing traps to be triggered and leaving the assailants standing still, unable to locate a hidden player. GameSpy said that the Source engine was Bloodlines greatest weakness; although the RPG aspects were the game's strong suit, features of the Source engine, such as first-person shooting, were where it stumbled.|$|E
5|$|On 29 May, Deutschland was {{attacked}} by two Republican planes. It was claimed that their Soviet pilots had mistaken it for the Nationalist ship Canarias, or else had been fired upon by it. 32 sailors were killed, the Kriegsmarine's greatest loss {{of life in the}} war. After a retaliatory attack on Almeria (Valencia had been the original target, but minefields posed <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> problem), Germany came close to withdrawing from the agreement, but British diplomatic efforts to keep Germany patrolling prevailed. After the Germans claimed that Leipzig had been attacked by an unidentified submarine off Oran, it formally withdrew from international patrols to enforce the agreement. Republican minister of defense Indalecio Prieto considered a declaration of war on Germany, but Soviet fear of a world war prevented this.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{sovereignty}} {{means that}} Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power. The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But {{the principle of}} legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume {{that even the most}} general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.|$|E

Really, the working out has been wondrous, is wondrous now. The Master-Fate is <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>an</b> artist to suffer an anti-climax.

5|$|The I-5 and the I-6 were {{virtually}} identical in performance, although the I-6 took 15 seconds {{to complete a}} full circle versus the 9.5 seconds of the I-5. Both aircraft were armed with two 7.62mm (0.3in) PV-1 machine guns, but the production model of the I-5 {{was expected to be}} armed with four, although this proved to impose <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> penalty to the I-5's performance. The exact reasons for the selection of the I-5 over the I-6, which was debated for a full year, are not known, but likely relate to both of these factors. Curiously, Polikarpov was not informed of the selection of the I-5 until his release in 1933 after his initial sentence of death had been commuted to ten years of imprisonment in a labor camp.|$|E
5|$|The Regent let his ministers {{take full}} charge of {{government}} affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father. The {{principle that the}} prime minister was the person supported by {{a majority in the}} House of Commons, whether the king personally favoured him or not, became established. His governments, with little help from the Regent, presided over British policy. One of the most important political conflicts facing the country concerned Catholic emancipation, the movement to relieve Roman Catholics of various political disabilities. The Tories, led by the Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval, were opposed to Catholic emancipation, while the Whigs supported it. At the beginning of the Regency, the Prince of Wales was expected to support the Whig leader, William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville. He did not, however, immediately put Lord Grenville and the Whigs into office. Influenced by his mother, he claimed that a sudden dismissal of the Tory government would exact <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> toll on the health of the King (a steadfast supporter of the Tories), thereby eliminating any chance of a recovery.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th century, the fur {{trade in}} the region was booming, with the Hudson's Bay Company having a virtual monopoly. In 1783, however, the North West Company was formed to rival the Hudson's Bay Company. The North West Company built forts on Lake Superior at Grand Portage, Fort William, Nipigon, the Pic River, the Michipicoten River, and Sault Ste. Marie. But by 1821, with {{competition}} taking <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> toll on both, the companies merged under the Hudson's Bay Company name.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} summer of 1943 it was clear the UBS was <b>too</b> <b>great</b> <b>a</b> {{challenge}} and could delay the entire program. At a 22 October meeting {{the decision was made}} to use a simplified bomb aiming system for the immediate future, with a radar operator calling information to the bombardier, who would use a simple mechanical calculator to time the drop. It was clear this was not satisfactory, but with no other option available in the short term, an order for 40 preproduction Eagle Mark I systems was placed for delivery in August 1944.|$|E
