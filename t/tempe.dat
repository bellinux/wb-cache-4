However, once there, Alexander I of Macedon warned them that the vale could be bypassed by several other passes, and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelmingly large, and the Greeks retreated.

40|$|The goal {{of these}} {{preliminary}} studies {{is to support}} Indonesian program for increasing palm oil added value through independent production technology based on Indonesian natural resources.

This paper provides information about producing crude lipase from <b>Tempe's</b> mould cultivated in rice-husk-based solid media using palm oil as carbon source. Observed variables include solid media composition, optimum fermentation time, extraction and enriching process of crude lipase. The crude lipase was analyzed its hydrolysis activity on coconut oil and palm oil.

A force of 10,000 Allies led by the Spartan polemarch Euenetus and Themistocles was thus despatched to the pass. However, once there, they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed by at least two other passes, and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming; the Allies therefore retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.

50|$|According to Arnold Houbraken, <b>Tempeest</b> {{was the son}} of Pieter de Molijn, not Pieter Mulier.
