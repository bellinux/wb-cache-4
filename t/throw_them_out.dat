In the episode, the Simpsons {{discover}} that the inhabitants of Springfield have grown tired of them and have secretly decided to <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the city. After being evicted from Springfield, the family members {{end up in a}} rugged place without rules and regulations called The Outlands. There, they briefly come across their neighbor Julian Assange, who created WikiLeaks.

500|$|On May 4, 1942, Haynes flew {{to rescue}} 30 members of General Joseph Stilwell's mission {{when they got}} cut off in Northern Burma, though [...] "Vinegar Joe" [...] himself refused the lift, preferring to walk out with the {{remainder}} of his force. Haynes subsequently dropped supplies to Stilwell's group {{as they made their way}} west through the jungle. On one such mission, a Japanese fighter attacking his C-47 was discouraged into retreat when the crewmen of the supposedly unarmed transport opened up on it with fire from Thompson submachine guns and 45-caliber M1911 pistols. Around this time Tokyo Rose announced on the radio about Haynes that the Japanese would no longer have anything to worry about because the Americans [...] "made that old broken-down transport pilot commander-in-chief". Haynes, in command of no bombers with which to retaliate, instead loaded a transport with [...] fragmentation bombs and had some soldiers <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> over enemy forces. He returned the next day to drop leaflets which read [...] "Compliments of the Old Broken-Down Transport Pilot". For this action, Haynes was awarded the Silver Star.|$|E
500|$|The Bailey {{household}} {{was very}} religious; Rose {{and his family}} attended a Pentecostal church, where he was required to attend services three to eight times per week and even taught Sunday school. Rose later recalled an oppressive upbringing, stating, [...] "We'd have televisions one week, then my stepdad would <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> because they were Satanic. I wasn't allowed to listen to music. Women were evil. Everything was evil." [...] He accused his stepfather of physically abusing him and his siblings and sexually abusing his sister. Rose found solace in music from an early age. He sang in the church choir {{from the age of}} five, and performed at services with his brother and sister under the name the Bailey Trio. At Jefferson High School, he participated in the school chorus and studied piano. A second baritone, Rose began developing [...] "different voices" [...] during chorus practice to confuse his teacher. He eventually formed a band with his friends, one of whom was Jeff Isbell, later known as Izzy Stradlin.|$|E

500|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Needham's early life, {{but by the time}} she was middle-aged she was renowned in London as the keeper of a brothel in Park Place, St. James. Her house was {{regarded}} as the most exclusive in London, superior to those of Covent Garden, even to that of the other notorious bawd of the time, Mother Wisebourne. [...] She was said to still be attractive in middle-age; Hogarth described her as a [...] "handsome old Procuress... well dressed in silk", but mentions [...] "patches on her face" [...] and in his picture her face is seen to be pock-marked. She went by a number of aliases: Bird, Howard, Blewitt and Trent are among those ascribed to her, although Mother Bird was also the name of another brothel-keeper who was committed to Newgate Prison with Needham in 1724. Needham was apparently ruthless with the girls and women who worked for her. They were forced to hire their dresses from her, and, if they were unable to pay the exorbitant rentals, she would force them to take more customers or have them committed to debtors' prison until they met her demands (a scheme John Cleland's heroine falls prey to in Fanny Hill (1748)). Once they were too old or too ill to attract customers, she would <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Ted and Dougal go to {{the cinema}} to find only a couple people there. They make a gentlemen's {{agreement}} with Michael, the cinema manager, to watch the film once and then peaceful protest it so that Michael can <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> making {{it look like a}} fuss. They return to the parochial house for the night, and discuss the film, agreeing it was difficult to understand and sexually explicit. The next morning, Brennan returns and forces them to start early on their protest, despite the fact the cinema is not yet open. They half-heartedly stand around the cinema, waving placards that say [...] "Down with this sort of thing" [...] and [...] "Careful now". Ted has Dougal buy them handcuffs to chain themselves to the railings outside the cinema, hoping that will increase attention. However, they find their protests have the opposite effect, as people are drawn in to see the film.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{believed}} in both predestination - writing that [...] "I believe {{that not a}} worm is {{picked up by a}} bird without the direct intervention of God" [...] - and free will with humans choosing their own fate, writing [...] "I cannot and do not pretend to reconcile the two". These religious beliefs mirrored differing aspects of Gordon's personality as he believed that he could choose his own fate through the force of his personality and a fatalistic streak often ending his letters with D.V (Deo volente-Latin for [...] "God willing" [...] i.e. whatever God wants will be). Gordon's very strong religious feelings led him to devote much time and money to charity {{both at home and abroad}} and he was well known for sticking Christian tracts onto city walls and to <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of a train window. The Romanian historian Eric Tappe described Gordon as a man who developed his own [...] "very personal peculiar variety of Protestantism".|$|E

2500|$|In World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), Cactus Jack, {{billed as}} Cactus Jack Manson, {{was a major}} part of Skandor Akbar's stable. (The {{addition}} of [...] "Manson" [...] to Foley's name came {{as the result of a}} woman who began to stalk him at WCCW shows who went by the name Mary Ann Manson; Foley later said that the connection of that stalker's name to his, as well as its connection to Charles Manson, made him uncomfortable.) Foley also won several titles, including the company's light heavyweight and tag team titles before leaving the company, losing his last match to Eric Embry in nine seconds. He then briefly competed in Alabama's Continental Wrestling Federation before completing a brief stint with World Championship Wrestling. [...] For much of his time there, he would team with jobbers. [...] When the jobber would lose the match for the team, Cactus Jack would attack his partner, <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the ring, and deliver his infamous ring apron flying elbow drop onto the concrete floor. [...] His biggest match at the time was against Mil Máscaras at [...] It was during this period that Foley was involved in a car accident that resulted in the loss of his two front teeth, adding to the distinctive look for which he is famous. Following the short stint with WCW, Foley then signed with Herb Abrams's Universal Wrestling Federation. In UWF, Foley teamed with Bob Orton to feud with Don Muraco, Sunny Beach, and Brian Blair.|$|E
