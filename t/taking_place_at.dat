5|$|In 2013, Dwayne Heard at the University of Leeds {{suggested}} that quantum mechanical tunneling could explain a reaction his group observed <b>taking</b> <b>place,</b> <b>at</b> {{a significantly higher}} than expected rate, between cold (around 63 kelvins) hydroxyl and methanol molecules, apparently bypassing intramolecular energy barriers which {{would have to be}} overcome by thermal energy or ionization events for the same rate to exist at warmer temperatures. The proposed tunneling mechanism may help explain the common observation of fairly complex molecules (up to tens of atoms) in interstellar space.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began on}} June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of that year, {{primarily}} <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> Leavesden Film Studios in England.
