25|$|Meanwhile, at {{approximately}} {{the same time as}} Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, Napoleon ordered Ney to capture La Haye Sainte at whatever the cost. Ney accomplished this with what was left of D'Erlon's corps soon after 18:00. Ney then moved horse artillery up towards Wellington's centre and began to destroy the infantry squares at short-range with canister. This all but destroyed the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment, and the 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square. Wellington's centre was now {{on the verge of collapse}} and wide open to an attack from the French. Luckily for Wellington, Pirch I's and Zieten's corps of the Prussian Army were now at hand. Zieten's corps permitted the two fresh cavalry brigades of Vivian and Vandeleur on Wellington's extreme left to be moved and posted behind the depleted centre. Pirch I Corps then proceeded to support Bülow and together they regained possession of Plancenoit, and once more the Charleroi road was swept by Prussian round shot. The value of this reinforcement at <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>moment</b> can hardly be overestimated.|$|E

The point of contact between Crown and Indians was the local administrative authority, the Corregidor. Provided enormous leeway in the weak state system of colonial governance, the position of Corregidor was purchased. The individual who held it for a specified number of years was free to exploit it for his personal economic benefit by functioning within a closed market system as the sole distributor of manufactured goods to the Indians in the towns they controlled and by purchasing marketable goods produced by the 'Indians' under their charge. No controls were placed on prices beyond the caprice of the Corregidor, who had the coercive {{power of the state}} to insure that the price demands were met. While the Corrregidor did fulfill an important economic role, clearly the system was ripe for abuse, and abused it was.|$|R

Life-advice programming in East Asia includes a range of &# 039;popular factual&# 039; formats from cooking and health shows to makeover and consumer advice shows. A growing body of AngloAmerican scholarship emphasizes the cultural importance of lifestyle programming, suggesting that the explosion of lifestyle formats at <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> cultural-historical <b>moment</b> connects to broader transformations in western neoliberal states, especially the rise of individualized, consumer-based models of identity and citizenship.

40|$|My thesis {{explores the}} {{intimate}} engagement {{of young women}} with the popular HBO television show Girls. While the show emerged amidst a storm of controversy and critiques, my subjects found that Girls spoke to their lives and experiences.

I merged my ethnographic work with these young women with the larger popular and critical discourses and interpretations about Girls online within news and entertainment media, as the reality of millennial daily life is constantly mediated by the internet. Looking at how these young women interpreted, questioned, and struggled with Girls at <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> “postfeminist” <b>moment,</b> we are reminded that individuals are embedded with particular social fields and dominant ideologies.

40|$|This chapter {{looks at}} women’s {{political}} {{representation in the}} context of the Italian Second Republic. Specifically, the chapter looks at the position of women in the Berlusconi IV government. By the time Berlusconi resigned as Prime Minister in November 2011, there were five women in the cabinet. Largely holding marginal portfolios, and much criticised for simply augmenting Berlusconi’s masculinity, they remain largely under-studied as a political phenomenon. The focus of the debate on Berlusconi’s velinismo only serves to further marginalise the role these women played in Italian politics. It should be noted that <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> gender paradigm is not supported by every party on the Right, as highlighted by the 2009 controversy with Fini’s think tank. Unpacking the idiosyncrasies of conservative values (as appropriated by the Popolo delle Libertá), this chapter seeks to evaluate whether at <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> historical <b>moment</b> women of the Centre Right can meaningfully appropriate a “feminist agenda” based on the politics of emancipation. The challenge for scholars of women’s political representation in Italy is to assess the nature (and quality) of political representation provided by women in position of leadership in the since 2008...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this study examines who feminists are {{and what kinds of}} life experiences {{may have contributed to the}} process of becoming a feminist. A discussion of the barriers to the emergence of a women's movement and a reconsideration of some current explanations of the emergence of a movement at <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> historical <b>moment</b> provide some context for a study of the social development of feminists. Criterion for selecting study subjects was self-identification in terms of commitment and action; in all, 54 women were interviewed, all of whom were students at the time of the interviews and were from predominantly middle class homes. The composite picture of the contemporary feminist which emerges from the research is described in terms of three non-exclusive and sometimes mutually reinforcing models: the bright academic, the father's girl, and the early independent. While the process of becoming a feminist was most often a gradual evolution rather than a sudden conversion, most of the respondents were able to cite specific events and periods during their lives when they became conscious of their oppression as women.

40|$|Loss {{is a part}} of our atomic make-up: {{as energy}} {{persists}} and develops, so it creates memory of place and time. Our world is a remnant of others’ loss and will be so for those beyond us: much of our presence is confirmed by what we leave behind us. How much easier it is to dispense with a loved one’s possessions when they are still alive is an indication of that shift from the inanimate to the shrine. At <b>this</b> very <b>particular</b> <b>moment</b> in our history loss seems magnified in the media, in terms of human life, habitat, morality and economic integrity. If loss is integral to existence, what is it that makes it such a persistent and painful presence in our lives? Losing someone enforces our own ultimate individuality as we see, or imagine, that loss manifested in a movement away from this life, a process that we indeed will have to face at some point. Losing the familiar, whether in terms of an object or an environment, stimulates similar mental and emotional processes that recreate through memory a personalised image that becomes a reshaped replacement for the original. Looking at implicit possibilities of bereavement through a Curtain of Loss; examining how perceptions of loss can be explored as we leave memories behind is one of the pieces shown at Chichester Cathedral...|$|R
40|$|The colonial {{encounter}} {{was arguably}} an early instance of transnationalization that had lasting and significant {{effects on the}} organization of gender and sexuality in the subcontinent, and on the current gender dynamics of transnationalization. This paper will examine the juxtaposed dynamics of imperialism, nationalism, and the Gandhian enterprise under the colonial encounter. It will argue that this dynamic impacted severely on the practices and meanings of self-definition—individual, communal, and national—and elaborated them with an almost libidinal intensity {{in the fields of}} gender and sexuality, bringing sexual politics into policy and embodiment into theory and practice. The paper will outline the modes of masculinity that were generated, operationalized, transmitted, and embodied through this dynamic and will show how in the course of <b>this</b> encounter, <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> historical <b>moment</b> was indexed in a multiplicity of ways. To do this, I map out the distinctive gender politics that was mobilized by imperial coloniality, by Gandhi and by the politico-historical developments that are now almost emblematic of national and communitarian identity politics within the modern Indian nation-state. While doing this, the paper will trace the links that Gandhi made between sexual practices and national destiny, and elaborate the gender politics of such sexual experimentation...|$|R

40|$|In {{the face}} of an {{increasing}} influx of refugees in Europe and the inability of the government to respond to this in an adequate and timely way, an informal refugee camp was built in September 2015 in front of the Foreign Office in Brussels, Belgium. In this refugee camp in between 100 and 150 volunteers worked together on a daily basis to provide shelter, food, medical care and even schooling and animation to in between 500 and 1000 refugees. This paper examines the political moments and places inside this refugee camp, based on ethnographic fieldwork in the kitchen of the camp. This kitchen was set up by CollectActif, a participatory project addressing food waste, led by six irregular migrants. We examine how the people present, their interactions and their activities in and surrounding this kitchen disturb the existing ways of ‘dealing with refugees’ and the categories being made between refugees, irregular migrants and migrants or even people in general. Hence, we analyse how the kitchen becomes a political practice guided by the hypothesis of equality, interrupting the existing order in which everyone is allocated to a particular place (Rancière, 2001). We analyse <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> political <b>moment</b> and place in relation to the broader development of the refugee camp, other actors in this camp and the changing discourse on refugees and how to deal with them in society. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{the role}} of popular music in contemporary Spanish culture. The eighties were a fascinating period of Spanish history, as the country was making its transition from dictatorship to democracy, and there were high national and international expectations connected to this change. The popular music of this period amply reflects the changes that the new country was undergoing. This study is theoretically grounded in new trends in Cultural Studies which open up and expand what we understand by “Culture” today. In this new theoretical reconfiguration, popular music today plays a predominant function in the conception {{of the social and}} cultural space of Spain. Through the study of these songs, we are able to understand <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> historical <b>moment</b> better, and also see how this culture has shaped us today. In the present “age of mechanical reproduction” (using Walter Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s terminology) we are key contributors to Culture, yet we are also shaped by it. Because of this, all processes of cultural production deserve to be examined. The analysis responds to the recent parameters in contemporary Spanish Cultural and Literary Studies, an area which needs more scholarly attention, reflecting as it does current changes in our world. This work seeks to develop and legitimate a previously neglected and ignored area of study, using an interdisciplinary approach, by integrating different disciplines such as Music, Literature, or History. ...|$|R
