5|$|Toy Storys {{script was}} {{strongly}} influenced by the ideas of screenwriter Robert McKee. The members of Pixar's story team—Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Joe Ranft—were aware {{that most of them}} were beginners at writing for feature films. None of them had any feature story or writing credits to their name besides Ranft, who had taught a story class at CalArts and did some storyboard work prior. Seeking insight, Lasseter and Docter attended a three-day seminar in Los Angeles given by McKee. His principles, grounded in Aristotle's Poetics, dictated that a character emerges most realistically and compellingly from the choices that the protagonist makes in reaction to his problems. Disney also appointed Joel Cohen, Alec Sokolow and, later, Joss Whedon to help develop the script. Whedon found that the script wasn't working but had a great structure, and added the character of Rex and sought a pivotal role for Barbie. The story team continued to <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the script as production was underway. Among the late additions was the encounter between Buzz and the alien squeaky toys at Pizza Planet, which emerged from a brainstorming session with a dozen directors, story artists, and animators from Disney.|$|E

25|$|The {{first and}} most {{extensive}} recorded cleaning, revarnishing, and touch-up of the Mona Lisa was an 1809 wash and revarnishing undertaken by Jean-Marie Hooghstoel, {{who was responsible for}} restoration of paintings for the galleries of the Musée Napoléon. The work involved cleaning with spirits, touch-up of colour, and revarnishing the painting. In 1906, Louvre restorer Eugène Denizard performed watercolour retouches on areas of the paint layer disturbed by the crack in the panel. Denizard also retouched the edges of the picture with varnish, to mask areas that had been covered initially by an older frame. In 1913, when the painting was recovered after its theft, Denizard was again called upon to work on the Mona Lisa. Denizard was directed to clean the picture without solvent, and to lightly <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> several scratches to the painting with watercolour. In 1952, the varnish layer over the background in the painting was evened out. After the second 1956 attack, restorer Jean-Gabriel Goulinat was directed to <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the damage to Mona Lisas left elbow with watercolour.|$|E

25|$|The {{bridge was}} {{originally}} painted with red lead primer and a lead-based topcoat, which was touched up as required. In the mid-1960s, a program was started to improve corrosion protection by stripping the original paint and repainting the bridge with zinc silicate primer and vinyl topcoats. Since 1990, acrylic topcoats {{have been used}} instead for air-quality reasons. The program was completed in 1995 {{and it is now}} maintained by 38 painters who <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the paintwork where it becomes seriously corroded.|$|E
500|$|The producer, John F. S. Laing, blamed Pyun for {{the failure}} of the film. After the filming was {{completed}} on Guam, director Isaac Florentine was hired to <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the film in Los Angeles in order to improve its marketability, adding around ten minutes of screen time in the process. Florentine declined screen credit, stating in a later interview that he [...] "n't feel it [...] fair" [...] to Pyun. The L.A. shoot took ten days, and featured David Carradine and Richard Roundtree, who were not part of the original cut.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ben Richards. The general plot of India and Pakistan {{on the verge of}} nuclear war is based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. The beginning was not originally in the script; Richards wanted to feature a submarine crisis, but the producers were not sure what the crisis would be. They eventually decided to have an Indian submarine [...] "taken hostage" [...] by the Pakistanis. They wanted to add a personal stake towards Tariq, by revealing that members of his family live in Pakistan. The intent was to include and develop a potential relationship between Ros and Lawrence {{to the point where they}} bond during their final scenes before the hotel explosion. They also wanted to <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> on the Harry/Ruth relationship, which was not in the original script; so Ben Richards added the scenes as additional dialogue.|$|E

2500|$|Like Zimmerman, George {{also took}} the {{opportunity}} for the Enterprise-D's screen debut to <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> its exterior. Because Generations featured the Enterprise-D separating into its saucer and engineering sections, the original [...] model built by ILM for the television series was hauled out of storage. The ship was stripped, rewired, and its surface detailed {{to stand up to}} scrutiny of the silver screen. George changed the paint job, as he recalled they had been in a rush to prep the model for television and its green-and-blue color scheme did not properly read on film. The paint scheme was shifted towards a [...] "battleship grey", with glossy tiled areas reminiscent of the original feature film Enterprise.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{draft for}} the remake had moved the setting to {{northern}} California, and altered the third act to include {{elements of the}} supernatural. When that script was rejected, Carl Ellsworth {{was brought in to}} <b>touch</b> <b>up</b> the script written by Adam Alleca. Ellsworth had previously worked with Craven on Red Eye, but had never seen the original Last House on the Left. After reading the script and watching the 1972 film—the latter he found difficult to watch because of its extreme nature—Ellsworth decided that the first thing they needed to do was to establish someone whose survival you wanted the audience to root for. The writer wanted to know how the [...] "typical family" [...] would react to such a heinous act being perpetrated on their daughter, and what they were truly capable of. Craven points out that most of the early script problems were based around deciding what elements to include. They were never sure how much of the Krug family needed to be seen, what elements from the original film should be included, or even if Mari should live or die.|$|E

2500|$|At age 22, Sondheim had {{finished}} the four shows requested by Hammerstein. Julius and Philip Epstein's Front Porch in Flatbush, unproduced at the time, was being shopped around by Lemuel (Lem) Ayers. Ayers approached Frank Loesser and another composer, who turned him down. Ayers and Sondheim met as ushers at a wedding, and Ayers commissioned Sondheim for three songs for the show; Julius Epstein flew in from California and hired Sondheim, {{who worked with him}} in California for four or five months. After eight auditions for backers, half the money needed was raised. The show, retitled Saturday Night, was intended to open during the 1954–55 Broadway season; however, Ayers died of leukemia in his early forties. The rights transferred to his widow, Shirley, and due to her inexperience the show did not continue as planned; it opened off-Broadway in 2000. Sondheim later said, [...] "I don't have any emotional reaction to Saturday Night at all – except fondness. It's not bad stuff for a 23-year-old. There are some things that embarrass me so much in the lyrics – the missed accents, the obvious jokes. But I decided, leave it. It's my baby pictures.
