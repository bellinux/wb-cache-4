5|$|When De Simone's mother, Mary Sedotti, {{discovered}} {{she had not}} returned home by the morning, she expressed concern, and her husband Michael, Teresa's stepfather, drove to the pub where he observed DeSimone's car still parked, but did not make any closer investigation. Shortly after 10:00, Anthony Pocock, the landlord of the Tom Tackle, was expecting a commercial delivery to the premises, and believing DeSimone had deliberately left the car overnight he decided to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> it to allow the delivery through. Inside he discovered DeSimone's partially clothed body on the back seat. He immediately called the police.|$|E
5|$|As {{proposed}} by the Admiralty, Moore's plans for the new attack on Kaafjord involved the Home Fleet's aircraft attacking the region over several days. While the fighter aircraft involved in the previous raids had used only their machine guns to strafe German defences {{in order to reduce}} the threat they posed to the Barracudas, it was decided to use some of these aircraft as dive bombers during Operation Goodwood. In preparation, the two squadrons of Corsairs and single squadron of Grumman F6F Hellcats selected to participate in the attack received training in dive-bombing tactics during the period between Operations Mascot and Goodwood. Another new element of the plans was a decision to use Fleet Air Arm aircraft to drop mines near Tirpitz and the entrance to Kaafjord. The mines dropped near the battleship were to be fitted with time-delay fuses, and it was hoped that the explosions of these devices would cause Tirpitzs captain to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the warship into safer waters and pass through the minefield at the fjord's entrance. During the period before Operation Goodwood, the Home Fleet's flying squadrons conducted training exercises using a target range at Loch Eriboll in northern Scotland; the terrain in this area is comparable to that around Kaafjord, and the loch had also been used for this purpose as part of the preparations for Operation Tungsten.|$|E

5|$|The CoE mistakenly {{believed}} that the waters of Beaver Lake would cover {{the area of the}} large hotels, so those parcels were added to the land they purchased for the project. Dallas Barrack, who owned Oklahoma Row, felt that he had been treated poorly and had received much less than his property was worth. The CoE held a sealed-bid auction and J. G. Gladdens purchased what was left of Missouri and Oklahoma Rows. He planned to move the remnants of Oklahoma Row out of the path of the rising lake waters. In order to do this, it was first necessary to remove the log portion or shell of the hotel. The original windows and doors were dismantled for the move and later reinstalled. The fireplaces, as well as all of the major stonework were later torn down. Also sold at auction were two massive concrete chairs that had been {{at the base of the}} amphitheater. They were bought by Mr. and Mrs. Ulis Rose of Rogers and were used to decorate the lawns of their Town and Country restaurant and motel. The chairs are still located in Rogers; however, they now sit unceremoniously in Frisco Park without any plaque or marker indicating their significance. The concrete couch was left in place at the base of the amphitheater, because no one wanted to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> it.|$|E

25|$|After {{lobbying}} by Churchill, who was keen {{to bring}} the Channel Ports under British control, and by Wilson, French lobbied Joffre (27 September) for the BEF, which was less heavily gunned and more mobile than a similarly-sized French Army, to disengage and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> around the Allied left flank, part of the outflanking movements known as the Race to the Sea. Joffre agreed in principle, although he had private doubts about having no French troops between the BEF and the sea and later {{came to believe that}} this move had, by using up scarce rail capacity for ten days, prevented him from reinforcing Lille and had allowed the Germans to capture it.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{defensive}} {{players are}} assigned a player (or rather a position) which they must account for in defence. Manoeuvres by {{players on the}} attacking team are sometimes aimed at foiling this defensive system. A 'run-around' occurs when player A passes the ball to player B, and then circles behind him to receive the ball again from him. This play is designed {{to take advantage of}} those defenders who will follow the 'player' and not the 'position' thus luring one or many defenders out of their respective positions in the defensive line, leaving the defensive line punctuated by gaps. The defending team must <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> laterally with the ball across the field to ensure all attacking players remain marked.|$|E
25|$|It is {{customary}} to eat rice to {{the last}} grain. Being a picky eater is frowned upon, {{and it is not}} customary to ask for special requests or substitutions at restaurants. It is considered ungrateful to make these requests especially in circumstances where one is being hosted, as in a business dinner environment. After eating, <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> all dishes back to the same position they were {{at the start of the}} meal. This includes replacing the lids on dishes and putting one's chopsticks on the chopstick holder or back into their paper slip. Good manners dictate that one respects the selections of the host. However, this can be set aside for a diner with allergies such as a peanut allergy, or a religious prohibition against certain foods like pork.|$|E
25|$|During the 2004–05 season, Charisteas scored five {{goals in}} 11 matches for Werder Bremen, {{before moving to}} the Netherlands to play for Ajax for a {{reported}} fee of €4.5 million. Greece manager Otto Rehhagel had publicly urged Charisteas to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to another club during the January 2005 transfer window, in order to get more first-team action. Ajax fitted the bill, as they were hoping to find a replacement for Swedish international striker Zlatan Ibrahimović, who had been sold to Juventus. Charisteas made his Ajax debut on 23 January 2005 against FC Utrecht and scored his first goal four days later against SC Heerenveen. However, he only managed three more games all season. Charisteas netted home eight goals in the 2005–06 season, which included a late winner against Vitesse Arnhem. Charisteas missed Greece's crucial match in the World Cup qualifying due to a head injury received after colliding with Arsenal's Kolo Touré in a Champions League match which Ajax lost 2–1.|$|E

25|$|A {{higher than}} average {{concentration}} of hagwon in the Gangnam-gu (강남구) area, specifically Daechi-dong (대치동), has been cited as {{the primary reason for}} an increase in real estate costs in the area. In the 1970s the Seoul government made some top schools relocate to the area; however, the schools there have become associated with entry into elite high schools and then elite universities. Many residents feel their children need to be associated with these schools in order to reach the upper levels of business and success. As more parents <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to the area to allow their children to attend these schools, the prices of real estate in the area have risen to 300percent of similar areas in Seoul. In 2003 the government had planned to develop a hagwon center in Pangyo to relieve some of the pressure on Gangnam, yet after heavy criticism for only shifting the problem around and not solving it, the government canceled the plan only a couple weeks later.|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, it was {{confirmed}} by Jean that Smithers would come out to Mr. Burns in a season 27 episode. The episode, [...] "The Burns Cage", was broadcast the following April and saw Smithers unsuccessfully <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on from Burns. A writer for British progressive magazine the New Statesman felt that the episode was a retcon, making a serious story about the character's homosexuality instead of the previous jokes and innuendo which were arguably homophobic.|$|E
500|$|Frogs in the {{families}} Bufonidae, Rhinophrynidae, and Microhylidae have short back legs {{and tend to}} walk rather than jump. When they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> rapidly, they speed up the rate of movement of their limbs or resort to an ungainly hopping gait. The Great Plains narrow-mouthed toad (Gastrophryne olivacea) {{has been described as}} having a gait that is [...] "a combination of running and short hops that are usually only an inch or two in length". In an experiment, Fowler's toad (Bufo fowleri) was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds. By measuring the toad's uptake of oxygen it was found that hopping was an inefficient use of resources during sustained locomotion but was a useful strategy during short bursts of high-intensity activity.|$|E

500|$|In 1938, Ziff-Davis, a Chicago-based {{publisher}} {{looking to}} expand into the pulp magazine market, acquired Amazing Stories. [...] The number of science fiction magazines grew quickly; several new titles appeared {{over the next few}} years, including Fantastic Adventures, which was launched by Ziff-Davis in 1939 as a companion to Amazing. [...] Under the editorship of Raymond Palmer the magazines were reasonably successful but published poor quality work, and when Howard Browne took over as editor of Amazing in January 1950 he decided to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the magazine upmarket. [...] Ziff-Davis agreed to back the new magazine, and Browne put together a sample copy, but when the Korean War broke out Ziff-Davis cut their budgets and the project was abandoned. [...] Browne did not give up, and in 1952 received the go-ahead to try a new magazine instead, focused on high-quality fantasy, a genre which had recently become more popular. The first issue of Fantastic, dated Summer 1952, appeared on March 21 of that year.|$|E
500|$|The common {{starling}} is {{a highly}} gregarious species, especially in autumn and winter. Although flock size is highly variable, huge, noisy flocks - murmurations - may form near roosts. These dense concentrations of birds {{are thought to be}} a defence against attacks by birds of prey such as peregrine falcons or Eurasian sparrowhawks. Flocks form a tight sphere-like formation in flight, frequently expanding and contracting and changing shape, seemingly without any sort of leader. Each common starling changes its course and speed {{as a result of the}} movement of its closest neighbours. Very large roosts, exceptionally up to 1.5million birds, can form in city centres, woodlands or reedbeds, causing problems with their droppings. These may accumulate up to [...] deep, killing trees by their concentration of chemicals. In smaller amounts, the droppings act as a fertiliser, and therefore woodland managers may <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> roosts from one area of a wood to another to benefit from the soil enhancement and avoid large toxic deposits.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the landing}} east of Lae, the 7th Division, having {{concentrated}} in Port Moresby, was flown into Nadzab following its capture by the US 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment (503rd PIR) on 5 September. Tasked with advancing from the north-west, its main {{role was to}} act as a buffer between the 9th Division and Japanese reinforcements which might <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> down through the Markham and Ramu Valleys. The 9th Division's initial advance along the coast met with limited resistance, with the largest Japanese elements being mainly company-sized. In response to the landing at Nadzab, the Japanese command ordered Lieutenant General Hidemitsu Nakano's 51st Division to reinforce Ryoichi Shoge's heavily entrenched garrison at Lae, falling back from the Salamaua region. There were numerous small creeks and rivers west of the Buso, including four major rivers and on the inland route, the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion, having crossed the Buso on the first day, began a series of what author Joseph Morgan has described as [...] "treacherous river crossings and hard slogs...through the jungle".|$|E

Shepherd is sucked out {{the side of the}} plane and awakens alone in the wood; his mangled hand having been pushed through the door of the plane.
