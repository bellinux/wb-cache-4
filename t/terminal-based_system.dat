40|$|Trust is {{a concept}} of {{increasing}} importance in today’s information systems where information storage and generation to a higher extent is distributed among several entities throughout local or global networks. This trend in information science requires new ways to sustain the information security in the systems. This document deﬁnes trust {{in the context of}} a <b>terminal-based</b> <b>system</b> and analyzes the architecture of a distributed <b>terminal-based</b> <b>system</b> using threat modeling tools to elicit the prerequisites for trust in such a system. The result of the analysis is then converted into measures and activities that can be performed to fulﬁll these prerequisites. The proposed measures include hardware identiﬁcation and both hardware and software attestation supported by the Trusted Computing Group standards and Trusted Platform Modules that are included in a connection handshake protocol. The proposed handshake protocol is evaluated against a practical case of a terminal-based casino system where the weaknesses of the protocol, mainly the requirement to build a system-wide Trusted Computing Base, are made evident. Proposed solutions to this problem such as minimization of the Trusted Computing Base are discussed along with the fundamental reason of the problem and the future solutions using the next generation of CPUs and Operating System kernels...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} area of {{ubiquitous}} applications and location-based services has made indoor localization an interesting topic for research. Some indoor localization solutions for smartphones exploit radio information and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), which {{are embedded in}} most of the modern smartphones. In this work, we propose to fuse WiFi Receiving Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) readings, IMUs, and floor plan information in an enhanced particle filter to achieve high accuracy and stable performance in the tracking process. We provide an efficient double resampling method to mitigate errors caused by off-the-shelf IMUs and WiFi sensors embedded in commodity smartphones. The algorithms are designed in a <b>terminal-based</b> <b>system,</b> which consists of commercial smartphones and WiFi access points. We evaluate our system in two complex environments along moving paths. Experiment results show that our tracking method can achieve the average tracking error of 1. 01 meters and 90 % accuracy of 1. 7 meters...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{a growing}} number of {{ubiquitous}} mobile applications has increased the interest in indoor location-based services. Some indoor localization solutions for smartphones exploit radio information or data from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), which are embedded in most of the modern smartphones. In this work, we propose to fuse WiFi Receiving Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) readings, IMUs, and floor plan information in an enhanced particle filter to achieve high accuracy and stable performance in the tracking process. Compared to our previous work, the improved stochastic model for location estimation is formulated in a discretized graph-based representation of the indoor environment. Additionally, we propose an efficient filtering approach for improving the IMU measurements, which is able to mitigate errors caused by inaccurate off-the-shelf IMUs and magnetic field disturbances. Moreover, we also provide a simple and efficient solution for localization failures like the kidnapped-robot problem. The tracking algorithms are designed in a <b>terminal-based</b> <b>system,</b> which consists of commercial smartphones and WiFi access points. We evaluate our system in a complex indoor environment. Results show that our tracking approach can automatically recover from localization failures, and it could achieve the average tracking error of 1. 15 meters and a 90...|$|E
50|$|IBM in {{the mid-1970s}} saw itself mainly as a {{hardware}} vendor and hence all its innovations in that period aimed to increase hardware sales. SNA's objective was to reduce the costs of operating large numbers of terminals and thus induce customers to develop or expand interactive <b>terminal-based</b> <b>systems</b> as opposed to batch systems. An expansion of interactive <b>terminal-based</b> <b>systems</b> would increase sales of terminals and more importantly of mainframe computers and peripherals - {{partly because of the}} simple increase in the volume of work done by the systems and partly because interactive processing requires more computing power per transaction than batch processing.|$|R
50|$|As a result, {{running a}} large number of {{terminals}} required a lot more communications lines than the number required today, especially if different types of terminals needed to be supported, or the users wanted to use different types of applications (.e.g. under CICS or TSO) from the same location. In purely financial terms SNA's objectives were to increase customers' spending on <b>terminal-based</b> <b>systems</b> {{and at the same time}} to increase IBM's share of that spending, mainly at the expense of the telecommunications companies.|$|R
5000|$|The term ASCII porn -sometimes typographically euphemized as [...] "ASCII pr0n"- {{describes}} pornographic images {{consisting of}} ASCII art. ASCII porn was the world's first Internet pornography, and was popular (among the then fewer computer users) before {{the invention of}} the World-Wide Web, and often found on BBSes and other text mode <b>terminal-based</b> <b>systems</b> that could be reached via direct modem dial-up. It was also exchanged via Fidonet and sneakernet and on the early Internet using pre-WWW services such as email, telnet, usenet and gopher.|$|R
50|$|PTT Bulletin Board System (PTT, , telnet://ptt.cc) is {{the largest}} <b>terminal-based</b> {{bulletin}} board <b>system</b> (BBS) based in Taiwan. It was founded by Yi-Chin Tu and other students from the National Taiwan University in 1995, and it is currently administrated by the Electronic BBS Research Society as a non-commercial and open-source BBS.|$|R
