To finish the workpiece with high accuracy, {{it is necessary}} to understand the temperature distribution of the workpiece during grinding process. However there is no study to analyze the temperature distribution of a large workpiece during surface grinding process. In this study, an advanced simulation analysis method of the temperature distribution for a large workpiece was developed. In the developed simulation analysis method, the temperature distribution was calculated from the power consumption of the wheel motor. The power consumption can be obtained easily without any specialized equipment. To evaluate the developed simulation analysis method, in-process measurement of the temperature distribution of a large workpiece was also carried out. A large workpiece ground in this study weights about 1. 3 tons. The temperature distribution was measured with <b>thermistors</b> <b>mounted</b> in many places of the ground workpiece.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{instrument}} for measuring snow depth and snow temperature {{has been developed}} by POLS engineering in Iceland. The snow sensor (SM 4) consists {{of a series of}} digital <b>thermistors</b> <b>mounted</b> with a fixed interval on a pole that extends through the snowpack. An algorithm has been developed to calculate the snow depth based on the temperature data. The temperature profile is obtained as additional information. Avalanches in Iceland are most commonly triggered directly by heavy snowfall and high wind speeds. However, stability tests and data from avalanche crowns indicate that facets {{are one of the most}} common crystal types in persistent weak layers in Iceland. Comparing historical data from the SM 4 sensors to avalanche occurrences indicates that avalanche cycles that are not explained solely by severe weather may in many cases be explained by high temperature gradients for a long time, which may be assumed to lead to the formation of a weak layer of facets. Methods have been developed to detect and visualize layers with temperature gradients that exceed a critical value, assumed to be the critical gradient to produce facets. The duration of the temperature gradient above the critical value is also shown. Showing the location and time periods of critical temperature gradient in a visual way should help avalanche forecasters to detect warning signs related to possible facet formation. This will improve the avalanche forecast for both human and naturally triggered avalanches and decrease the risk of a failure to forecast avalanches that are not a direct consequence of severe weather...|$|R

At each site, a vertical section was excavated and thermistors were placed within the exposed section at measured intervals between the debris surface and the debris-ice interface. The excavated debris was then replaced {{as close to the}} original condition as possible. Rather than measuring surface temperature unshielded from incoming solar radiation, Ts is near-surface debris temperature as the thermistors were covered with a thin layer of debris; the measurement depth of Ts was therefore 0. 02 m. Ta was measured using <b>thermistors</b> <b>mounted</b> in naturally ventilated radiation shields 1 m above the debris surface. All thermistors were connected to Gemini Tiny Tag Plus 2 TGP- 4520 dataloggers that have a stated accuracy of ± 0. 4 °C, and temperature was sampled every 30 minutes in local (Nepal) time = GMT + 4. 5 hours.

The sensor uses ceramic discs of predetermined pore-size distribution (i. e., fixed-matrix) for suction measurement and a surface <b>mounted</b> <b>thermistor</b> to take temperature readings. The ceramic disc assembly of the sensor is brought in contact with a soil for which the suction measurement is required. The sensor measures the water content of the ceramic discs and further uses the water retention characteristic of the ceramic discs to determine suction. The suction thus determined {{is equal to the}} suction of the soil which is in contact with the sensor. Soil–water mixtures were prepared from two clays (Speswhite kaolin and MX 80 bentonite) with a diversified range of plasticity properties and mineralogy. Suction measurements of the soil–water mixtures were carried out at several water contents. The measured suctions of the clays were compared with the test results from a dew-point potentiameter. The test results showed that, very high suctions up to more than 10, 000 kPa and very low suctions up to about 10 kPa can be measured using the sensor. The suction equilibrium time for the soils studied was found to vary between a couple of hours to several days depending upon the magnitude of suction and initial state of the sensor (i. e., wet or dry). Comparisons of the test results from the sensor with the results from the dew-point potentiameter tests showed some significant differences in case of the bentonite, whereas the agreements between the test results from the two devices were better in case of Speswhite kaolin. The test results clearly showed that under predetermined conditions, the water potential sensor can be used to measure soil suction greater than 1500 kPa within a few hours...|$|R
