5|$|Further into chapter 4, Odin {{appoints}} Njörðr and Freyr as {{priests of}} sacrificial offerings, {{and they became}} gods among the Æsir. Freyja is introduced as a daughter of Njörðr, and as the priestess at the sacrifices. In the saga, Njörðr is described as having once wed his unnamed sister {{while he was still}} among the Vanir, and the couple produced their children Freyr and Freyja from <b>this</b> <b>union,</b> though this custom was forbidden among the Æsir.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{television}} producer Joan Ganz Cooney {{and her staff}} at the Children's Television Workshop, impressed by the quality and creativity of the Henson-led team, asked Henson and staff to work full-time on Sesame Street, a visionary children's program for public television. <b>This</b> <b>union</b> of talents would become legendary in television entertainment.|$|E
5|$|In AD 515 Eutharic {{answered}} a summons by Theoderic the Great {{and moved to}} the Ostrogothic court at Ravenna in Italy. Here he was given in marriage Amalasuintha, the daughter of the king. It was Theoderic's intention that <b>this</b> <b>union</b> would create a long-lasting dynastic connection between the previously sundered Ostrogoths and Visigoths. Theoderic also named Eutharic his presumptive heir.|$|E

25|$|The main method {{the unions}} used {{to effect change}} was strike action. Many strikes were painful events for both sides, the unions and the management. In Britain, the Combination Act 1799 forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in 1824. Even after <b>this,</b> <b>unions</b> were still {{severely}} restricted.|$|R
50|$|As a result, Wallachia and Moldavia both elected Alexandru Ioan Cuza in 1859 {{as their}} prince, {{creating}} a personal <b>union.</b> <b>This</b> personal <b>union</b> {{was turned into}} a state union, named Romania, which in 1866 adopted prince Carol from the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family as its monarch.|$|R
5|$|The Battle of Five Forks {{occurred}} on April 1, 1865. Five Forks {{is a small}} community in Dinwiddie County, located between Dinwiddie Court House and Petersburg. For <b>this</b> <b>Union</b> victory, Sheridan received reinforcements from the Fifth Corps and a division of cavalry from the Army of the James. Sheridan's plan was to capture the Confederate infantry that had isolated itself beyond the Confederate line of defense after pursuing Sheridan at Dinwiddie.|$|E
5|$|The Confederates {{were still}} able to {{evacuate}} Winchester (including a hospital), and Averell did not pursue the retreating rebels because he was unsure {{if the rest of}} Confederate General Early's army was nearby. <b>This</b> <b>Union</b> victory was the second of three major Union victories won under the leadership of General Averell.|$|E
5|$|Therefore I shall again {{repeat the}} {{doctrine}} of the Trinity, as it is positively affirmed in Scripture: that God is there expressed in three different names, as Father, as Son, and as Holy Ghost: that each of these is God, and that there is but one God. But <b>this</b> <b>union</b> and distinction are a mystery utterly unknown to mankind.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Marcellus in 23BC, Augustus married his {{daughter}} to Agrippa. <b>This</b> <b>union</b> produced five children, three sons and two daughters: Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Vipsania Julia, Agrippina the Elder, and Postumus Agrippa, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering {{the eastern half of}} the Empire with the imperium of a proconsul and the same tribunicia potestas granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at Samos in the eastern Aegean. This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, {{but it was also a}} measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.|$|E
5|$|Arévalo's {{response}} {{toward the}} non-communist unions was mixed. In 1945, he criminalized all rural labor unions in workplaces {{with fewer than}} 500 workers, which included most plantations. One of the few unions big enough to survive this law was of the banana workers employed by the UFC. In 1946 <b>this</b> <b>union</b> organized a strike, which provoked Arévalo into outlawing all strikes until a new labor code was passed. This led to efforts {{on the part of}} employers to stall the labor code, as well as to exploit workers as far as possible before it was passed. The unions were also damaged when the US government persuaded the American Federation of Labor to found the Organización Regional Internacional del Trabajo (ORIT), a union that took a virulently anti-communist stance.|$|E
5|$|Bheema however {{carries his}} four {{brothers}} and mother {{on his back}} and races through the tunnel and takes them to the hiding spot. There a certain cannibal rakshasa named Hidimbasura lives with his sister Hidimbi. He smells the scent of human beings and orders his sister to bring them. Hidimbi however falls in love at first sight with Bheema. Unable to wait any longer, Hidimbasura comes to kill the Pandavas himself. Bheema however kills him very easily. Hidimbi is married to Bheema. She later gives birth to Ghatotkacha from <b>this</b> <b>union.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1889 a {{dissident}} faction of shoemakers who {{were part of}} National Trade Assembly 216 of the Knights of Labor split off to establish a new organization called the Boot and Shoe Workers International <b>Union.</b> <b>This</b> new <b>union</b> affiliated almost immediately with the American Federation of Labor (AF of L), a federative organization which united many specialized craft unions into a single entity.|$|R

25|$|As Smith noted, unions were {{illegal for}} many years in most countries, {{although}} Smith argued that it should remain illegal to fix wages or prices by employees or employers. There were severe penalties for attempting to organize unions, up to and including execution. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>unions</b> were formed and began to acquire political power, eventually resulting in a body of labour law that not only legalized organizing efforts, but codified the relationship between employers and those employees organized into unions.|$|R
5|$|Cosimo did {{not enjoy}} a {{harmonious}} relationship with his elder son, Ferdinando. They disagreed about Cosimo's bigoted ideology and his monthly allowance. Cosimo married him to a Bavarian princess, Violante Beatrice. <b>This</b> <b>union</b> was exceedingly discontent, and produced no offspring. Anna Maria Luisa was the Grand Duke's favourite child. She married Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, and like her brother, had no issue. Gian Gastone, Cosimo's eventual successor, despised {{his father and his}} court. Anna Maria Luisa arranged for him to marry Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, a union that produced no children.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944, it was {{announced}} that broadcast performers must organize themselves into a union, and that <b>this</b> <b>union</b> would be the only one permitted to operate in Argentina. Shortly after the union formed, Eva Duarte was elected its president. Fraser and Navarro speculate that Juan Perón made the suggestion that performers create a union, and the other performers likely felt it was good politics to elect his mistress. Shortly after her election as president of the union, Eva Duarte began a daily program called Toward a Better Future, which dramatized in soap opera form the accomplishments of Juan Perón. Often, Perón's own speeches were played during the program. When she spoke, Eva Duarte spoke in ordinary language as a regular woman who wanted listeners to believe what she herself believed about Juan Perón.|$|E
5|$|In the Reformed confessions, the Lord's Supper is a {{meal that}} {{provides}} spiritual nourishment. Eating {{the body and}} drinking the blood of Christ in the sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen Christians. Believers are already believed to be united with Christ, but the Supper serves to deepen and strengthen <b>this</b> <b>union.</b> The Supper is also a way to commemorate and proclaim the death and resurrection of Christ. Partakers are to express gratitude and praise to God in thanks for his death and the benefits it provides. The Supper is believed to assure Christians of their salvation and union with Christ, which has been communicated {{to them in the}} preaching of the gospel. The Supper is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. It calls Christians to love and obey Christ, and to live in harmony with other Christians.|$|E

50|$|Halliday {{continued}} {{to work as a}} miner into his twenties, spending time in County Durham, Staffordshire and Yorkshire. He became interested in trade unionism, and around 1860 founded the Wigan Miners' District Union, followed in 1863 by the Farnwoth and Kearsley District Miners' <b>Union.</b> <b>This</b> second <b>union</b> employed Halliday as its full-time agent, and through this role, Halliday became active in Alexander Macdonald's Miners' National Association (MNA).|$|R

5|$|The Battle of Moorefield was a cavalry {{battle in}} the American Civil War, which took place on August 7, 1864. The {{fighting}} occurred along the South Branch of the Potomac River, north of Moorefield, West Virginia, in Hardy County. The National Park Service groups this battle with Early's Washington Raid and operations against the B Railroad, {{and it was the}} last major {{battle in the}} region before General Philip Sheridan took command of Union troops in the Shenandoah Valley. <b>This</b> <b>Union</b> triumph was the third of three major victories (Battle of Droop Mountain, Battle of Rutherford's Farm, and the Battle of Moorefield) for Brigadier General William W. Averell, who performed best when operating on his own.|$|E
5|$|The Reformed {{tradition}} {{holds that}} baptism is primarily God's promise or offer of grace to the baptized. Baptism {{is said to}} signify union with Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection. The baptized is made one with Christ's person, meaning God the Father treats them the same as he treats Christ. Baptism also unites the baptized with Christ's history, meaning that the person {{can be said to}} have died, been buried, and raised again just as Christ was. The baptized person's identity in Christ is based on Christ's action in baptism rather than the person's action. <b>This</b> <b>union</b> also unites Christians to one another. Through the words of institution used in baptism, Christians are also united to each {{of the members of the}} trinity.|$|E
5|$|Warfare was not {{the only}} {{strategy}} by which Andriamanelo sought to expand the territory under his control. Several years into his reign (after the death of his younger brother) Andriamanelo married a maternal cousin named Ramaitsoanala ("Green Forest") who was a princess through her astrologer father, King Rabiby (for whom his capital, the village of Ambohidrabiby, is named), and her mother Ivorombe who is described in legends as a Vazimba water goddess. Through <b>this</b> <b>union</b> Andriamanelo ensured he would become master of the lands around Ambohidrabiby upon the death of his wife's father. Ramaitsoanala took the name Randapavola upon her marriage and then became known as Queen Rasolobe upon the birth of the couple's seventh and final son, Ralambothe only one of Andriamanelo's children to survive to adulthood. Six earlier pregnancies ended in stillbirth or the death of the child in infancy.|$|E

5|$|When {{appealing}} {{for military}} {{aid from the}} American Government {{in the aftermath of}} the Whitman massacre, the settlers detailed the structural weaknesses of the Provisional Government: The very nature of our compact formed between the citizens of a republic and the subjects and official representatives of a monarchy, is such that the ties of political union could not be drawn so closely as to produce that stability and strength sufficient to form an efficient government. <b>This</b> <b>union</b> between democrats of a republic and wealthy aristocratic subjects of a monarchy could not be formed without reserving to themselves the right of allegiance to their respective governments. Political jealousy and strong party feeling have tended to thwart and render impotent the acts of a government, from its very nature weak and insufficient.|$|E
5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli {{was seated}} on Kola or Kolu, an island {{that appears to}} refer to Coll or perhaps Colonsay. The saga also states that Gilli was married to Sigurðr's sister, Hvarflǫð. This marital {{alliance}} appears to further evince the southward extension of Sigurðr's influence. <b>This</b> <b>union,</b> along with the record of apparent amiable dealings with Sigurðr's associates, suggests that Gilli and Sigurðr indeed enjoyed close relations. The earl's family was clearly not adverse to marrying into native dynasties, as Sigurðr's own mother {{was the daughter of}} an Irish king, whilst his wife was the daughter of a Scottish king. In fact, the aforesaid sources appear to indicate that Gilli operated in the Hebrides as a tributary earl to his brother-in-law. Certainly, Eyrbyggja saga states that Sigurðr left menn ("agents") in the Hebrides to collect tax from Mann, whilst Orkneyinga saga reveals that, at a later period in time, Sigurðr's son and successor, Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065), tasked a member of his own wife's family, Kálfr Árnason (died 1051), to impose Orcadian authority in the Isles.|$|E
5|$|Anderson visited Confederate sympathizers as he traveled, {{some of whom}} viewed him as a {{hero for}} {{fighting}} the Union, whom they deeply hated. Many of Anderson's men also despised the Union, and he was adept at tapping into this emotion. The Union soldier held captured at Centralia {{was impressed with the}} control that Anderson exercised over his men. Although many of them wished to execute <b>this</b> <b>Union</b> hostage, Anderson refused to allow it. On October 6, Anderson and his men traveled to meet General Price in Boonville, Missouri. Price was disgusted that Anderson used scalps to decorate his horse, and would not speak with him until he removed them. He was, however, impressed by the effectiveness of Anderson's attacks. Anderson presented him with a gift of fine Union pistols, likely captured at Centralia. Price instructed Anderson to travel to the Missouri railroad and disrupt rail traffic, making Anderson a de facto Confederate captain.|$|E
