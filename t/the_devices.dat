5|$|In April 2009, T-Mobile {{announced}} that it had sold over a million G1s in the United States, accounting for two thirds of <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> on its 3G network. AdMob estimated in March 2009 that Android and the G1 had reached a market share of 6% in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Mobile {{devices are}} also useful for {{providing}} location information; either from inbuilt gps/location tracking or via cell site logs, which track <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> within their range. Such information {{was used to}} track down the kidnappers of Thomas Onofri in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Packaging: SiC chips {{may have}} a higher power density than silicon power devices {{and are able to}} handle higher {{temperatures}} exceeding the silicon limit of 150°C. New die attach technologies such as sintering are required to efficiently get the heat out of <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> and ensure a reliable interconnection.|$|E
30|$|For example, {{consider}} a given <b>device</b> life-cycle. In <b>the</b> pre-deployment, some cryptographic material is loaded into <b>the</b> <b>device</b> during its manufacturing process. Next, {{the owner of}} <b>the</b> <b>device</b> purchases it and gets a PIN that grants the owner the initial access to <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> <b>The</b> <b>device</b> is later installed and commissioned within a network by an installer during the bootstrapping phase. <b>The</b> <b>device</b> identity and <b>the</b> secret keys used during normal operation are provided to <b>the</b> <b>device</b> during this phase. After being bootstrapped, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is in operational mode. During this operational phase, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> will need to prove its identity (D 2 D communication) and to control the access to its resources/data. For devices with lifetimes spanning several years, maintenance cycles should be required. During each maintenance phase, the software on <b>the</b> <b>device</b> can be upgraded, or applications (running on <b>the</b> <b>device)</b> can be reconfigured. <b>The</b> <b>device</b> continues to loop through the operational phase until <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is decommissioned {{at the end of}} its lifecycle. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> can also be removed and re-commissioned to be used in a different system under a different owner thereby starting the lifecycle all over again. During this phase, the cryptographic material held by <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is wiped, and the owner is unbound from <b>the</b> <b>device</b> [147].|$|R
30|$|Figure  7 {{illustrates}} how <b>the</b> <b>device</b> maneuvers into a selected path in Type A. In Fig.  7 a, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is approaching a branch, {{making sure to}} keep the hook facing the path toward which <b>the</b> <b>device</b> will proceed. Then, the hook makes contact with the inner wall and bends <b>the</b> <b>device</b> to proceed into the pathway (Fig.  7 b). Finally, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> successfully passes <b>the</b> branch-off point and enters the pathway (Fig.  7 c). Note that, if <b>the</b> <b>device</b> rotates 180 degrees before it approaches the branched path, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> can proceed toward an opposing path.|$|R
5000|$|Lost Mode (iOS 6 or later) - Flags <b>the</b> <b>device</b> as lost or stolen, {{allowing}} {{the user to}} lock it with a passcode. If <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is an iPhone and someone finds <b>the</b> <b>device,</b> they can call the user directly on <b>the</b> <b>device.</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{defeating}} the eight Robot Masters, the player proceeds to Dr. Wily's fortress, {{which consists of}} six levels that are played linearly. As in the first title, the player is required to fight each Robot Master a second time in Dr. Wily's fortress. However, these battles {{take place in a}} single room rather than a series of linearly connected rooms. The room contains teleportation devices that lead to each Robot Master. <b>The</b> <b>devices</b> can be entered in any order, but are not labeled. Once the bosses are defeated again, the player must fight Dr. Wily.|$|E
5|$|Developer {{communities}} {{have used the}} SDK to port later versions of Windows Mobile OS to older devices and making the OS images available for free, thus providing <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> with the current feature set. Microsoft has tolerated this procedure for some time but decided in February 2007 to ask developers to take their OS images off the net, which in turn raised discussions. At the same time Microsoft offered upgrades to Windows Mobile 6 versions to manufacturers for free.|$|E
5|$|NuScale's design {{does not}} rely on powered water pumps or circulatory equipment. The company claims it can shut down and {{continue}} cooling itself indefinitely {{in the event of}} a catastrophe. <b>The</b> <b>devices</b> are intended to be kept in a below-ground pool, to absorb the shock of earthquakes, with a concrete lid over the pool. In the event that AC power is lost for normal cooling systems, the pool water begins to absorb heat and boil.|$|E
5|$|When a USB {{device is}} first {{connected}} to a USB host, <b>the</b> USB <b>device</b> enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to <b>the</b> USB <b>device.</b> <b>The</b> data rate of <b>the</b> USB <b>device</b> is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, <b>the</b> USB <b>device's</b> information is read by the host and <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is supported by <b>the</b> host, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> drivers needed for communicating with <b>the</b> <b>device</b> are loaded and <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|R
30|$|While {{staying in}} backoff procedure, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> {{continues}} {{to sense the}} channel, {{and as soon as}} an idle channel is sensed, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> starts to reduce its BC for one time slot. When the BC of <b>the</b> <b>device</b> reaches 0, <b>the</b> <b>device</b> can start its transmission immediately.|$|R

5|$|The bombing had {{destroyed}} the north {{wing of the}} school. During the search, rescuers found an additional 500pounds (230kg) of dynamite which had failed to detonate in the south wing. The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to disarm <b>the</b> <b>devices,</b> and they found an alarm clock timed to go off at 8:45a.m. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion may have caused a short circuit in {{the second set of}} bombs, preventing them from detonating. They searched the building and then returned to the recovery work.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus are {{smartphones}} {{designed and}} marketed by Apple Inc. <b>The</b> <b>devices</b> {{are part of}} the iPhone series and were announced on September 9, 2014, and released on September 19, 2014. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus jointly serve as successors to the iPhone 5S and were themselves replaced as flagship devices of the iPhone series by the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus on September 9, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The next {{twelve years}} {{consisted}} of training exercises and maneuvers in the Pacific and the Caribbean, with the Pacific and the Atlantic Fleets. She also took several cruises to South American ports {{and was used}} for the early development of PID controllers. Invented by the Russian-American engineer Nicolas Minorsky for the automated steering of ships, <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> have since become widespread in control engineering. After that, in 1925, she took a cruise to Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
30|$|Besides {{information}} about <b>the</b> <b>device</b> channels, {{there is some}} globally general {{information about}} <b>the</b> <b>device</b> which is not specific to a single channel, e.g. the location of <b>the</b> <b>device</b> and <b>the</b> list of residents who are allowed to access <b>the</b> <b>device,</b> etc. This general information about <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is covered by the field of “deviceGeneralInfo”, which also consists of a list of Information objects, the same as channelInfo.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of PDOs: {{transmit}} and receive PDOs (TPDO and RPDO). The former is for data coming from <b>the</b> <b>device</b> (<b>the</b> <b>device</b> is a data producer) and the latter is for data going to <b>the</b> <b>device</b> (<b>the</b> <b>device</b> is a data consumer); that is, with RPDO you can send data to <b>the</b> <b>device</b> and with TPDO you can read data from <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> In <b>the</b> pre-defined connection set there are identifiers for four (4) TPDOs and four (4) RPDOs available. With configuration 512 PDOs are possible.|$|R
30|$|View Device General Information. This {{operation}} allows {{residents to}} view general global information about <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> This information is usually static or not updated frequently, for example, {{the location of}} <b>the</b> <b>device</b> in a building, the time that <b>the</b> <b>device</b> was purchased, or some other factory information about <b>the</b> <b>device.</b>|$|R
5|$|The sensors were {{designed}} for air deployment by either of two means. The first was by parachute, which would hang <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> in trees, where {{they appeared to be}} part of the foliage. The second method was the use of gravity, which would drive the spike-shaped device into the ground like a lawn dart, burying all but their antennae, which {{were designed}} to appear as weeds. Surprisingly, approximately 80 percent of the air-dropped sensors were found to be operational after delivery.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} had changed again by 1918, when tank attacks would have one tank every 100 or , with a tank company of 12–16 tanks per objective. One section of each {{company would be}} out in front, with {{the remainder of the}} company following behind and each tank providing protection for an infantry platoon, who were instructed to advance, making use of available cover and supported by machine gun fire. When the tanks came across an enemy strong point, they would engage the defenders, forcing them into shelter and leaving them to <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> of the following infantry.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately. Howard Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents with the computer, but the offer was declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one digital camera. <b>The</b> <b>devices</b> were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. The camera was returned to the Cottermans as {{there was no evidence}} of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files. Howard Cotterman agreed to come in the next day, but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E

5|$|In July 1942 the U-boats {{became aware}} of Coastal Command {{aircraft}} using another innovation – sonobuoys, which were {{thought of as the}} air equivalent of the Navy's ASDIC. A U-boat reported them on 29 July being dropped in the north transit area, and they were thought by the enemy to be devices for preventing U-boats from travelling on the surface. They were, in fact, for detecting submerged U-boats, and were used by No. 210 Squadron RAF, operating Sunderlands. In operational records they were coded High Tea. Most crews were unaware of their existence. <b>The</b> <b>devices</b> stayed in use until 1998, when some wartime crews saw them for the first time. Until then the RAF had kept them secret.|$|E
5|$|In the {{parallel}} universe, Walternate's machine has been detected by the Fringe division and Fauxlivia {{and her team}} go to investigate. When Walternate tells them to stand down, Fauxilivia asks him about her recent mission to the prime universe and the part that she recovered. Walternate admits {{to her that the}} machine has been activated, having sacrificed his own son Peter to allow Fauxlivia's son to live. Fauxlivia becomes distressed at Walternate's actions, and later returns to Liberty Island to obtain <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> to allow her to cross to the prime universe, but is caught before she can use them. Walternate locks her away, seeing her as a traitor to his cause.|$|E
5|$|The band applied {{microphone}} placement techniques {{similar to}} those which many orchestras used. The recording process was a deliberate exaggeration of the techniques used by the Beatles in the early 1960s, with a four-track representation of <b>the</b> <b>devices.</b> The guitars can be heard separately on the stereo channels—electric bass on the left channel, rhythm guitar on the right—drums and vocals are mixed {{in the middle of}} the stereo mix. The mixing of the production also used more modern techniques such as overdubbing, a technique used by studios to add a supplementary recorded sound to the material. The band also used a technique known as doubling, where the vocal line used is sung twice.|$|E
50|$|The casing of the Xiaomi Mi1 {{is mostly}} made from plastic, with SIM card slots located inside.

50|$|The host is {{expected}} to be a more complex entity than <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> <b>The</b> host needs to retrieve the HID descriptor from <b>the</b> <b>device</b> and parse it before it can fully communicate with <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> Parsing <b>the</b> HID descriptor can be complicated. Multiple operating systems are known to have shipped bugs in <b>the</b> <b>device</b> drivers responsible for parsing the HID descriptors years after <b>the</b> <b>device</b> drivers were originally released to the public. However, this complexity is the reason why rapid innovation with HID devices is possible.|$|R
50|$|A Coulomb {{blockade}} {{will also}} be observed when making <b>the</b> <b>device</b> very small (like a quantum dot). When <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is small enough, electrons inside <b>the</b> <b>device</b> will create a strong coulomb repulsion preventing other electrons to flow. <b>The</b> <b>device</b> will no longer follow Ohm's law. The current-voltage relation of the coulomb blockade looks like a staircase.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} USB1.0 specification, {{which was}} introduced in January 1996, defined data transfer rates of 1.5Mbit/s Low Speed and 12Mbit/s Full Speed. Microsoft Windows 95, OSR 2.1 provided OEM support for <b>the</b> <b>devices.</b> The first widely used version of USB was 1.1, which was released in September 1998. The 12Mbit/s data rate was intended for higher-speed devices such as disk drives, and the lower 1.5Mbit/s rate for low data rate devices such as joysticks. Apple Inc.'s iMac was the first mainstream product with USB and the iMac's success popularized USB itself. Following Apple's design decision to remove all legacy ports from the iMac, many PC manufacturers began building legacy-free PCs, {{which led to the}} broader PC market using USB as a standard.|$|E
5|$|To {{overcome}} {{the constraints of}} the bocage that had made attacks so difficult and costly for both sides, Rhino modifications were made to some M4 Sherman, M5A1 Stuart tanks and M10 tank destroyers, by fitting them with hedge-breaching 'tusks' that could force a path through hedgerows. German tanks remained restricted to the roads but U.S. armored vehicles could maneuver more freely, although the effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> was exaggerated. By the eve of Cobra, 60 percent of the tanks of the First Army had the rhino modification. To preserve operational security, Bradley forbade their use until Cobra was launched. In all, 1,269 M4 medium tanks, 694 M5A1 light tanks and 288 M10 tank destroyers were available.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{technique}} {{by which a}} device that performs private key operations (signatures or decryptions) in networked applications and whose local private key is activated with a password or PIN can be immunized to o#ine dictionary attacks in case <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is captured. Our techniques do not assume tamper resistance of <b>the</b> <b>device</b> but rather exploit the networked nature of <b>the</b> <b>device</b> in that <b>the</b> <b>device's</b> private key operations are performed using a simple interaction with a remote server. This server, however, is untrusted [...] its compromise does not reduce the security of <b>the</b> <b>device's</b> private key unless <b>the</b> <b>device</b> is also captured [...] and need not have a prior relationship with <b>the</b> <b>device.</b> We further extend this approach with support for key disabling,by which the rightful owner of a stolen <b>device</b> can disable <b>the</b> <b>device's</b> private key even if the attacker already knows the user's password...|$|R
40|$|Authentication in an ad-hoc {{network is}} {{established}} between a first device (for example a service-requesting device) {{and a second}} device (for example a service-providing device) using a third device (a peer device).
