5|$|A {{small wooden}} {{platform}} was built at Hellingly railway station, opposite {{the main line}} platform. This had no connection to the station buildings and was used only for the transfer of passengers between main-line and hospital trains, and kept chained off when not in use. Coal yards and sidings were also built at Hellingly station. The hospital opened <b>to</b> <b>patients,</b> <b>and</b> the railway to passengers, on 20 July 1903.|$|E
5|$|Volunteers: Volunteers form a {{major part}} of hospice care in the United States and may provide a variety of {{physical}} or emotional comforts <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> family, including providing housework, health care, spiritual counseling and companionship. Hospice volunteers also provide administrative assistance to hospices.|$|E
5|$|If {{permanent}} brachytherapy is used, {{low dose}} radioactive sources (seeds) {{are left in}} the body after treatment – the radiation levels are very low and decrease over time. In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues within a few millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised to not hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women {{for a short time}} after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> advise for how long they need to be careful.|$|E

5|$|Social Worker: Every {{patient is}} {{assigned}} {{a social worker}} who visits {{at the time of}} admission to hospice. The social worker function can vary from providing superficial support <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> families to intensive crisis-oriented counseling. Additionally, with a terminal illness often comes more complicated financial stressors; the social worker can be instrumental in connecting the patient and family with community resources including services such as Meals on Wheels. Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E
5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E
5|$|The Faculty of Medicine is {{affiliated}} with a network of ten teaching hospitals, providing medical treatment, research and advisory services <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> clients from Canada and abroad. A core member of the network is University Health Network, itself a specialized federation of Toronto General Hospital, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto Western Hospital, and Toronto Rehabilitation Institute. Physicians in the medical institutes have cross-appointments to faculty and supervisory positions in university departments. The Rotman School of Management developed the discipline and methodology of integrative thinking, upon which the school bases its curriculum. Founded in 1887, the Faculty of Law's emphasis on formal teachings of liberal arts and legal theory was then considered unconventional, but gradually helped shift the country's legal education system away from the apprenticeship model that prevailed until the mid-20th century. The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education is the teachers college of the university, {{affiliated with}} its two laboratory schools, the Institute of Child Study and the University of Toronto Schools. Autonomous institutes at the university include the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies and the Fields Institute.|$|E

25|$|Distinguishing {{science from}} pseudoscience has {{practical}} implications {{in the case}} of health care, expert testimony, environmental policies, and science education.

25|$|Physicians like al-Razi {{wrote about}} the {{importance}} of morality in medicine, and may have presented, together with Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis, the first concept of ethics in Islamic medicine. He felt that it was important not only for the physician to be an expert in his field, but also to be a role model. His ideas on medical ethics were divided into three concepts: the physician's responsibility <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> to self, and also the patients’ responsibility to physicians.|$|E

25|$|False negatives {{and false}} positives are {{significant}} issues in medical testing. False negatives {{may provide a}} falsely reassuring message <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> physicians that disease is absent, when it is actually present.

A common example is relying on cardiac stress tests to detect coronary atherosclerosis, even though cardiac stress tests are known to only detect limitations of coronary artery blood flow due to advanced stenosis.|$|E
