5|$|Fiberglass is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by glass fibers, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 1968, a B-52G, {{with four}} nuclear bombs aboard {{as part of}} Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of the North Star Bay while {{attempting}} an emergency landing at Thule Air Base, Greenland. The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination, the cleanup (Project Crested Ice) lasting until September of that year. Following closely on the Palomares incident, the cleanup costs and political consequences proved <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> risk again, so SAC ended the airborne alert program the following day.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of AIDS in the nation's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by blood bank leadership occurred {{as early as}} 1982, yet {{it was not until}} 1985, when AIDS antibody testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that blood bank industry leaders acknowledged that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions. Shilts' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank industry leaders that screening donors for hepatitis alone might offend the donors, and that the cost of screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year was <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> be feasible.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the film}} {{takes place in}} Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm, {{principal}} photography took place in Luleå (in the north of Sweden) to ensure enough snow and cold weather. The area where the filming took place dated from {{around the same time}} as Blackeberg, and has similar architecture. However, Alfredson shot a few scenes in the Blackeberg area. In particular, the scene where Eli leaps down on Virginia from a tree, was shot in the town square of Blackeberg. Another scene, where Eli attacks Jocke in an underpass, was shot in the nearby suburb of Råcksta. The original Blackeberg underpass that Lindqvist had envisioned was deemed <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> fit in the picture. Some of the outdoor close-up scenes were made in a super cold studio. The jungle gym where much of the interaction between Oskar and Eli takes place was constructed specifically for the film. Its design was intended to suit the CinemaScope format better than a regular jungle gym, which would typically have to be cropped height-wise.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Dubna, {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in 1958 and 1960 aiming to synthesize element 102 as well. The first 1958 experiment bombarded plutonium-239 and -241 with oxygen-16 ions. Some alpha decays with energies just over 8.5MeV were observed, and they were assigned to 251,252,253102, although the team wrote that formation of isotopes from lead or bismuth impurities (which would not produce nobelium) could not be ruled out. While later 1958 experiments noted that new isotopes could be produced from mercury, thallium, lead, or bismuth impurities, the scientists still stood by their conclusion that element 102 could be produced from this reaction, mentioning a half-life of under 30seconds and a decay energy of (8.8±0.5)MeV. Later 1960 experiments proved that these were background effects. 1967 experiments also lowered the decay energy to (8.6±0.4)MeV, but both values are <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> possibly match those of 253No or 254No. The Dubna team later stated in 1970 and again in 1987 that these results were not conclusive.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to their}} intensity, the strongest Atlantic hurricanes have all {{attained}} Category5 classification. Hurricane Opal, the strongest Category4 hurricane recorded, intensified {{to reach a}} minimum pressure of 916mbar (hPa; 27.05inHg), a pressure typical of Category5 hurricanes. Nonetheless, the pressure remains <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> list Opal {{as one of the}} ten strongest Atlantic tropical cyclones. Presently, Hurricane Wilma is the strongest Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, after reaching an intensity of 882mbar (hPa; 26.05inHg) in October2005; this also made Wilma the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide outside of the West Pacific, where seven tropical cyclones have been recorded to intensify to lower pressures. However, this was later superseded by Hurricane Patricia in 2015 in the east Pacific, which had a pressure reading of 872 mbar. Preceding Wilma is Hurricane Gilbert, which had also held the record for most intense Atlantic hurricane for 17years. The 1935 Labor Day hurricane, with a pressure of 892 mbar (hPa; 26.34 inHg), is the third strongest Atlantic hurricane and the strongest documented tropical cyclone prior to 1950. Since the measurements taken during Wilma and Gilbert were documented using dropsonde, this pressure remains the lowest measured over land.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the French opened fire Goliath, {{ignoring}} fire from the fort to starboard and from Guerrier to port, most of which was <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> trouble the ship, crossed {{the head of the}} French line. Captain Thomas Foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between Guerrier and the shallow water of the shoal. On his own initiative, Foley decided to exploit this tactical error and changed his angle of approach to sail through the gap. As the bow of Guerrier came within range, Goliath opened fire, inflicting severe damage with a double-shotted raking broadside as the British ship turned to port and passed down the unprepared port side of Guerrier. Foley's Royal Marines and a company of Austrian grenadiers joined the attack, firing their muskets. Foley had intended to anchor alongside the French ship and engage it closely, but his anchor took too long to descend and his ship passed Guerrier entirely. Goliath eventually stopped close to the bow of Conquérant, opening fire on the new opponent and using the unengaged starboard guns to exchange occasional shots with the frigate Sérieuse and bomb vessel Hercule, which were anchored inshore of the battle line.|$|E
5|$|The fen was {{inundated}} in 1798, and {{the civil}} engineers William Jessop and John Rennie were asked to assist the local engineers Edward Hare and George Maxwell. There was a clear understanding that the outfalls were <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> allow proper drainage by gravity, and two possible solutions were considered. The first was an outfall at a lower level, which would involve hugh expense in its construction, and the second, favoured by Jessop and Rennie, was the provision of steam pumping engines at Pode Hole. These would pump water from the internal drains of the fen to Vernatt's Drain, and the lower internal water levels would allow the existing wind-powered drainage mills to work efficiently. A report was produced, which {{formed the basis for}} the Deeping Fen Act of 1801. The channel of the Welland above Spalding was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains which crossed the fen to join Vernatt's Drain at Pode Hole were made deeper. At the time there were no steam engines working in the fens, and Rennie's recommendation of a steam pumping station at Pode Hole was not implemented.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{any other}} element, helium will remain liquid down to {{absolute}} zero at normal pressures. This {{is a direct}} effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the zero point energy {{of the system is}} <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> allow freezing. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5K (about −272°C or −457°F) at about 25 bar (2.5MPa) of pressure. It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%. With a bulk modulus of about 27 MPa it is ~100 times more compressible than water. Solid helium has a density of 0.214±0.006g/cm3 at 1.15K and 66atm; the projected density at 0K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187±0.009g/cm3. At higher temperatures, helium will solidify with sufficient pressure. At room temperature, this requires about 114,000 atm.|$|E

Jenny and Dean are brought into {{question}}ing; however Jenny tells Megan that Callum was giving it to her, to go on an art course. Samantha talks to Frank again, but when they question him about Irina {{but he does not}} know her. They find out that Irina was Callum's nurse, for his arthritis and that Callum was going to help Irina get her son from Belgrade to the US. Irina confesses that she did cut up Callum, but did not kill him. Irina found Callum dead, so cut him up so that she could forge the last immigration document to get her son to her as Callum had not finished it. Irina tells Megan where the head is, and they find a fracture on his head. Megan and Samantha go back to Callum’s apartment, and Megan demonstrates why Irina couldn’t have killed Callum due to the mark on the wall being <b>too</b> <b>high</b> <b>to</b> be Irina. Megan traces metal to Callum's landlord, Mike Walsh (Kelly AuCoin). Samantha infers that because Cal was under rent control, Mike killed him so a paying client could stay in the apartment. Meanwhile, Lacey Fleming (Mary Mouser) asks if she can go to Megan's work, for a school project. Lacey arrives, and speaks with Dr. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), discussing her work. Lacey tries to get Kate to allow her to see the body, however she refuses. Lacey speaks to Ethan, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and later Megan, who shows her pictures of bodies, telling her about her job.|$|E
