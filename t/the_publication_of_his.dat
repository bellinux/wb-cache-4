According to Siedler, these donations were as high as 80% of his royalties. Speer kept the donations anonymous, both for fear of rejection, and for fear of being called a hypocrite.|$|E
5|$|He {{eventually}} {{did receive}} a degree. Just before <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Dictionary in 1755, Oxford University awarded Johnson {{the degree of}} Master of Arts. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1765 by Trinity College Dublin and in 1775 by Oxford University. In 1776, he returned to Pembroke with Boswell and toured the college with his former tutor Adams, who was now a Master. During that visit he recalled his time at the college, his early career, and expressed his later fondness for Jorden.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Chaplin {{established}} his official filmography with <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> book, My Autobiography. The filmography consisted of 80 motion pictures released since 1914.

5|$|Mickiewicz {{was welcomed}} into the leading {{literary}} circles of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, {{where he became}} a great favorite for his agreeable manners and extraordinary talent for poetic improvisation. The year 1828 saw <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> poem Konrad Wallenrod. Novosiltsev, who recognized its patriotic and subversive message, which had been missed by the Moscow censors, unsuccessfully attempted to sabotage its publication and to damage Mickiewicz's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{macroeconomics}} {{can be said}} to {{have begun}} with Keynes and <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936. Keynes expanded on the concept of liquidity preferences and built a general theory of how the economy worked. Keynes's theory was brought together both monetary and real economic factors for the first time, explained unemployment, and suggested policy achieving economic stability.|$|E
5|$|Abu Nuwar {{spent much}} of his time in exile between Syria and Egypt {{organizing}} opposition to Hussein and the monarchy, all the while maintaining his innocence in the Zarqa incident. He returned to Jordan in 1964 after being pardoned by Hussein as part of the latter's broader reconciliation efforts with his exiled opposition. In 1971, Abu Nuwar was made ambassador to France and he was later appointed to the Senate of Jordan's parliament in 1989.

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{book on the}} fur trade, Innis {{turned to}} a study of an earlier staple—the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, {{especially}} the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500years. While {{his study of the}} fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.|$|E
5|$|Heilmann's {{original}} {{articles were}} publicly ignored by Danish zoologists, but caused considerable unrest behind the scenes. Danish zoologist R.H. Stamm, for example, mocked Heilmann in private letters to Helms shortly after <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first article. Other Danish zoologists openly expressed their disdain for Heilmann's work as well, including the professors of zoology in Copenhagen University J.E.V. Boas and Hector Jungersen. Despite this, Helms continued to steadfastly support Heilmann and his ideas, which eventually began to gain attention from abroad. In April 1913, the American expert in fossil birds R. W. Shufeldt came across Heilmann's first article by chance. Shufeldt, {{who was married}} to a Norwegian, could understand some Danish and was able to interpret Heilmann's work and initiated contact with him shortly thereafter. This opened up the opportunity for international correspondence with distinguished paleontologists for Heilmann, which was instrumental to the recognition of his work outside of Denmark.|$|E
5|$|In June 1910 Pound {{returned}} to the United States for eight months; his arrival coincided with <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first book of literary criticism, The Spirit of Romance, based on his lecture notes at the polytechnic. His essays on America were written during this period, compiled as Patria Mia and not published until 1950. He loved New York but felt the city was threatened by commercialism and vulgarity, and he no longer felt at home there. He found the New York Public Library, then being built, especially offensive and, according to Paul L. Montgomery, visited the architects' offices almost every day to shout at them.|$|E

50|$|After {{retiring}} in 1947, de Sélincourt settled at Niton on the Isle of Wight, and devoted himself to writing. He died there in December 1962, shortly after <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most successful books, The World of Herodotus.|$|R
5|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> third edition, Erasmus {{had seen}} the Complutensian Polyglot, and used its text for {{improvement}} of his own text. In the Book of Revelation he altered his fourth edition (1527) in about 90 passages {{on the basis of}} the Complutensian text. Unfortunately Erasmus had forgotten what places of the Apocalypse he translated from Latin and he did not correct all of them. Except in the Revelation, the fourth edition differed only in about 20 places from his third (according to Mill about 10 places). The fourth edition was printed in three parallel columns, they contain the Greek, Erasmus' own Latin version, and the Vulgate.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in {{the spring}} of 1827, Poe turned over his manuscripts to an 18-year-old printer named Calvin F. S. Thomas, whose family may have been known by Poe's birth parents. Thomas had {{previously}} only printed labels, flyers, and other small jobs. Poe used his own money to pay for <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> poems as the 40-page collection Tamerlane and Other Poems, the only known book printed by Thomas. The collection was pamphlet-sized, 6.75 by 4.5 inches. Poe was 18 years old when the collection was released in July 1827 and only 50 copies were printed. The total production number is the subject of dispute; various scholars believe the number was slightly lower (only 20 copies) or substantially higher (as many as 200).|$|E
5|$|The {{first volume}} of Beebe's {{pheasant}} monograph was published that fall, although the ongoing war made it unclear when the remaining three volumes would be published. The first volume was highly praised by reviewers, and received the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1918. In January 1919 Roosevelt, who was severely ill by this point, wrote to Beebe from his hospital bed congratulating Beebe on <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> monograph. His letter of congratulation to Beebe was the last letter that Roosevelt wrote before his death. Volume II of the monograph was published in 1921, and volumes III and IV were published in 1922. The completed work, titled A Monograph of the Pheasants, has been considered by some reviewers to be possibly the greatest ornithological monograph of the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|The {{process that}} {{ultimately}} led to Accum's departure from England and return to Germany began {{a few months after}} <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> book on the poisoning of foodstuffs. For a long time, many contradictory accounts have been given of the exact circumstances of his exile. Finally in 1951, Cole, in an addendum to the minutes of Royal Institution, proved that the presentation of the events adopted in the article in the Dictionary of National Biography, and also later in the Allgemeinen Deutschen Biographie (according to which Accum was embroiled in charges of embezzlement as librarian of the Royal Institution and escaped to Germany), did not correspond to the facts.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's fame {{reached its}} first peak in Austria and Germany before World War I, helped by <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> letters in three volumes in 1914. His letters are {{expressive}} and literate, {{and have been}} described as among the foremost 19th-century writings of their kind. These began a compelling mythology of Van Gogh as an intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young. In 1934, the novelist Irving Stone wrote a biographical novel of Van Gogh's life titled Lust for Life, based on Van Gogh's letters to Theo. This novel and the 1956 film further enhanced his fame, especially in the United States where Stone surmised only a few hundred people had heard of van Gogh prior to his surprise best-selling book.|$|E
5|$|While {{he agreed}} to relieve Meyszner as HSSPF for Serbia and Montenegro, Himmler did this by {{transferring}} him to Berlin and appointing him as Generalinspekteur der Gendarmerie und Schutzpolizei der Gemeinden (General Inspector of the Gendarmerie and Schutzpolizei in the Reich) {{with the intention of}} establishing a Europe-wide gendarmerie. Nothing is known about Meyszner's activities in this role. At the end of the war, he fell {{into the hands of the}} Western Allies and his high SS rank ensured attention from investigators. He was interrogated by the United States Chief Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality, Robert H. Jackson, in June 1945 and was placed into Yugoslav custody soon after. His involvement in the carrying out of reprisal executions both on his own account and on behalf of the Wehrmacht, and <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> name along with lists of those executed, meant that his fate was certain.|$|E

5|$|During {{his stay}} Lissitzky also {{developed}} {{his career as}} a graphic designer with some historically important works such as the books Dlia Golossa (For the Voice), a collection of poems from Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Die Kunstismen (The Artisms) together with Jean Arp. In Berlin he also met and befriended many other artists, most notably Kurt Schwitters, László Moholy-Nagy, and Theo van Doesburg. Together with Schwitters and van Doesburg, Lissitzky presented the idea of an international artistic movement under the guidelines of constructivism while also working with Kurt Schwitters on the issue Nasci (Nature) of the periodical Merz, and continuing to illustrate children's books. The year after <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first Proun series in Moscow in 1921, Schwitters introduced Lissitzky to the Hanover gallery kestnergesellschaft, where he held his first solo exhibition. The second Proun series, printed in Hanover in 1923, was a success, utilizing new printing techniques. Later on, he met Sophie Kuppers, who was the widow of Paul Kuppers, an art director of the kestnergesellschaft at which Lissitzky was showing, and whom he would marry in 1927.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> memoirs, Chaplin {{began work}} on A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s. Set on an ocean liner, it starred Marlon Brando as an American {{ambassador}} and Sophia Loren as a stowaway found in his cabin. The film differed from Chaplin's earlier productions in several aspects. It was his first to use Technicolor and the widescreen format, while he concentrated on directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward. He also signed a deal with Universal Pictures and appointed his assistant, Jerome Epstein, as the producer. Chaplin was paid $600,000 director's fee {{as well as a}} percentage of the gross receipts. A Countess from Hong Kong premiered in January 1967, to unfavourable reviews, and was a box-office failure. Chaplin was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to the film, which turned out to be his last.|$|E
5|$|The {{important}} {{relationship between}} ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became more feasible {{with the development}} of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication Molecular Ecology in 1992. Molecular ecology uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context. In 1994, John Avise also played a leading role in this area of science with <b>the</b> <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> book, Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution. Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. Molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology. For example, molecular ecology revealed promiscuous sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in tree swallows previously thought to be socially monogamous. In a biogeographical context, the marriage between genetics, ecology, and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called phylogeography.|$|E
