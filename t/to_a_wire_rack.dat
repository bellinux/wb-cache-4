50|$|Pre-heat {{the oven}} to 200°C and bake the bread for 30-40 minutes. The bread should sound hollow when tapped if it is fully cooked. Return the bread to the oven (out of the tin) for a further 5-10 minutes to crisp up the base and sides. Leave <b>to</b> cool on <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rack.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Lee created a product called [...] "Sandra Lee Kraft Kurtains", a home-decorating tool that used <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> and sheets or other fabric samples to create {{decorative}} drapery.

Home-shopping network QVC hired her as on-air talent; {{in her first}} 18 months on the network, Lee sold $20 million worth of products.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{standard}} central vacuum system {{is equipped with}} a 30 foot (9 m) hose, plus standard cleaning tools similar to those used with portable vacuum cleaners. For further convenience, some owners will keep a hose and set of tools on each floor of a multi-story building. When not in use, the hose is loosely coiled around <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> mounted on <b>a</b> closet wall, or {{on the back of a}} door.|$|R
5000|$|Dutton, {{the son of}} {{a banking}} lawyer, was born in the Society Hill {{neighborhood}} of Philadelphia, and began playing guitar at age eight. He wrote his first song {{by the time he was}} in the ninth grade and began playing harmonica in <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rack.</b> Dutton credits Bob Dylan and John Hammond Jr., as well as the then-contemporary [...] "old school" [...] hip-hop sounds of Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, and Philadelphia's own Schoolly D, as influences.|$|R
2500|$|In 1924, Livens {{invented a}} small {{dishwasher}} {{suitable for use}} in a domestic setting. It had all the features of a modern dishwasher, including a front door for loading, <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> <b>to</b> hold crockery and a rotating sprayer. According to family tradition, [...] Livens built a prototype {{for the benefit of the}} family. When it was tried out by their maidservant, she was later found in tears with water flooding across the floor; at that point the experiment was abandoned.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, William Howard Livens {{invented a}} small, non-electric {{dishwasher}} suitable for domestic use in 1924. It {{was the first}} dishwasher that incorporated most of the design elements that are featured in the models of today; it included a front door for loading, <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> <b>to</b> hold the dirty crockery and a rotating sprayer. Drying elements were even added to his design in 1940. It was the first machine suitable for domestic use, and it {{came at a time}} when permanent plumbing and running water in the house was becoming increasingly common.|$|R
5000|$|Compact flowers like marigolds, chrysanthemums, cornflowers and zinnias {{dry well}} in a fan-assisted, {{convection}} chamber. Non-ventilated chambers are not appropriate, because they generate too much moisture. The material must be dried at a low temperature (30-35˚Celsius), over many hours. The flowers are slotted through holes in <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> mesh <b>rack</b> leaving room for the stems to dangle below. The time required depends upon {{the density of the}} flowers.|$|R
40|$|During rainy season, it {{is usually}} {{difficult}} to prepare hay, especially that of high quality. Authors conducted <b>a</b> study <b>to</b> enable farmers to prepare good hay economically, with as little labor as possible even during the rainy season. Methods: Italian ryegrass (before heading) was cut with a mower on a fine morning, dried under the sun until the evening, carried into a vinyl house (32 m^ 2) and further dried {{for two to three}} days in the house either on the floor or on <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> hay <b>rack.</b> Results: Drying on a hay rack produced very good hay. The upper portion of the hay dried on the floor showed good quality, despite the higher water content as compared with that dried on <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> hay <b>rack.</b> The lower portion of the hay dried on the floor still contained too much water and was inappropriate for long term storage. Upper and lower portion of hay dried on the floor and hay dried on the rack were all taken wall by dairy cows, indicating no significant difference of the amount taken. (Received June 30, 1977...|$|R
5000|$|Toaster oven: Toaster ovens {{are small}} {{electric}} ovens with <b>a</b> front door, <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> and removable baking pan. To toast bread with a toaster oven, {{slices of bread}} are placed horizontally on the rack. When the toast is done, the toaster turns off, {{but in most cases}} the door must be opened manually. Most toaster ovens are significantly larger than toasters, but are capable of performing most of the functions of electric ovens, albeit on a much smaller scale.|$|R
50|$|Sliding racks are {{typically}} {{used for the}} storage of framed works of art, where works are hung on <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> connected <b>to</b> tracks that are suspended from channels {{on the floor and}} ceiling, which keeps the racks from swaying. This type of system allows great variation, as the distance between racks can be adjusted to accommodate large or small frames, and works can be organized {{to make the most of}} the space while keeping them in their upright position to avoid damage. These types of sliding rack systems can also be a closed unit, where the end of each rack has a panel with a gasket and closed walls at either end, or each individual rack can be a sealed space in itself, which is typically used for textile display or visible storage systems, where the objects are encased in a transparent rack. Mobile racks can also be utilized to hang textiles, where the textiles can either be draped over a bar, or supported by hooks attached to frames. Racks can also be mounted to the walls of storage spaces, utilizing the perimeter space of a storage area, which is safest for framed objects that should not be moved often, such as framed pastel drawings.|$|R

50|$|Adaptive Wireless Path Protocol (AWPP) is a Cisco's {{proprietary}} protocol for wireless mesh networks. It dynamicallydiscovers neighboring radios and calculates {{the quality of}} all possible paths <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wired</b> network. An optimal path is established through a mesh of wireless nodes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>wired</b> gateway and these calculations are continuously updated, allowing paths to change and optimize as traffic patterns on wireless links change. Furthermore, a self-configuring and self-healing wireless mesh backhaul is created.|$|R
