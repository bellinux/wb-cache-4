500|$|Of the end result, Spotnitz said [...] "I {{was very}} pleased with the way it was executed, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> mystery. He later wrote that he [...] "liked [...] more as time has gone on." [...] Director Rob Bowman {{admitted}} to being tired and not inspired by the time this episode—the second to last of the season—was produced. This lack of interest later resulted in the episode taking extra time to finish. Bowman later recalled that the most difficult aspect of the episode was filming the climactic human sacrifice scene, if only because of the ceremonial mask featured. He explained, [...] "the mask {{scared the hell out of}} me only because I thought, 'Boy, if I don't shoot this right, it's going to be silly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting Holby City origins as a {{spin-off}} from Casualty and the {{closely related}} premises {{of the two}} programmes, the BBC has screened occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled Casualty@Holby City, featuring a number of characters {{from each of the}} two casts. Mervyn Watson, former executive producer of Casualty, has commented on the origins of the idea to fully cross the two shows over for the first time: [...] "I think the idea came from somebody in the comedy department, who casually said to the Controller of Drama 'Wouldn't it be a good idea if...' The Controller did <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea, spoke to myself and Holby's executive producer, got it commissioned by the Head of BBC One and the rest is history." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{was not a}} {{very good}} father about money, because when Pony went to ask him for a five-cent piece he always wanted to know what it was for, and even when it was for a good thing a fellow did not always like to tell. If his father did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> thing he would not let Pony have it, and then Pony would be ashamed {{to go back to the}} boys, for they would say his father was stingy, though perhaps none of them had tried to get money from their own fathers.|$|E
60|$|Well, I fetched him, half-shaved, and {{the rest}} of the {{business}} may be imagined. It is a very fine thing to be a hero with a big H. Henceforth (thanks to me) that was Charlie Scroope's lot in life. He has grandchildren now, and they all think him a hero. What is more, he does not contradict them. I went down to the lady's place in Essex, a fine property with a beautiful old house. On the night I arrived there was a dinner-party of twenty-four people. I had to make a speech about Charlie Scroope and the leopard. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> speech. At any rate everybody cheered, including the servants, who had gathered at the back of the big hall.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{stroke of}} luck that knocked me on my back here at Napier, instead of some hotel in the centre of a noisy city. Here we have the smooth and placidly-complaining sea at our door, with nothing between us and it but 20 yards of shingle--and hardly a {{suggestion}} of life in that space to mar it or make a noise. Away down here fifty-five degrees south of the Equator this sea seems to murmur in an unfamiliar tongue--a foreign tongue--tongue bred among the ice-fields of the Antarctic--a murmur with a note of melancholy in it proper to the vast unvisited solitudes it has come from. It was very delicious and solacing to wake {{in the night and}} find it still pulsing there. I wish you were here--land, but it would be fine! ...|$|E

60|$|The {{battle of}} Fontenoy was {{fought in the}} course of a great war to decide who would be emperor of Germany, in which France and England took {{different}} sides; and this made Charles Edward Stuart, the eldest son of James, <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> moment for trying once again to get back the crown of his forefathers. He was a fine-looking young man, with winning manners, and a great deal more spirit than his father: and when he landed in Scotland with a very few followers, one Highland gentleman after another was so delighted with him that they all brought their clans to join him, and he was at the head of quite a large force, with which he took possession of the town of Edinburgh; but he never could take the castle. The English army was most of it away fighting in Germany, and the soldiers who met him at Prestonpans, close to Edinburgh, were not well managed, and were easily beaten by the Highlanders. Then he marched straight on into England: and there was great terror, for the Highlanders--with their plaids, long swords, and strange language--were thought to be all savage robbers, and the Londoners expected to have every house and shop ruined and themselves murdered: though on the whole the Highlanders behaved very well. They would probably have really entered London if they had gone on, and reached it before the army could come home, but they grew discontented and frightened at being so far away from their own hills; and at Derby. Charles Edward was obliged to let them turn back to Scotland.|$|E
