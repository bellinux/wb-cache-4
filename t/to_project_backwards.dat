MESH uses Edinburgh’s rich cartographic history, generously {{supplied}} in geo-referenfed form by the NLS Map Library, and also creates many new maps using {{information for the}} period 1000 to 2000. The presentation will explore the relative attraction of different digital representations of Edinburgh and explain {{how it is possible}} <b>to</b> <b>project</b> <b>backwards</b> to obtain maps of the pre-surveyed era. The preference for OpenStreetMap will be explained, and some early results of the of the project will be presented...|$|E

5000|$|The rapid {{ascent of}} Prussia and later Germany during the 19th {{and the early}} 20th centuries altered {{the balance of power}} between the two nations. This gave rise to an existential change in the nature of their relationship, {{increasingly}} defined by mutually hostile modern nationalism. Writers, historians and politicians in both countries tended <b>to</b> <b>project</b> their enmity <b>backwards,</b> regarded all history as a single, coherent and unbroken narrative of ongoing conflict, and reinterpreted the earlier history to fit into the concept of a [...] "hereditary enmity".|$|R

50|$|The {{secondary}} chamberlets in {{the original}} description of Cushman and Edwards 1937 that give the stellate appearance were noted by Loeblich and Tappan as resulting from non-porous flaps that <b>project</b> <b>backwards</b> from each chamber partly covering the preceding suture and umbilical region but leaving a small open cavity beneath, giving the appearance of secondary chamberlets.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{techniques}} from futures studies are applicable to historical dynamics. Whether projecting forward from {{a point in the}} past to the present for validation studies, or <b>projecting</b> <b>backwards</b> from the present into the past - many of {{the techniques}} are useful. Likewise, simulations of the past, or alternative pasts, provide a groundwork of techniques for futures studies.|$|R
50|$|Unlike Stegoceras, Hanssuesia, and Colepiocephale, the {{parietal bone}} of Foraminacephale (which {{constitutes}} the back {{part of the}} dome) <b>projects</b> <b>backwards</b> and downwards over {{the base of the}} skull. Two traits also differentiate Foraminacephale from Sphaerotholus and Prenocephale: there are prominent grooves between the central lobe and the lateral lobes, and the opening of the temporal bone is slit-like.|$|R
5|$|The crests of Corythosaurus {{resemble}} {{that of a}} cassowary, or a Corinthian helmet. They {{are formed}} {{by a combination of}} the praemaxillae, nasals, prefrontals and frontals, as in Saurolophus, but instead of <b>projecting</b> <b>backwards</b> as a spine, they rise up to make the highest point above the orbit. The two halves of the crest are separated by a median suture. In front of the orbit, the crest is made of thick bone.|$|R
5000|$|Mental {{time travel}} (MTT) {{is defined as}} the ability <b>to</b> mentally <b>project</b> oneself <b>backwards</b> in time to re-live past {{personal}} experiences, or forward in time to pre-live possible events in the future. [...] It is a concept created by Canadian psychologist Endel Tulving. It does not simply refer to knowing an event happened, but requires conscious awareness that the individual is indeed reliving the episode. Due to this, it is certain that mental time travel requires central executive functioning, and most often a conscious ability. However new research has found many cases in which mental time travel occurs involuntarily without consciousness. Specifically research shows this occurs for autobiographical events, and as a result these cases are more specific and detail oriented. An example of this would be the phenomenon of scent: How a particular scent can send an individual back to a specific event in their lifetime. There is also evidence that involuntary and voluntary mental time travel differ on activation levels in areas of the brain suggesting that they have different retrieval mechanisms. [...] Current research has moved away from the retrospective portion and towards the prospective aspect of mental time travel. There is also extensive research on whether mental time travel is unique to humans as there has been some evidence that {{it may be possible to}} occur in animals ...|$|R
50|$|Aulococerids are {{characterized}} by a straight, slim, conical shell with a large living chamber, simple aperture. The protoconch (initial, embryonic chamber) is egg-shaped and separated from the phragnocone by a constriction. The siphucle is narrow and ventral, constricted at the septa and expanded {{in the middle of}} the chamber; necks are retrochoantiic, <b>project</b> <b>backwards</b> toward the apex. Nacre recovered from aulococerids as well as from belemnites resembles that found in recent Sepia and Spirula but differs from that of recent Nautilus.|$|R

In the M9 the {{propellant tank}} is a sphere below the left fuel tank and does not <b>project</b> <b>backwards.</b> After the Vietnam War finished, most army use of flamethrowers was stopped by the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (concluded at Geneva on 10 October 1980 and entered into force in December 1983). See the Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons (Protocol III), which the United States ratified on 23 December 2008.|$|R
50|$|Although Buriolestes superficially {{resembles the}} predatory {{theropod}} dinosaurs, with jaws lined by finely serrated and slightly curved teeth well-adapted to a carnivorous diet, it {{in fact is}} an early member of the otherwise-herbivorous Sauropodomorpha, the group {{that gave rise to}} the giant sauropods. Characteristically sauropodomorph traits seen in Buriolestes include a downturned jaw tip and a long deltopectoral crest on the humerus. However, Buriolestes also lacks a small head and enlarged nostrils, which are typical among sauropodomorphs, and the medial condyle on the end of its tibia <b>projects</b> <b>backwards,</b> a distinctive feature (autapomorphy) unique to this animal.|$|R
50|$|They {{are large}} (up to 3 cm), fast-flying bees, {{distinguished}} from the closely related genus Epicharis {{by the absence of}} long, whip-like setae that <b>project</b> <b>backwards</b> from just behind the eyes. They are commonly encountered bees in American deserts, and are active at very high ambient temperatures when many other species are in hiding. They can often be seen in large numbers on desert-willow (Chilopsis) and palo verde (Parkinsonia) blossoms. Bees of this genus are of some economical significance in pollinating crops such as Brazil Nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and Cashew (Anacardium occidentale, pollinated by C. tarsata among others).|$|R
5000|$|Retrograde {{extrapolation}} is {{the mathematical}} {{process by which}} someone's blood alcohol concentration {{at the time of}} driving is estimated by <b>projecting</b> <b>backwards</b> from a later chemical test. This involves estimating the absorption and elimination of alcohol in the interim between driving and testing. The rate of elimination in the average person is commonly estimated at [...]015 to [...]020 grams per deciliter per hour (g/dl/h), although again this can vary from person to person and in a given person from one moment to another. Metabolism can be affected by numerous factors, including such things as body temperature, the type of alcoholic beverage consumed, and the amount and type of food consumed.|$|R

5000|$|Einiosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul {{estimated}} {{its body}} length at 4.5 metres, its weight at 1.3 tonnes. Its snout is narrow and very pointed. It is typically portrayed with a low, strongly forward and downward curving nasal horn {{that resembles a}} bottle opener, though this may only occur in some adults. The supraorbital (over-the-eye) horns are low, short and triangular in top view if present at all, {{as opposed to the}} chasmosaurines, such as Triceratops, which have prominent supraorbital horns. A pair of large spikes, the third epiparietals, <b>projects</b> <b>backwards</b> from the relatively small frill. Smaller osteoderms adorn the frill edge. The first epiparietals are largely absent.|$|R
5|$|The ilium of {{the pelvis}} had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the acetabulum), and a narrow brevis-shelf (a {{projection}} where tail muscles attached). The pubic foot was pronounced and shorter {{at the front}} than behind. The ischium was straight and expanded hindwards, ending in a lobe-shape. The femur was sigmoid-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep sulcus (groove). The lesser trochanter of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the greater trochanter, which was short. The fourth trochanter was large and <b>projected</b> <b>backwards.</b> The tibia of the lower leg was expanded at the upper end, its articular facet (where it articulated with the femur) was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{pictorial}} {{evidence that}} by the end of the sixteenth century similar influences may have affected the design of the Scottish galley.

40|$|Two new annual {{species of}} Nemesia Vent, are {{described}} from southern Africa. N. williamsonii {{is characterized by}} bright orange flowers with an inflated yellow palate. It differs from the related N. maxii Hiern by having a spur that <b>projects</b> <b>backwards,</b> not downwards, and bracts that are lanceolate with a truncate base, not triangular or cordate. It is unusual for the genus in having dimorphic seeds.   N. williamsonii occurs almost exclusively in the Richtersveld. but has been collected in a few localities across the Orange River in southern Namibia. N. hemiptera is a delicate, wiry-stemmed annual with small white flowers. The flowers are characterized by a tiny nipple-like spur and a seed that is winged on onlv one side. N. hemiptera isendemic to the Kamiesberg from near Garies to Kamieskroon. </p...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the back}} of the maxilla, the palate form a wide shelf which is deeply notched at the back, forming in part the {{suborbital}} fenestra. Small spikes along the midline of the suborbital fenestra represent the palatine bones, which contact the maxilla. The ectopterygoid bones are three-pronged; the lateral processes close off {{the back of}} the suborbital fenestra, the anterior processes join the process of the palatal shelf, and the posterior process overlaps the pterygoid bone and forms part of the pterygo-ectopterygoid fenestra, which is separated from the suborbital fenestra by a bar of the pterygoid; the same bar is seen in Gnathosaurus, albeit much shorter. As for the pterygoid itself, it was expanded along the midline and <b>projected</b> <b>backwards</b> <b>to</b> connect to the basisphenoid bone and quadrate.|$|R
50|$|Having been a {{combination}} of the carrack and the caravel, the square-rigged caravel was distinguished clearly from both ships by its combined sails (absent in the caravel), with four or more masts, usually three with lateen rigged sails and the fore-mast with two square sails, and by its hull design which was narrower and longer. The square-rigged caravel was proportionally narrower in width and longer than the caravel, distinguished also by the sterncastle, more elongated and usually more <b>projected</b> <b>backwards,</b> and more complex, in two floors or two-deck castle-like, on diagonal gradation in length. It was also distinguished from the caravel by the existence of a lower forecastle and by having a snout or head - a long beak, projecting forward from the bow below the level of the forecastle (both absent in the lateen caravel).|$|R
25|$|Unusually among basal sauropodomorphs, Xingxiulong {{has four}} sacral vertebrae. This is a trait {{typically}} seen in more derived sauropodomorphs, like Melanorosaurus, Leonerasaurus, Barapasaurus, and Shunosaurus.

5000|$|The genus Epicharis {{contains}} {{fewer than}} 40 species of large apid bees {{occurring in the}} Neotropics (from Mexico to Brazil [...] ), most of which possess adaptations for carrying floral oils rather than (or in addition to) pollen or nectar. The floral oils are typically gathered from plants of the family Malpighiaceae, though other plants may be visited. They also commonly gather plant resins for use in nest cell construction. Recent studies have shown they are sister to the clade formed by corbiculate bees (the most well-known and economically important group of bees) plus Centris [...] They are large bees, generally with a black head and mesosoma, and the metasoma is often red, and/or has bright yellow spots or bands.

50|$|Earlier cyclic-type cosmological models had {{an entropy}} {{problem that the}} new cyclic model evades. According to the second law of thermodynamics, entropy always increases. The entropy {{produced}} in one cycle adds to the entropy produced in earlier cycles. If the universe contracts and the entropy produced in previous cycles lies within the observable universe {{at the beginning of}} the next cycle, the added entropy will cause the next cycle to be longer than the one before; or, <b>projecting</b> <b>backwards</b> in time, earlier cycles would have to be shorter and shorter, eventually reducing to zero duration. This reintroduces the problem that time must have a beginning. In the new cyclic model, the observable universe just after a bounce only occupies a tiny fraction of the space occupied by the observable universe a cycle earlier and so only contains a negligible fraction of the total entropy. The entropy building up over the cycles is almost entirely beyond what can be seen and cannot influence the next cycle.|$|R
50|$|The default Pendragon {{setting is}} a {{pastiche}} of actual fifth- and sixth-century British history, high medieval history (10th to 15th centuries), and Arthurian legend. The political forces are roughly those actually present in sub-Roman Britain: Celts fighting Germanic, Irish, and Pictish invaders {{in the wake}} of the collapse of Roman authority. Technology and many aspects of culture, however, progress in an accelerated fashion, such that King Arthur's Britain is depicted as thoroughly feudal. Knights bear unique coats of arms, joust in tournaments, follow chivalric customs, and pursue courtly love. In effect, many trappings of the milieu in which the Arthurian romances were composed are <b>projected</b> <b>backwards.</b> Many of the campaign events and personalities come from the great mass of Arthurian literature composed from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century. That being said, it is also possible to run a Pendragon campaign set firmly in the Dark Ages or in a more fantastic vision of Arthurian Britain.|$|R
50|$|Diplurans {{are mostly}} 2 - 5 mm long, {{although}} some species of Japyx may reach 50 mm. They have no eyes and, {{apart from the}} darkened cerci in some species, they are unpigmented. They have long antennae with 10 or more bead-like segments projecting forward from the head, {{and a pair of}} cerci <b>projecting</b> <b>backwards</b> from the last of the 11 abdominal somites. These cerci may be long and filamentous or short and pincer-like, leading to occasional confusion with earwigs. These cerci give the group its name, from the Greek diplo ("two") and uros ("tail"). Some diplurans have the ability to shed their cerci if necessary (autotomy); of all terrestrial arthropods, only diplurans have the ability to regenerate these lost appendages over a series of moults. Moulting occurs up to 30 times throughout the life of a dipluran, which is estimated to last up to one year. The abdomens of diplurans bear eversible vesicles, which seem to absorb moisture from the environment and help with the animal's water balance.|$|R
5000|$|Feilongus {{is based}} on holotype IVPP V-12539, a skull and {{articulated}} mandible, with on the same plate the detached posterior braincase, of a subadult individual. The fossil is strongly crushed. It is notable for having two bony crests on the skull (one long and low on middle of the snout, and one <b>projecting</b> <b>backwards</b> {{from the rear of}} the skull), and for the upper jaws being 10% or 27 millimetres longer than the lower jaws, giving it a pronounced overbite. The preserved part of the second crest was short with the leading edge rounded, and may have had a nonbony extension, now lost. The skull of the only known individual is 390-400 millimeters long (15.4-15.7 inches) and extremely elongated with a slightly concave top. Its wingspan was estimated by Wang to have been around 2.4 meters (7.9 feet), making it large for a basal pterodactyloid. The skull and lower jaws held 76 long, curved needle-like teeth, eighteen in the upper, nineteen in the lower jaw, confined to the beak ends, the anterior third, of the jaws.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{designed}} and manufactured by the Royal Ordnance Factories in early 1915 and introduced along with the 1.57 inch mortar in March 1915. It incorporated what was known of the German prewar Krupp mortar. This was the first design to meet all the requirements, after modifications to simplify manufacture; it fired a good-sized spherical cast-iron bomb of 42 pounds (total projectile weight 51 pounds with stick and fuze), considered the largest practical size for use from trenches, at ranges from 100 to 600 yards using a simple 2-inch tube as the mortar body. The mortar and ammunition could be cheaply manufactured by small unsophisticated [...] "trade" [...] workshops; the bomb was safely detonated by a standard No. 80 [...] "time and percussion" [...] artillery fuze. Drawbacks were that the steel tail was usually <b>projected</b> <b>backwards</b> towards the firer when the bomb detonated, resulting in occasional casualties and the No. 80 fuze was also required by the 18-pounder field guns which were given priority, limiting mortar ammunition supply to the front until early 1916 when a special cheap trench mortar fuze was developed.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contends that}} the historiography of the ‘late’ Byzantine world, and the thirteenth century in particular, has been compromised. The {{so-called}} ‘turning-points’ of 1204, 1261 and 1453 have come to monopolise a historical narrative which does little more than link these ‘significant’ events together. A teleological and anachronistic metanarrative has been created, which forces ‘historical events’ into a simplistic linear narrative framework, denuding the past of its due complexity. The historiographical treatment of the polities which came into existence {{after the fall of}} Constantinople in 1204 illustrates this macrohistoriographical trend. The perceived ‘success’ of the polity founded at Nicaea, which captured Constantinople in 1261, is repeatedly <b>projected</b> <b>backwards</b> onto the entire period 1204 - 61. Historiographical treatment routinely denudes Nicaea’s so-called rivals of power and potential, through a combination of the events on which historians place significance and the language they use to describe them. This thesis considers in depth the effect that (meta) narrativisation has had on the period 1204 - 14. It thus serves the dual function of identifying a macro-historiographical issue and starting to resolve some of the problems to which it has given rise...|$|R
