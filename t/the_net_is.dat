25|$|<b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> {{lowered into}} the water through a complex system of winches and, likewise, {{promptly}} pulled up to retrieve its catch. At least two men are entrusted with the tough task of operating the winches that maneuver the giant net. Small trabucchi of Abruzzo and Molise Coast are often electrically powered.|$|E
25|$|European seiners {{have their}} bridge and {{accommodation}} located {{more to the}} after part of the vessel with the working deck amidships. European seiners are most common in waters fished by European nations. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> stowed in a net bin at the stern, and is set over the stern from this position. The pursing winch is normally positioned at the forward part of the working deck.|$|E

25|$|Hasek roll: The Hasek roll is a desperation {{maneuver}} {{named after}} Czech goaltender Dominik Hašek. In the stacked pad stance {{the lower part}} of <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> protected very well, but the upper third is completely open. In a last-ditch effort to block an incoming high shot the goaltender can roll around his upper back, flailing his pads through the air and stacking them on the other side. If the timing is right the goalie might get his leg up just in time to make the save.|$|E
25|$|Otter {{trawling}} derives {{its name}} from the large rectangular otter boards which are used to keep the mouth of the trawl net open. Otter boards are made of timber or steel and are positioned {{in such a way that}} the hydrodynamic forces, acting on them when <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> towed along the seabed, push them outwards and prevent the mouth of the net from closing. They also act like a plough, digging up to 15cm into the seabed, creating a turbid cloud, and scaring fish towards the net mouth.|$|E
25|$|The {{non-deterministic}} property {{has been}} a very valuable one, as it lets the user abstract a large number of properties (depending on what <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> used for). In certain cases, however, the need arises to also model the timing, not only the structure of a model. For these cases, timed Petri nets have evolved, where there are transitions that are timed, and possibly transitions which are not timed (if there are, transitions that are not timed have a higher priority than timed ones). A subsidiary of timed Petri nets are the stochastic Petri nets that add nondeterministic time through adjustable randomness of the transitions. The exponential random distribution is usually used to 'time' these nets. In this case, the nets' reachability graph {{can be used as a}} continuous time Markov chain (CTMC).|$|E
5000|$|In New South Wales, Australia, 51 beaches <b>are</b> <b>netted.</b> <b>The</b> <b>nets</b> <b>are</b> {{maintained}} by <b>the</b> New South Wales Department of Primary Industries. <b>The</b> <b>nets</b> <b>are</b> generally 150 metres long, 6 m wide and [...] "bottom-set" [...] on the seabed in depths of 10 m. <b>The</b> <b>nets</b> can <b>be</b> 500 metres from the beach. The mesh is sized 50-60 centimetres. <b>Nets</b> <b>are</b> lifted every 24 to 48 hours for servicing {{so as to}} prevent rotting, to clean out debris and to remove dead sharks and other marine life. It is said that 35-50% of the sharks are entangled from the beach side. Acoustic [...] "pingers" [...] have <b>been</b> fitted to <b>the</b> <b>nets</b> to warn off dolphins and whales and <b>the</b> <b>nets</b> <b>are</b> not in place in winter, the whale migration season. The Department states that <b>the</b> <b>nets</b> have [...] "never been regarded {{as a means of}} absolutely preventing any attacks", but help to deter sharks from establishing territories. <b>The</b> <b>netting</b> program began in 1937 and during 70 years while <b>the</b> <b>nets</b> have <b>been</b> in operation, there has been only one fatal attack on a netted beach.|$|R

25|$|The {{display on}} a net sounder shows the {{distance}} of the net from the bottom (or the surface), rather than the depth of water as with the echo-sounder's hull-mounted transducer. Fixed to the headline of the net, the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance. Any fish passing into the net can also be seen, allowing fine adjustments to be made to catch the most fish possible. In other fisheries, where the amount of fish in <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> important, catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod-end of the net. As the cod-end fills up these catch sensor transducers are triggered one by one and this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel. The skipper can then decide when to haul the net.|$|E
25|$|The main way {{to prevent}} malaria is through vector control. There are mostly three main forms that the vector can be controlled: (1)insecticide-treated {{mosquito}} nets, (2)indoor residual spraying and (3)antimalarial drugs. Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLNs) are the preferred method of control {{because it is the}} most cost effective. The WHO is currently strategizing how to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> properly maintained to protect people at risk. The second option is indoor residual spraying and has been proven effective if at least 80% of the homes are sprayed. However, such method is only effective for 3-6months. A drawback to these two methods, unfortunately, is that mosquito resistance against these insecticides has risen. National malaria control efforts are undergoing rapid changes to ensure the people are given the most effective method of vector control. Lastly, antimalarial drugs {{can also be used to}} prevent infection from developing into a clinical disease. However, there has also been an increase resistance to antimalarial medicine.|$|E
25|$|Purse seiners {{are very}} {{effective}} at targeting aggregating pelagic species near the surface. The seiner circles the shoal {{with a deep}} curtain of netting, possibly using bow thrusters for better manoeuvrability. Then the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> pursed (closed) underneath the fish shoal by hauling a wire running from the vessel through rings {{along the bottom of}} the net and then back to the vessel. The {{most important part of the}} fishing operation is searching for the fish shoals and assessing their size and direction of movement. Sophisticated electronics, such as echosounders, sonar, and track plotters, may be used are used to search for and track schools; assessing their size and movement and keeping in touch with the school while it is surrounded with the seine net. Crows nests may be built on the masts for further visual support. Large vessels can have observation towers and helicopter landing decks. Helicopters and spotter planes are used for detecting fish schools. The main types of purse seiners are the American seiners, the European seiners and the Drum seiners.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>netting</b> <b>is</b> 38 ft off {{the ground}} and 100 ft. tall and the three support poles are 102 ft, 125 ft. and 145 ft. tall. <b>The</b> <b>netting</b> <b>is</b> {{designed}} to show the movements of the wind. Its shape reflects Arizona's enormous cumulus clouds, and the colors were inspired by the blossoms of the cereus cactus which are found in the region.|$|R
25|$|Set {{gillnets}} {{consist of}} a single netting wall kept vertical by a floatline (upper line/headrope) and a weighted groundline (lower line/footrope). Small floats, usually shaped like eggs or cylinders and made of solid plastic, are evenly distributed along the floatline, while lead weights are evenly distributed along groundline. The lower line can also be made of lead cored rope, which does not need additional weight. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> set on the bottom, or at a distance above it and held in place with anchors or weights on both ends. By adjusting the design these nets can fish in surface layers, in mid water or at the bottom, targeting pelagic, demersal or benthic species. On small boats gillnets are handled by hand. Larger boats use hydraulic net haulers or net drums. Set gillnets are widely used all over the world, and are employed both in inland and sea waters. They are popular with artisanal fisheries because no specialized gear is needed, and it is low cost based {{on the relationship of}} fuel/fish.|$|E
500|$|The [...] to [...] {{diameter}} area surrounding <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> {{called the}} [...] "crease". Players {{except for the}} goaltender may not enter the crease while playing the ball. Punishments for crease infractions include a change of possession, resetting of the time-clock, or a possible two-minute penalty depending on the infraction. Opposing players may not {{make contact with the}} goaltender while he is in the crease. Once he leaves the crease, however, he loses all goaltender privileges.|$|E
500|$|If {{the ball}} reaches {{the bottom of}} the screen without being {{deflected}} by a paddle, bounces on the same paddle four times, hits the net, or is deflected into the side of the screen, then a sound is played and a point is awarded to the player on the opposing side. After a point is scored, the ball is dropped from the top of the screen again. Every two times the ball is bounced across the net by the players without a point being scored <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> grows slightly higher, up to ten times; it resets in height when a point is scored. Two large numbers at the top of the screen record the points for each player. Each game costs a quarter, and machines can be set to play one or two rounds per game. Rounds can be set to play until a player reaches either eleven or fifteen points. Whenever a game is won, the game resets into its [...] "attract mode", where the paddles are stretched across the screen, allowing the ball to bounce along to the side and be re-dropped indefinitely. Atari subsidiary Kee Games made a version of the game named Spike, which was functionally almost identical with the addition of a [...] "spike" [...] button; this button made the player's paddle jump into the air, potentially bouncing the ball into a downward trajectory like a volleyball spike.|$|E

50|$|Fish {{was caught}} by means of <b>the</b> seine <b>net,</b> which {{together}} with the curing at the fish pallices had been introduced by English settlers in the period. Two boats, the seine boat and the so-called “follower” were used. The seine boat, a large boat pulled by perhaps {{a dozen or more}} oars, carried <b>the</b> <b>net,</b> which <b>was</b> often 300-400 yards long. An experienced fisherman acted as a “huer” by directing fishing operations from suitable points of vantage. From high land, the huer could see the shoals of pilchards clearly, and he directed the “skipper” of the seine boat, by suitable signs to the location of a likely shoal. On a given signal, <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>was</b> shot around <b>the</b> shoal by the seine boat, and in the meantime, the free end of <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>was</b> picked up by the “follower”, with a crew of perhaps five or six, and the two ends of <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>were</b> brought together. Weighted pieces of timber were placed to prevent the fish from escaping. The escaping footropes of <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>were</b> gradually drawn up until the fish were completely enclosed, and by means of baskets the fish <b>were</b> transferred from <b>the</b> <b>net</b> to <b>the</b> boat, and fishing continued until no more fish could be managed, or if catches were poor. The pilchards were preserved with salt in the “pallices” or occasionally smoked.|$|R
2500|$|When two {{boats are}} used (pair trawling), the {{horizontal}} spread of <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> {{provided by the}} boats, with one {{or in the case}} of pelagic trawling two [...] attached to each boat. However, single-boat trawling is more common. Here, the horizontal spread of <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> provided by trawl doors (also known as [...] "otter boards"). Trawl doors are available in various sizes and shapes and may be specialized to keep in contact with the sea bottom (bottom trawling) or to remain elevated in the water. In all cases, doors essentially act as wings, using a hydrodynamic shape to provide horizontal spread. As with all wings, the towing vessel must go at a certain speed for the doors to remain standing and functional. This speed varies, but is generally in the range of 2.5–4.0 knots.|$|E
2500|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} bottom trawling, {{the mouth of}} <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> held open by a solid metal beam, attached to two [...] "shoes", which are solid metal plates, welded {{to the ends of}} the beam, which slide over and disturb the seabed. This method is mainly used on smaller vessels, fishing for flatfish or prawns, relatively close inshore.|$|E
2500|$|The boat models {{discovered}} at Meketre′s tomb feature several {{different kinds of}} boats, including traveling boats, sporting boats, and several papyriform crafts. [...] Two of the papyriform skiffs have a trawling net slung between them. It is uncertain whether or not <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> meant to be depicted as being under the water or being {{pulled out of the}} water by the fishermen. In the event that the artist meant for the net to be in the water, {{it is interesting to note}} that <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> upside down. Needless to say, the upside down net would not work for catching fish. [...] This ambiguity points up the question of artistic veracity of the craftsmen who make ship models. As is attested by the ambiguity of the holes in the sides of the Phoenician model, and the skiff from Meketre, archaeologists need to be aware of the possibility of artistic error while interpreting ancient ship models. While a mistake involving an inverted trawling net may seem trivial, the lesson is important. It is important for archaeologists to be aware of the possibility that ancient artists may not have been familiar with the finer details of ships and boats.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The net-inserted {{metal matrix}} {{composite}} strip could be cast by a twin roll caster at only one process. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> could <b>be</b> inserted in the strip or lower surface of the aluminium alloy strip. The matrix was Al- 12 mass%Si, and inserted <b>net</b> <b>was</b> made from SUS 304 stainless steel. The diameter of the wire of <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>was</b> 0. 29 mm, and distance between the wires was 0. 98 mm (# 20). The roll speed <b>was</b> 30 m/min. <b>The</b> <b>net</b> <b>was</b> not reacted with the matrix, {{and there was not}} gap between the matrix and <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> <b>The</b> mechanical property of the net-inserted composite strip was affected by the direction of the wire of <b>the</b> <b>net.</b> When <b>the</b> angle of the wire against the tensile direction was 45 degrees, elongation of the composite became better than that of the matrix from 14 % up to 23 %. This reason was improvement of the local contraction of the composite strip. The net-inserted composite strip could be cold rolled. The reduction of <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>was</b> smaller than that of the strip. The reduction of the wire at rolling direction was larger than that of the wire at lateral direction...|$|R

2500|$|Encircling {{gillnets}} are gillnets set vertically {{in shallow}} water, with the floatline remaining {{at the surface}} so they encircle fish. Small open boats or canoes {{can be used to}} set the net around the fish. Once the fish are encircled, the fishers shout and splash the water to panic the fish so they gill or entangle themselves. There is little negative impact on the environment. As soon as the gear is set the [...] scaring takes place and <b>the</b> <b>net</b> <b>is</b> hauled back in. The fish are alive and discards can be returned to the sea. Encircling gillnets are commonly used by groups of small-scale fishers, and does not require other equipment.|$|E
