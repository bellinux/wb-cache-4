40|$|Recent {{analysis}} of the mechanism of the nephridial apparatus of Paramecium multimicronucleatum by high-speed cinematography (300 fps at X 250) confirms the observations by electron microscopy (Schneider, 1960) that once the pore is opened, the vesicle is invaginated by adjacent cytoplasm and is emptied by collapsing under pressure from that cytoplasm, aided perhaps by pressure of the fibrils which anchor the ampullae to the excretory canal. There is no indication of active contraction of the vesicle or its membrane. There is no permanent pore to the vesicle. The vesicle is closed by a sealing of the ruptured membrane where it is {{in contact with the}} pellicular excretory canal. At onset of expulsion of vesicular fluid the membrane across the basal opening of the excretory canal is ripped along one semicircular portion of the excretory pore and is driven up against the opposite wall as a flap while <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>rushes</b> <b>out.</b> A constriction of the vesicular and cell membranes {{at the base of the}} excretory canal reseals the opening. The discovery of the water-expulsion vesicle ("contractile vacuole") of Paramecium is usually attributed to Joblot in 1718, and the observation of the repeated appearance of the ampullary canals of Paramecium attributed to Spallanzani in 1776. These vesicles are and have been repeatedly the basis for study in protozoa dealing with their development and structure and their functions i...|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} European {{pioneers in}} Wellington knew {{the area that}} became Hataitai as [...] "Jenkins Estate". The name Hataitai originated with the syndicate which sub-divided it for building in 1901, and derives from Whātaitai, the ancient Maori name for present-day Miramar. The ridge of the hill was thought to represent the petrified remains of the great taniwha (sea monster) Whataitai, {{one of the two}} creatures who helped form the harbour of Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington Harbour). When one taniwha broke through the rock that separated the then lake from Cook Strait (the story goes), <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>rushed</b> <b>out,</b> leaving Whātaitai stranded on rocks. An earthquake later lifted the monster's body into the hills below Tangi Te Keo (Mount Victoria).|$|R
60|$|From {{inside his}} shirt the steward drew a brace, and to it fitted a half- inch bit from his hip-pocket.

He worked quickly, boring cask after cask down the {{alleyway}} that led to deeper twilight. When he had {{reached the end of the}} first row of casks he paused a moment to listen to the gurglings of the many half-inch streams running to waste. His quick ears caught a similar gurgling from the right in the direction of the next alleyway. Listening closely, he could have sworn he heard the sounds of a bit biting into hard wood.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the telling}} of the myth, Tiddalik awoke one morning with an unquenchable thirst, and began to drink until all <b>the</b> fresh <b>water</b> was greedily consumed. Creatures and plant life {{everywhere}} began to die {{due to lack of}} moisture. Other animals conspired against Tiddalik and devised a plan for him to release all of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> he had consumed. This was successfully coordinated by a wise old Owl, when Nabunum the eel made Tiddalik laugh when he tied himself in comical shapes. As Tiddalik laughed, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>rushed</b> <b>out</b> of him to replenish the lakes, swamps and rivers. The legend of Tiddalik is not only an important story of the Dreamtime, but {{has been the subject of}} popular modern children's books. In some Aboriginal cultures, Tiddalik is known as [...] "Molok".|$|R

6000|$|When {{thrown up}} on the sand Wulf {{tried in vain to}} resist the {{backward}} rush of the water; he and Osgod were borne out again. When the next wave again swept them up Wulf saw the earl standing knee-deep in <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> and as he was swept past, Harold seized him and Osgod, and with tremendous strength lifted them right out of <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> [...] "Keep still!" [...] he shouted; [...] "your weight will help me to keep my feet." [...] Wulf felt his supporter quiver as <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>rushed</b> <b>out,</b> for he was waist-deep now; but directly afterwards he set them both down on their feet, saying, [...] "Run before the next wave comes." [...] Ten yards farther and they were {{beyond the reach of the}} sea. Harold was with them, and directed those who had got ashore to form lines, taking hold of each other's hands, and so to advance far into the surf and grasp their comrades as they were swept up. Many were saved in this way, although some of the rescuers were badly hurt by floating pieces of wreckage, for the vessel had entirely broken up immediately after her course had been arrested.|$|R
60|$|In {{the pocket}} of General Roiz, {{who had been killed}} in the battle, was found a letter from General Menou, expressing fear that the English would cut the Canal of Alexandria and let <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of it and Lake Aboukir into the old bed of Lake Mareotis. It was evident that an immense {{advantage}} would be gained by this. Our own left would be secure against attack. The French would be nearly cut off from the interior, and the British army be enabled to undertake fresh operations. General Hutchinson, however, hesitated {{for a long time before}} taking the step. A tract of rich country would be overwhelmed, and none of the Arabs could say how far the inundations would reach. However, the step was evidently so much to the advantage of the army that at last he gave the order, and on the 13th of April the work began, and that evening <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>rushed</b> <b>out</b> from Lake Aboukir through two cuts. Others were opened the next day. <b>The</b> <b>rush</b> of <b>water</b> quickly widened these, and soon the inundation spread over a large tract of country behind Alexandria.|$|R
50|$|The {{path of the}} {{hurricane}} was thought {{by many to be}} the worst-case scenario for the Outer Banks, just east over the Pamlico Sound. The storm winds pushed <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>rushing</b> into <b>the</b> sound in the form of rainfall back up the rivers feeding the sound and when {{the hurricane}} passed <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>rushed</b> back <b>out</b> causing historic flooding along the Outer Banks in particular in the towns of Waves, Rodanthe and Salvo. The flood caused major damage to the area that can still be seen in Mirlo Beach at the north end of Rodanthe. Flood waters exceeded seven feet in many locations and destroyed many houses and businesses.|$|R
60|$|The {{assembly}} dispersed, and {{the work}} on the canal was resumed with a view of making it deeper. In {{the course of a year}} the excavation was completed, and all was made ready for a new trial. Claudius summoned a new assembly to witness the operation, and at this time, instead of a naval conflict, he made provision for a great combat of gladiators, to be fought on immense floating platforms which were built upon the lake near the outlet which the engineers had made. In the end, however, the second attempt to make <b>the</b> <b>water</b> flow, proved more unfortunate than the first. The channel had been made very deep and wide, so that <b>the</b> <b>water</b> was inclined to move, when once put in motion, with the utmost impetuosity and force; and it so happened, that in some way or other, the means which the engineer had relied upon for controlling it were insufficient, and when the gates were opened every thing suddenly gave way. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>rushed</b> <b>out</b> in an overwhelming torrent, as in an inundation--and undermined and carried away the platforms and stagings which had been erected for the seats of the spectators. A scene of indescribable tumult and confusion ensued. The emperor and empress, with the guests and spectators, fled precipitously together, and all narrowly escaped being carried down into the canal.|$|R
50|$|In one tale, the amemasu {{swallows}} a {{deer that}} has {{come down to the}} lake to drink, but the deer's antler tears open the great fish's belly and kills it. The amemasu's enormous corpse then blocks up the lake and puts it in danger of flooding. A god {{in the form of a}} bird warns the people in villages nearby. The villagers upstream escape to higher ground, but the people downstream, not believing the bird, find the amemasu's body and drag it out of the lake, after which <b>the</b> <b>water</b> comes <b>rushing</b> <b>out</b> with such force that everything downriver is washed away.

50|$|The breaks {{were formed}} {{during the last}} ice age, when a {{continental}} ice sheet extended down from Canada, and blocked off the previous drainage of the Missouri. The ice sheet backed water up into a large lake that filled a basin where Great Falls is now located. <b>The</b> rising lake <b>waters</b> finally broke out from the ice dam. As <b>the</b> lake <b>waters</b> <b>rushed</b> <b>out,</b> they carved a new river channel for the Missouri {{along the edge of}} the existing continental ice sheet. This sudden erosive action cut out the current channel of the river from below present Fort Benton, to the present Fort Peck Dam. This new channel was cut into soft Cretaceous age sedimentary rock, and tributaries then eroded down to the Missouri from each side. The tributaries were quickly carved by <b>water</b> erosion into <b>the</b> same soft Cretaceous age layers on both sides of the new river channel, thus creating the steeply eroded badlands known as the Missouri Breaks.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rushing</b> <b>water</b> carves <b>out</b> small {{depressions}} where soil accumulates, forming micro-islands {{that play}} host to plants that thrive {{with low levels of}} nutrients and shallow root structures. Typical species include Sphagnum moss; carnivorous plants such as round-leaf sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea and S. jonesii), and horned bladderwort (Utricularia cornuta); several orchid species such as common grass pink (Calopogon tuberosus), small green wood-orchid (Platanthera clavellata), rose pogonia (Pogonia ophioglossoides), and nodding ladies’-tresses (Spiranthes cernua). Other plants found in cataract bogs are limeseep grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia grandifolia), Indian paint brush (Castilleja coccinea), stiff cowbane (Oxypolis rigidior), Appalachian bluet (Houstonia serpyllifolia) and northern sundrops (Oenothera tetragona).|$|R
50|$|The play is set by a {{dried up}} well on a desolate mountainside which is guarded by a hawk-like woman. An old man has kept camp there for fifty years, waiting to drink <b>the</b> miraculous <b>waters</b> from <b>the</b> well which {{occasionally}} rise up. Cuchulain {{arrives at the}} spot, having heard a story that <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> bring immortality. <b>The</b> Old Man urges Cuchulain to leave the well, telling of his wasted lifetime there and how, even when <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> did rise up, he was thwarted by a sudden urge to sleep. But Cuchulain is determined to stay and convinced that he shall soon drink <b>the</b> <b>waters.</b> While they speak of a hawk which had attacked Cuchulain earlier in the day, and which the old man claims is a supernatural being which carries a curse of discontent and violence, the Guardian of the Well seems to fall into a trance, arises, and begins to dance with hawk-like motions. She then leaves the stage as <b>the</b> well <b>waters</b> bubble up. Cuchulain pursues her, but unable to find her {{he returns to the}} well to be informed by the Old Man he has missed <b>the</b> <b>waters.</b> Oblivious, he <b>rushes</b> <b>out</b> again to face the warrior women the Guardian of the Well has called out to battle, ignoring the Old Man's pleas to stay with him.|$|R

60|$|Owing to {{the little}} Indian canoe having been wrecked on the sand-bank, Frank and his men had to embark in the smaller of the large canoes; a change which was in some respects a {{disadvantage}} to the party, as Frank could not now so readily dash away in pursuit of game. However, this did not much matter, as, {{in a few days}} afterwards, they arrived {{at the mouth of the}} river by which they intended to penetrate into the interior of the country. The name of the river is Deer River, and it flows into Richmond Gulf, which is situated on the east shore of Hudson's Bay, in latitude 56 degrees North. Richmond Gulf is twenty miles long, and about the same in breadth; but the entrance to it is so narrow that the tide pours into it like a torrent until it is full. <b>The</b> pent-up <b>waters</b> then <b>rush</b> <b>out</b> on one side of this narrow inlet while they are running in at the other, causing a whirlpool which would engulf a large boat and greatly endanger even a small vessel. Of course it was out of the question to attempt the passage of such a vortex in canoes, except at half flood or half ebb tide, at which periods <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> became quiet. On arriving at the mouth of the gulf, the travellers found the tide out and the entrance to it curling and rolling in massive volumes, as if all the evil water-spirits of the north were holding their orgies there. Oostesimow and Ma-Istequan, being by nature and education intensely superstitious, told Stanley--after they had landed to await the flow of the tide--that it was absolutely necessary to perform certain ceremonies in order to propitiate the deities of the place, otherwise they could not expect to pass such an awful whirlpool in safety. Their leader smiled, and told them to do as they thought fit, adding, however, that he would not join them, as he did not believe in any deities whatever, except the one true God, who did not require to be propitiated in any way, and could not be moved by any other means than by prayer in the name of Jesus Christ. The red men seemed surprised a little at this, but, with their proverbial stoicism, refrained from any further or more decided expression of feeling.|$|R
60|$|Qu. 10. Is not Flame a Vapour, Fume or Exhalation heated red hot, that is, so hot as to shine? For Bodies do not flame without {{emitting}} a copious Fume, {{and this}} Fume burns in the Flame. The Ignis Fatuus is a Vapour shining without heat, {{and is there}} not the same difference between this Vapour and Flame, as between rotten Wood shining without heat and burning Coals of Fire? In distilling hot Spirits, if the Head of the Still be taken off, the Vapour which ascends out of the Still will take fire at the Flame of a Candle, and turn into Flame, and the Flame will run along the Vapour from the Candle to the Still. Some Bodies heated by Motion, or Fermentation, if the heat grow intense, fume copiously, and if the heat be great enough the Fumes will shine and become Flame. Metals in fusion do not flame {{for want of a}} copious Fume, except Spelter, which fumes copiously, and thereby flames. All flaming Bodies, as Oil, Tallow, Wax, Wood, fossil Coals, Pitch, Sulphur, by flaming waste and vanish into burning Smoke, which Smoke, if the Flame be put out, is very thick and visible, and sometimes smells strongly, but in the Flame loses its smell by burning, and according {{to the nature of the}} Smoke the Flame is of several Colours, as that of Sulphur blue, that of Copper open'd with sublimate green, that of Tallow yellow, that of Camphire white. Smoke passing through Flame cannot but grow red hot, and red hot Smoke can have no other appearance than that of Flame. When Gun-powder takes fire, it goes away into Flaming Smoke. For the Charcoal and Sulphur easily take fire, and set fire to the Nitre, and the Spirit of the Nitre being thereby rarified into Vapour, <b>rushes</b> <b>out</b> with Explosion much after the manner that <b>the</b> Vapour of <b>Water</b> <b>rushes</b> <b>out</b> of an Æolipile; the Sulphur also being volatile is converted into Vapour, and augments the Explosion. And the acid Vapour of the Sulphur (namely that which distils under a Bell into Oil of Sulphur,) entring violently into the fix'd Body of the Nitre, sets loose the Spirit of the Nitre, and excites a great Fermentation, whereby the Heat is farther augmented, and the fix'd Body of the Nitre is also rarified into Fume, and the Explosion is thereby made more vehement and quick. For if Salt of Tartar be mix'd with Gun-powder, and that Mixture be warm'd till it takes fire, the Explosion will be more violent and quick than that of Gun-powder alone; which cannot proceed from any other cause than the action of the Vapour of the Gun-powder upon the Salt of Tartar, whereby that Salt is rarified. The Explosion of Gun-powder arises therefore from the violent action whereby all the Mixture being quickly and vehemently heated, is rarified and converted into Fume and Vapour: which Vapour, by the violence of that action, becoming so hot as to shine, appears in the form of Flame.|$|R
