5000|$|Critic Jerry Renshaw lauded {{the film}} and wrote, [...] "On the surface, Union Station is a fairly routine action film for 1950, with its high level of suspense, strong-arm police {{procedural}} tactics, and caper-film trappings. However, a definite noir outlook is belied (sic) {{by the fact that}} the police play as rough as the bad guys, blurring the lines of good and evil. Audiences are used to seeing Barry Fitzgerald as a kindly Irish priest in most roles; during the scene on the empty platform, though, Fitzgerald's Inspector Donnelly tells the cops in his most charming Father O'Flaherty voice, 'Make it look accidental.' That's one of the more chilling moments of noir, more suited to James Ellroy <b>than</b> <b>Fifties</b> Hollywood. Director Maté also helmed the classic D.O.A. in 1950." ...|$|R
