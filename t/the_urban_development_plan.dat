40|$|This article {{discusses}} the conceptual requirements in preparing an evaluation framework for <b>the</b> <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> in Iran {{as well as}} modifies the evaluation criteria proposed in previous studies. Although applying a highly refined evaluation framework for assessing <b>the</b> quality of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>plans</b> can increase <b>the</b> efficiency of the development process, employing an unmodified framework in a specific urban context may negatively affect the development process because of exclusive conditions.

With no centralised leadership beyond the small assembly that organized the original environmental protest, the protests have been compared to the Occupy movement and the May 1968 events. Social media played a key part in the protests, not least because much of the Turkish media downplayed the protests, particularly in the early stages. Three and a half million people (out of Turkey's population of 80 million) are estimated to have taken an active part in almost 5,000 demonstrations across Turkey connected with the original Gezi Park protest.
