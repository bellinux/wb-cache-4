5|$|Measurements of the {{interaction}} between energetic photons and hadrons show that {{the interaction}} is much more intense than expected by <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> merely photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> energetic photons with protons is similar to <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> photons with neutrons {{in spite of the fact}} that the electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. A theory called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this effect. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon which interacts only with electric charges and vector meson. However, if experimentally probed at very short distances, the intrinsic structure of the photon is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon components, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described by the photon structure function. A comprehensive comparison of data with theoretical predictions was presented in a review in 2000.|$|E

5|$|All Galilean moons have thin atmospheres with surface {{pressures}} {{in the range}} 0.01–1nbar, which in turn support substantial ionospheres with electron densities {{in the range of}} 1,000–10,000cm−3. The co-rotational flow of cold magnetospheric plasma is partially diverted around them by the currents induced in their ionospheres, creating wedge-shaped structures known as Alfvén wings. <b>The</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> the large moons with the co-rotational flow is similar to <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> the solar wind with the non-magnetized planets like Venus, although the co-rotational speed is usually subsonic (the speeds vary from 74 to 328km/s), which prevents the formation of a bow shock. The pressure from the co-rotating plasma continuously strips gases from the moons' atmospheres (especially from that of Io), and some of these atoms are ionized and brought into co-rotation. This process creates gas and plasma tori in the vicinity of moons' orbits with the Ionian torus being the most prominent. In effect, the Galilean moons (mainly Io) serve as the principal plasma sources in Jupiter's inner and middle magnetosphere. Meanwhile, the energetic particles are largely unaffected by the Alfvén wings and have free access to the moons' surfaces (except Ganymede's).|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in the mathematical derivation below, the X-ray scattering {{is determined by the}} density of electrons within the crystal.

5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E

The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This is caused by <b>the</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. <b>The</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E
