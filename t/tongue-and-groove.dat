5|$|In general, humans {{consider}} woodpeckers in a favourable light; {{they are}} viewed as interesting birds and fascinating to watch as they drum or forage. However, their activities are not universally appreciated. Some individual birds habitually excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, and there are various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting, that the birds find attractive for drumming. Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or {{at the corners of}} <b>tongue-and-groove</b> boarding. The birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind the woodwork.|$|E
25|$|Employing asymmetry, heavy massing, {{high quality}} brickwork, {{semi-circular}} forms and simplified ornamentation, {{the design of}} St Paul's combines characteristics of Gothic, Romanesque and Arts and Crafts styles. The church is constructed in dark-red-brown Flemish bond brickwork, with painted render dressings defining features such as string courses, copings, lintels and sills (internally and externally). Stepped and plain buttresses support the exterior walls, and arched openings are constructed from multiple rowlock (brick-on-edge) courses. The prominent roof form is clad with rib-and-pan profile metal sheeting (replaced in 1997), and features flared eaves supported on decoratively trimmed rafters with a raked soffit of <b>tongue-and-groove</b> boards. The nave end walls are topped with stone cross finials, and gable ends to the vestries and entrance porch are finished with basket weave patterned brickwork. The entrance porch features a radiating arch with deep angled brick jambs, rounded window openings and a boarded ceiling. The belfry atop the octagonal bell tower is enclosed with fixed timber louvres between brick piers of alternating, three-course bands of rendered and face brickwork capped by a concrete hemispherical cupola.|$|E
500|$|As {{the family}} expanded, {{the house was}} {{enlarged}} and improved. [...] In 1915, the muslin ceiling was replaced with plaster. [...] Two years later, wood <b>tongue-and-groove</b> flooring was installed. [...] In 1924, two additions were made. [...] The space between the two arms of the L was framed in {{and covered with a}} shed roof; the resulting southeast corner room was left unfinished and used as a laundry room. [...] The west sod wall of the house was removed completely, and a second shed-roofed addition constructed to extend the house to the west. [...] Both additions were clad in wooden shingles. [...] William Dowse, Jr. and his wife Inez occupied the western addition.|$|E
2500|$|The main armour belt was [...] {{high and}} covered the hull side from the main {{armoured}} deck to finish [...] below the deep waterline. Post-World War I studies had indicated {{that it was possible}} for delayed-action AP shells to dive under a shallow belt and penetrate into vital areas of the ship and therefore the main belt was made to extend as far below the waterline as possible. Along the ship, the belt started just forward of the forward turret and finished just aft of the aft turret. The armour consisted of three equal-depth strakes, The strakes were <b>tongue-and-grooved</b> together, and each individual plate in a strake was keyed into neighbouring plates. The belt was at its thickest above and at the waterline. Most secondary and some primary sources describe the maximum thickness of the belt armour varying between 14 and 15 inches (possibly due to rounding up to the nearest inch). Some sources give more detail: along the magazines, the belt was 14.7inches thick (373mm); over the machinery spaces, the belt was 13.7inches (349mm). The lower section of belt tapered to a thickness of between 4.5in and 5.5in. Armour protection was even better than the thickness of armour would indicate due to the improved qualities of the cemented armour which provided excellent resistance. The armoured belt, together with armoured bulkheads fore and aft and the armoured main deck, formed an [...] "armoured citadel" [...] protecting magazines and machinery. The armoured bulkhead was 12in (305mm) thick forward and 10in (254mm) thick at the after end of the citadel The main armoured belt extended forward and aft of the main armoured bulkheads with reduced height to protect the waterline and gradually reduced in thickness from 13 to 5.5inches. Immune zone calculations vary widely from source to source. The armour provision was designed to offer protection from guns of a greater calibre than the class mounted themselves, and was on a scale second to none at the time the ships were designed. Indeed, the armour protection of these vessels was subsequently exceeded only by the Japanese battleships of the Yamato class.|$|R

2500|$|The Wiechers-Villaronga Residence is a [...] "U" [...] shaped, one-storied structure, {{measuring}} 68'-10" [...] {{in width}} by 95'-2" [...] in length, {{located at the}} northeast corner of Reina and Mendez Vigo Streets. Behind all its highly elaborated decoration, with European Baroque influence, essentially the structure is Neo-Classic in style, making a unique and yet elegant combination of both styles. The building rests on a rusticated stone podium; its facades and main walls are of brick masonry with some interior partitions and walls of the gallery and kitchen in wood. Wooden beams supports a galvanized zinc roof. The windows and doors of the building are wooden with movable louvers and fixed colored glass inlets. A variety of flooring material is used throughout the house: from native cement-colored tiles in the dining area and vestibule, 1" [...] by 6" [...] <b>tongue-and-groove</b> wood slats in the living area and bedrooms, and ceramic tiles in the bathroom, to marble tiles at the entry-way.|$|E
2500|$|At a size of [...] long, [...] {{wide and}} [...] high, the Hall {{provided}} space for seating 1,500. In 1913 {{the ceiling was}} plastered with a cornice and a [...] "deep frieze of a delicate tint, and a picture moulding" [...] around three sides of the Hall; this has now been replaced. The four main reinforced concrete roof beams create five ceiling bays, and in each bay are three plaster centrepieces representing vines and grapes. These are ventilator-covers. The middle one of each three originally carried copper bronze electroliers with chains and Holophane reflectors. (Today, more numerous and bigger lights are fixed there.) The walls were originally largely of glass and painted in eau de nil or pale green, with a darker shade on the dado. The special dance floor was rock maple over concrete, and the acoustics {{were said to be}} [...] "perfect". There was a further tiered seating area on the roof for 1,100 deckchairs facing the cast iron bandstand and linking the roof with the Downs. The roof was [...] "illuminated by five electric light standards, and the columns, the upper ornamental part of the bandstand, and the ribs of the bandstand roof [...] picked out with fairylights." [...] The box office in the vestibule was [...] "artistically designed [...] [...] [...] of brick faced with plaster in the Georgian style." [...] The marble plaque on its front was carved by Emil Fuchs who had designed the King Edward VII Coronation Medal. The old <b>tongue-and-groove</b> wood flooring of the vestibule was now replaced with terrazzo paving, with the town crest decorating the area in front of the kiosk (today this is covered over, or possibly removed). Over the Hall's exit doors (now removed) and over the kiosk were bullseye glass circles.|$|E
