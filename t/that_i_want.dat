As detailed in her 2002 autobiography, I'm the One <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want,</b> in 1995, her substance abuse was evident during a performance in Monroe, Louisiana, where she was booed off the stage by 800 college students after going on the stage drunk.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Oxford {{just after}} the September 11 attacks, Clinton was drawn to other American {{students}} who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told Talk magazine:Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be around Americans – people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.|$|E

In fact, he comprehended the situation perfectly.|$|R

500|$|Though [...] "outwardly nerveless", {{according}} to military historian Patrick Bishop, Shannon was {{not immune to}} dread feelings. As they prepared to depart {{on one of their}} night missions, Cheshire commented on the beautiful sunset, to which Shannon replied, [...] "I don't give a fuck about <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to see the sunrise". Having been raised to acting squadron leader, he was awarded a bar to his DSO on 26September 1944 for [...] "courage of high order on numerous sorties".

500|$|Whereas {{the first}} song {{was a little bit}} more artistic and a little bit more soulful, and it has done everything, it {{probably}} exceeded my expectations, I mean, from the moment I was able to give it away. I was able to kind of be reintroduced in a way musically, and thank you to [...] Diplo, but 'Scream' is really like the next step.

500|$|Chaplin felt The Gold Rush was {{the best}} film he had made to that point. It opened in August 1925 {{and became one of}} the highest-grossing films of the silent era with a profit of $5 million. The comedy {{contains}} some of Chaplin's most famous sequences, such as the Tramp eating his shoe and the [...] "Dance of the Rolls". Macnab has called it [...] "the quintessential Chaplin film". Chaplin stated, [...] "This is the picture <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be remembered by" [...] {{at the time of the}} film's release.|$|E
500|$|On June 2, 2016, it {{was officially}} {{announced}} that Lansbury {{would return to}} Broadway in the 2017–18 season in a revival of Enid Bagnold's 1955 play The Chalk Garden. The play will be produced by Scott Rudin at a theatre to-be-announced. However, in an interview published on September 20, 2016, Lansbury stated that {{she will not be}} performing in The Chalk Garden, stating, in part: [...] "At my time of life, I've decided <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be with family more and being alone in New York doing a play requires an extraordinary amount of time left alone." ...|$|E

500|$|Though Lawson {{has enjoyed}} a {{successful}} career in cookery, {{she is not a}} trained chef, and does not like being referred to as a [...] "celebrity chef". Furthermore, she does not see herself as a cook or an expert in her field. Throughout Lawson's television programmes, she emphasises that she cooks for her own pleasure, for enjoyment, and that she finds cooking therapeutic. When deciding upon which recipes to feature in her books, she takes the view of the eater, stating, [...] "If it's something I don't want to carry on eating once I'm full, then I don't want the recipe ... I have to feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to cook the thing again".|$|E
500|$|In a January 1996 murder case, the {{defendant}} counsel for Brian Bassett, 16, and Nicholaus McDonald, 18, {{claimed that the}} pair listened to [...] "Israel's Son", from Frogstomp, which contributed {{to the murder of}} Bassett's parents and a younger brother. McDonald's lawyer cited the lyrics [...] "'Hate is what I feel for you/I want you to know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you dead'" [...] which were [...] "almost a script. They're relevant to everything that happened". The band's manager, Watson, issued a statement that they did not condone nor intend any such acts of violence. Prosecutors rejected the defence case and convinced the jury that the murder was committed to [...] "steal money and belongings and run off to California." ...|$|E
500|$|The set {{was already}} being broken down {{the day after}} filming finished. Debra Messing, who plays Grace, said it was [...] "cordoned off like an {{accident}} scene. It {{was a shock to}} see parts of it gone already." [...] Each cast member was allowed to keep their favorite souvenir from the set. Messing took the door to Grace's office; she wanted to lean it up against the wall at her house as a piece of modern art. Sean Hayes was given a couple of pieces from Will's apartment: [...] "There's a leather box that was on Will’s desk <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to find a place for." [...] Mullally chose a simple portrait from one of the walls, and McCormack took a small ceramic dog, though he said he would have taken everything if he could.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} years of Dallas, Principal took certain {{measures}} in her personal life in order to add depth to her character. She initially was very distant from the cast and they assumed she didn't like them. Series producer Leonard Katzman confronted her about the issue and she said, [...] "I like everybody. It's just <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to feel like an outsider, like Pam Barnes does, being married to a Ewing." [...] Principal also took to other ways of improving her character, such as taking voice lessons to perfect a Texas accent. Her relationship with Patrick Duffy's character, Bobby, was a central component to the show, and when Duffy returned to Dallas in 1986, after being killed off a year earlier, the entire previous year had been written off as Pam's dream.|$|E
500|$|Lovato's fifth album, Confident, was {{released}} on October 16, 2015, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people what I can really do." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{he first}} started {{composing}} Schyman scored his music by playing {{it on the}} piano {{without the aid of}} computers, but now he composes digitally using Digital Performer and [...] "the latest technology". He considers himself to be a [...] "very intuitive composer", in that he has [...] "something in my mind’s ear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to achieve" [...] and improvises until the music he is creating matches up with it. He finds that the hardest part of composing for a project is finding the basic concept for the music that he wants to use, rather than composing any of the individual pieces. Although he has written a concerto, Schyman does not regularly compose [...] "art music" [...] pieces, as he finds his commercial work to be [...] "satisfying music from a creative standpoint".|$|E

500|$|Haley {{exercised}} discretion over content, guided MalcolmX {{in critical}} stylistic and rhetorical choices, and compiled the work. In the epilogue to the Autobiography, Haley describes an agreement he made with MalcolmX, who demanded that: [...] "Nothing {{can be in}} this book's manuscript that I didn't say and nothing can be left out <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> in it." [...] As such, Haley wrote an addendum to the contract specifically referring to the book as an [...] "as told to" [...] account. In the agreement, Haley gained an [...] "important concession": [...] "I asked for—and he gave—his permission {{that at the end}} of the book I could write comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review." [...] These comments became the epilogue to the Autobiography, which Haley wrote after the death of his subject.|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{created a}} pair of razor-blade sunglasses—which she {{believed}} portrayed tough female spirit—to wear in the video, explaining [...] "I wanted to design a pair {{for some of the}} toughest chicks and some of my girlfriends ... they used to keep razor blades in the side of their mouths ... That tough female spirit is something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to project. It's meant to be, 'This is my shield, this is my weapon, this is my inner sense of fame, this is my monster.' Gaga also said that the video shows [...] "how the entertainment industry can, in a metaphorical way, simulate human trafficking - products being sold, the woman perceived as a commodity." [...] The white latex suits in the video were inspired by the wolf costume from the film Where the Wild Things Are. Gaga also wore designer Alexander McQueen's [...] high shoes and the famous [...] "Alien" [...] shoes.|$|E
500|$|Given the UFA's formal {{adoption}} of the goal of replacing Stewart's Liberal government with a Farmer government, it remained surprisingly friendly towards the Premier. While campaigning for Moore during the Cochrane by-election, Wood called Stewart [...] "an honourable, upright citizen, doing {{the best he could}} under difficult circumstances" [...] and boasted that [...] "if I have got to tear down the character of an honourable man to build up something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want,</b> I am not going to build it up." [...] When at last the general election came, in 1921, the UFA declined to run a candidate in Stewart's Sedgewick riding as a sign of respect to the Premier. After the UFA swept to victory, there was even speculation that Stewart, still a UFA member, would stay on as Premier of a new Farmer's government (as part of its opposition to [...] "old style politics," [...] the UFA had contested the election without designating a leader), but he announced otherwise.|$|E
