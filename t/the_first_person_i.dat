500|$|More recently, IM Hans Berliner, {{a former}} World Champion of Correspondence Chess, claimed in his 1999 book The System that 1.d4 gives White a large, and {{possibly}} decisive, advantage. Berliner asserted that with best play White wins against the Grünfeld Defense, the Modern Benoni, the Benko Gambit and other (unnamed) [...] "major defences", and achieves {{at least a}} large advantage in many lines of the Queen's Gambit Declined. However, he allowed that, [...] "It {{is possible that the}} rules of chess are such that only some number of plausible-appearing defences to 1.d4 can be refuted." [...] Berliner wrote that Adams' [...] "theories, though looked upon with scorn by most top chess players, made an immediate and lasting impression on me. Weaver W. Adams was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> met who actually had theories about how chess should be played." ...|$|E
2500|$|White {{claimed to}} have found {{inspiration}} for his first murder while watching RoboCop 2: [...] "The first girl I killed was from a 'RoboCop' movie... I seen him cut somebody's throat then take the knife and slit down the chest to the stomach and left the body in a certain position. With <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> killed I did exactly what I saw in the movie." ...|$|E

Weaver W. Adams was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> met who actually had theories about how chess should be played." [...] Berliner is himself a controversial figure, who argued in his 1999 book The System, that 1.d4 may win by force for White.|$|E

So far as I remember, my only request, when I gave you your liberty and half my income, was that your friendship with the Draconmeyers should decrease. Almost <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>persons</b> <b>I</b> see on my arrival in Monte Carlo are you and Mr. Draconmeyer. I learn that you came out with them and that you are staying at the same hotel." ...|$|R

2500|$|Eventually, actors Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law {{were cast}} to replace Heath Ledger in certain scenes, portraying the new idea of {{transformed}} versions of Ledger's character travelling through magical realms, while the footage shot with Ledger {{would remain in}} the film as his character's [...] "real-world" [...] appearance. Gilliam told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Then we made the quantum leap: What if we get three actors to replace him? [...] Johnny was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> called. He said, 'Done. I'm there.' Same with Jude and Colin." [...] Depp, a friend of Gilliam's who starred in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the aborted The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, had been compared to Ledger by cinematographer Nicola Pecorini. Law was also a friend of Ledger's and had been considered {{for the role of}} Tony, and Farrell had also been friends with Ledger.|$|E
2500|$|Sevag Balikci, [...] a Turkish {{soldier of}} Armenian descent, {{was shot dead}} on April 24, 2011, {{the day of the}} {{commemoration}} of the Armenian Genocide during his military service in Batman. It was later discovered that killer Kıvanç Ağaoğlu was an ultra-nationalist. Through his Facebook profile, it was uncovered that he was a sympathizer of nationalist politician Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu and Turkish agent / contract killer Abdullah Çatlı, who himself had a history of anti-Armenian activity, such as the Armenian Genocide Memorial bombing in a Paris suburb in 1984. His Facebook profile also showed that he was a Great Union Party (BBP) sympathizer, a far-right nationalist party in Turkey. Testimony given by Sevag Balıkçı's fiancée stated that he was subjected to psychological pressure at the military compound. She was told by Sevag over the phone that he feared for his life because a certain military serviceman threatened him by saying, [...] "If war were to happen with Armenia, you would be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> would kill." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lucy Benjamin {{told the}} Daily Star that keeping the secret that her {{character}} {{was responsible for}} the attempted murder had been the [...] "worst two months of her life". She commented to The Mirror, [...] "For two months I've carried this secret and it's been tough, really hard. I've had to lie to my colleagues— all the suspects were told to say it wasn't us. I've become very good at lying! The lies went on and on. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> told that it wasn't me was Todd Carty, who plays Mark [...] I thought he was a good chap to try my lies on to see if he believed it! And he did. I was delighted that it was me. I think Lisa had every reason to do it". At the time, Lucy Benjamin expressed fear that the high-profile storyline would spell the end of her character, who she had thought would be imprisoned. However, in a further plot twist, Phil framed Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), for the shooting. Subsequent storylines involved in Lisa and Phil's narratives surrounded Lisa's pregnancy. In the storyline, Lisa, secretly expecting Phil's baby, married Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and claimed the baby was his. This secret was blown in the Christmas Day 2001 episodes.|$|E

6000|$|Thereupon the {{assembly}} broke up, and I rode back to Bonaventure, reaching {{it with the}} first of the daylight, blackened and singed, while, as it happened, Lucille Haldane was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> met.

60|$|Towards sunset {{that evening}} I stood {{again on the}} well-remembered terrace, and looked once more at the {{peaceful}} old country house.

I knew it well; and I said I would go and seek him myself.|$|R
60|$|I must beg {{allowance}} to use <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> singular. <b>I</b> cannot, {{like old}} Weller, spell {{myself with a}} We. Ours is, I believe, the only language that has shown so much sense of the worth of the individual (to himself) as to erect <b>the</b> <b>first</b> personal pronoun {{into a kind of}} votive column to the dignity of human nature. Other tongues have, or pretend, a greater modesty.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> whom <b>I</b> saw, to my surprise, by the sober {{light of}} the shaded lamp, was Uriah.

The Doctor sat in his study chair, covering his face with his hands. Mr. Wickfield, sorely troubled and distressed, was leaning forward, irresolutely touching the Doctor's arm.|$|R
60|$|I had {{no sooner}} ridden {{out of the}} forest shade when I saw that the place was in an uproar, men and women {{gathering}} in groups and running here and there between the cabins.

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> met on {{the pier}} was Rectus. He had had his supper, and had come down to watch for me. I was so angry that I would not speak to him. He kept by my side, though, as I {{walked up to the}} house, excusing himself for going off and leaving me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> {{addressed}} was a Kawwas[FN#6] {{or police}} officer, who, coiled comfortably up {{in a bit}} of shade fitting his person like a robe, was in full enjoyment of the Asiatic [...] "Kayf."

2500|$|Rochester's enemy Lord Halifax {{called for}} an inquiry into Rochester's {{stewardship}} of the finances and {{it was found that}} £40,000 had been lost by mismanagement.
