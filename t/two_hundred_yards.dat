5|$|The tornado {{crossed the}} Ohio River {{a third time}} back into Indiana and across the {{southern}} fringes of Evansville. Here, the tornado ripped directly through the Eastbrook Mobile Home Park, obliterating numerous mobile homes and killing 20 people. Of about 350 mobile homes in the park, 100 were destroyed and another 125 were damaged. The coroner reported {{that most of the}} victims were probably killed instantly, many by spine and skull fractures. Several bodies were carried almost <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards.</b> The tornado then crossed into Warrick County, Indiana at the Angel Mounds State Historic Site. Several permanent homes were destroyed in this area, along with many others {{on the north side of}} Newburgh. Past Newburgh, the tornado reached its peak intensity (high-end F3) as it tore through an industrial park near Paradise. Further northeast, the tornado passed just south of Boonville and caused a fatality in a mobile home. The tornado then tore directly through the small community of DeGonia Springs, tossing vehicles and destroying homes. Some of the homes in the community were leveled, and three people were killed in a mobile home in this area. The tornado began to rapidly weaken as it passed just south of Tennyson, and then dissipated as it crossed into Spencer County, Indiana. Overall, the tornado damaged or destroyed 500 buildings, killed 25 people, and injured 230 others.|$|E
5|$|The 8th Division {{was sent}} to France in November 1914; {{immediately}} after arrival, two battalions were deployed to hold {{a section of the}} front line for a week during the closing stages of the First Battle of Ypres. However, the brigade did not see its first major action under Pinney's command until 10 March 1915, when it was committed to action as part of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. The 23rd Brigade met heavy resistance when it began its attack, due to a failure by the divisional artillery to bombard a large section of the defenders' trenches; the 2nd Middlesex, making a frontal attack, were wiped out almost completely. The other lead battalion of the brigade, the 2nd Cameronians, was enfiladed from the undamaged sector and took heavy losses, losing almost all its officers and retreating in confusion. Pinney quickly learned of this—he was only <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> from the front line—and decided to continue the attack. As {{he was not able to}} call for artillery support, the only possible approach was to send in the two reserve battalions. The second assault suffered heavy casualties at the outset, and quickly had to be called off when it was discovered that the corps artillery was about to fire on the positions being attacked; the Devonshires and West Yorkshires were withdrawn, having taken high casualties and achieved little. After this, the attack continued to bog down, and whilst there was some success elsewhere in the divisional sector, nothing more was achieved by 23rd Brigade. Following Neuve Chapelle, the brigade was reinforced with two Territorial battalions. At the Battle of Aubers on 9 May, 23rd Brigade was held in reserve by 8th Division and so escaped the heavy casualties of the two attacking brigades. Around noon a scratch force of all available infantry was pushed forward by the divisional commander to support these two brigades, including some units of Pinney's brigade.|$|E
25|$|The American troops crossed Charlestown {{neck and}} {{proceeded}} up the gentle slopes of Bunker Hill. From there Prescott, {{for reasons that}} were never made completely clear, went against orders, assembled a separate party of 1200 men and continued on <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> further down the peninsula to Breed's Hill and {{under cover of darkness}} began construction of a redoubt and a rail fence that extended to Mystic River, with Gridley in command of construction, while the secondary fortifications were constructed on Bunker Hill. This later proved to be a major tactical error.|$|E

25|$|When {{the bell}} rang, Seabiscuit broke in front, led by over a length after 20 seconds, and soon crossed {{over to the}} rail position. Halfway down the backstretch, War Admiral started to cut into the lead, {{gradually}} pulling level with Seabiscuit, then slightly ahead. Following advice he had received from Pollard, Woolf had eased up on Seabiscuit, allowing his horse to see his rival, then asked for more effort. <b>Two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> from the wire, Seabiscuit pulled away again and continued to extend his lead over the closing stretch, finally winning by four lengths despite War Admiral's running his best time for the distance.|$|E
25|$|During {{the months}} of July and August, Burbridge {{initiated}} building more fortifications in Kentucky, although Sherman's march through Georgia effectively reduced the Confederate threat to Kentucky. Burbridge received permission from Union General John Schofield to build fortifications in Mount Sterling, Lexington, Frankfort and Louisville. Each location {{was to have a}} small enclosed field work of about <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> along the interior crest, except for Louisville, which would be five hundred yards. Other earthworks were planned to follow in Louisville. All the works were to be built by soldiers, except at Frankfort, where the state would assign workers, and at Louisville, where the city would manage it. Lt. Colonel. J. H, Simpson, of the Federal Engineers, furnished the plans and engineering force.|$|E
25|$|On 29 July, Isonomy {{ran in the}} Goodwood Cup, {{in which}} he was asked to concede {{thirteen}} pounds to Parole. An outsider named The Bear set off in front and at one stage opened up a lead of <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards.</b> Isonomy finally caught up with the front-runner in the straight and pulled away in the closing stages to win easily by three lengths, with Parole third A few days later on 6 August he was sent to Brighton Racecourse for the two-mile Brighton Cup, in which he carried 136 pounds and started at odds of 1/10 against three opponents. After settling in third place he moved into the lead in the straight and went three lengths clear, before being eased down in the closing stages to record a three-quarter-length win over Paul's Cray. Isonomy was then sent north for the Ebor Handicap at York on 27 August, for which he was made 8/11 favourite. Despite the very difficult conditions ("mud and water flying in all directions"), and conceding at least thirty pounds to his opponents, he won impressively by eight lengths.|$|E

500|$|As the {{survivors}} awaited the game's start, Survivor crews prepared {{the island for}} reward and immunity challenges, removing any harmful items, checking for any harmful animals in specific locations, and building a Tribal Council set. Camera and other crews {{were sent to the}} island three weeks in advance for testing. On {{the opposite side of the}} island from the tribes, headquarters were set up for the producers and crew to live in on the island. This facility included many traditional trailers with running water, televisions, and one phone line. The Tribal Council set was built <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> from the crew's facility. The Tribal Council set was [...] with no walls and only a platform. In the middle of the set was a fire lava pit providing fire for the torches, which represented the castaways' life in the game.|$|E
500|$|By midnight, the Baley {{company had}} fallen behind the Rose company {{and decided to}} stop and make a {{mountain}} camp while Rose and others continued to the Colorado River, where they planned to water their combined stock and build a raft {{in preparation for the}} impending river crossing. By noon on August 28, Rose had reached a patch of Cottonwood trees about one mile from the river, where their oxen were unhitched and allowed to join the loose stock racing towards the water. There the emigrants encountered more Mohave, but unlike the friendly ones that greeted them at Sitgreaves Pass, these were rude and hostile. After a thorough watering, the work oxen were returned to the wagons. Rose and his wife, Amanda, decided to scout the river bank for a suitable campsite, exiting their wagon to make the journey by foot. Moments later, an aggressive Mohave placed his hand on her shoulder and bosom, and she ran back, terrified, to the relative safety of their wagon. Rose, not wanting to incite the Mohave, ignored the incident and continued to the river. Other Mohave harassed Alpha Brown's family, briefly threatening to take his wife's dress and abduct their son. That danger was averted, but many Mohave set about driving off and slaughtering several of the party's cattle before leaving the emigrants alone at their encampment, some <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> from the river and [...] away from the Baley company's mountain camp.|$|E

2500|$|Moulton {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} foot racer while living on the frontier, and later became a professional sprinter. [...] It was while working in the west as a scout that Moulton's talent as a sprinter was discovered. [...] One published story recounts the circumstance as follows:One morning... a young buffalo was sighted and because the horses were all picketed, the plainsmen were forced to give chase on foot. [...] Moulton outdistanced them all, gained <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> on the buffalo, no doubt very tired from trailing its herd, and succeeded in shooting it down. [...] Thereafter, his name was a by-word on the plains. He did not lose a race that year.|$|E
2500|$|By 12:30 pm, {{thousands}} of government supporters were {{gathered around the}} palace blocking all routes to Miraflores except for the Llaguno Overpass, which was where the Bolivarian Circles had gathered to overlook the route. As the march turned a corner and began to approach the Miraflores at about 2:00 pm, the National Guard fired about 12 tear gas canisters from behind the palace walls and the protesters fled back down the road. As more marchers pressed toward Miraflores, {{the leaders of the}} protest, Guaicaipuro Lameda and Rear Admiral Molina Tamayo, [...] "kept calling on them to surge forward for a direct assault on the palace about <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> away" [...] and urged the crowd to advance through the tear gas about 20 minutes after the initial confrontation. The protesters made it closer to Miraflores and the Presidential Guard responded with more tear gas, about 20 gas canisters causing panic and a dispersion of the demonstrators to areas surrounding the palace. At about 2:30 pm opposition protesters began to throw objects at the National Guard and the Chavistas a block away; some were thrown back, and the opposition and the Chavistas exchanged insults.|$|E
2500|$|On September 10, 1876, General Crook Crook ordered Frank Grouard, his trusted Chief Scout, {{to carry}} dispatches to Fort Laramie announcing the battle and victory at Slim Buttes. [...] Grouard’s strict orders were {{to see that}} the {{official}} dispatches were telegraphed first, then followed by the dispatches from the war correspondents. The next morning, Grouard left in company with Captain Anson Mills, Lieut. Bubb and about seventy-five mounted troopers riding ahead to the Black Hills mining camps to purchase provisions for Crook’s starving command. At Crook’s request, Captain Jack joined Mills’s party, accompanied by war correspondents Robert E. Strahorn and Reuben Briggs Davenport. [...] Unknown to Grouard, Davenport wanted an exclusive for the New York Herald and offered to pay Captain Jack five-hundred dollars if he could beat Grouard to the telegraph in Fort Laramie. [...] Telegraphing news of the victory of Slim Buttes thus became a race between Frank Grouard and Captain Jack Crawford. [...] It was a dangerous undertaking, for Indians were still harassing the mining communities, and only two days earlier, a Sioux party had come within <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> of the main street in Crook City.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a series}} of {{unsuccessful}} struggles in the courts to prevent further oil development in the Channel, the Department of the Interior gave the green light on August 15 to Sun Oil to construct their Platform Hillhouse adjacent to Union's Platform A. [...] Protestors harassed the convoy bringing the platform {{all the way from}} the Oakland shipyard, down the coast, and into the Channel. [...] Get Oil Out! (GOO) staged a [...] "fish-in" [...] with boats and even helicopters fishing (unsuccessfully) at the planned platform site, one mile east of Platform A. [...] They refused to move until the Supreme Court responded to their appeal. [...] Then the crane lifting the platform from the barge bungled the platform transfer, and Platform Hillhouse flopped over in the water, legs-up, about <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> from the fleet of protestors. [...] While this was going on, the Supreme Court denied the appeal, allowing Sun Oil to proceed, even though their platform floated upside down – an absurd and discomforting sight to local residents hopeful that the spill might have made oil industry accidents less likely. [...] By November 26, Hillhouse was installed correctly, and Platform C, the final platform to be built of the four in the Dos Cuadras field, went up in 1977.|$|E
2500|$|... (b. 1846; d. Herne Bay 5 December 1917) In 1903, Edmund James Reid {{moved into}} number Four, Eddington Gardens: {{the house at}} the landward end of the terrace, {{previously}} advertised for £300. At that point the sea was still about <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> away. He had retired in 1896 or 1898, having been head of CID in the Metropolitan police, and his most famous case was the Whitechapel murders in 1888. He named his house Reid's Ranch, painted castellations and cannon on its side and soon became known as the eccentric champion of the beleaguered Hampton-on-Sea residents. His house contained a parrot and many photographs of his London cases. His garden contained a cannonball found on his property, a post {{from the end of the}} old pier and a flagpole with a union flag. From a wooden kiosk in his garden named the Hampton-on-Sea Hotel he sold soft drinks and postcards featuring himself and the fast-vanishing remains of Hampton-on-Sea. [...] Some of these were photographed by Fred C. Palmer of Herne Bay, who was the Herne Bay Press photographer for all big events. The stagnant Hampton Brook became a butt of Reid's jokes and he renamed it Lavender Brook, sending sardonic letters to the Council about erosion, Hampton Brook, public facilities and the pier as shipping hazard. With two neighbours he built a bridge over the brook, but it was declared dangerous and demolished by the Council. The sea flowed closer to his property, and in 1915 he was the last remaining resident of Eddington Gardens and of Hampton-on-Sea. [...] He abandoned his house in 1916, moved to Herne Bay, married in 1917 and died aged 71 on 5 December of the same year. He was buried in Herne Bay Cemetery in plot J62 on 8 December 1917.|$|E
