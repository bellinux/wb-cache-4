The medical profession is concerned about cleft palate because it is of sufficiently frequent occurrence to distress many people. Knowledge of the mechanisms and materials involved in palate development might be useful in designing preventive measures for prenatal care. The cleft palate condition is of interest to embryologists because it so often turns up in the list of defects caused by various teratogenic agents, and a better understanding of this defect would help in assessing the specific defects of a <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substance...</b>|$|E
30|$|Over the years, {{thalidomide}} {{has been}} used to treat different medical conditions, such as leprosy and other painful conditions [1]. In the late 1950 s {{and the beginning of the}} 1960 s, thalidomide was offered as a treatment for insomnia and was frequently used by pregnant women due to its reputation of being harmless. However, when the number of children born with multiple malformations all over the world increased following the maternal intake of thalidomide during pregnancy [2, 3], it gradually became apparent that thalidomide was a highly <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substance</b> [4]. This led to the syndrome being referred to as thalidomide embryopathy (TE). Thalidomide was subsequently banned from the market for some years, but today it is once again being used for the treatment of leprosy [5, 6], multiple myeloma [7], Crohn’s disease [8], and other conditions. Despite our knowledge of the teratogenic effect of thalidomide, children still being born with TE [6]. Information on its teratogenic effects is still insufficient and action for the prevention of TE is not being taken.|$|E
40|$|Background information: There {{are rising}} {{concerns}} about potential hazardous properties of food additives, forcing legislator to tighten management policy and requiring extensive, yet animal- minimized, testing strategies. The zebrafish embryo is an emerging model system for chemical testing with many advantages {{that made it}} amenable to high-throughput assays at the in vivo level. In this study, we applied a panel of tests to evaluate toxicity, particularly neurobehavioral effects, of seven substances including standard compounds and controversial food additives. Methods: Zebrafish wildtype and transgenic fluorescent embryos were exposed to different concentrations of four food additives: Sodium benzoate (SB), Monosodium glutamate (MSG), Tartrazine (TTZ), and Quinoline yellow (QY). Method validation was carried out using three other substances: Ethanol (EtOH), Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 3, 4 -Dichloroaniline (DCA). Morphological and lethal effects were recorded and the data were analysed to determine median lethal concentration (LC 50), median effective concentration (EC 50), effective concentration 10 % (EC 10), and teratogenic index (TI) values as well as concentration-response equations. Delayed effects of substances on larval locomotion were inspected using the light/dark challenge. Gene expression analysis was carried out using transgenic fluorescent lines. Results: LC 50 values of three standard compounds (EtOH, DMSO, and DCA) reveal a high correlation with previously validated data, proving the reliability of our method. Effects of each substance on zebrafish embryonic morphology and lethality were determined {{as well as the}} corresponding concentration-response curves. Calculated toxicological indexes revealed that SB belongs to Cat. 3 aquatic toxicity class, while QY is the most <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substance.</b> At EC 10, all additives exhibited a delayed effect on zebrafish larval locomotion in compound-specific patterns. Observation of transgenic fluorescent embryos and locomotion analysis of hatched larvae reveal that SB could decrease the zebrafish motoneuron differentiation rate, while TTZ exhibited anti-angiogenic effects. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that our test panel is reliable as a means to assess and categorise chemical toxicity. Also, our data suggest the need to reconsider the safety of food additives SB, TTZ, and QY as well as other controversial food additives in further studies...|$|E

40|$|Report {{attempts}} to understand midwives’ {{perceptions of their}} practice in addressing alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Background Alcohol is a <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substance</b> and, when consumed during pregnancy, {{is associated with a}} range of adverse effects in the developing fetus, including spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, low birthweight, growth deficiency, intra-uterine growth restriction, and prematurity. The umbrella term FASD describes disabilities that include fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (PFAS) and neurodevelopmental disorder-alcohol exposed (ND-AE). The prevalence of FASD has been reported as 2 - 5 % in the USA and in Canada it is estimated as 1 / 100 births. FASDs are under-diagnosed and under-reported in Australia where the prevalence is reported as 1. 7 / 1, 000 live births and 4. 7 / 1, 000 Indigenous live births. Children with FASDs may experience developmental delay, deficits in intellectual functioning and difficulties with learning, memory and attention; may have poor executive functioning and deficits in social and adaptive functioning. Prenatal alcohol exposure may also result in secondary disabilities, for example, limited opportunities for work and mental health problems such as depression and self-injury. Very few adults with FAS work and live independently, many have mental health problems, trouble with the law, inappropriate sexual behaviours, drug and alcohol problems, and experience incarceration. These secondary disabilities may be prevented by early diagnosis and management of FASD. The degree of harm to the fetus from prenatal alcohol exposure is influenced by the dose, pattern, and timing of alcohol exposure and the stage of development of the fetus when exposed. Research evidence is inconclusive about the effects of low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy and its risk of harm to the fetus has not been determined. Thus the Australian Guidelines to Reduce Health Risks from Drinking Alcohol Guideline 4 (Australian Alcohol Guideline) aims to prevent alcohol consumption during pregnancy and applies an evidence based precautionary principle: “For women who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, not drinking is the safest option”. It is important to prevent exposure of the fetus to alcohol - there is no cure for FASDs and their burden and cost to individuals, families, communities and society is great...|$|E
40|$|Pre- and {{perinatal}} {{adverse events}} may cause {{damage to the}} central nervous and vascu-lar systems. The eye is an organ that allows studies of both these systems, as the optic nerve {{is an extension of}} the central nervous system, and the retinal vessels are the only vessels where direct inspection can be used for study-ing vessel morphology. The aims of this study were to evaluate the optic disc and retinal vessel morphology in children with various conditions caused by adverse events during prenatal and/or perinatal life, and to investigate whether ocular fundus morphology can reflect associated brain lesions as well as etiology and timing of the pre- and perinatal damage. Paper I describes a technique for digital image analysis of fundus photographs, which allows reliable measurements of various ocular fundus structures. In Paper II, this method was used in 100 healthy Swedish individuals of various ages from childhood to adolescence, in order to investigate the normal morphology of the optic disc and retinal vessels, thus providing reference values. In Paper III, the influence of gestational age, birth weight, perinatal morbidity and postnatal growth on ocular fundus morphology was investigated in children born preterm. There was no difference in optic disc size between the preterm children and the full-term controls. However, the preterm children demonstrated a differ-ent vascular pattern, i. e. marked tortuosity of the retinal vessels and a lower number of vascular branching points, independently of the perinatal variables studied, compared with the controls. In preterm girls, a negative relationship was found between gestational age {{and the size of the}} optic disc. In Paper IV, optic disc morphology in children with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) was investigated. Children with PVL had morphological abnormalities, i. e. large cupping of the optic discs, and functional deficits, such as strabismus, nystagmus and visual field defects. The large cups in normal-sized discs might be a result of a transsynaptic degeneration caused by the primary lesion of the optic radiation during a sensitive period in the immature brain. In Paper V, fundus morphology in children who had been pre-natally exposed to the <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substance</b> alcohol was investigated by cross-sectional and follow-up analyses. Children with the fetal alcohol syndrome had small optic disc areas and abnormal vascu-lar patterns, abnormalities that seemed to be stationary during childhood. In Paper VI, the ocular fundus morphology and its relationship to the anterior visual pathway dimensions and midline brain anomalies were studied in several groups of children with pituitary hormone insufficiency. Morphological abnormalities, i. e. small optic discs and/or retinal vessel abnormalities, were noted in all groups. The most pronounced ocular fundus abnormalities were seen among the children with the lowest growth hormone levels. The ocular fundus findings in this group of children were associated with small anterior visual pathway dimensions and midline brain anomalies, indicating early prenatal damage. This study suggests that there is a relationship between the severity of ocular fundus abnormality and the degree of pituitary hormone insufficiency. The major conclusions of this thesis are that abnormalities of the ocular fundus occur in a number of conditions caused by adverse events during prenatal and/or perinatal life, and that the optic disc and retinal vessel morp-hology can reflect associated lesions of the brain as well as etiology and timing of the pre- and perinatal damage...|$|E
50|$|Ancestral Women and Conditions: In the {{environment}} of evolutionary adaptation (EEA), selection pressures shaping avoidance of or defenses against <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substances</b> would have been high. Evidence from evolutionary anthropology suggest ancestral women, similar to women in extant hunter gatherer populations, experienced high fertility and high infant mortality. Importantly, high fertility is characterized by short inter-birth intervals, early age at first birth, and periods of breastfeeding spanning upwards of two years. Given such high reproductive costs, it is likely the fitness cost of ingesting neurotoxins is higher for women than men. One such hunter-gatherer population, the Aka, have incredibly high smoking prevalence rates among men (95%), but very low rates among women (5%).|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis is an {{essential}} common final pathway in numerous pathological conditions such as malignant tumors, HIV-related CD 4 lymphocytes degeneration, neurodegenerative disorders, and in programmed cell death events during normal embryogenesis. Some <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substances</b> for man and laboratory mammals induce an increase of the apoptotic phenomenon, responsible for the occurrence of some precise cranio-maxillo-facial malformations.

40|$|Prenatal {{exposure}} to <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substances,</b> such as nicotine or alcohol, {{increases the risk}} of developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To date, studies examining this relationship have used symptom scales as outcome measures to assess the effect of prenatal exposure, and have not investigated the neurobiological pathways involved. This study explores the effect of prenatal {{exposure to}} cigarettes or alcohol on brain volume in children with ADHD and typically developing controls. Children with ADHD who had been exposed prenatally to either substance were individually matched to children with and without ADHD who had not been. Controls who had been exposed prenatally were also individually matched to controls who had not been. For prenatal exposure to both smoking and alcohol, we found a pattern where subjects with ADHD who had been exposed had the smallest brain volumes and unexposed controls had the largest, with intermediate volumes for unexposed subjects with ADHD. This effect was most pronounced for cerebellum. A similar reduction fell short of significance for controls who had been exposed to cigarettes, but not alcohol. Our results are consistent with an additive effect of prenatal exposure and ADHD on brain volume, with the effects most pronounced for cerebellum...|$|R
40|$|Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is {{the most}} common severe {{congenital}} abnormality in the newborn and the cause of over half the deaths from congenital anomalies in childhood. Prenatal diagnosis, possible as early as 15 weeks of gestation, allows physicians and families the greatest number of therapeutic options, and can improve the postnatal outcome. There are several potential indications for performing such examination. Evaluation of the heart in the setting of restricted fetal growth or fetal distress is often recommended. Whenever extracardiac anomalies are detected during fetal ultrasound examination or in presence of chromosomal abnormalities detected with amniocentesis, cardiac assessment is mandatory. The test should also be performed as part of the assessment of fetal arrhythmias. Finally, whenever congenital heart disease is suspected for other reasons, such as maternal exposure to <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substances</b> or a parental history of previous children with congenital lesions, the examination should be considered. The performance of a fetal echocardiogram requires experience and a systematic approach. Guidelines for training have been formulated, and only qualified individuals should perform this highly specialized examination.

40|$|A {{cleft palate}} is a genetic {{disorder}} {{that occurs when}} an oro-nasal communication is present between the palate and {{the base of the}} nose. During pregnancy, the maxillary is not completely merged, and the defect is only seen at birth. Possible causes are hormonal imbalances, nutritional deficiencies, infections, radiation during pregnancy, alcohol or cigarette consumption, the ingestion of other <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substances</b> by the mother, and heredity. The resulting defect requires corrective surgery. In the case of a cleft palate, surgery is postponed until after the first year of life to avoid disturbing the normal development of speech and the risk of aspiration of food, which causes infections such as otitis and pneumonia. Ear infections can harm the development of speech in cases where surgery is not possible or the defect has reappeared. This article describes the prosthetic rehabilitation of a edentulous patient: a woman of 53 years old with a cleft palate who was treated surgically. In a clinical examination, a residual palatal defect was identified.

40|$|Municipal {{wastewater}} contains {{significant amounts}} of organic substances of both natural and anthropogenic origin. Wastewater treatment removes most of contaminants, however new substances are formed {{as a result of}} biochemical changes taking part during the treatment process; some of them remain in the final effluent and may pose a threat to life and health of living organisms. Humic substances (HS), which include soluble fulvic acids (FA) are contaminants commonly found in wastewater. This is why the research attempted to examine the content of fulvic acids in mechanically treated wastewater at the Płaszów Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Kraków. The study was conducted to assess the quantities of the pollution load coming to the plant. FA were separated (isolated) at a hydrophobic ion exchanger, and then subjected to qualitative analysis to determine their elemental composition and degree of contamination with metals and other substances. Studies were also conducted in the infrared spectrum {{to determine the effects of}} internal structure of fulvic acids.

40|$|Substance {{abuse in}} {{pregnant}} and recently postpartum women {{is a major}} public health concern because of effects on the infant and {{on the ability of}} the adult to care for the infant. In addition to the negative health effects of <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substances</b> on fetal development, substance use can contribute to difficulties associated with the social and behavioral aspects of parenting. Neural circuits associated with parenting behavior overlap with circuits involved in addiction (e. g., frontal, striatal and limbic systems) and thus may be co-opted for the craving/reward cycle associated with substance use and abuse and be less available for parenting. The current study investigates the degree to which neural circuits associated with parenting are disrupted in mothers who are substance-using. Specifically, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural response to emotional infant cues (faces and cries) in substance-using compared to non-using mothers. In response to both faces (of varying emotional valence) and cries (of varying distress levels), substance-using mothers evidenced reduced neural activation in regions that have been previously implicated in reward and motivation as well as regions involved in cognitive control. Specifically, in response to faces, substance users showed reduced activation in prefrontal regions, including the dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, as well as visual processing (occipital lobes) and limbic regions (parahippocampus and amygdala). Similarly, in response to infant cries substance-using mothers showed reduced activation relative to non-using mothers in prefrontal regions, auditory sensory processing regions, insula and limbic regions (parahippocampus and amygdala). These findings suggest that infant stimuli may be less salient for substance-using mothers, and such reduced saliency may impair developing infant-caregiver attachment and the ability of mothers to respond appropriately to their infant...|$|R
40|$|Most {{discussions of}} food sharing among {{so-called}} "egalitarian" hunters and gatherers implicitly assume that, because all adult {{members of a}} group participate in the network of sharing, all must therefore be receiving portions of more or less equivalent nutritional worth. This assumption is questioned and five basic points are raised: (1) because fat is not uniformly distributed over the carcass of an animal and because it is depleted sequentially when an animal is stressed, certain individuals may receive nutritionally inferior portions of meat, with potentially serious health consequences for the recipients during seasonal or interannual periods when other food resources are in short supply; (2) even when sharing is quantitatively and nutritionally equitable, food taboos may block certain individuals from access to meat and/or fat, particularly children, women at critical stages in their reproductive life, and the elderly (however, in the case of pregnant women, such food taboos and seemingly inequitable sharing practices may have positive as well as negative consequences for the health and survivorship of the fetus or newborn infant by keeping maternal protein consumption below about 20 % of total calories and by reducing the mother's risk of exposure to potentially <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substances</b> that may accumulate in animal tissues); (3) skilled hunters may acquire nutritionally more valuable parts than do other males by "snacking" at kill sites and through differential sharing; (4) food-sharing practices and food taboos vary widely among foragers, and this diversity may contribute to observed differences among groups in fertility and infant mortality patterns; and (5) the focus of anthropologists on the sharing of food, especially meat, as opposed to the sharing of a broad spectrum of social, political, economic, and sexual rights and privileges, is an overly narrow and potentially misleading perspective. In closing, the paper briefly discusses the utility of the term "egalitarian," concluding that the concept, by conflating ideology with actual behavior, may obscure rather than enhance our understanding of the origins and adaptations of foraging societies...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of teratogenic effects of chemicals is generally performed using in vivo teratogenicity assays e. g., in rats or rabbits. Following the 3 R principles, {{the development of}} alternative methods is encouraged {{to reduce the number}} of animal tests. From this perspective, we have developed an in vitro assay (mDarT) using the zebrafish Danio rerio embryo teratogenicity assay (DarT) combined with an exogenous mammalian metabolic activation system (MAS), able to biotransform proteratogenic compounds. Cyclophosphamide, ethanol, benzo[a]pyrene and thalidomide were used as test materials to assess the efficiency of this assay. Briefly, the zebrafish embryos were co-cultured at 2 hpf (hours post fertilization) with the test material at varying concentrations, mammalian liver microsomes from different species and NADPH for 60 min at 32 °C under moderate agitation in Tris buffer. The negative control (test material alone) and the MAS control (MAS alone) were incubated in parallel. For each test group, 20 eggs were used for statistical robustness. Afterwards fish embryos were transferred individually into 24 -well plates filled with fish medium for 48 hours at 26 °C with a 12 hour-light cycle. Teratogenicity was scored after 24 and 48 hpf using morphological endpoints. The test was considered to be valid if a minimum of 90 % of fish eggs developed normally for the two controls (test material alone and MAS alone). For each test material, the experiment was repeated three times with the controls satisfying the validation criteria (≤ 10 % impaired embryos). Indeed, no significant teratogenic effects were observed compared to controls in fish embryos exposed to the proteratogens alone (i. e., without metabolic activation) or the MAS alone. In contrast, the four test materials induced significant abnormalities in fish embryos when co-incubated with animal liver microsomes. For cyclophosphamide, ethanol and thalidomide a concentration-response relationship was shown and the qualitative nature of the malformations was similar between fish embryos and humans. Benzo[a]pyrene was demonstrated to be significantly teratogenic in fish embryos in spite of no concentration-response and unspecific teratogenic fingerprints. We conclude that the application of animal liver microsomes will improve and refine the DarT as a predictive and valuable alternative method to screen <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substances...</b>|$|R
40|$|Antiepileptic drugs (AED) {{are known}} <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substances.</b> Major {{congenital}} malformations, minor anomalies, retarded intrauterine growth and delayed psychomotor development {{have been reported}} after exposure to AED in utero. Results from previous studies are inconclusive due to different study designs, therapeutic traditions, genetic and environmental factors. Aims of the study: A) To investigate the incidence of minor anomalies and psychomotor development in children born to women with epilepsy on AED treatment during pregnancy. B) To investigate foetal growth and the incidence of major congenital malformations in children exposed to AED in utero in Sweden between 1973 and 1997 by using the Swedish health registries. One hundred prospectively collected infants, born to 136 women with carefully monitored epilepsy during pregnancy {{were included in the}} study of minor anomalies. Based on gestational age, sex and mode of delivery, each infant was matched with infants not exposed to AED in utero. The infants were examined at birth for the occurrence of minor anomalies according to a special protocol. The investigator was unaware of the exposure status of the child. The results showed {{a significant increase in the}} incidence of minor anomalies but no special dysmorphic syndromes were observed. The tests from the routinely performed neonatal screening for hypothyreosis and congenital adrenal hyperplasia were re-analysed for 34 of the matched pairs of exposed and unexposed infants. The results showed no differences between the groups. The psychomotor development was assessed with the Griffiths' test at 9 months and at 4. 5 - 5 years of age in the children born to the women on strict treatment strategy during pregnancy (data set 11). The test psychologist performed the evaluation without prior knowledge of the history of exposure status. Between the groups there was no difference in psychomotor development at 9 months of age. A subtle but significant difference in locomotor development in the children exposed to phenytoin (PHT) was observed at the 4. 5 - 5 years follow-up. The influence on body dimensions was investigated in three different data sets collected 1973 - 1997. Data set I (1973 - 1980) consisted of 354 children exposed to AED in utero identified retrospectively by record linkage between the Medical Birth Registry and the Hospital Discharge Registry in Sweden. Data set II (1985 - 1995) is the above-described data set, but here 123 of the eligible infants are included. Data set III (1995 - 1997) consists of 500 infants exposed to AED in utero, identified prospectively in the Medical Birth Registry. A total of 963 singleton deliveries was included. The mean values for birth weight, body length, head circumference, and pregnancy duration for the infants in the three data sets were compared with the general population (2. 5 million births) after stratification for year of birth, maternal age, parity, and maternal educational level or smoking habits. The number of women with monotherapy treatment increased from 40 to 90 % over the study period. A reduction in body dimensions was observed, more marked after exposure to polytherapy. This reduction decreased over the 25 -year study period. The incidence of major congenital malformations was investigated using the same three cohorts. In addition, data from the Swedish Registry of Congenital Malformations, the Child Cardiology Registry and the Hospital Discharge Registry were added. A total of 977 infants was included. There was a significant increase in the number of major congenital malformations (OR: 1. 5 95 %CI: 1. 1 - 2. 0). Conclusions: There may be an association between exposure to AED in utero and a) impaired foetal growth, b) a subtle delay in motor development, c) an increased risk of major congenital malformations and d) minor anomalies in the children. Maternal treatment with monotherapy in low doses seems to have the least negative influence on the infants. The methods used in the present study do not distinguish between the effects of maternal AED treatment and genetic or environmental factors. Further follow-up studies are warranted to study subtle influences on growth and psychomotor development...|$|R
40|$|Owing {{to their}} non-selective nature, {{anti-cancer}} drugs affect both cancerous and non-cancerous cells and present a major health risk to healthcare staff working with them. This project {{was conducted at}} Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, to investigate the extent of contamination with anti-cancer drugs on work surfaces and the environmental emissions of these drugs. In the Isolator study, surface contamination arising from the preparation of five anticancer drug infusions (epirubicin, fluorouracil, cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin) in a pharmaceutical isolator and external surfaces of infusion bags and syringes using a conventional syringe and needle technique was investigated and compared with that obtained using a closed system drug transfer device (Tevadaptor). Wipe samples were taken {{for a period of}} one week from pre-defined areas in a pharmaceutical isolator and from the surface of prepared Intra-Venous (IV) infusion bags and pre-filled syringes to obtain baseline data. Gloves and preparation mats used during this period were also collected. Following a one-week operator familiarisation period, the Tevadaptor device was then introduced for cytotoxic preparation and wipe-sampling of surfaces and collection of consumables was continued for a further week (intervention period). The samples obtained were then analysed by HPLC and ICP-MS. The baseline contamination data from Tevadaptor isolator study was undetected to 0. 9 ng cm- 2 (epirubicin), undetected to 3. 58 ng cm- 2 (5 -FU) and 0. 05 - 0. 92 ng cm- 2 (Pt) in the wipe samples from the pharmaceutical isolator surfaces; amounts on glove samples were 1100 - 6100 ng/glove (epirubicin), 300 - 8100 ng/glove (5 -FU) and 1 - 6 ng/glove (platinum). During the intervention phase isolator surface contamination was not detected in all samples for 5 -FU and epirubicin and platinum was detected on the isolator surfaces in the range of 0. 002 - 0. 09 ng cm- 2. The use of Tevadaptor resulted in a reduction of contamination on external surfaces by a factor of 10 or more for all marker drugs. A ward study investigated the surface contamination in the oncology out-patient department caused by cisplatin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin and gemcitabine. The study compared the effect of using the Tevadaptor to prepare and administer anticancer drugs infusions on ward surface contamination to the current UK standard practice. A questionnaire was also distributed to participating staff members to assess the user-friendliness of Tevadaptor. Wipe samples were taken from pre-defined areas from the oncology out-patients department and gloves used by nursing staff for assembly and administration of the above drugs were also collected. Sample collection followed a similar schedule to the Tevadaptor isolator study. The baseline ward surface contamination ranged from undetected to 4. 97 ng cm- 2 (gemcitabine) and 3. 1 ng cm- 2 (platinum). In the case of gloves used by nursing staff the levels of contamination ranged from undetected to 1251 ng/glove (gemcitabine) and 405. 4 ng/glove (platinum). The contamination on ward surfaces during the intervention phase ranged from undetected to 3. 21 ng cm- 2 (gemcitabine) and 2. 69 ng cm- 2 (platinum) and contamination levels on gloves ranged from undetected to 9252 ng/glove (gemcitabine) and 1319 ng/glove (platinum). During the intervention phase there was a reduction in frequency of contamination, even though the total amount of surface contamination by anticancer drugs did not always decrease in comparison to baseline data, presumably due to unaccounted spillages. A drain study investigated the presence of platinum in hospital wastewater as a measure of contamination caused by the excretion of platinum-based anticancer drugs by patients. Platinum was measured over a three week period in one of the main drains and in the effluent of the oncology ward. The study showed the presence of measurable quantity of platinum which ranged from 0. 02 to 140 μg L- 1 in the oncology effluent and 0. 03 to 100 μg L- 1 in the main drain. Data from this study was coupled with published measurements on the removal of the drugs by conventional sewage treatment and then concentration of platinum arising from each drug was predicted in recipient surface waters as a function of water flow rate. Although predicted concentrations were below EMEA guidelines warranting further risk assessment, the presence of potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic and <b>teratogenic</b> <b>substances</b> in surface waters is cause for concern. The results showed that a closed system drug transfer device (CSTD) used in conjunction with an isolator is highly efficient in reducing surface contamination with anti-cancer drugs. However, despite current best practice contamination on ward surfaces remained even after the use of a CSTD. Nursing as well as healthcare staff should be educated of these results and the risks of occupational exposure to low levels of anti-cancer drugs and the use of PPE should be emphasised. Results of the drain study form the basis of preliminary estimates of the likely concentrations of platinum-based drugs in surface waters and their potential environmental impacts...|$|R
