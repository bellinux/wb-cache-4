40|$|Abstract. Carbon fiber is a fiber material, so the <b>tension</b> {{must be kept}} {{constant}} in the placement process. The attitude of carbon fiber placement head will change with the change of a placement path. Focusing {{on the problem of}} <b>tension</b> fluctuation caused by the attitude of carbon fiber placement head, gravity balance characteristic of symmetrical objects is adopted to propose a <b>tension</b> control method for eliminating the <b>tension</b> fluctuation and <b>tension</b> measuring error caused by gravity. In this way, the <b>tension</b> is kept constant depending on <b>tension</b> feedback control. Mathematical model and theoretical analysis show that the <b>tension</b> control method with gravity balance can eliminate the gravity influence on <b>tension</b> and make the <b>tension</b> keep constant...|$|R

25|$|Whereas 20th-Century square-rigged vessels were {{constructed}} of steel with steel standing rigging, prior vessels used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller {{by the end}} of the 19th Century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the lower mast, top mast, and topgallant mast. This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of <b>tensioning</b> started with the stays that were anchored at in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs deadeyes, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line—lanyard—to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow <b>tensioning</b> of the shroud.|$|E

Uniquely, this is a single loop of cable rather than the usual pair of cables, and, rather than being spun in place above the catwalks, substantial bundles of strands were dragged into place with temporary support above the catwalks, eventually suspended by <b>tensioning</b> the strand. These strand bundles were then arranged to be finally compacted to form the completed main cable.|$|E

25|$|Automatic {{patterning}} machines can knit two-colour Fair Isle patterns automatically, {{and have}} machine stitch patterning {{features such as}} plating and knitweaving. Plating refers to knitting with two strands of yarn that are held {{in such a way}} that one is in front of the other. Plated effects can be particularly striking in a ribbed fabric. Knitweaving refers to a technique in which a separate piece of yarn, often heavier than the knitted fabric, is carried along and caught between stitches to produce an effect like weaving. With knitwoven fabric, the purl side (usually the wrong side) is the right side of the fabric. The fine and standard gauge models have the option of a lace carriage, where stitches can be transferred from one needle to the next. The yarn passes through a <b>tensioning</b> mechanism and down through the knit carriage, which feeds the yarn to the needles as they knit.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tension</b> and {{suspense}} {{are powerful}} emotional experiences {{that occur in}} a wide variety of contexts (e. g., in music, film, literature, and everyday life). The omnipresence of <b>tension</b> and suspense suggests that they build on very basic cognitive and affective mechanisms. However, the psychological underpinnings of <b>tension</b> experiences remain largely unexplained, and <b>tension</b> and suspense are rarely discussed from a general, domain-independent perspective. In this paper, we argue that <b>tension</b> experiences in different contexts (e. g., musical <b>tension</b> or suspense in a movie) build on the same underlying psychological processes. We discuss key components of <b>tension</b> experiences and propose a domain-independent model of <b>tension</b> and suspense. According to this model, <b>tension</b> experiences originate from states of conflict, instability, dissonance, or uncertainty that trigger predictive processes directed at future events of emotional significance. We also discuss possible neural mechanisms underlying <b>tension</b> and suspense. The model provides a theoretical framework that can inform future empirical research on <b>tension</b> phenomena...|$|R
25|$|The cable {{construction}} technique {{differed significantly}} from that {{used for the}} earlier western spans and similar conventional suspension bridges. In that method, the cables were spun only a few wires at a time, with bundles made up as the wires were spun by pulling a loop along the cable's route. The SAS used a different technique, with the wire strands pre-fabricated into mile-long cable bundles with bundle terminations already in place, pulled by dragging one end through the route. After attachment to the termination, a <b>tensioning</b> operation was performed on each bundle at the eastern anchor point, and the bundles were suspended a few feet above the catwalk. A total of 137 such bundles were installed. As bundles were positioned, they were temporarily tied together to form the cable. The cable was completely in place in late May 2012. It was later compacted into a circular shape, and then wrapped with a protective wire jacket. In mid-March 2013, the western portion was completed and the catwalks were removed. Wire wrapping was still in progress on the eastern portion.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{segment of}} the grooved wheel, made of {{hardened}} steel, projects through a slot cut to its precise dimensions {{in the base of}} the priming pan. The wheel is grooved on its outside circumference with three or more V-shaped grooves with transverse cuts at intervals to provide a friction surface for the iron pyrites.

The outside projection is of square section to permit a spanner (wrench) to be engaged for subsequent <b>tensioning</b> of the lock. The other end of the shaft fits {{through a hole in the}} lockplate, and on this end is forged a cam, or eccentric. One end of a short, robust chain (made of three or four flat, parallel links like a short piece of bicycle chain) is fixed to the cam, while the other end of the chain is held in a groove at the end of the longer branch of a large heavy V-spring, which is generally retained by a screw and a headed bracket through upstands inside the lockplate.|$|E
25|$|Three inch (7.5cm) {{diameter}} bolts connect {{portions of}} the bridge deck mounting bosses to several concrete columns. There are 288 such bolts of various lengths. The bolts were tested in place by overtightening their retaining nuts. In the two weeks subsequent to this tightening, 30 of the first 96 bolts loaded failed. These bolts vary in length from 9 to 17 feet and failure was initially attributed to hydrogen embrittlement, with hydrogen introduced during either manufacturing or electroplating. Some of the bolts can be replaced while others cannot be removed and load transfer will require more complex remediation methods. Repairs were initially not expected to delay the opening, but later it was believed it would delay the opening until December. The fix could cost up to five million dollars. A temporary fix was announced on August 15, 2013, with the opening revised back to its original date. The solution selected was to add a tendon-secured saddle at each deck boss location.

25|$|The {{technical}} requirements and exacting standards required of a facility like the Kauffman Center made {{it one of}} the most complex structures in the world to design and build. The building, which took nearly five years to complete, contains 40,000 square feet of glass, 25,000 cubic yards of concrete, and 27 steel cables. The main lobby, Brandmeyer Great Hall, is built of a glass ceiling and sloping glass walls that provide a panoramic view of Kansas City to the south. The twenty-seven steel cables on the south façade are anchored in embeds that weigh approximately one and a half tons, and the embeds are an extension of the foundation and bedrock beneath the building. When the steel cables were pulled taut during the construction process, the entire steel structure shifted two to six inches to the south. This <b>tensioning</b> provides stability to the structure and keeps the glass lobby securely in place. The Kauffman Center covers 13 acres (53,000 m2), including landscaped grounds over the 1,000-space, city-owned Arts District Garage. The cost of the project was approximately $413 million, which includes both a $40 million operating endowment and the city’s $47 million construction of the parking garage. The Kauffman Center was designed by lead architect Moshe Safdie, acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota, theater consultant Theatre Projects Consultants and Richard Pilbrow, and engineering firm Arup. Local firm BNIM was the associate architect. Lead contractor was J.E. Dunn Construction Group of Kansas City.|$|E
