When the Narrator has believed himself to be asleep, Tyler has been controlling his body and traveling to different locations.|$|E
5|$|The May-Johnson bill soon {{ran into}} difficulties. Although the Interim Committee was {{discharged}} in November, it met {{one more time}} in December to discuss amendments to the May-Johnson bill. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative Senate bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian control of atomic energy. In 1946, several major revisions were made to the McMahon bill in order to appease the more conservative elements in the Senate. The resulting bill passed both the Senate and <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>without</b> major modifications. On August 1, 1946, Truman signed the McMahon bill into law as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, McCreary was re-elected to {{the state}} House without opposition. In the {{upcoming}} legislative session, the major question {{was expected to be}} the Cincinnati Southern Railway's request for authorization to build a track connecting Cincinnati, Ohio, with either Knoxville or Chattanooga, Tennessee, through Central Kentucky. The action was opposed by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, a bitter rival of the Cincinnati line. Appeals to the General Assembly to oppose the bill on grounds that an out-of-state corporation should not be granted a charter in the state were successful in 1869 and 1870, and an attempt by the federal Congress to grant the charter was defeated by states' rights legislators there. Moreover, newly elected governor Preston Leslie had opposed a bill granting Cincinnati Southern's request {{when he was in the}} state Senate in 1869. In the lead-up to the 1871 session, frustrated Central Kentuckians threatened to defect from the Democratic Party in future elections if the bill were not passed in the session. Supporters of Cincinnati Southern won a victory when McCreary, a staunch supporter of the bill to grant the line's request, was elected Speaker of the House. After approval of a series of amendments designed to give Kentucky courts some jurisdiction in cases involving the line and the Kentucky General Assembly some measure of control over the line's activities, the bill passed the House by a vote of 59–38. The vote in the Senate resulted in a 19–19 tie; President Pro Tem John G. Carlisle—a native of Covington, through which the proposed line would pass—cast the deciding vote in favor of approving Cincinnati Southern's request. With the will of the people clearly expressed through the legislature, Governor Leslie did not employ his gubernatorial veto. McCreary was again returned to <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>without</b> opposition in 1873 and was again chosen Speaker of the House during his term.|$|E

Boehner later promised to pass the bill. However, some commentators praised Boehner for not passing a bill they saw as full of pork barrel.|$|E
25|$|S. 4893 was {{considered}} by the House of Representatives on March 2, 1921, with two days remaining in the congressional session. Ohio's Warren Gard had asked {{a number of questions}} about previous coin bills when they passed through the House. Gard asked Vestal if the Missouri bill was identical to the earlier bills, and if it contained the same safeguards, and Vestal confirmed these. The bill was passed by <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>without</b> recorded objection, and was enacted into law with the signature of the new president, Warren G. Harding, on his inauguration day, March 4, 1921.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time in centuries, respectable but daringly fashionable women would leave <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>without</b> a hat or bonnet, {{previously}} something often associated with prostitutes. However most women continued to wear something on their head outdoors, though they were beginning to cease to do so indoors during the day (as well as for evening wear). The antique head-dress, or Queen Mary coif, Chinese hat, Oriental inspired turban, and Highland helmet were popular. As for bonnets, their crowns and brims were adorned with increasingly elaborate ornamentations, such as feathers and ribbons. In fact, ladies of the day embellished their hats frequently, replacing old decorations with new trims or feathers.|$|E
25|$|When he was young, Dian Wei once {{agreed to}} help a certain Liu family in Xiangyi (襄邑) take revenge by killing Li Yong (李永), a man from Suiyang (睢陽). Li Yong was {{formerly}} the Chief (長) of Fuchun County (富春縣), {{and he was very}} cautious about his personal protection. Dian Wei disguised himself as a marquis and travelled to Li Yong's house in a carriage filled with food and wine. He entered <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>without</b> challenge, stabbed Li with a concealed dagger, and killed Li's wife as well. He then left the house and retrieved his weapons (a sword and a ji) from the carriage and walked away. As Li Yong lived near the marketplace, news of his death spread quickly and the whole town was shocked. Hundreds of men went to pursue the murderer but none of them dared to approach Dian Wei. After travelling four or five li on foot, Dian Wei met his companions and they escaped after a brief fight with the pursuers. Dian Wei became recognised as a hero after that incident.|$|E
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>without</b> saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E

500|$|The first Charlie Chan {{film was}} <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>Without</b> a Key (1926), a ten-chapter serial {{produced}} by Pathé Studios, starring George Kuwa, a Japanese actor, as Chan. A year later Universal Pictures followed with The Chinese Parrot, starring Japanese actor, Kamiyama Sojin, in the starring role. In both productions, Charlie Chan's role was minimized. Contemporary reviews were unfavorable; {{in the words}} of one reviewer, speaking of The Chinese Parrot, Sojin plays [...] "the Chink sleuth as a Lon Chaney cook-waiter … because Chaney can't stoop that low." ...|$|E

500|$|The [...] "amiable Chinese" [...] {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>Without</b> a Key (1925). The character was not central to the novel and was not mentioned by name on the dust jacket of the first edition. In the novel, Chan is described as walking with [...] "the light dainty step of a woman" [...] and as being [...] "very fat indeed … an undistinguished figure in his Western clothes." [...] According to critic Sandra Hawley, this description of Chan allows Biggers to portray the character as nonthreatening, the opposite of evil Chinese characters, such as Fu Manchu, while simultaneously emphasizing supposedly Chinese characteristics such as impassivity and stoicism.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Charlie Chan {{was created by}} Earl Derr Biggers. In 1919, while visiting Hawaii, Biggers planned a detective novel to be called <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>Without</b> a Key. He did not begin to write that novel until four years later, however, when he was inspired to add a Chinese-American police officer to the plot after reading in a newspaper of Chang Apana (鄭阿平) and Lee Fook, two detectives on the Honolulu police force. Biggers, who disliked the Yellow Peril stereotypes he found {{when he came to}} California, explicitly conceived of the character as an alternative: [...] "Sinister and wicked Chinese are old stuff, but an amiable Chinese on the side of law and order has never been used." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{bill passed}} the Senate by an {{overwhelming}} 52–1 vote and passed <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>without</b> dissent. President Harrison signed the bill into law on July 2, 1890. Sherman was the prime mover {{in getting the}} bill passed and became [...] "by far the most articulate spokesman for antitrust in Congress". The Act was later criticized for its simple language and lack of defined terms, but Sherman defended it, saying that it drew on common-law language and precedents. He also denied that the Act was anti-business at all, saying that it only opposed unfair business practices. Sherman emphasized that the Act aimed not at lawful competition, but at illegal combination. The later analysis was more generous: [...] "The Sherman Act was as good an antitrust law as the Congress of 1890 could have devised." ...|$|E
