I would like to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear {{friend of mine who}} is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now {{we got to go}} the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot.

The current Doctor promptly sends the current Rory and the now-current Amy through the inner TARDIS. The Doctor then explains that he will set up a [...] "controlled temporal implosion" [...] in order to [...] "reset the TARDIS", but in order to do so he must know which lever to use on the control panel.

2500|$|The cover art {{painting}} {{is by the}} British artist Nic Dartnell. Although {{it has been said}} to be originally intended for the American group Spirit, and that the bald-headed man on the left of the cover is Spirit's drummer, Ed Cassidy, the artist denied this in an interview with Mike Goldstein of RockPoP: [...] "I'd like to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and dispel a rumor that, according to Wikipedia, the image is somehow linked to the LA band Spirit.
