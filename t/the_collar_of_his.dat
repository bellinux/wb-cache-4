25|$|He wore <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dark-blue {{overcoat}} {{turned up}} and {{the brim of his}} hat pulled down.|$|E
500|$|He was {{questioned}} {{several times over}} the next few days, before being taken to another location, which Thomas described as [...] "some sort of mansion house", where he was kept in a small cell {{for the next two weeks}} and questioned on a number of occasions. Initially he maintained a fabricated story, that he was a student who had been travelling in Pakistan, but he later revealed the truth, that he had been in contact with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He said that he was motivated to change his story by several incidents, including one in which one of the Pakistani interrogators pulled on <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hood, so as to strangle him, and incidents in which interrogators said that he would be electrocuted and executed. According to Thomas, he was then told that his cooperation was welcome and that he would be returned home.|$|E
500|$|Audio {{tracks were}} mixed with {{recorded}} sounds from real subway cars, {{as well as}} PA system announcements, to make the episode sound more authentic. In the original episode, Pembleton grabbed Biedron by <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shirt while Biedron {{sat in the back}} of a squad car during one of the final scenes. The scene was modified so that Pembleton only looked at Biedron, because Yoshimura felt that the scene was just as effective without him grabbing Biedron. During the last scene of the episode, in which Lange's girlfriend jogs by the subway station and ignores the emergency vehicles, Rabinowitz was originally instructed to include a musical score. He tried many different types of music, including rock music, Irish music, classical music, jazz, and piano riffs. When none of the music worked, Fontana suggested including no music at all, and it was agreed the silence was the most effective solution. Fontana said that after watching the episode repeatedly during the editing process, he liked the final product but doubted he would watch it again for a long time because it was [...] "too emotionally draining".|$|E
60|$|He was a nautical-looking {{fellow of}} perhaps forty. He wore a blue pea- jacket and trousers, and under <b>the</b> rolling <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> gray flannel shirt was tied a black {{bandanna}} in true sailor style.|$|R
60|$|Razumov spun round. The General's smooth big cheeks {{rested on}} <b>the</b> stiff <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> uniform. He {{must have been}} already looking at Razumov, because that last saw the pale blue eyes {{fastened}} on him coldly.|$|R
60|$|Duane thought Lawson would choke. He was thick-necked anyway, and {{the rush}} of blood made him tear at <b>the</b> soft <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shirt. Duane awaited his chance, patient, cold, all his {{feelings}} shut in a vise.|$|R
500|$|Kitase {{expressed}} a desire to give the game a foreign atmosphere ("foreign" [...] being in relation to Japan); his objective with the environment was to create a largely European setting. The first character Nomura designed specifically for use in Final Fantasy VIII was Squall, initially giving him longer hair and a more feminine appearance. However, Yoshinori Kitase did not feel that this design worked and asked Nomura to shorten his hair and make him look more masculine, which led to the design seen in-game. When designing Cloud Strife, Nomura gave him distinctly spiky, bright blonde hair to emphasize his role as that game's protagonist. With Squall, Nomura wanted to try a unique angle to establish his role, giving him the characteristic gunblade scar across the bridge of his nose. A complete history was not yet conceived, so Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to Nojima. Squall's design was flourished by a fur lining along <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket, included for the purpose of challenging the game's full motion video designers. This is but one example of the demands he has consistently extended to the programmers of the Final Fantasy series as technology has advanced.|$|E
500|$|Character {{designer}} Shigenori Soejima made Yu {{with the}} idea that his entire personality be decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions. As a result, he wanted Yu to look more ambiguous than the protagonist of Persona 3. Soejima compared Yu to the Blue Ranger from the Power Rangers franchise as such character tends to stand silent to follow the orders from his leader. His character design stayed relatively similar to its initial conception, with his tone and facial expressions changing the most. The feature Soejima focused on most was his eyes: he thought that having his eyes under the fringe of his hair would make him [...] "look cool." [...] <b>The</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> school uniform was made to stand a bit taller than other characters'. While designing the character, Soejima noted [...] "the main character needs to be well-rounded enough to be likeable, but also needs that extra little something to make him stand out {{from the rest of the}} cast." [...] He made a [...] "baby face" [...] sketch of the character so that he and the staff could discover Yu's [...] "special something" [...] and discuss what would make him stand out as the protagonist.|$|E
500|$|To {{maintain}} a foreign atmosphere, {{the characters of}} the game were designed to have predominantly European appearances. The first Final Fantasy VIII character created was Squall. Desiring to add a unique angle to Squall's appearance and emphasize {{his role as the}} central character, Nomura gave him a scar across his brow and the bridge of his nose. As there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character, Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall was given a gunblade, a fictional revolver–sword hybrid that functions primarily as a sword, with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism, similar to a vibroblade. His character design was complemented by a fur lining along <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket, incorporated by Nomura as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers. Additionally, some designs Nomura had previously drawn, but had not yet used in a Final Fantasy game, were incorporated into Final Fantasy VIII. These were the designs of Edea, Fujin and Raijin. The latter two had originally been designed for use in Final Fantasy VII, but with the inclusion of the Turks characters in that game, it was felt that Fujin and Raijin were unnecessary. Nomura had designed Edea before the development of Final Fantasy VII, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano. For the Guardian Forces, Nomura felt they should be unique beings, without clothes or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to [...] "become the actual monsters", so he took great care in their design. Leviathan was the first GF, created as a test and included in a game demo. After it received a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.|$|E
60|$|On repeating {{this last}} word Mr Vladimir laid {{a long white}} {{forefinger}} {{on the edge of}} the desk. Every trace of huskiness disappeared from Verloc’s voice. The nape <b>of</b> <b>his</b> gross neck became crimson above <b>the</b> velvet <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat. His lips quivered before they came widely open.|$|R
60|$|Near Button-Bright, on the ground, lay {{a sailor}} {{hat with a}} gilt anchor on the band. His sailor {{trousers}} were long and wide at the bottom, and <b>the</b> broad <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> blouse had gold anchors sewed on its corners. The boy was still digging at his hole.|$|R
60|$|I thought Wright would choke. He was thick-necked anyway, and the gush {{of blood}} made him tear at <b>the</b> soft <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shirt. Both men were excited now, moving about, {{beginning}} to rouse. I awaited my chance, patient, cold, all my feelings shut in the vise of my will.|$|R
60|$|Bibot {{tried to}} speak; he tugged at <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ragged shirt; an awful curse escaped him.|$|E
60|$|It {{had begun}} to rain as they left Billy's lodgings. Psmith turned up <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Burberry.|$|E
60|$|His cousin reached forward suddenly, and {{catching}} him by <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat pinned {{him down on}} the table.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly {{they stepped}} {{out in the}} roadway almost {{directly}} in front of the on-coming boxsled. The driver, who was crouched down with <b>the</b> big <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat turned up around his ears, had evidently been in deep thought, for when he noticed them he straightened up in surprise and brought his team to a sudden halt.|$|R
5000|$|He had {{an unusual}} {{ambition}} for a pop performer {{trying to make}} a name for himself - to appear on television completely hidden by a prop. In his own words, to [...] "not appear, to stay behind something and not come out". He often hid behind <b>the</b> upturned <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> leather jacket, or wrapped himself around, and effectively behind, the microphone lead.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're right," [...] {{said the}} Antiquary, readjusting <b>the</b> sleeves and <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat, [...] "you're right, Caxon; {{this is a}} naughty night to swim in.--Miss Wardour, let me convey you to the chariot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "SUBITO!" [...] cried Benham, {{and giving}} way to a long-restrained impulse seized the padrone by <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat and shook him vigorously.|$|E
60|$|Keegan turned away, {{and taking}} Thady by <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat, {{led him to}} the window; he began to find he could do nothing with Larry.|$|E
60|$|Philammon seized him by <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ragged tunic, {{and held}} him in a gripe from which the little man, though he twisted like an eel could not escape.|$|E
6000|$|She {{leaned back}} in her chair, and crushed <b>the</b> velvet <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat under her neck in lifting her head to stare at the high-hung mezzotints and family {{photographs}} on the walls, while a flattered smile parted her lips, and there was a little thrill of joy in her voice. [...] "I presume we must be a good deal behind the age in everything at Equity." ...|$|R
60|$|The man in {{the next}} chair roused him by putting down his tumbler with a tap, and seating himself upon the {{cushioned}} fender. Through the mist of smoke, with shoulders hunched, elbows and knees crooked out, cigar protruding, beak-ways, below his nose, and <b>the</b> crimson <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> smoking jacket buttoned close as plumage on his breast, {{he looked a little}} like a gorgeous bird.|$|R
60|$|That evening, as Salome Marsh lay {{in her bed}} in a {{glory of}} sunset light, her heart filled with unutterable {{gratitude}} and happiness, Judith came into the room. She wore her best hat and dress, and she held Lionel Hezekiah by the hand. Lionel Hezekiah's beaming face was scrubbed clean, and his curls fell in beautiful sleekness over <b>the</b> lace <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> velvet suit.|$|R
60|$|He was a tall, slender {{young man}} with a light brown moustache. Imminent little drops of rain hung at the brim of his hat and <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket-coat was turned up.|$|E
60|$|Ten days later, shivering, with <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{thin coat}} turned high, he {{burst into the}} studio of Carolus White {{at the top of}} a tall {{building}} in Tenth Street, New York City.|$|E
60|$|Running {{into the}} water, they seized {{him by the}} hair and <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat, and dragged him into the shallow part easily enough, but they had not {{strength}} to haul him ashore.|$|E
6000|$|... "All little {{children}} were in bed when the Sahib heard that call last," [...] said Bukta, passing Chinn a clean handkerchief. The call brought back memories <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cot under the mosquito-netting, his mother's kiss, {{and the sound of}} footsteps growing fainter as he dropped asleep among his men. So he hooked <b>the</b> dark <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new mess-jacket, and went to dinner like a prince who has newly inherited his father's crown.|$|R
60|$|As {{for that}} lazy naughty boy at Chur, I doubt whether HE will like novels {{when he is}} thirty years of age. He is taking too great a glut of them now. He is eating jelly until he will be sick. He will know most plots {{by the time he}} is twenty, so that HE will never be {{surprised}} when the Stranger {{turns out to be the}} rightful earl,--when the old waterman, throwing off his beggarly gabardine, shows <b>his</b> stars and <b>the</b> <b>collars</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> various orders, and clasping Antonia to his bosom, proves himself to be the prince, her long-lost father. He will recognize the novelist's same characters, though they appear in red-heeled pumps and ailes-de-pigeon, or the garb of the nineteenth century. He will get weary of sweets, as boys of private schools grow (or used to grow, for I have done growing some little time myself, and the practice may have ended too)--as private school-boys used to grow tired of the pudding before their mutton at dinner.|$|R
5000|$|Because the CSM {{represents}} all of {{the enlisted}} soldiers in the command, CSMs assigned to units above brigade do not wear <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> insignia <b>of</b> <b>his</b> or her career specialty (e.g., infantry, quartermaster, intelligence, inter alia), but instead wears the CSM (formerly [...] "branch immaterial") <b>collar</b> insignia. <b>The</b> insignia is a gold-color rendering of the coat of arms of the United States; like the branch of service insignia of all U.S. Army enlisted soldiers, it is placed upon a gold-colored metal disk, one inch in diameter.|$|R
60|$|Sir Andrew went to {{see what}} was the matter, and Hugh, {{breaking}} off his tale, followed him, to find the notary, Basil, on his knees with Grey Dick gripping him by <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> robe.|$|E
60|$|He had straggling gray hair, bleared {{eyes with}} an opaque, glazy look and a bluish cast of countenance. His chin {{was buried in}} <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> open shirt; his {{shoulders}} sagged, and he breathed heavily.|$|E
60|$|Then the Captain {{stepped to}} the press, and pulled open one of the wings of its massive oaken door. He took the huddled inmate by <b>the</b> <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doublet, and lugged him out into the open.|$|E
60|$|Turning up <b>the</b> deep astrachan <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> long coat, <b>the</b> {{stranger}} {{swept out}} of the shop, with the air, Miss Fritten afterwards described it, of a Satrap proroguing a Sanhedrim. Whether such a pleasant function ever fell to a Satrap’s lot she was not quite certain, but the simile faithfully conveyed her meaning to a large circle of acquaintances.|$|R
60|$|Than Kosis now took {{a set of}} the {{ornaments}} {{from one}} of the salvers and placed one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collars</b> <b>of</b> gold about <b>his</b> son's neck, springing the padlock fast. After a few more words addressed to Sab Than he turned to the other figure, from which the officers now removed the enshrouding silks, disclosing to my now comprehending view Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.|$|R
60|$|We {{understood}} {{each other}} very well from the first. He took charge of me as if I were not quite of age. I had a delightful boyish feeling of coming home from school when he muffled me up next morning in an enormous bear-skin travelling-coat and took his seat protectively by my side. The sledge was a very small one and it looked utterly insignificant, almost like a toy behind the four big bays harnessed two and two. We three, counting the coachman, filled it completely. He was a young fellow with clear blue eyes; <b>the</b> high <b>collar</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> livery fur coat framed his cheery countenance and stood all round level with the top <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|R
