5|$|After {{the second}} match ended, Rick Rude and the Junkyard Dog {{made their way}} to the ring. Their match began as Rude {{attacked}} Junkyard Dog from behind, who retaliated by headbutting Rude several times. Subsequently, Rude climbed to the wrestling ring's top rope and pulled down his <b>tights</b> to reveal another pair of <b>tights</b> with a picture of Cheryl Roberts on them. As a result, Jake Roberts, Cheryl Roberts' husband, ran to the ring and attacked Rude, forcing the referee to disqualify the Junkyard Dog.|$|E
5|$|The {{on-screen}} feud between Rick Rude and Jake Roberts began {{weeks before}} SummerSlam. As {{part of his}} gimmick, Rude would—after winning a match—invite a pre-selected woman from the audience to kiss him in the ring. On one occasion, {{one of the women}} refused to comply, later identifying herself as Robert's wife, Cheryl. As the feud intensified, Rude began wearing a pair of <b>tights</b> with a picture of Cheryl stenciled on them, prompting a furious Roberts to charge into the ring and strip the <b>tights</b> off Rude, appearing to television viewers to leave Rude naked, although the live audience saw him stripped to a G-string instead.|$|E

5|$|Although Monroe {{had become}} one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, her {{contract}} had not changed since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects or co-workers. She was also tired of being typecast, and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in dramas. When she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version of The Girl in Pink <b>Tights,</b> which was to co-star Frank Sinatra, the studio suspended her on January 4, 1954.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the group}} had {{generated}} sales of 620 million Deutsche Mark and employed 22,600 employees. In the mid-1960s Triumph International introduced broad scale electronic data processing. Due to the economic crisis, the company encountered significant difficulties {{for the first time}} at the beginning of the 1970s, meaning the company even had to introduce short-term work. The crisis also affected the company’s <b>tights</b> sales, which they had begun in 1969 and discontinued only three years later. At the same time, Triumph International began for the first time to produce products from lighter fabrics with fibers such as nylon or lycra.|$|E
30|$|In this article, <b>tight</b> {{oil and gas}} {{accumulation}} {{refers to}} that occurring in low-permeability reservoirs that are not source rocks or shale, which primarily includes petroleum accumulations in <b>tight</b> sandstone and <b>tight</b> carbonate reservoirs. Accordingly, such reservoirs are known as <b>tight</b> reservoirs. Two models were proposed to interpret hydrocarbon accumulations in such <b>tight</b> reservoirs as <b>tight</b> sandstones, which are: (1) the deep-basin or basin-centered gas model, {{also known as the}} continuous accumulation model; and (2) the conventional trap-controlled accumulation model. Recently, Zhao et al. (2012 a, 2013, 2016 a) proposed a new model termed quasi-continuous accumulation and demonstrated that <b>tight</b> oil and gas are dominated by quasi-continuous accumulation, while discontinuous (conventional trap-controlled) accumulations are of subordinate importance. Zhao et al. (2016 a) also argued that the so-called continuous (basin-centered) accumulations actually do not exist in non-source-rock <b>tight</b> reservoirs such as <b>tight</b> sandstones. Hence, two types of hydrocarbon accumulations can be caused in <b>tight</b> petroleum systems, namely the quasi-continuous accumulation and discontinuous accumulation.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tight</b> geodesics were {{introduced}} by Masur-Minsky in [17]. They and their hierarchies {{have been a}} powerful tool {{in the study of}} the curve complex, mapping class groups, Teichmüller spaces, and hyperbolic 3 -manifolds. In the same paper, they showed that there are at least one and at most finitely many <b>tight</b> geodesics between any two vertices in the curve complex. Bowditch found a uniform finiteness property on <b>tight</b> geodesics [9], and this property has given further important applications in some of the above studies. In this paper, we introduce classes of geodesics which are not <b>tight</b> but still have the uniform finiteness property. These classes of geodesics will be obtained as examples of weak <b>tight</b> geodesics which {{were introduced}} and shown to have the property in [19]. The aim of this paper is to study about weak <b>tight</b> geodesics focusing on giving examples of them with canonical constructions and investigating gaps between two classes of them. Our main investigation will be on weak <b>tight</b> geodesics contained in the class of M-weakly <b>tight</b> geodesics where M is the bound given by the bounded geodesic image theorem. As M-weakly <b>tight</b> geodesics contain <b>tight</b> geodesics, the classes of weak <b>tight</b> geodesics to be introduced in this paper will live around <b>tight</b> geodesics. In appendices, we expand some of these studies to outside of the class of M-weakly <b>tight</b> geodesics...|$|R

5|$|The next {{match was}} for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, in which Randy Orton defended the {{championship}} against Shelton Benjamin. The match began with Benjamin performing a drop kick on Orton, which knocked him out {{to the outside of}} the ring. Benjamin proceeded to knock Orton over the security barricade into the crowd. Orton got the advantage, after Ric Flair {{made his way to the}} ring, distracting Benjamin in the process. The match came to an end when Benjamin went off the top rope and dove onto Orton, but Orton rolled through and hooked Benjamin's <b>tights</b> to pin Benjamin for the three count and retaining the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|Women in {{athletics}} often wear bikinis of similar size as those worn in beach volleyball. Amy Acuff, a US high-jumper, {{wore a black}} leather bikini instead of a track suit at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

In the 2007 South Pacific Games, the rules were adjusted to allow players to wear less revealing shorts and cropped sports tops instead of bikinis. At the West Asian Games in 2006, organizers banned bikini-bottoms for female athletes {{and asked them to}} wear long shorts.|$|E

Crush made his televised debut in WWF under his new character on May 9, 1992 episode of Superstars, defeating Kato. Crush made his first pay-per-view appearance under the gimmick with a win over Repo Man at SummerSlam. Crush then engaged in a feud with Doink the Clown, after he was attacked with a loaded prosthetic arm while confronting the clown about his cruel pranks on children at ringside, which caused Crush to miss the 1993 Royal Rumble. The feud culminated at WrestleMania IX, where Crush lost after a second, identical Doink appeared from underneath the ring and struck Crush with the prosthetic arm. At the first King of the Ring pay-per-view, Crush challenged Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship, but lost the match after a distraction by Doink.|$|E

Interspersed are some scenes from a photo shoot within her film Dreamgirls. This version appears on the Dreamgirls DVD release. In the director's cut of this version, Beyoncé is seen posing for a photo shoot not featured in the film in which she wears very outlandish clothing. As the shoot progresses it becomes more and more evident that Beyoncé is not happy with the direction of the shoot and when she is handed a bird to pose with she becomes fed up, walks away and strips down to the black tank top and <b>tights</b> underneath. She then climbs the staircase of the building to the rooftop and finishes singing the song.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, competitors Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel were unable, {{due to a}} pre-match stipulation, to hit {{each other in the}} face. The two men exchanged holds but were both preoccupied with looking to ringside for approval from Sensational Sherri. Martel gained the advantage by throwing Michaels to the outside of the ring and attacking him there. When the two returned to the ring, they took turns attempting to pin their opponent, pulling down their opponent's wrestling <b>tights</b> to reveal their buttocks each time. Michaels then kicked Martel and tried to pin him, but the referee stopped the three-count because Michaels' feet were on the ropes. Both wrestlers broke the pre-match stipulation by slapping each other in the face. Sherri pretended to faint, which drew the attention of both wrestlers. Michaels and Martel argued over who would carry Sherri backstage, with each man carrying her a few feet before being stopped by his opponent. Both wrestlers were counted out, but they continued to argue. Martel tried to revive Sherri by throwing water on her, but he hit Michaels as well. Michaels dropped Sherri and chased Martel backstage; upset at being left behind by both men, Sherri screamed and cried as she walked backstage.|$|E

On July 13, Ziggler, Zack Ryder and Justin Roberts were involved in a car accident in San Diego while driving from Comic-Con; none of them suffered severe injuries. Two days later at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Ziggler won the Money in the Bank ladder match to guarantee him the opportunity to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at a time of his choosing within the next year. Later that night, Ziggler attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus after Alberto Del Rio attacked him after their match, but Del Rio stopped Ziggler from cashing in. On the following episode of SmackDown, Ziggler again attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus following a tag team match with Alberto Del Rio, but was laid out by Rey Mysterio and Sheamus before he could do so. During this time, Ziggler began a feud with Chris Jericho after claiming he had lost his touch, which resulted in Jericho attacking him on two occasions, and defeating him in a singles match at SummerSlam. The night after SummerSlam, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch; as a result Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated. Following this, Ziggler began feuding with Randy Orton on SmackDown four days later, after Orton hit him with an RKO when Ziggler tried to cash his Money in the Bank contract on a vulnerable Sheamus. The following week on SmackDown, Ziggler faced Orton in a match that was won by Orton, Ziggler defeated him in a rematch on Raw by pinning him while holding his <b>tights.</b> Ziggler faced Orton again at Night of Champions where he lost again, ending the feud. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Ziggler captained the traditional 5-on-5 elimination tag team match opposite Mick Foley and won the match by last pinning Orton, making him the sole survivor of the match.|$|E

The following week on SmackDown, the two faced off in a match that was won by Orton. Three days later on Raw, Orton was defeated by Ziggler in a rematch, after Ziggler pinned him while holding his <b>tights.</b> Orton and Ziggler faced each other again at Night of Champions where Orton won. On the September 28 SmackDown, Orton was scheduled to face Big Show in a number one contenders match for the World Heavyweight Championship. However, a pre-match assault from Alberto Del Rio cost Orton the match and started a feud. Orton returned to SmackDown two weeks later, attacking Del Rio and his ring announcer Ricardo Rodriguez. The rivalry built to a singles match on October 28 at Hell in a Cell, where Orton emerged victorious. On the following episode of Main Event, Orton teamed with Rey Mysterio and Sin Cara to face Del Rio and the Prime Time Players (Darren Young and Titus O'Neil) in six-man tag team bout that ended with Orton pinning Del Rio for the win. On the November 6 SmackDown, Orton defeated Del Rio again in a Falls Count Anywhere match, after executing the RKO onto the ring steps. The two were then on opposing teams for the traditional five-on-five elimination tag match on November 18 at Survivor Series. Del Rio's team, led by Dolph Ziggler, ended up defeating Orton's team, led by Mick Foley.
