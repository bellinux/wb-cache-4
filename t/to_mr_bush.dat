50|$|The first Clear Lake {{newspaper}} was the Independent, established by Silas Noyes and John M. Brainard. The first issue bore the date, February 10, 1860. Its publication was continued {{for about a}} year, when it was moved to Hancock County, Iowa. The Observer was then established in 1869. George E. Frost was the first proprietor of the Observer. After two years of editorship he sold the office to Judge M.P. Rosecrans who made the paper entirely independent, in tone and sentiment, where before it had been strongly republican. Mr. Rosecrans soon sold the office to parties in Belmond. Mr. Frost then purchased a new outfit and for 6 or 7 years was the editor. In 1879 he sold <b>to</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> who changed the name to the Clear Lake Mirror. In April 1896, J.C. Davenport established another weekly paper here which he called the Clear Lake Reporter. These two weekly newspapers combined under one ownership with the Reporter buying the Mirror in 1951. They operated as twin weeklies with the Mirror published on Tuesdays and the Reporter on Fridays until January 1955 when the two joined together to become the Mirror and Reporter. The Clear Lake Mirror Reporter has been under current ownership since 1983 when a corporation was formed as Prefin, Inc. The team of Dave Presler and Michael Finnegan comprised the business which also owned other area newspapers. Presler moved on from the company and focus was placed to ownership of the Clear Lake paper by Finnegan, selling off the other newspapers and concentrating all his efforts into the newspaper as it currently stands.|$|E
40|$|Our {{world is}} facing lot of {{challenges}} with no solution in sight. The {{main cause of}} all these ills is the POVERTY. The problem of poverty has given rise ot many other problems such as the problem of taxes, terrorism,drug abuse. In this article I will describe the solution for these problems. 1. Do not barrow the money which cannot be returned with interest and in time. Issue bonds {{which can be used}} by everybody rich or poor and and are not debt so there is no question of interest. Take the example of USA which is under threat of great recession. USA borrows money by selling treasury bills and the interest based bonds. The suggestion is to sell these bonds on non interest basis. ONE dollar buys 5 bonds on the condition that the amount should be $ 100000 or multiple of it. Fewer amounts will have rate of four and three. This discount period is only for one month {{at the start of the}} implementation of this system. In the second month the rate will be 4 in the next month. The rate of 3 will apply to subsequent months for the same amount. These bonds will be used in all state controlled services and commodities. For example a bill of (any service or commodity) $ 100 can be paid with 200 bonds and there will be no exception to this rule. A NET DISCOUNT OF 60 %. A simple formula will apply :Total bill in dollars x 2 is the number of bonds surrendered. Price in bonds will not be less than the cost price but without the direct indirect taxes and the duties which are added to the present to make it very expensive. It will attract at least 150 million people to take this opportunity as early as possible. And if one is sure of making 100 % profit within 30 days there will be many more who will help themselves. The result will be that the government gets at least $ 15 trillion within a very short period of time of few days and much more in the rest of the year. THIS IS NOT A LONE AS STATE HAS SOLD BONDS(Commodity) WHICH IS AN ALTERNATE CURRENCY AND DO NOT CARRY ANY INTEREST. One immediately thinks that who will bear the loss and this big loss to the state is not more than total year budget of $ 12 trillion which it collects in one year with all the taxes and the duties but the bond price is simply a cost price without any kind of tax or duty. The state will float tenders to will select a private agency (USMF) UNITED STATES MONITORY FUND JUST A NAME GIVEN TO THIS ORGANIZATION with the lowest bid WHERE AS second third and forth bidders will be auditors of USMF. This agency will employ at least 20 million unemployed on 10 % commission basis and without any salary. These agents will have to pay $ 500 as an annual fee to USMF in order to built the infrastructure for the sale of bonds. Agents quota Will be $ 300000 per month or they will be allowed to sell their whole year quota in one day or in a month, This will only materialize if the agent shares his commission with the would be buyer. Greater the share of commission quicker the sale. This investor or a buyer will sell these bonds at the same rate of 5 per dollar and his bonds will sell like hot cakes every day as there is no condition of the amount of money to purchase any amount of bonds. In this way even the poorest person will get the same rate as the investor except for the commission which he takes from the agent who makes almost 100 % profit by only investing $ 100000. He will sell these bonds repeatedly and will keep at least 6 % profit every day till the demand lasts. NOW THINK HOW MUCH STATE HAS ACCUMULATED Much more than few years budget in matter of only one month. This is only the first flood gate of money and there are seven of these yet to open so at the end of 30 days or even much earlier the government declares tax free country for ever. With the removal of all kinds of direct and indirect taxes and duties the price of oil electricity telephone and of all types on other items under government control is almost 60 % less than before as these are being purchased by bonds(which is the cost price) and not with dollars. The production cost of every thing has come down tremendously. State also offers one million duty free if one deposits $ 100000 non refundable. This brings out all the black and spare money which state WAS NOT ABLE TO GET BEFORE AND AS THERE IS NO TAX AND HENCE NO TAX EVASION SO ALL THE MONEY IS WHITE AS IT IS BEING GIVEN TO GOVERNMENT. This was the second flood gate of money which is even bigger than the first one and the exact amount is impossible to asses unless the system is implemented. In order to provide cheep bonds through out the year government offers three types of registration fees. Pay $ 100000 in the start of the year and get the rate of 5 for the rest of the year and this will suit the professional’s and salaried person. Pay $ 10000 yearly and get 20000 new bonds at the rate 5 every month but one has to collect 10000 bonds(equal to fee) to get this cheap rate through out the year. Higher the registration fee More the entitlement of cheep bonds. This registration will suit any small time business who will sell his product cheaper provided 15 % bonds are also paid with rest of cash money by the customer SEE THE NEXT REGISTRATION FOR FARTHER EXPLANATION 15 %BONDS. This will apply to all goods in private sector and does not apply to the government sector. This is a big incentive to accept bonds in the private sector as the business accepting more bonds will have more business than the trader not accepting the bonds so the bonds market will multiply and there will be a constant need for bonds in the open market. The third type of registration will be of $ 100000 which will entitle the business to sell its products through USMF. The value of merchandise sold through this source will help the business to get the 5 bond per dollar rate equal to the amount sold or opt for the duty free option equal the amount sold. But with one condition of surrendering 15 % bonds at each sale in dollars. The example is the merchandised sold through USMF & 1000. The BONDS SURRENDERED 150 ARE DEPOSITED IN STATE ACCOUNT TO BE SOLD AGAIN SO THE CYCLE OF BONDS IS ESTABLISHED. A receipt of of bonds surrendered is obtained from USMF for evidence of sale of merchandise and this receipt will entitle the the traders to get cheep bonds or the duty free option through out the year BUT THE SAME RECEIPT CAN BE USED ONCE ONLY. The benefit to the business is cheap bonds throughout the year and the duty free option will help the industry. The quota which can be sold is ten times the amount of Registration but not more unless the registration fee is increased. Now all the business will opt for this registration in order to reduce the cost of production. These 15 % bonds the business will get back through a chain of dealers sub dealers and ultimately the customer will pay this bond portion as he will get the end product very cheep because of tremendous cut in the cost of production by the factors already mentioned. This will replace the GST or the VAT or the two price system seen all over USA. Almost every body will sell their product through this channel as it will be much costlier to sell the product out side this system as cheap bonds are not available otherwise. According to rough estimate at least $ 1000 trillion transactions are carried out every day in US and at each transaction 15 % bonds are being surrendered,the price 15 bonds is $ 3. So 3 % of 1000 trillion will be $ 30 trillion which goes into government account without any compulsion every day(UNBELIEVABLE) this is the third flood gate of money AND IS CALLED THE GOLD MINE. Now the state is sitting in the driving seat and all the money in banks of private sector have transferred into government account and banks are no more the lenders but are borrower from the state which is the only source left and will invest in business with sound feasibility study checked by the state bank. The state will offer to invest 80 % and the bank will bring investor who is willing to pool rest 20 %. This 20 % will be deposited in the bank and the bank will oversee the running the business, running expenses will be given to the investor from its share of 20 %. There will be no collateral and share of the profit and loss will be shared in the ratio of 60 and 40. The bank will share the 60 % with the investor and 40 % will go to state funds and the state will provide every thing under its control below cost which will farther reduce the cost of production and at the same time will MARKEDLY improve the profit margins OF ALL THE BUSINESSES. No major business can refuse this offer. Any bank showing repeated loss will go out of business as there will be no more funds available from the government source and all other interest based sources are not available any more. Interest based banking is is gone for ever or it may be at a very small scale and the state will not offer loans on interest as these are not any more profitable and risk free as there is no collateral. The amount of profit government will share will be unimaginable and this is the 5 Th flood gate opened. Last but not the least government will acquire all the land on lease without any force and will provide all the needs to the formers THROUGH CORPORATE FARMING SECTOR HIRED BY THE STATE below cost and will become the shareholder according to the mutual contract with the land owner this is the 6 TH flood gate of money. 2 -The drug abuse will be eliminiated when all the possible land is being cultivated by best agriculture engineers there will be much better yield and much more profit to land owner then who will not join hands with the government. THE OBVIOUS BENEFIT WILL BE THERE WILL BE NO MORE POPPY CULTIVATION IN COUNTRIES WHICH ARE POOR AND LARGELY DEPEND ON THE POPPY CROP. NOW THERE IS NO MORE POPPY AND NO MORE DRUGS. 3 -The solution of trerrorism lies in the eliminaton of poverty [...] We have to look at root cause and that is the POVERTY and NOT the religion which is being falsely blamed. Th going rate for a suicide bomber is $ 1000 in Pakistan Iraq and in Afghanistan. Can one believe that any one having at least two meals a day will blow himself ?Never the areas of the countries where these attacks are happening are extremely poor and the extremist elements who themselves are or were poor exploit these very poor people to carryout attacks for money to save their families from dying from hunger and is open secret. Osama Bin Laden has large force that is recruited from poor areas as there in no job anywhere and he provides these raw recruits with only food and shelter and at same time brainwash them and train some of them to carry out these attacks by giving them enough money in their lives to support their dependents. You might mention few isolated cases of being well to do and still carried out these attacks. Once the poverty is removed in these areas by implementing this system these attacks will come to an end immediately. This system is not only meant for USA but will be easily applicable to every country. A STRONG EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO REACH THE RULERS OF THESE COUNTRIES AND ALSO <b>TO</b> <b>MR</b> <b>BUSH</b> BUT SO FAR THERE HAS BEEN NO SUCCESS. I HAVE THE BLUE PRINT OF A REAL AND PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO GET USA FORCES OUT OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN WITHOUT VIOLENCE IN MATTER OF 6 MONTHS. IF ALL THE ABOVE IMPOSSIBLE CLAIMS I HAVE MADE ARE POSSIBLE AND TRUE TO THE LAST DETAIL THEN THERE IS NO REASON THAT THIS MESSAGE SHOULD NOT REACH THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR PROMPT FUTURE COURSE OF ACTION.
