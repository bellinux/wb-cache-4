40|$|When {{we speak}}, we speak in {{prosodic}} chunks.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} capture of Schuckmannsburg in the Caprivi Strip by a {{combined}} force of BSAP and Northern Rhodesia Police on 21 September 1914, the British South Africa Company's own armed forces and police remained almost totally uninvolved in the war until the following month. The South African Prime Minister, the former Boer general Louis Botha, had told Britain that the Union could both handle its own security during the hostilities and defeat German South-West Africa without help, so the Imperial garrison {{had been sent to}} the Western Front. Lieutenant-Colonel Manie Maritz—an ex-Boer commander who now headed a column of Afrikaans-speaking Union troops—defected to the Germans in mid-September, hoping to spark an uprising that would overthrow British supremacy in South Africa and restore the old Boer Republics. Botha requested the 500-man column that the Chartered Company had raised, hoping to reduce the possibility of further defections by interspersing his own forces with firmly pro-British Rhodesians. The expeditionary force was promptly formalised in Salisbury, and named the 1st Rhodesia Regiment after <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> Southern Rhodesian volunteers that had fought in the Anglo-Boer War. Apart from a small contingent of Matabele (or Ndebele) scouts, the unit was all white.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of evolutionary biology, studies of mutation and genetic diversity in natural populations, combined with biogeography and systematics, led to sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolution. Paleontology and comparative anatomy allowed more detailed reconstructions of the evolutionary history of life. After the rise of molecular genetics in the 1950s, the field of molecular evolution developed, based on protein sequences and immunological tests, and later incorporating RNA and DNA studies. The gene-centered view of evolution rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the neutral theory of molecular evolution, sparking debates over adaptationism, <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> selection, and {{the relative importance of}} genetic drift versus natural selection as causes of evolution. In the late 20th-century, DNA sequencing led to molecular phylogenetics and the reorganization of the tree of life into the three-domain system by Carl Woese. In addition, the newly recognized factors of symbiogenesis and horizontal gene transfer introduced yet more complexity into evolutionary theory. Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a significant impact not just within the traditional branches of biology, but also in other academic disciplines (for example: anthropology and psychology) and on society at large.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1890s onwards Giovanni Giorgi and Oliver Heaviside {{corresponded with}} each other {{regarding}} these anomalous results. This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to {{the congress of the}} Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.) in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent electro-mechanical system of units could be obtained by adding a fourth base unit of an electrical nature (ampere, volt or ohm) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report. This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the electro-mechanical quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given physical dimensions. His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played in the establishment of a coherent, rational system of units with the joule as <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> energy and the electrical units in the practical system of units remaining unchanged.|$|E

5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the z-axis toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E
5|$|The SI base {{units are}} the {{building}} blocks of the system and all other units are derived from them. When Maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit. Theoretically any one of electric current, potential difference, electrical resistance, electrical charge or a number of other quantities could have provided the base unit, with the remaining units then being defined by the laws of physics. In the event, <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, substance and luminous intensity) were added later.|$|E
5|$|The {{capacitor}} is {{a development}} of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance. <b>The</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> capacitance is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol F: one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.|$|E

5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. <b>The</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistor}} {{is perhaps}} the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance {{is a consequence of}} the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.|$|E
