40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The study {{sought to}} {{determine}} dynamic changes and theoretical bases of a clinical diagnostic test, the <b>tear</b> clearance rate. METHODS [...] Thirty four healthy subjects {{ranging in age from}} 22 to 84 years underwent examination of <b>tear</b> clearance rate, the Schirmer test with anaesthesia, as well as fluorophotometric measurement of <b>tear</b> turnover, <b>tear</b> volume, and <b>tear</b> flow. By applying 0. 5 % fluorescein into the conjunctival sac and subsequently measuring colour fades on a Schirmer strip, the <b>tear</b> clearance rate for assessing <b>tear</b> drainage was divided into nine grades. The results of the <b>tear</b> clearance rate were compared with those of the basal <b>tear</b> turnover and <b>tear</b> flow obtained from fluorophotometry. RESULTS [...] Significant relations were found between the <b>tear</b> clearance rate and the basal <b>tear</b> turnover or <b>tear</b> flow (r = 0. 91 and 0. 79, respectively, p = 0. 0001). Considering the grades of progression from low to high, each grade of <b>tear</b> clearance rate showed a 12. 5 % increase in basal <b>tear</b> turnover (3. 59 %/min) and <b>tear</b> flow (0. 38 microliter/min). There was no significant correlation between age and the basal <b>tear</b> turnover, <b>tear</b> volume, <b>tear</b> flow, or the <b>tear</b> clearance rate. CONCLUSION [...] The <b>tear</b> clearance rate is proposed as a simple and useful way to estimate basal <b>tear</b> turnover and <b>tear</b> flow, and measure <b>tear</b> drainage indirectly...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{assess the}} <b>tear</b> film {{quantity}} and correlate {{it with the}} quality and stability of the <b>tear</b> film in diabetics and compare them to age matched controls. Introduction. Diabetes affects <b>tear</b> film parameters in multiple ways. Poor metabolic control and neuropathy are postulated factors. To further understand how diabetes affects <b>tear</b> film parameters this study was conducted. Subjects and Methods. <b>Tear</b> meniscus height was measured by anterior segment OCT, along with <b>tear</b> thinning time, a subtype of noninvasive <b>tear</b> break-up time, and blinking rate per minute which were all recorded for 22 diabetic patients. Correlations between these <b>tear</b> film parameters were studied and then compared to 16 age matched controls. Results. A statistically {{significant difference was found}} in blinking rate between the diabetic and the control group (P= 0. 002), with higher blinking rate among diabetics. All <b>tear</b> film parameters were negatively correlated with duration of diabetes. A positive correlation was found between <b>tear</b> film volume and stability. Conclusion. Diabetes affects the <b>tear</b> film in various ways. Diabetics should be examined for dry eye signs even in absence of symptoms which may be masked by associated neuropathy.

MethodsThe experimental group consisted of 32 healthy females (mean age was 34. 72 ± 5. 44) on injectable hormonal contraceptives; and the control group comprised 32 females (mean age was 34. 66 ± 5. 24) who were not on hormonal contraceptives. The <b>tear</b> stability and <b>tear</b> secretion were measured using the non-invasive <b>tear</b> break up time (NITBUT) technique and Schirmer's strips, respectively. All the females were at follicular phase of menstrual cycle. The plasma levels of progesterone and estradiol of all subjects were determined. ResultsThere were no remarkable effects of injectable hormonal contraceptives on <b>tear</b> secretion (P= 0. 929) and <b>tear</b> stability (P= 0. 814). There were weak correlations between the plasma levels of progesterone and <b>tear</b> secretion (r=− 0. 232, P> 0. 05), {{as well as with}} <b>tear</b> stability (r=− 0. 322, P> 0. 05). Also, there were weak positive correlation between plasma levels of estradiol and <b>tear</b> secretion (r= 0. 304, P> 0. 05), as well as with <b>tear</b> stability (r= 0. 262, P> 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences in}} <b>tear</b> stability between the experimental and control groups (P> 0. 05). ConclusionsInjectable hormonal contraceptives had no significant effects on <b>tear</b> secretion and <b>tear</b> stability of healthy women of childbearing age.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the diagnostic performance {{and reliability of}} ultrasonography (US) in detecting and grading common extensor tendon (CET) <b>tear</b> in patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis (LE), using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the reference standard. The study comprised fifty-eight chronic LE patients. Each patient underwent US and MRI. CET status was classified as: high-grade <b>tear</b> (≥ 50 % thickness), low-grade <b>tear</b> (< 50 % thickness), suspected <b>tear</b> (possible but not evident <b>tear),</b> no <b>tear.</b> Additionally, the following dichotomous scale was used: confirmed or unconfirmed CET <b>tear.</b> Relative US parameters (versus MRI) for detecting CET <b>tear</b> included: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy. The agreement between US and MRI findings was measured using the weighted Cohen kappa coefficient (κ). US showed moderate agreement with MRI in detecting and grading CET <b>tear</b> (κ = 0. 49). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in CET <b>tear</b> detecting by US were 64. 52 %, 85. 19 %, and 72. 73 %, respectively. PPV and NPV of US were 83. 33 % and 67. 65 %, respectively. No patient with unconfirmed CET <b>tear</b> on US had high-grade CET <b>tear</b> on MRI. Ultrasonography is a valuable imaging modality {{that can be used}} as a screening tool to exclude high-grade CET <b>tear</b> in chronic LE patients.

5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube <b>tears</b> the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal <b>tears</b> {{to the back of}} the trachea or <b>tears</b> on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E
5|$|Freshly cut onions often cause a {{stinging}} sensation {{in the eyes}} of people nearby, and often uncontrollable <b>tears.</b> This is caused by the release of a volatile gas, syn-propanethial-S-oxide, which stimulates nerves in the eye creating {{a stinging}} sensation. This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism: chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases. These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids. A specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme, the lacrimatory factor synthase, producing the syn-propanethial-S-oxide. This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes, where it activates sensory neurons. Lacrimal glands produce <b>tears</b> to dilute and flush out the irritant.|$|E

40|$|Both {{cytotoxic}} and invasive {{strains of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa can damage corneal epithelial cells in vitro, but neither can infect healthy corneas in vivo. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} whole human <b>tear</b> fluid can protect corneal epithelia against P. aeruginosa virulence mechanisms. Cultured corneal epithelial cells were inoculated with 106 CFU of one of 10 strains of P. aeruginosa (five cytotoxic, five invasive) /ml with or without reflex <b>tear</b> fluid collected from the conjunctival sacs of human volunteers. Cytotoxicity was assessed by observation of trypan blue staining and measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release; invasion was quantified by using gentamicin survival assays. <b>Tear</b> fluid retarded growth of only 50 % of the P. aeruginosa strains (three of five invasive strains, two of five cytotoxic strains) yet protected corneal cells against invasion by or cytotoxicity of 9 of 10 strains. The only strain resistant to the <b>tear</b> cytoprotective effects was susceptible to <b>tear</b> bacteriostatic activity. Dilution of <b>tear</b> fluid threefold significantly reduced cytoprotection, while bacteriostatic activity prevailed with dilutions beyond 100 -fold. Sulfacetamide (1 mg/ml) with bacteriostatic activity matching that of <b>tear</b> fluid was less cytoprotective than <b>tear</b> fluid (80 % protection with <b>tear</b> fluid, 48 % with sulfacetamide). Video microscopy revealed bacterial chain formation in both <b>tear</b> fluid and sulfacetamide, but <b>tear</b> fluid also blocked bacterial swimming motility. After prolonged <b>tear</b> contact, bacteria regained normal growth rates, swimming motility, and cytotoxic activity, suggesting a breakdown of protective <b>tear</b> factors. Boiled <b>tear</b> fluid lost bacteriostatic activity and effects on bacterial motility but retained cytoprotective function. These results suggest that human <b>tear</b> fluid can protect corneal epithelial cells against P. aeruginosa virulence mechanisms in a manner not dependent upon bacteriostatic activity or effects on bacterial motility.
