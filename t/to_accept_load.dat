Composite consist of matrix and filler. Matrix is material compilation for composite, its function is to bond filler simultaneously; then, it is to form a unit structure of material element of composite that it is be able <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>load.</b> Matrix is divided into three groups; they are metal, ceramic, polymer.

40|$|The {{transition}} to smart grids is an on-going process that may both shape and {{be shaped by}} end-users' energy behavioural adaptations. This study explores current and potential energy behavioural adaptations in Portugal during the smart grid transition process. A web-based survey was made to {{a representative sample of}} a specific segment of Portuguese residential end-users. The survey evaluated current energy behaviours and hypothetical future behaviours in a dynamic pricing scenario. Results show this population segment has a positive predisposition towards smart technologies and demand shifting, but it is less likely <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>load</b> control and switch to the liberalised energy market. Factors influencing the behavioural potential are mostly related with market regulation, households' practices and usage behaviours, interference with the private domain, information and technical aspects, and social values. To facilitate behavioural adaptations several strategies are recommended, such as improving the energy market regulation, assessing households' behaviours, prioritising actions already embedded in households daily routines, not interfering with their activities and ensure an override option, and improving energy services, trust and information provided to end-users. The conclusions of the present study are of utmost importance for the design of more effective demand response programmes and energy policies...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{the blade}} fatigue testing {{capabilities}} at NREL were upgraded from single-axis to two-axis loading. To implement this, several practical challenges were addressed, as hardware complexity increased dramatically with two actuators applying the loads {{at right angles}} to each other. A custom bellcrank was designed and implemented to minimize the load angle errors and to prevent actuator side loading. The control system was upgraded <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>load</b> and displacement feedback from two actuators. The inherent long strokes uniquely associated with wind turbine blade-tests required substantial real-time corrections for both the control and data systems. A custom data acquisition and control system was developed using a National Instruments LabVIEW platform that interfaces with proprietary servo-hydraulic software developed by MTS Corporation. Before testing, the program is run under quasi-static (slow speed) conditions and iterates to determine the correct operational control parameters for the controller, taking into consideration geometry, test speed, and phase angle errors between the two actuators. Comparisons are made between single-axis and two-axis test loads using actual test load data and load uncertainties are qualitatively described. To date, two fatigue tests have been completed and another is currently ongoing using NREL's two-axis capability...|$|E

At the local scale, the principal mechanisms controlling the temperature map on the cell plane have been analysed {{and it has been}} shown that the fluid dynamics of the anodic and cathodic gases on the cell could have a fundamental role in thermal optimisation.

DESIGN A review of current literature and the scientific evidence for rehabilitation after articular cartilage repair of the knee.

If a customer has {{the capability to}} accurately determine whether <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> an offer or not, then {{in the case of}} accepting an offer, the customer can earn both an option premium to participate, and a strike price for load curtailments if requested.

The research is motivated by the need <b>to</b> study <b>load</b> <b>accepting</b> and <b>load</b> rejection characteristics of cooperating gas turbines. Only overall performance parameters of the gas turbine are provided by the manufacture and that made it difficult to carry out such studies. This work proposes the use of scaling method in the fixed geometry region and stage-stacking method in the variable geometry region. Generalized stage and overall component performance curves, all from literature, are used in presenting the performance maps. Characteristics of compressors whose actual maps are known are first used to choose a reference map. Relying on the selected map, predicted performance curves are obtained for the aforesaid gas turbine. The variable geometry is demonstrated considering actual data from literature. Having the design point parameters from limited overall performance data, the proposed approach has managed to get the key performance maps. The results can be used for stability, performance optimization and condition monitoring studies...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to present}} a new robustness-based design {{strategy}} for thin-walled composite structures under compressive loading, which combines strength requirements {{in terms of the}} limit and ultimate load with robustness requirements evaluated from the structural energy until collapse. Design/methodology/approach – In order to assess the structural energy, the area under the load-shortening curve between several characteristic points such as local buckling, global buckling, onset of degradation and collapse load is calculated. In this context, a geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis is carried out, in which the ply properties are selectively degraded by progressive failure. Findings – The advantage of the proposed methodology is observed by analyzing unstiffened composite plates under compressive loading, wherein the lightest plate that satisfies both strength and robustness requirements can be attained. Practical implications – As a practical implication, this methodology gives a new argument <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the collapse <b>load</b> close to the ultimate load once robustness is ensured. Originality value – The structural energy is employed to investigate the robustness of thin-walled composite structures in postbuckling, and new energy-based robustness measures are proposed. In the design of composite structures, this innovative strategy might lead to a more robust design when compared to an approach that only accounts for the ultimate load...|$|R

This gun, {{referred to}} as the LCLS gun, is {{a modified version of the}} UCLA/BNL/SLAC 1. 6 cell S-Band RF gun [1], {{referred to as}} the prototype gun. The changes include a larger mode separation (15 MHz for the LCLS gun vs. 3. 5 MHz for the prototype gun), a larger radius at the iris between the 2 cells, a reduced surface field on the curvature of the iris between the two cells, Z power coupling, increased cooling channels for operation at 120 Hz, dual rf feed, deformation tuning of the full cell, and field probes in both cells. Temporal shaping of the klystron pulse, to reduce the average power dissipated in the gun, has also been adopted. By increasing the mode separation, the amplitude of the 0 -mode electric field on the cathode decreases from 10 % of the peak on axis field for the prototype gun to less than 3 % for the LCLS gun for the steady state fields.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Production {{planning}} in fish processing is {{heavily dependent on}} the raw material supply. Because of the uncertainties associated with the quantity of catch and its composition, planning for production is a difficult task. Until recently the fish processing plants in Iceland also had <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the entire <b>loads</b> of fishing fleet vessels whenever the vessels had opportunity to land their catch. This uncertainty and randomness in the raw material supply requires frequent decisions on production plans for product mix, assignment of labour to machines and facilities, and the raw material inventory to be carried from one period to the next. This research develops a decision support system (dss) for integrating fishing and fish processing. The two primary components of dss are a simulation model and a linear programming model. The simulation model analyzes the trawler operations, including generating the catch, controlling {{the length of a}} fishing trip, and the order in which trawlers land their catch so as to provide a steady raw material supply. The linear programming model uses the output from the simulation model to determine labour requirements, work-in-process inventory levels and amount of products produced so as to optimize production costs. The research shows that heuristic and deterministic models can be integrated to form a decision support system that can aid in effective decision making...|$|R
