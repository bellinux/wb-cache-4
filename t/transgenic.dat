5|$|Genetic {{modification}} of animals to study disease. <b>Transgenic</b> animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific {{conditions such as}} single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease. Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as diabetes, or even <b>transgenic</b> mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer. These models allow investigations on {{how and why the}} disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of these <b>transgenic</b> models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.|$|E

Notable studies on non-human primates {{have been part of the}} polio vaccine development, and development of Deep Brain Stimulation, and their current heaviest non-toxicological use occurs in the monkey AIDS model, SIV. In 2008 a proposal to ban all primates experiments in the EU has sparked a vigorous debate.|$|E
5|$|The {{gene for}} apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5, gene ID 116519, OMIM {{accession}} number – 606368) was originally found by comparative sequencing {{of human and}} mice DNA as a last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins APOA1/APOC3/APOA4/APOA5, located on human chromosome 11 at position 11q23. The creation of two mice models (APOA5 <b>transgenic</b> and APOA5 knock-out) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride determination. The <b>transgenic</b> mice had lower and the knock-out mice higher levels of plasma triglycerides, while plasma cholesterol levels remained unchanged in both animal models.|$|E

The study used two <b>transgenic</b> lines of potato, both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant. According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not substantially equivalent, {{as one of the}} <b>transgenic</b> lines contained 20 percent less protein than the other, and the starch and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent among the three lines. Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop {{seeds from}} a local grain {{elevator}} for his second crop of the season. He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, {{many of which were}} <b>transgenic,</b> and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting. He tested the new seeds, and found that, as he had expected, some were <b>transgenic</b> and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E
5|$|In humans, plasma {{triglycerides}} such as triacylglycerols {{have been}} long debated {{as an important}} risk factor for not only cardiovascular disease but also for other relevant morbidities, such as cancer, renal disease, suicide, and all-cause mortality. The APOA5 gene was found by comparative sequencing of ~200 kbp of human and mice DNA as the last member of the gene cluster of apolipoproteins located on human chromosome 11 at 11q23. Two mouse <b>transgenic</b> mouse models (APOA5 <b>transgenic</b> and APOA5 knockout) confirmed {{the important role of}} this gene in plasma triglyceride levels of plasma triglycerides. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are both closely related to plasma triglyceride levels and APOA5. Recent meta-analyses suggest that the effect on metabolic syndrome development is more profound for rs662799 in Asian population and for rs3135506 for Europeans. Moreover, meta-analysis that focused on rs662799 and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus has suggested a significant association in Asian populations, but not in European populations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Transgenics</b> {{involves}} {{the insertion of}} one piece of DNA into another organism’s DNA in order to introduce a new gene(s) into the original organism. This addition of genes into an organism’s genetic material creates a new variety with desired traits. The DNA must be prepared and packaged in a test tube and then inserted into the new organism. New genetic information can be inserted with biolistics. An example of <b>transgenics</b> is the rainbow papaya, which is modified with a gene that gives it resistance to the Papaya Ringspot Virus.|$|R
5|$|Overexpression of systemin and HypSys {{has been}} found to improve plants' {{tolerance}} to abiotic stress, including salt stress and UV radiation. When prosystemin was over-expressed in tomato, <b>transgenic</b> plants had lower stomatal conductance than normal plants. When grown in salt solutions, <b>transgenic</b> plants had higher stomatal conductances, lower leaf concentrations of abscisic acid and proline and a higher biomass. These findings suggest that systemin either allowed the plants to adapt to salt stress more efficiently or that they perceived a less stressful environment. Similarly, wounded tomato plants were less susceptible to salt stress than unwounded plants. This may be because wounding decreases the growth of the plant and therefore slows the uptake of toxic ions into the roots. An analysis of salt-induced changes in gene expression found that the differences measured between the <b>transgenic</b> and normal plants could not be accounted for by changes in conventional salt stress-induced pathways. Instead Orsini et al. suggested that the activation of the jasmonic acid pathway determines a physiological state that not only directs resources towards the production of compounds active against pests, but also pre-adapts plants to minimize water loss. These effects are achieved by negatively regulating the production of hormones and metabolites that will force plants to invest additional resources to counteract water loss, a secondary effect of herbivores.|$|E

30|$|In this study, the {{relevance}} of reactive cytotoxic compounds was assessed in rice genotypes by exposing to accelerated aging conditions. Under aging treatment the reactive cytotoxic compounds accumulated in all the genotypes and affect the seed viability. The genotypic variability is correlated with the accumulation of MDA, MG and Maillard products. Further, we characterize an Aldo-keto reductase (AKR) by developing <b>transgenics</b> in tobacco and rice susceptible genotype Telahamsa. The <b>transgenics</b> seeds showed improved AKR activity, viability and germination when exposed to the ageing treatments. The reduced levels of RCCs MDA, MG, Maillard and Amodari compounds in <b>transgenics</b> signifies that RCCs are detoxified by the AKRs. The recovery in seed viability in highly susceptible rice genotype Tellahamsa by overexpression of AKR 1 clearly suggests that, detoxification of cytotoxic compounds by Aldo-keto reductases {{play a crucial role}} in maintaining the seed longevity and seedling vigour. The study demonstrates that, efficient detoxification of RCC’s by overexpression of AKR 1 enhances the life span of seeds.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{investigation}} with the objective of analyzing the positions of six Science teachers in Tijucas, Santa Catarina on ethics in science teaching during the classroom presentation on the theme of <b>transgenics.</b> For data collection, we used semi-structured interviews. For the analyses, we defined three units: the nature of ethics, the ideological discourse and the moral development, as well as the attitudes of Science teachers in situations of tension. In general, we see that the teachers presented important aspects that characterize the theme of <b>transgenics</b> in their teaching practice, such as the questioning that values, for example, the records and the information offered by the media in general. However, some still seem to have a partial understanding of ethics in science teaching, not explaining important aspects, such as their critical and reflective positioning about the use of <b>transgenics.</b> We realized that such teachers have notions about the “use of ethics”, but they still face difficulties in carrying out a process of ethical training...|$|R

40|$|Plants in {{ecosystems}} are simultaneously exposed to abiotic and biotic stresses, which restrict plant growth and development. The complex {{responses to these}} stresses are largely regulated by plant hormones, which in turn, orchestrate the different biochemical and molecular pathways to manoeuvre stress tolerance. The PR- 10 protein family {{is reported to be}} involved in defence regulation, stress response and plant growth and development. The JcPR- 10 a overexpression resulted in increased number of shoot buds in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), which could be due to high cytokinin to auxin ratio in the <b>transgenics.</b> The docking analysis shows the binding of three BAP molecules at the active sites of JcPR- 10 a protein. JcPR- 10 a <b>transgenics</b> showed enhanced salt tolerance, as was evident by increased germination rate, shoot and root length, relative water content, proline, soluble sugar and amino acid content under salinity. Interestingly, the <b>transgenics</b> also showed enhanced endogenous cytokinin level as compared to WT, which, further increased with salinity. Exposure of gradual salinity resulted in increased stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, photosynthesis rate and reduced transpiration rate. Furthermore, the <b>transgenics</b> also showed enhanced resistance against Macrophomina fungus. Thus, JcPR- 10 a might be working in co-ordination with cytokinin signalling in mitigating the stress induced damage by regulating different stress signalling pathways, leading to enhanced stress tolerance...|$|R
40|$|The cardiac {{conduction}} system (CCS) propagates and coordinates {{the electrical}} excitation that originates from the pacemaker cells, throughout the heart, resulting in rhythmic heartbeat. Its defects result in life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Understanding {{of the factors}} involved in the formation and function of the CCS remains incomplete. By transposon assisted transgenesis, we have developed enhancer trap (ET) lines of zebrafish that express fluorescent protein in the pacemaker cells at the sino-atrial node (SAN) and the atrio-ventricular region (AVR), termed CCS <b>transgenics.</b> This expression pattern begins at the stage when the heart undergoes looping morphogenesis at 36  h post fertilization (hpf) and is maintained into adulthood. Using the CCS <b>transgenics,</b> we investigated the effects of perturbation of cardiac function, as simulated by either the absence of endothelium or hemodynamic stimulation, on the cardiac conduction cells, which resulted in abnormal compaction of the SAN. To uncover {{the identity of the}} gene represented by the EGFP expression in the CCS <b>transgenics,</b> we mapped the transposon integration sites on the zebrafish genome to positions in close proximity to the gene encoding fibroblast growth homologous factor 2 a (fhf 2 a). Fhf 2 a is represented by three transcripts, one of which is expressed in the developing heart. These <b>transgenics</b> are useful tools for studies of development of the CCS and cardiac disease...|$|R

40|$|The potent {{antimalarial}} drug artemisinin {{has a high}} cost, since its only viable source to date is Artemisia annua (0. 01 - 0. 8 % DW). There is therefore an urgent need to design new strategies to increase its production or to find alternative sources. In the current study, Artemisia carvifolia Buch was selected {{with the aim of}} detecting artemisinin and then enhancing the production of the target compound and its derivatives. These metabolites were determined by LC-MS in the shoots of A. carvifolia wild type plants at the following concentrations: artemisinin (8 μg/g), artesunate (2. 24 μg/g), dihydroartemisinin (13. 6 μg/g) and artemether (12. 8 μg/g). Genetic transformation of A. carvifolia was carried out with Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV 3101 harboring the rol B and rol C genes. Artemisinin content increased 3 - 7 -fold in <b>transgenics</b> bearing the rol B gene, and 2. 3 - 6 -fold in those with the rol C gene. A similar pattern was observed for artemisinin analogues. The dynamics of artemisinin content in <b>transgenics</b> and wild type A. carvifolia was also correlated with the expression of genes involved in its biosynthesis. Real time qPCR analysis revealed the differential expression of genes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis, i. e. those encoding amorpha- 4, 11 diene synthase (ADS), cytochrome P 450 (CYP 71 AV 1), and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH 1), with a relatively higher transcript level found in <b>transgenics</b> than in the wild type plant. Also, the gene related to trichome development and sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis (TFAR 1) showed an altered expression in the <b>transgenics</b> compared to wild type A. carvifolia, which was in accordance with the trichome density of the respective plants.
