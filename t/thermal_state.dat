5|$|Mimas, the {{innermost}} {{of the round}} moons of Saturn and directly interior to Enceladus, is a geologically dead body, even though it should experience stronger tidal forces than Enceladus. This apparent paradox can be explained in part by temperature-dependent properties of water ice (the main constituent of the interiors of Mimas and Enceladus). The tidal heating per unit mass is given by the formula , where ρ is the (mass) density of the satellite, n is its mean orbital motion, r is the satellite's radius, e is the orbital eccentricity of the satellite, μ is the shear modulus and Q is the dimensionless dissipation factor. For a same-temperature approximation, the expected value of qtid for Mimas is about 40 times that of Enceladus. However, the material parameters μ and Q are temperature dependent. At high temperatures (close to the melting point), μ and Q are low, so tidal heating is high. Modeling suggests that for Enceladus, both a 'basic' low-energy <b>thermal</b> <b>state</b> with little internal temperature gradient, and an 'excited' high-energy <b>thermal</b> <b>state</b> with a significant temperature gradient, and consequent convection (endogenic geologic activity), once established, would be stable. For Mimas, only a low-energy state {{is expected to be}} stable, despite its being closer to Saturn. So the model predicts a low-internal-temperature state for Mimas (values of μ and Q are high) but a possible higher-temperature state for Enceladus (values of μ and Q are low). Additional historical information is needed to explain how Enceladus first entered the high-energy state (e.g. more radiogenic heating or a more eccentric orbit in the past).|$|E
25|$|Quantum {{annealing}} is not {{the only}} technology for sampling. In a prepare and measure scenario, a universal quantum computer prepares a <b>thermal</b> <b>state,</b> which is then sampled by measurements. This can reduce the time required to train a deep restricted Boltzmann machine, and provide a richer and more comprehensive framework for deep learning than classical computing. The same quantum methods also permit efficient training of full Boltzmann machines and multi-layer, fully connected models and do not have well-known classical counterparts. Relying on an efficient <b>thermal</b> <b>state</b> preparation protocol starting from an arbitrary state, quantum-enhanced Markov logic networks exploit the symmetries and the locality structure of the probabilistic graphical model generated by a first-order logic template. This provides an exponential reduction in computational complexity in probabilistic inference, and, while the protocol relies on a universal quantum computer, under mild assumptions it can be embedded on contemporary quantum annealing hardware.|$|E

40|$|We {{give the}} optimal bounds on the phase-estimation {{precision}} for mixed Gaussian {{states in the}} single-copy and many-copy regimes. Specifically, we focus on displaced thermal and squeezed <b>thermal</b> <b>states.</b> We find that while for displaced <b>thermal</b> <b>states</b> an increase in temperature reduces the estimation fidelity, for squeezed <b>thermal</b> <b>states</b> a larger temperature can enhance the estimation fidelity. The many-copy optimal bounds are compared with the minimum variance achieved by three important single-shot measurement strategies. We show that the single-copy canonical phase measurement does not always attain the optimal bounds in the many-copy scenario. Adaptive homodyning schemes do attain the bounds for displaced <b>thermal</b> <b>states,</b> but for squeezed states they yield fidelities that are insensitive to temperature variations and are, therefore, sub-optimal. Finally, we find that heterodyne measurements perform very poorly for pure states but can attain the optimal bounds for sufficiently mixed states. We apply our results to investigate the influence of losses in an optical metrology experiment. In the presence of losses squeezed states cease to provide Heisenberg limited precision and their performance is close to that of coherent states with the same mean photon number.

40|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} weak nonresonant interactions are shown to produce entanglement between two initially disentangled systems prepared as a tensor product of <b>thermal</b> <b>states,</b> provided the initial temperature is sufficiently low. Entanglement {{is determined by the}} Peres-Horodeckii criterion, which establishes that a composite state is entangled if its partial transpose is not positive. If the initial temperature of the <b>thermal</b> <b>states</b> is higher than an upper critical value T_uc the minimal eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix of the composite state remains positive {{in the course of the}} evolution. If the initial temperature of the <b>thermal</b> <b>states</b> is lower than a lower critical value T_lc≤ T_uc the minimal eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix of the composite state becomes negative which means that entanglement develops. We calculate the lower bound T_lb for T_lc and show that the negativity of the composite state is negligibly small in the interval T_lb<T<T_uc. Therefore the lower bound temperature T_lb can be considered as the critical temperature for the generation of entanglement. Comment: 27 pages and 7 figure...|$|R
