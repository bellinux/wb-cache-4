5|$|In 1983, Lotterby {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> at {{the insistence}} of Brian Wilde, who preferred Lotterby's use of tight shots focused on the trio as they talked rather than Bell's wide-angle scenes. Lotterby produced and directed one additional series before departing again the same year. Bell then returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> beginning with the 1983 Christmas special and produced and directed all episodes of the show {{to the end of the}} 31st series.|$|E

5|$|Abra's initial role in {{the show}} was that of Third World rights {{champion}} and humorous surgical , whose major storylines centered on serious rule breaking (including stealing returned anti-retroviral drugs to send to African countries in need, performing an experimental xenotransplantation without authorisation, and secretly using Holby City Hospital's theatres at night to perform charity operations on African children) {{as well as his}} relationship with colleague nurse Kyla Tyson. Upon returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> in April 2008, the character took a darker turn, resorting to self-harm as a symptom of post-traumatic stress, following a harrowing experience in the war torn Congo.|$|E

2500|$|Critics have objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> {{usage of}} {{violence}} by dressing it with pretty photography. Others complained that <b>the</b> <b>show</b> relied more on visual aspects and music than on coherent stories and fully drawn characters. Civic leaders in Miami have also objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> airing of <b>the</b> city's crime problems all across America. Most civic leaders, however, have been placated due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> estimated contribution of $1 million per episode <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's economy and boosting tourism to Miami. Gerald S. Arenberg of the National Association of Chiefs of Police criticized <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> glamorous depiction of vice squads, saying [...] "no real vice cops chase drug dealers in a Ferrari while wearing $600 suits. More often than not, they're {{holed up in}} a crummy room somewhere, wearing jeans with holes in them, watching some beat-up warehouse in a godforsaken part of town through a pair of dented binoculars".|$|R

In late November 2003, CMLL held an eight-team, three-week tournament to crown new champions. Most of the teams in the tournament had not teamed up on a regular basis prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> except for Los Nuevo Infernales. In the end, the team of El Felino, Safari and Volador Jr., who was paired up for the tournament, defeated Alan Stone, Super Crazy, and Zumbido to win the titles.|$|E
5|$|After Wilson's {{temporary}} departure during Houses fifth season, Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times immediately {{stated that}} she wanted the character to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> Linda Stasi of The New York Post said that Dr. House's relationship with Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston), who temporarily replaced Wilson, was far more natural than House's relationship with Wilson.

50|$|He {{discusses}} {{the technique of}} using surveillance methods within shots (TV monitors, security cameras etc.) <b>to</b> give <b>the</b> sense of always being watched and a need <b>to</b> process <b>the</b> vast amount of information available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> detective characters. He also talks about trying <b>to</b> ground <b>the</b> <b>show</b> in realism by using only diegetic music.|$|R

5|$|Already 40 years old, Bacon {{viewed the}} {{exhibition}} as his last chance and applied {{himself to the}} task with determination. Because he had destroyed all his output {{of the last three}} years, he {{had little choice but to}} present new works. He did not have a grand plan when he agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year, and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition, completing the series barely in time for the opening.|$|E

5|$|CTW enlisted Palmer, in {{conjunction}} with Harvard University, in 1979 to conduct a study in Jamaica regarding the effects of Sesame Street on children with no exposure to other children's television programs, in order to correct {{for the effects of}} multimedia exposure on children in the US. Palmer discovered that Jamaican children's interest dropped during segments with the Muppets, possibly due to language and cultural differences; musical segments were the most effective. The children's learning increased after exposure <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> especially letter and number recognition.|$|E

50|$|Given that a full 22 episodes {{had been}} filmed before the series began airing, the Seven Network aired {{consistent}} repeats <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> find an audience. Ratings didn't climb, however, and in early September, the network announced <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> cancellation. <b>The</b> series finale aired on 25 October. This episode {{ended in a}} cliffhanger, which - due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show's</b> cancellation - will remain unresolved.|$|R
5|$|Director Michael Mayer {{heard the}} album and {{expressed}} an interest in adapting it for the stage. When he approached the band regarding a collaboration, they agreed to work with him. The band also gave Mayer a wide latitude for his adaptation after seeing his earlier work in Spring Awakening. Though additional songs were included from the Green Day catalog, Mayer added very little dialogue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> He felt instead that the music and lyrics were expressive enough on their own, and even removed some of the dialogue {{that was part of the}} Berkeley production before the show moved to Broadway.|$|E
