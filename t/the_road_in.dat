5|$|Plans for {{the road}} {{go back to the}} 1930s, when a parkway was {{proposed}} between Camden and Atlantic City that was never built. Plans resurfaced for <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s when a group of officials led by State Senator Frank S. Farley pushed for a road to help the area economy. The New Jersey Expressway Authority was created in 1962 to be responsible for building an expressway. The Atlantic City Expressway was built between 1962 and 1965 at a total cost of $48.2 million. The South Jersey Transportation Authority assumed control of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> 1991 from the New Jersey Expressway Authority.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} The Bishops Avenue, the A1 becomes Lyttelton Road, {{which was}} laid out in 1931 {{as part of the}} residential development of the area, and runs east–west along the northern foot of Highgate Hill between Hampstead Garden Suburb and East Finchley. It is for the most part residential; on the northern side stands the Belvedere Court block of flats.

5|$|As {{a primary}} route to southwestern England, the A303 is {{frequently}} congested on its single carriageway sections. As {{it passes through}} the Stonehenge World Heritage Site and the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, attempts to upgrade <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> those areas have been controversial. In particular, the Stonehenge tunnel, which would see the A303 rerouted underground, has been proposed and delayed several times. Nevertheless, the road remains a popular alternative to motorway driving, and was commemorated in a book and BBC Four television documentary by Tom Fort in the early 2010s.|$|E
5|$|By 18 March, Jourdan {{had formed}} his {{headquarters}} at Pfullendorf, on the heights above Ostrach. In {{front of him}} stood the largest part of his cavalry and half of his infantry. The center, including the 4th Regiment of Hussars, the 1st of Chasseurs à Cheval, and two squadrons of the 17th Dragoons, lay behind Ostrach, under command of General Klein. Jourdan distributed them in three columns, the strongest on the post road by Saulgau, another on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> the direction of Altshausen, and a third at the hamlet of Friedberg.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, {{what is now}} Route 54 in Delaware existed as an unpaved county road. The {{portion of}} the current route along Millsboro Highway was {{proposed}} as a state highway by 1925. This segment of state highway was completed by 1931, along with the portions from south of Columbia to a point along the state line {{to the east of}} Delmar and between Selbyville and Williamsville. A portion of the route along the state line east of Delmar was paved as a county road. On July 1, 1935, the county-maintained portions of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> Delaware were taken over by the state. By 1936, the roadway was paved between Williamsville and Fenwick Island. A portion of road to the west of Selbyville was paved by 1939. By 1942, the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> Delaware between the Maryland border and south of Columbia and Gumboro and Selbyville were paved.|$|E

5|$|By 1930, SH112 {{had been}} paved from Del Norte {{to the county}} line. Because the {{residents}} of San Luis Valley sought better roads, the Department of Highways began improving SH112 around the area, but the highway was not fully surfaced until 1946. The next year, Rio Grande and Saguache counties paid to resurface the rest of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> asphalt. Since 1947, {{there have been no}} major realignments in the routing.|$|E
5|$|Close to Lakefield and off <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> {{their own}} {{enclosure}} were three dwellings known as Lakefield Cottages. Mr. Rogerson, a gardener and caretaker at Lakefield, {{lived in one}} of the cottages, and eventually his wife's two pedigree Pomeranians– Darkie and Duchess– would become the models for Potter's fictional Duchess. Darkie had a fine black mane, but Duchess was more intelligent and could sit up with a lump of sugar balanced on her nose.|$|E
5|$|Due to an archaic law in Erie County, {{the town}} of Tonawanda and {{the town of}} Amherst, who {{completed}} <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> 1925, were requested in 1935 to take over $2million (1935USD) in debts bonded for its construction. The county noted that the towns' inability to pay for the road made the new road a financial burden for the county. To make things worse, the new road did not bring the immediate influx of business that was advertised and was looking early on as a giant mistake {{on the part of the}} county and towns.|$|E

5|$|Lake Shore Road {{around the}} island was built between 1900 and 1910 by the state, and the M-185 {{designation}} was first assigned on July 12, 1933. The roadway was purpose-built for non-motorized use; it is narrower than other state highways. During the 1950s, the state paved <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> asphalt. Since the 1970s, the MISPC has allowed snowmobiles to operate on Mackinac Island during the winter.|$|E

5|$|SH-58 was {{originally}} {{a part of}} US-164. When US-164 was decommissioned in 1930, a section of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> Major County that was left without a designation became SH-58.

5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department rerouted M-33/M-72 near Fairview in late 1951 {{or early}} 1952, turning the former route back to local control.

The southern end was extended slightly to end at the M-76 freeway that opened between Alger and Standish; that freeway was redesignated as part of I-75 in 1974.
