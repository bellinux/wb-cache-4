5|$|This episode has {{the final}} {{speaking}} appearance of Lionel Hutz, {{five months before}} the death of Phil Hartman. The episode's development {{grew out of a}} desire by the writers to do a show focused on Marge, where her job did not work out. The episode received positive mention in <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>I</b> Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, and is featured in the special 2003 DVD release The Simpsons: Risky Business.|$|E
5|$|It {{was written}} by Ron Hauge, {{directed}} by Bob Anderson, and guest starred Alex Trebek as himself. Hauge was inspired to write the episode after learning of an orphanage that had been ripped off. The episode was selected, among other Christmas themed episodes of the series, on an 2005 Christmas special boxed set on DVD. The authors of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>I</b> Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide criticized the episode as a rehash of older themes, {{but it was also}} described as one of The Simpsons’ more memorable episodes in a review of the 2005 DVD boxed set release.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} well known and for many years {{respected}} books about Wyatt Earp was <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>I</b> Married Wyatt Earp, originally credited as a factual memoir by Josephine Marcus Earp. Published in 1976, it was edited by amateur historian Glenn Boyer, and published by the respected University of Arizona Press. It was immensely popular for many years, capturing the imagination of people {{with an interest in}} western history, studied in classrooms, cited by scholars, and relied upon as factual by filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|Reviews in The Sydney Morning Herald and DVD Movie Guide were favorable, and {{the authors}} of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>I</b> Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide cited Marge's police {{training}} as {{the highlight of the}} episode. Contributors to compilation works analyzing The Simpsons from philosophical and cultural perspectives have cited and discussed the episode.

25|$|In November 2014, Mattel {{received}} criticism over <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>I</b> Can Be a Computer Engineer, which depicted Barbie {{as being}} inept at computers and requiring that her two male friends complete {{all of the}} necessary tasks to restore two laptops after she downloads a virus onto both of them.

25|$|Harlan Ellison's {{proposed}} {{screenplay for}} I, Robot began by introducing the Three Laws, and issues growing from the Three Laws form {{a large part}} of the screenplay's plot development. This is only natural since Ellison's screenplay is one inspired by Citizen Kane: a frame story surrounding four of Asimov's short-story plots and three taken from <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>I,</b> Robot itself. Ellison's adaptations of these four stories are relatively faithful although he magnifies Susan Calvin's role in two of them. Due to various complications in the Hollywood moviemaking system, to which Ellison's introduction devotes much invective, his screenplay was never filmed.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>I</b> probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
