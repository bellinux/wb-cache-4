40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>advice</b> {{complexity}} <b>of</b> {{an online}} problem describes the additional information both necessary and sufficient for online algorithms to compute solutions {{of a certain}} quality. In this model, an oracle inspects the input before it is processed by an online algorithm. Depending on the input string, the oracle prepares an advice bit string that is accessed sequentially by the algorithm. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> bits that are read to achieve some specific solution quality can then serve as a fine-grained complexity measure. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to study a powerful method for proving lower bounds on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> bits necessary. To this end, we consider the string guessing problem as a generic online problem and show a lower bound on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> bits needed to obtain a good solution. We use special reductions from string guessing to improve the best known lower bound for the online set cover problem and to give a lower bound on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> online maximum clique problem. ...|$|R
40|$|Seeking {{advice is}} a basic {{practice}} in making real life decisions. Until recently, however, {{little attention has been}} given to it in either empirical studies or theories of decision making. The studies reported here investigate <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> on judgment and <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> use for judgment accuracy. Respondents were asked to provide final judgments {{on the basis of their}} initial opinions and advice presented to them. The respondents’ weighting policies were inferred. Analysis of the these policies show that (a) the respondents tended to place a higher weight on their own opinion than on the advisor's opinion (the self/other effect); (b) more knowledgeable individuals discounted <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> more; (c) <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> decreased as its distance from the initial opinion increased; and (d) <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> improved accuracy significantly, though not optimally. A theoretical framework is introduced which draws in part on insights from the study of attitude change to explain <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>advice.</b> Finally <b>the</b> usefulness <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> for improving judgment accuracy is considered. ...|$|R

5|$|In Anglo-Saxon England, Witenagemot was {{an early}} {{equivalent}} to the Privy Council of England. During the reigns of the Norman monarchs, the English Crown was advised by a royal court or curia regis, which consisted of magnates, ecclesiastics and high officials. The body originally concerned itself with advising the sovereign on legislation, administration and justice. Later, different bodies assuming distinct functions evolved from the court. The courts of law took over the business of dispensing justice, while Parliament became the supreme legislature of the kingdom. Nevertheless, the Council retained the power to hear legal disputes, either {{in the first instance}} or on appeal. Furthermore, laws made by the sovereign on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> the Council, rather than on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> Parliament, were accepted as valid. Powerful sovereigns often used the body to circumvent the Courts and Parliament. For example, a committee of the Council—which later became the Court of the Star Chamber—was during the 15th century permitted to inflict any punishment except death, without being bound by normal court procedure. During Henry VIII's reign, the sovereign, on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> the Council, was allowed to enact laws by mere proclamation. The legislative pre-eminence of Parliament was not restored until after Henry VIII's death. Though the royal Council retained legislative and judicial responsibilities, it became a primarily administrative body. The Council consisted of forty members in 1553, but the sovereign relied on a smaller committee, which later evolved into the modern Cabinet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>advice</b> {{complexity}} <b>of</b> {{an online}} {{problem is a}} measure of how much knowledge of the future an online algorithm needs in order to achieve a certain competitive ratio. We determine <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> complexity <b>of</b> hard online problems such as Online Independent Set, Online Vertex Cover and Online Disjoint Path Allocation. These problems are hard since a single wrong answer by the online algorithm can have devastating consequences. We show that log 1 + (c− 1) c− 1 cc n = Θ(n/c) bits <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> are necessary and sufficient (up to a lower-order term) to achieve a strict competitive ratio of c for each of these problems. This is done by introducing a new string guessing problem related to that of Böckenhauer et al. (Theoretical Computer Science 2014). It turns out that this gives a powerful but easy-to-use method for providing both upper and lower bounds on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> complexity <b>of</b> an entire class of online problems. Previous results of Halldórsson et al. (Theoretical Computer Science 2002) on Online Independent Set, in a related model, implies that <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> complexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem is Θ(n/c). Our results improve on this by providing an exact formula for the higher-order term. Böckenhauer et al. (ISAAC 2009) gave a lower bound of Ω(n/c) and an upper bound of O((n log c) /c) on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> complexity <b>of</b> Online Disjoint Path Allocation. We improve on the upper bound by a log c factor. For the remaining problems, no bounds on their advice complexity were previously known. ...|$|R
