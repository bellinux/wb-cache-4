5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{stands in}} {{semantic}} contrast with defensive mimicry, {{where it is}} the prey {{that acts as a}} mimic, with predators being duped. Defensive mimicry includes the well-known Batesian and Müllerian forms of mimicry, where <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> shares outward characteristics with an aposematic or harmful model. In Batesian mimicry, <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> is modeled on a dangerous (usually unpalatable) species, while in Müllerian mimicry both species are harmful, and act as comimics, converging on a common set of signals and sharing the burden of 'educating' their predators. Also included in defensive mimicry is the lesser known Mertensian mimicry, where <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> is more harmful than the model, and Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds come to mimic crops through unintentional artificial selection. In defensive mimicry, <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> benefits by avoiding a harmful interaction with another organism that {{would be more likely to}} take place without the deceptive signals employed. Harmful interactions might involve being eaten, or pulled out of the ground as a weed. In contrast, the aggressive mimic benefits from an interaction that would be less likely to take place without the deception, at the expense of its target.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a case}} of {{protective}} or defensive mimicry, where <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, which means that all three parties are from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close enough for them to eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for <b>the</b> <b>mimic,</b> and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry {{occurs when}} an {{organism}} (<b>the</b> <b>mimic)</b> simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This results in <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> gaining protection, food, and mating advantages. There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve aposematic coloration, or warning signals, {{to avoid being}} attacked by a predator.|$|E

5|$|With their {{powerful}} stings and conspicuous warning coloration, social wasps are {{the models}} for {{many species of}} mimic. Two common cases are Batesian mimicry, where <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> is harmless and is essentially bluffing, and Müllerian mimicry, where <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> is also distasteful, and the mimicry can be considered mutual. Batesian mimics of wasps include many species of hoverfly and the wasp beetle. Many species of wasp are involved in Müllerian mimicry, as are many species of bee.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive mimicry, where <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> generally benefits from being treated as harmful. <b>The</b> <b>mimic</b> may resemble its own prey, or some other organism which is beneficial {{or at least not}} harmful to the prey. The model, i.e. the organism being 'imitated', may experience increased or reduced fitness, or may not be affected at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, {{as is the case in}} most mimicry complexes.|$|E

5|$|In Batesian mimicry, <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as}} the model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid <b>the</b> <b>mimic.</b> The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E
5|$|In Wasmannian mimicry, <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> {{resembles a}} model that it lives along with in a nest or colony. Most of the models here are social insects such as ants, termites, bees and wasps.|$|E

5|$|In Batesian mimicry <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> shares signals {{similar to}} the model, but {{does not have the}} {{attribute}} that makes it unprofitable to predators (e.g., unpalatability). In other words, a Batesian mimic is a sheep in wolf's clothing. It is named after Henry Walter Bates, an English naturalist whose work on butterflies in the Amazon rainforest (described in The Naturalist on the River Amazons) was pioneering in this field of study. Mimics {{are less likely to be}} found out (for example by predators) when in low proportion to their model. This phenomenon is called negative frequency dependent selection, and it applies in most forms of mimicry. Batesian mimicry can only be maintained if the harm caused to the predator by eating a model outweighs the benefit of eating a mimic. The nature of learning is weighted in favor of the mimics, for a predator that has a bad first experience with a model tends to avoid anything that looks like it for a long time, and does not re-sample soon to see whether the initial experience was a false negative. However, if mimics become more abundant than models, then the probability of a young predator having a first experience with a mimic increases. Such systems are therefore most likely to be stable where both the model and <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> occur, and where the model is more abundant than <b>the</b> <b>mimic.</b> This is not the case in Müllerian mimicry, which is described next.|$|E
5|$|Only certain traits may be {{required}} to deceive predators; for example, tests on the sympatry/allopatry border (where the two are in the same area, and where they are not) of <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> Lampropeltis elapsoides and the model Micrurus fulvius showed that color proportions in these snakes were important in deceiving predators, but that the order of the colored rings was not.|$|E
50|$|Eggflies {{are known}} for their marked sexual {{dimorphism}} and Batesian mimicry of poisonous milkweed butterflies (Danainae). For example, <b>the</b> Danaid eggfly <b>mimics</b> Danaus chrysippus while the great eggfly (H. bolina) <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> Australian crow (Euploea core). In each case, <b>the</b> eggfly <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> danainid's markings, thus adopting the latter's distasteful reputation to predators without being poisonous itself.|$|R

50|$|The female of {{the common}} Mormon is polymorphic. In the Indian Subcontinent, it has three forms or morphs. These are as follows:Form cyrusThis form {{is similar to the}} male, differing in that it always has {{strongly}} marked red crescents. It is the least common of the three forms. It is normally abundant where the common rose or crimson rose do not occur, such as in Himachal Pradesh around Shimla; although a few specimens of form romulus have also been caught alongside.Form stichiusThis female form of <b>the</b> common Mormon <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> common rose very closely. This is the commonest form wherever the common rose flies.Form romulusThis female form <b>mimics</b> <b>the</b> crimson rose and is common over its range. It is not such a close <b>mimic</b> as <b>the</b> previous form being duller than its model. It is easy to differentiate <b>the</b> <b>mimics</b> from models by the colour of their body—the models are red-bodied and <b>the</b> <b>mimics</b> are black-bodied.|$|R
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). <b>The</b> <b>mimic</b> may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. In this class of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such that the word mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with Müllerian mimicry, a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because <b>the</b> <b>mimic</b> may have a degree of protection itself, the distinction is not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally different forms of mimicry. Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive mimicry, where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.|$|E

5|$|Browerian mimicry, {{named after}} Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower, is a {{postulated}} form of automimicry; where the model {{belongs to the}} same species as <b>the</b> <b>mimic.</b> This is the analogue of Batesian mimicry within a single species, and occurs {{when there is a}} palatability spectrum within a population. Examples include the monarch and the queen from the Danainae subfamily, which feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. These species store toxins from its host plant, which are maintained even in the adult (imago) form. As levels of toxin vary depending on diet during the larval stage, some individuals are more toxic than others. Less palatable organisms, therefore, mimic more dangerous individuals, with their likeness already perfected.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the signal {{receiver}} is lured toward <b>the</b> <b>mimic.</b> This involves mimicry of a resource that is often vital to the prey's survival (or more precisely, the survival of its genes) such as nutrition or a mate. If the bait offered is of little value to prey {{they would not be}} expected to take such a risk. For example, in all known cases of sexual signal mimicry it is always the male sex that is deceived (in fact, {{it has been suggested that}} females of some species have evolved mimicry as a strategy to avoid unwanted matings). In these cases the predator need not move about foraging for prey, but may simply stay still and allow prey to come to it.|$|E
5|$|Like Bakerian mimicry, Dodsonian mimicry {{is a form}} of {{reproductive}} floral mimicry, but the model belongs to a different species than <b>the</b> <b>mimic.</b> The name refers to Calaway H. Dodson. By providing similar sensory signals as the model flower, it can lure its pollinators. Like Bakerian mimics, no nectar is provided. Epidendrum ibaguense (Orchidaceae) resembles flowers of Lantana camara and Asclepias curassavica, and is pollinated by monarch butterflies and perhaps hummingbirds. Similar cases are seen in some other species of the same family. The mimetic species may still have pollinators of its own though. For example, a lamellicorn beetle, which usually pollinates correspondingly colored Cistus flowers, is also known to aid in pollination of Ophrys species that are normally pollinated by bees.|$|E
