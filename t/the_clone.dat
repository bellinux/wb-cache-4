5|$|In 2379, {{two hundred}} years after the events of Alien 3, {{military}} scientists on the space vessel USM Auriga create a clone of Ellen Ripley, designated Ripley 8, using DNA from blood samples taken before her death. The xenomorph queen's DNA has been mixed in with Ripley's, and <b>the</b> <b>clone</b> grows up with an embryo inside it. The scientists extract the embryo, raise it and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. As {{a result of the}} xenomorphs' DNA inside her, she has enhanced strength and reflexes, blood that is somewhat acidic and a psychic link with the xenomorphs. Additionally, the xenomorph's genetic memory allows <b>the</b> <b>clone</b> to have some of Ripley's memories.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{back at the}} ranch, Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance. The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, {{but it does not}} seem to be working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals with a little help from Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch and proceeds to terrorize the town. The boys eventually find <b>the</b> <b>clone</b> and take it to Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair. Mephesto shows up and shoots <b>the</b> <b>clone,</b> but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything <b>the</b> <b>clone</b> did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{communications between}} a human CD 4 + clone and autologous CD 4 + <b>clones</b> induced with <b>the</b> first <b>clone</b> are described. <b>The</b> autoreactive <b>clones</b> proliferated after stimulation with <b>the</b> inducer <b>clone,</b> but not after stimulation with autologous clones expressing irrelevant specificities. <b>The</b> inducer <b>clone</b> markedly lost {{its ability to}} interact with <b>the</b> autoreactive <b>clones</b> after <b>the</b> modulation of its T-cell receptor. The proliferation of <b>the</b> autoreactive <b>clones</b> stimulated with <b>the</b> inducer <b>clone</b> was blocked by anti-DR monoclonal antibody. Collectively, these findings indicate that <b>the</b> autoreactive <b>clones</b> recognize idiotypic-like determinants on the receptor of <b>the</b> inducer <b>clone</b> in conjunction with DR antigen. The regulatory activity of <b>the</b> autoreactive <b>clones</b> was assayed by co-cultivation with their target inducer <b>clone.</b> <b>The</b> autoreactive <b>clones</b> were not committed to a single program, they could either suppress or enhance the proliferation of the target cells depending {{on the state of}} activation of the target cells. Activated target cells were suppressed whereas non-activated cells were enhanced. It is predicted that antagonistic cytokines released from <b>the</b> autoreactive <b>clones</b> exert differential effects on <b>the</b> target <b>clone...</b>|$|R

40|$|Since {{the birth}} of <b>the</b> first <b>cloned</b> sheep, somatic cell nuclear {{transfer}} technology has been successfully used to clone a variety of mammals. Cloned livestock have no apparent health risks, and the quality and safety of <b>the</b> <b>cloned</b> animal products are similar to non-cloned animals. The social behavior and environmental adaptability of postnatal cloned animals, especially when used for grassland farm production purposes, is unknown. In the present study, <b>the</b> <b>cloned</b> Dorper sheep equipped with GPS location devices were free-grazed in a harsh natural environment similar to conditions commonly experienced by Mongolian sheep. The main findings of this research were as follows. (1) Under free-grazing conditions, <b>the</b> <b>cloned</b> sheep showed excellent climatic and ecological adaptability. In extreme temperature conditions ranging from - 30 to 40 &#x 000 ba;C, <b>the</b> <b>cloned</b> sheep maintained acceptable body condition and behaved as other sheep. (2) <b>The</b> <b>cloned</b> sheep quickly adapted from a herd feeding strategy to the harsh environment and quickly exhibited a grazing regimen as other free-grazing sheep. (3) <b>The</b> <b>cloned</b> sheep exhibited free-grazing patterns and social behavior as other sheep. (4) <b>The</b> <b>cloned</b> sheep in <b>the</b> harsh environment thrived and produced healthy lambs. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>cloned</b> Dorper sheep exhibited excellent ecological adaptation, which is an important consideration for breeding meat sheep by <b>cloning.</b> <b>The</b> Dorper sheep readily adapted to the free-grazing conditions on the Mongolian plateau grassland, which attests {{to their ability to}} withstand harsh environmental conditions...|$|R

5|$|Since the Separatists are {{secretly}} {{building a}} battle droid army, Palpatine uses {{the situation to}} have himself granted emergency powers. Palpatine feigns reluctance to accept this authority, promising to {{return it to the}} Senate once the crisis has ended.

With the galaxy now at war as Sidious planned, Dooku brings him the secret plans for a new superweapon.|$|E
5|$|The film begins {{three years}} after the onset of <b>the</b> <b>Clone</b> Wars. The Jedi Knights are spread across the galaxy, leading a massive war against the Separatists. The Jedi Council dispatches Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to {{eliminate}} the notorious General Grievous, leader of the Separatist Army. Meanwhile, Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker grows close to Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic and, unknown to the public, a Sith Lord.

50|$|Cloning vectors without {{promoter}} and RBS for <b>the</b> <b>cloned</b> DNA sequence {{are sometimes}} used, for example when cloning genes whose products are toxic to E. coli cells.

The Ararat Corporation is run by an alien colony of miniature spider robots (led by an entity named Bob) that have infiltrated the U.S. government.

5|$|Gaunt was a late {{entry to}} the {{controversial}} storyline, created mainly as a plot device to return Harry to life; the plan for the character included Harry regaining his humanity, taking credit for tricking Peter into thinking he was a clone, and assuming his father's Green Goblin identity. However, this narrative was rejected by newly-promoted editor in chief Bob Harras, and eventually Norman was chosen to be the mastermind. Following <b>the</b> <b>Clone</b> Saga, Green Goblin re-established himself as a supervillain and Spider-Man's nemesis, serving as the main antagonist of several arcs thereafter.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} <b>the</b> quantum <b>cloning</b> {{of continuous}} variable entangled states. This {{is achieved by}} introducing two symmetric entanglement cloning machines (or e-cloners) : a local e-cloner and a global e-cloner; where {{we look at the}} preservation of entanglement in <b>the</b> <b>clones</b> under <b>the</b> condition that the fidelity of <b>the</b> <b>clones</b> is maximized. These cloning machines are implemented using simple linear optical elements such as beam splitters and homodyne detection along with squeeze gates. We show that the global e-cloner out-performs the local e-cloner both in terms of the fidelity of <b>the</b> <b>cloned</b> states as well as the strength of the entanglement of <b>the</b> <b>clones.</b> There is a minimum strength of entanglement (3 dB for the inseparability criterion and 5. 7 dB for the EPR paradox criterion) of the input state of the global e-cloner that is required to preserve the entanglement in <b>the</b> <b>clones.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
