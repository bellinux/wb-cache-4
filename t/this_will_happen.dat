25|$|As in The Age of Intelligent Machines Kurzweil argues {{here that}} {{evolution}} has an intelligence quotient just slightly greater than zero. He {{says it is}} not higher than that because evolution operates so slowly, and intelligence {{is a function of}} time. Kurzweil explains that humans are far more intelligent than evolution, based on what we have created in the last few thousand years, and that in turn our creations will soon be more intelligent than us. The law of accelerating returns predicts <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> within decades, Kurzweil reveals.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{settlement}} between Ngāi Tahu and the Crown in 1998, {{the name of}} the mountain was officially changed from Mount Cook to Aoraki / Mount Cook to incorporate its historic Māori name, Aoraki. As part of {{the settlement}}, a number of South Island placenames were amended to incorporate their original Māori name. Signifying the importance of Aoraki / Mount Cook, it {{is the only one of}} these names where the Māori name precedes the English. Under the settlement the Crown agreed to return title to Aoraki / Mount Cook to Ngāi Tahu, who would then formally gift it back to the nation.

25|$|Once the {{decision}} is made to arrest the suspect, or they have voluntarily surrendered, they are photographed and fingerprinted at a police station, and then taken to the appropriate courthouse for an arraignment or similar procedure that brings the case into the legal system. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) usually advises the media as to when <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> in cases that may be of interest; other large departments do not, so photographers and camera crews wait at the central location in hopes of getting a perp-walk image. In 2011, some New York camera crews and photographers waited 15 hours for former International Monetary Fund director Dominique Strauss-Kahn to be brought by for his arraignment on charges of sexually assaulting a hotel maid.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant Colonel Mike Howard, Squadron Commander, saw COIN as {{a process}} of {{providing}} three services in the Kamdesh region. Providing clean water by installing gravity fed pipelines in all the local villages, repairing the hydroelectric plants in Urmul and Kamdesh, and setting up new plants in Mirdesh and Gawardesh. New roads would be the final stage, built and maintained by local contractors, this would improve the local economy while providing improved communications with the central government {{and the rest of the}} nation. 1.33 million dollars was budgeted for these projects. This had the potential of providing a significant boost to the local economy, which in the past saw little in the way of civic improvements. Keating saw these programs as having mixed results. Villagers and clans who were left out of these projects were resentful, and quick to turn to those who would exploit the resulting divisions. Haji Yunus, a village elder of Gawardesh and contractor for an electric plant was kidnapped and murdered. A note was attached to his body which said: “Don’t work with coalition forces. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> to you.” The note was signed “Mullah Omar”. Omar was the top Taliban leader in Afghanistan, but U.S. Intelligence stated HIG had done the killing, giving Omar “credit” in order in instill more fear due to Omar’s greater reputation. The constant ambushes and fire fights along the road to Naray did little to relieve Keating’s doubts. “The little bastards keep shooting at us every day.”, represented Keating’s assessment of the progress of COIN in Kamdesh.|$|E

It seems Archbishop Lefebvre did not see things in quite the same way even if he did respond to Padre Pio with: [...] "I will remember that, Father." [...] Padre Pio looked at him intensely and, seeing what would soon happen, said: [...] "No! You will forget it!

500|$|While the Soviet Union had {{not signed}} the Geneva Convention, {{this did not}} mean their {{soldiers}} were entirely exempted from the protection it afforded; Germany had signed the treaty and was thus obligated to offer Soviet POWs treatment according to its provisions (as they generally did with other Allied POWs). According to the Soviets, they had not signed the Geneva Conventions in 1929 due to Article 9 which, by imposing racial segregation of POWs into different camps, contravened the Soviet constitution. [...] Article 82 of the convention specified that [...] "In case, in time of war, one of the belligerents is not {{a party to the}} Convention, its provisions shall nevertheless remain in force as between the belligerents who are parties thereto." [...] Despite this Hitler called for the battle against the Soviet Union to be a [...] "struggle for existence" [...] and emphasized that the Russian armies were to be [...] "annihilated", a mindset that contributed to war crimes against Soviet prisoners of war. [...] A Nazi memorandum from 16 July 1941, recorded by Martin Bormann, quotes Hitler saying, [...] "The giant [...] area must naturally be pacified as quickly as possible; <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> at best if anyone who just looks funny should be shot". Conveniently for the Nazis, the fact that the Soviets failed to sign the convention played into their hands as they justified their behavior accordingly. Even if the Soviets had signed, {{it is highly unlikely that}} this would have stopped the Nazis' genocidal policies towards combatants, civilians, and prisoners of war.|$|E
