5|$|A {{persistent}} {{shortage of}} coinage {{in all of}} the colonies prompted Massachusetts to establish a mint on May 27, 1652, and begin production of coins from its silver reserves. This act solved a practical problem, but the colony had no authority to do so from the crown. Although <b>this</b> <b>did</b> not become an issue while Endecott was governor, it eventually became a source of controversy with the crown, and the mint had apparently ceased operations around 1682.|$|E

King Charles III created a public chair of mineralogy, physics and chemistry for Chabaneau in Madrid and provided him with a laboratory for his research. The Count d'Aranda secured the government's entire supply of platinum for Chabaneau's laboratory.|$|E
