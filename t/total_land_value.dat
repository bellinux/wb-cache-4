40|$|The Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) {{snow crab}} (Chionoecetes opilio) fishery {{has become the}} {{backbone}} of the fishing industry since the closure of the groundfish fishery in the early 1990 's. In 2003, snow crab contributed approximately $ 277 million to the <b>total</b> <b>landed</b> <b>value</b> of the fishery. This represented 50 per cent of the <b>total</b> <b>landed</b> <b>value</b> for the entire fishing industry. [...] For the fishing industry, snow crab expansion has been {{the order of the day}} throughout the 90 's. However, in 2000, based on the fall surveys of 1999, warning signs were raised. As a result, snow crab quotas were cut for the first time in over a decade. Since 2000, the crab fishery has been showing signs of declines in certain areas. The fear among industry is that this trend is going to continue and spread to other or all areas. [...] A key management objective of the snow crab fishery is to protect the reproductive potential of the resource. The reproductive potential is thought to be protected by the retention of only snow crabs over 95 mm (3. 74 inches) carapace width and discarding all female crab. Given that the resource is declining two questions arise. First, why is this resource declining given the current management strategy? Second, what can be done to prevent the snow crab resource from further reduction? Hence, this study will review the NL crab fishery to examine the factors affecting its sustainability. The focus of this study will consist of an examination of the snow crab biology, discuss the development of the snow crab fishery, state the importance of the snow crab fishery to the NL economy, identify factors affecting sustainability (natural and man made), with special emphasis on snow crab discards, exploring other fishing related impacts and method of harvest.

As a result, deep-sea demersal fish species are more vulnerable to exploitation.

However, it is common knowledge that governments around the world do provide subsidies to their fishing industries. The objective of this contribution is to estimate the global amount of subsidies paid to bottom trawl fleets operating in the high seas, i. e., outside of the Exclusive Economic Zones of maritime countries.

The Santa Rosa Plateau area in southern Riverside County was the location for this pilot study. Data on home and land value for 4, 800 parcels surrounding an 8, 300 acre oak woodland open space owned and operated a private land conservancy were col-lected. This was merged with spatial data from vegetation maps using a geographic information system (GIS). Distance from each parcel {{to the edge of the}} open space land, to the nearest trailhead and to the nearest stand of native oaks was calculated. Hedonic regression showed that both land and home value decreased as the distance from the open space boundary, trailheads, and local stands of native oak habitat increased. The model results were applied to the overall home and land parcels in the study area. A decrease of 10 percent in the distance to the nearest oak stands and to the edge of the permanent open space land resulted in an increase of $ 4 million in the total home value, and an increase of $ 16 million in <b>total</b> <b>land</b> <b>value</b> in the community.

40|$|Abstract: The large {{variation}} in the share of land for open space across U. S. urban areas raises some interesting questions: a) what determines the amount of open space in an urban area? b) How does open space affect community characteristics such as housing prices and local property tax rates? and c) are existing amounts of open space across U. S. urban areas socially optimal? In this paper, we conduct theoretical and empirical analysis to address these issues. Our theoretical analysis reveals that price elasticities of housing demand and supply, economies of scale in providing public services, and values of environmental benefits from open space are key parameters affecting the optimal amount of open space in an urban area. Our empirical results confirm that the price elasticity of housing supply varies widely across U. S. urban areas and is a significant determinant {{of the amount of}} open space in an urban area. Urban areas with a larger share of land in open space tend to have lower property tax rates and lower per-capita spending on public services. A significant share of U. S. urban areas are found to have too little open space in the sense that even if additional open space would not provide any amenities, it would still increase total land values and social welfare. However, for more than 10 % of U.

40|$|China's {{shift away}} from the welfare housing scheme has {{generated}} tremendous demand for private home ownership since the early 1990 's. The resulting growth {{in the housing market}} fueled the country's transformation towards a market economy. However, the transition has not been without problems. One of the main issues the government has been grappling with is the dispute between developers and residents over low rates of resettlement compensation. This thesis offers a compound option model to analyze the existing land disposal system in China. Assuming Shanghai's land market is efficient and the market values of land-use rights converge to the option values of land, the model identifies the maximum values of tenants' resettlement and infrastructure components of the total land values developers can rationally pay to avoid negative-NPV investment decisions. The model suggests a compensation cost function of about 51 percent of <b>total</b> <b>land</b> <b>value</b> (conveyance fee plus resettlement and infrastructure cost), or 26 percent of the underlying asset value upon sales of the residential development. It is the recommendation of this thesis that the Chinese government reexamines the existing land conveyance system to formally include tenants' resettlement compensation and infrastructural fees as part of the land-use rights bidding package. This thesis further recommends legal recognitions of tenants' 'invisible leasehold interests' to strengthen their rights to the land on which they reside. by Victor L. H. Sheen. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the literature on urban spatial structure by addressing two research questions. First, it empirically examines the urban economic theory by testing the relationship between the distance elasticities of land prices and housing prices. The theory indicates that land prices are more elastic with respect to distance from the city center than housing prices; in other words, land prices decline faster than housing prices. Using data from Beijing, which include matched housing and land prices, my findings support the theory. Second, this dissertation investigates the impacts of housing services production in general and the impacts of the capital-land substitution in particular on urban spatial structure. Using a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function for housing services, I theoretically derive the impacts of the elasticity of capital-land substitution on urban spatial structure, which is measured in terms of the distance gradients of land prices and capital densities, the housing output per unit of land, and the ratio of the distance elasticity of land prices to the distance elasticity of housing prices. The derived results suggest that an increase in the elasticity of capital-land substitution leads to increases in the land price, the capital density, and the housing output per unit of land at any location within the city, flattening of the land price and capital density curves, an increase in the ratio of the distance elasticity of land prices to the distance elasticity of housing prices, an expansion of the city boundary, and a growth in the population. These theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations and empirical estimations using the Beijing data. The simulations also reveal the magnitudes of these impacts: a 1 % change in the elasticity of capital-land substitution leads to 15 - 20 % changes in the <b>total</b> <b>land</b> <b>value</b> and housing output. The findings of this dissertation have practical implications in housing market behaviors, land value assessment for property taxation, and urban land use policy and planning...|$|E

40|$|This article proposes an inovative {{methodology}} {{to compute}} economic rents of land designed to current or potential offices uses. It consists {{in the establishment}} of a cause-and-effect relation between offices´ price levels and correspondent levels of land rent, considering the main factors that influence property prices, the ones that guide public and private activities´ location decisions and the inter-dependencies between land and real estate property markets. The rationale subjacent to this research is that land economic rent is determined by the difference between offices market price and a set of costs correspondent to land acquisition, planning and building processes, and a profit margin. An assessment of surplus values is provided in order to compute it as the difference between <b>total</b> <b>land</b> market <b>value</b> (<b>land</b> economic rent plus economic return on land use) and correspondent tributary patrimonial value according to legal valuation proceedings (settled on property law). In order to reach these goals, variables that exert influence on urban planning and municipal management were identified, an urban management information system was designed and implemented, and an integrated and interactive model to support decisions in urban planning - concerning real estate offices and land prices and characteristics - was developed. These tools were applied as a case study to Oporto city (Portugal). They embody updating functionalities, setting up as an on-going support to policies of municipal land use management (particularly applied to offices uses). A proposal is made to integrate similar models in territorial plans as valuation tools to support better approaches {{to assess the impact of}} planning decisions on real estate and <b>land</b> <b>values,</b> thus informing a more equitable, efficient and local-based tax basis. Implications of this analysis for urban planning and fiscal settings are proposed. This article proposes an inovative methodology to compute economic rents of land designed to current or potential offices uses. It consists {{in the establishment of}} a cause-and-effect relation between offices´ price levels and correspondent levels of land rent, considering the main factors that influence property prices, the ones that guide public and private activities´ location decisions and the inter-dependencies between land and real estate property markets. The rationale subjacent to this research is that land economic rent is determined by the difference between offices market price and a set of costs correspondent to land acquisition, planning and building processes, and a profit margin. An assessment of surplus values is provided in order to compute it as the difference between <b>total</b> <b>land</b> market <b>value</b> (<b>land</b> economic rent plus economic return on land use) and correspondent tributary patrimonial value according to legal valuation proceedings (settled on property law). In order to reach these goals, variables that exert influence on urban planning and municipal management were identified, an urban management information system was designed and implemented, and an integrated and interactive model to support decisions in urban planning - concerning real estate offices and land prices and characteristics - was developed. These tools were applied as a case study to Oporto city (Portugal). They embody updating functionalities, setting up as an on-going support to policies of municipal land use management (particularly applied to offices uses). A proposal is made to integrate similar models in territorial plans as valuation tools to support better approaches to assess the impact of planning decisions on real estate and <b>land</b> <b>values,</b> thus informing a more equitable, efficient and local-based tax basis. Implications of this analysis for urban planning and fiscal settings are proposed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a bioeconomic {{model of a}} commercial fishery. Emphasis is on the decision making processes of the harvesting sector. A model of dynamic decision making by fishermen is developed to study the biological and {{economic impact of the}} commercial exploitation of the Georges Bank scallops fishery (Placopecten Magellanicus). Stock biomass abundance dynamics are modelled using Deriso's age structured population model. Growth rate, mortality rates and recruitment are included as part of the biological component of the model. Decision making by fishermen is modelled using two discrete decision algorithms, myopic and adaptive. The myopic model provides the fisherman with the area yielding the highest immediate expected return on the basis of cost, expected catch and the current measure of biomass abundance. A computer model simulates the application of both the myopic and adaptive algorithms by a single fisherman as well as by a fleet of fishermen. In the later case, each fisherman is assumed to be initially identical and independent of the others in the fleet with respect to landings and catch information compiled. Vessel performance is measured in terms of total catch, <b>total</b> costs, <b>landed</b> <b>values</b> and net incomes. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the 2011 {{results of the}} North Dakota Land Valuation Model. The model is used annually to estimate average <b>land</b> <b>values</b> by county, based {{on the value of}} production from cropland and non-cropland. The county <b>land</b> <b>values</b> developed from this procedure form the basis for the 2011 valuation of agricultural land for real estate tax assessment. The average value for all agricultural land in a county from this analysis is multiplied by the total acres of agricultural land on the county abstract to determine each county’s <b>total</b> agricultural <b>land</b> <b>value</b> for taxation purposes. The State Board of Equalization compares this value with the total value assessed to agricultural property in each county. Each county is required by state statute to assess a total value of agricultural property within 5 percent of this value. The average value per acre of all agricultural land in North Dakota increased by 5. 4 percent from 2010 to 2011 based on the value of production. The value of cropland increased by 6. 0 percent, and non-cropland value decreased by 0. 40 percent. The formula capitalization rate was below the minimum set by the State Legislature, therefore the minimum rate of 7. 4 percent was used. The increase in the values for cropland and all agricultural land was due to the increased value of crop production. The value of production for most counties has been considerably higher since 2007 than prior years. This increase in value of production is a combination of increased yields, higher prices and a change in cropping mix. The change in crop revenue impacted <b>land</b> <b>values</b> from a negative 0. 52 percent in Pembina County to an increase of 13. 12 percent in Hettinger County. The capitalization rate change increased land valuations by 4. 05 percent in all counties; while the cost of production index decreased <b>land</b> <b>values</b> in all counties by 5. 72 percent. Changes in market value are included for comparison. Market value data are from the annual County Rents and Values survey conducted by North Dakota Agricultural Statistics Service.

Urban <b>land</b> <b>values</b> are note uniformly distributed in cities. The city centre records highest <b>land</b> <b>values</b> in almost all cities of the world. The <b>land</b> <b>values</b> decrease is not uniform. It takes many curvilinear shapes. In large cities there are mini-poles of <b>land</b> <b>values</b> like regional retail centres, business thoroughfares etc. Usually decrease in the <b>land</b> <b>values</b> from these mini-poles also acquire patterns which differ from city to city. <b>Land</b> <b>values</b> are affected by different factor like location of plot, amenities, taxes, environmental conditions and inter-related factors The present study analyses the <b>land</b> <b>value</b> distribution within Karachi City us the largest city of Pakistan. Its land use is complex. Therefore a complex pattern of <b>land</b> <b>values</b> has developed. The study examines the following aspect of <b>land</b> <b>values</b> 1. An overall distribution of <b>land</b> <b>values</b> within the city. The city centre records the highest <b>land</b> <b>value.</b> The <b>land</b> <b>values</b> decrease with distance from the city centre. It has been investigated in this study whether decrease in <b>land</b> <b>value</b> from the city cnetre to the periphery is linear or not. If not, whether it has developed a pattern 2. The city centre is not a point. It covers an appreciable area. <b>Land</b> <b>values</b> differ from one part of the city centre to the other 3. Distributional pattern of <b>land</b> <b>values</b> within the city centre has been analysed 4. Retail trading areas develop {{in different parts of the}} city. More complex the city more complex its retail trade. Next to the city centre the retail areas fetch high <b>land</b> <b>values.</b> However the <b>land</b> <b>values</b> differ from one retail area to another. It has been investigated whether the <b>land</b> <b>values</b> of retail areas have developed any pattern 5. Residential <b>land</b> <b>values</b> differ from one area to another in accordance with their location in relation to city centre, retail centers, industrial areas, highways and roads, plot size and many other factors.

40|$|Overfishing threatens {{coral reefs}} worldwide, {{yet there is}} no {{reliable}} estimate on the number of reef fishers globally. We address this data gap by quantifying the number of reef fishers on a global scale, using two approaches - the first estimates reef fishers as a proportion {{of the total number of}} marine fishers in a country, based on the ratio of reef-related to <b>total</b> marine fish <b>landed</b> <b>values.</b> The second estimates reef fishers as a function of coral reef area, rural coastal population, and fishing pressure. In total, we find that there are 6 million reef fishers in 99 reef countries and territories worldwide, of which at least 25 % are reef gleaners. Our estimates are an improvement over most existing fisher population statistics, which tend to omit accounting for gleaners and reef fishers. Our results suggest that slightly over a quarter of the world's small-scale fishers fish on coral reefs, and half of all coral reef fishers are in Southeast Asia. Coral reefs evidently support the socio-economic well-being of numerous coastal communities. By quantifying the number of people who are employed as reef fishers, we provide decision-makers with an important input into planning for sustainable coral reef fisheries at the appropriate scale...|$|R
