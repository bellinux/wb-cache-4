5|$|Linguistically, BASL {{differs from}} other {{varieties}} of ASL in its phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends {{to have a}} larger signing space, meaning that some signs are produced further {{away from the body}} than in other dialects. Signers of BASL also tend <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> one-handed variants. Some signs are different in BASL as well, with some borrowings from African American English.|$|E

The break with preferred activities decreased aberrant behavior and increased appropriate behavior...|$|R
5|$|The {{steering}} ratio is the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire {{behavior and the}} actual turning radius. Values less than one, where the front wheel side slip {{is greater than the}} rear wheel side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> neutral or slight over-steering. Car drivers tend <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> under-steering.|$|E

50|$|Liquidation {{preferences}} are typically implemented {{by making them}} an attribute that attaches <b>to</b> <b>preferred</b> stock that investors purchase {{in exchange for their}} investment. This means that the preference is senior to holders of common shares (and possibly other series of preferred stock), but junior to a company's debts and secured obligations.

5|$|The birthday-number {{effect is}} the {{unconscious}} tendency of people <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> {{the numbers in}} the date of their birthday over other numbers. First reported in 1997 by Japanese psychologists Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa, the birthday-number effect has been replicated in various countries. It holds across age and gender. The effect is most prominent for numbers over 12.|$|E

Perpetual debt comes in two types: cumulative and noncumulative. Interest on cumulative perpetual debt accrues if payments are missed. For noncumulative perpetual debt, if payments are missed, they do not accrue and the cash flow is lost.|$|R

50|$|Assuming {{no option}} is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> itself i.e. the {{relation}} is irreflexive, a preference relation with a loop is not transitive. For if it is, each {{option in the}} loop is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> each option, including itself. This can be illustrated for this example of a loop among A, B, and C. Assume the relation is transitive. Then, since A is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> B and B is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> C, also A is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> C. But then, since C is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> A, also A is <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> A.|$|R
5|$|The {{response}} towards {{more effective}} cannons {{was to build}} thicker walls and <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> round towers, as the curving sides {{were more likely to}} deflect a shot than a flat surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures {{had to find a way}} to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled behind a castle's curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.|$|E
5|$|The strong {{taste of}} the fruit body may have some role in insects {{avoiding}} it. The small fly species Megaselia pygmaeoides feeds on and infests the fruit bodies of T.felleus in North America, though it seems <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> other boletes in Europe. Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mould Sepedonium ampullosporum. Infection results in necrosis of the mushroom tissue, and a yellow colour caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia (single-celled conidia produced by extrusion from the conidiophores).|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian {{psychologist}} Jozef Nuttin, the name-letter {{effect has}} been replicated {{in dozens of}} studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for initials, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both given and family names still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.|$|E

5|$|Further, {{he points}} out that the {{language}} used by the Beowulf poet was already archaic, and the choice of words was at the time recognisably poetic. Tolkien gives as an example beorn, which meant both 'bear' and 'warrior', but only in heroic poetry could it be used to mean 'man'. He advises the translator <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> 'striking' and 'smiting', and to avoid 'hitting' and 'whacking'. But on the other hand, he criticises William Morris for using the dead and unintelligible 'leeds' for OE leode ('freemen', 'people'; cf German leute), even if antiquarians feel that the word ought to have survived. Tolkien does not accept the etymological fallacy either: mod means 'pride', not 'mood'; burg is 'stronghold', not 'borough', even though the modern word derives from the old one.|$|E
5|$|Males sing {{constantly}} as {{the breeding}} period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In {{the presence of}} a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance, apparently attempting to entice the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones. Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater reproductive success than others. Females appear <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> mates with more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} the self, and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E

A similar effect has been found for numbers related to birthdays: people tend <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as frequent exposure and early mastery, have been ruled out. In psychological assessments, the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|P.acicularis is {{probably}} the most abundant species of the genus. Most specimens have been found on the west coast of North America as far north as Alaska, but it has been reported most frequently from British Columbia and Washington. The species is found in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and has also been reported from the Russian arctic. In general, P.acicularis seems <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> an oceanic climate without extremely low temperatures, at least in comparison with other species of the genus. This assumption is supported by the fact that P.acicularis is found more southerly (34 findings in California) than all other species and is less frequently found in northern Alaska where, for example, P.robustus and P.vegae are more common. P.acicularis is rare east of the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|Quite common {{within its}} small range, the {{sluggish}} and reclusive puffadder shyshark {{is often seen}} lying still on the sea floor. It is gregarious and several individuals may rest together. A generalist predator with grasping dentition, the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey: crustaceans (including crabs, shrimp, crayfish, mantis shrimp, and hermit crabs), annelid worms (including polychaetes), bony fishes (including anchovies, jack macherels, and gobies), cephalopods (including squid), and fish offal. Overall, the most important component of this shark's diet is crustaceans, followed by polychaetes and then fishes. Males seem <b>to</b> <b>prefer</b> polychaetes, while females prefer crustaceans. It has been observed attacking a common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) by tearing off an arm with a twisting motion.|$|E
