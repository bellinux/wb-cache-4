5|$|Although P. rebeli {{is found}} across the Palearctic (see subspecies), it is {{difficult}} to determine exactly where <b>they</b> <b>inhabit</b> because of their similarity with P. alcon. In Western Europe they are thought to be concentrated in the Alps and in Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|The pygmaea–rixosa group (small weasels): Tiny weasels {{with short}} tails, pedomorphic skulls, and pelts that turn pure white in winter. <b>They</b> <b>inhabit</b> {{northern}} European Russia, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Finland, northern Scandinavian Peninsula, Mongolia, northeastern China, Japan and North America.|$|E
5|$|The boccamela group (large weasels): Very large weasels {{with large}} skulls, {{relatively}} long tails and lighter coloured pelts. Locally, they either do not turn white or only partially change colour in winter. <b>They</b> <b>inhabit</b> Transcaucasia, from western Kazakhstan to Semirechye {{and in the}} flat deserts of Middle Asia. They are also found in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.|$|E

5|$|Adult hawksbill {{sea turtles}} are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, <b>they</b> <b>inhabit</b> {{a wide range of}} habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young sea turtles, they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species can}} roll {{themselves}} into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land. <b>They</b> <b>inhabit</b> the splash zone on rocky shores, jetties and pilings, may hide under debris washed up on the shore and can swim if immersed in water.|$|E

5|$|Rallidae is a {{large family}} of small to {{medium-sized}} birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots and gallinules. Typically <b>they</b> <b>inhabit</b> dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and appear to be weak fliers.|$|E
5|$|The Gila monster {{is found}} in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, a range {{including}} Sonora, Arizona, parts of California, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico (potentially including Baja California). <b>They</b> <b>inhabit</b> scrubland, succulent desert, and oak woodland, seeking shelter in burrows, thickets, and under rocks in locations with ready access to moisture. In fact, Gila monsters seem to like water and can be observed immersing themselves in puddles of water after a summer rain. They avoid living in open areas such as flats and farmland.|$|E
5|$|William Beebe was {{a pioneer}} in the field now known as ecology. His theory that organisms must be {{understood}} {{in the context of the}} ecosystems <b>they</b> <b>inhabit</b> was completely new for its time, and has been highly influential. The method he invented of methodically analyzing all organisms within a small area of wilderness has become a standard method in this field. Beebe was also {{a pioneer in the}} field of oceanography, setting a precedent with his Bathysphere dives which many other researchers would follow.|$|E

5|$|Each year in {{late summer}} {{thousands}} of black swans and ducks descend on the area as the inland waterways <b>they</b> <b>inhabit</b> dry up. Waterbirds such as pelicans, cormorants, oyster catchers and terns are common often year round. Egrets, ibis, herons and spoonbills feed on the seagrass and fairy wrens, chats, fantails and thornbills feed on insects and plants amongst the samphire. Each September stints and sandpipers arrive from the Northern Hemisphere in a spectacular display. With the abundance of birdlife the area attracts birds of prey with swamp harriers, collared sparrowhawks, black-shouldered kites, kestrels and little falcons are all seen in the skies over St Kilda.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have also}} found {{significant}} levels of toxins in fish and the waters <b>they</b> <b>inhabit</b> within the basin. Accumulation of toxins in fish threatens the survival of fish species, and human consumption of these fish can lead to health problems. Water quality {{is also an important}} factor in the survival of other wildlife and plants that grow in the Columbia River drainage basin. The states, Indian tribes, and federal government are all engaged in efforts to restore and improve the water, land, and air quality of the Columbia River drainage basin and have committed to work together to enhance and accomplish critical ecosystem restoration efforts. A number of cleanup efforts are currently underway, including Superfund projects at Portland Harbor, Hanford, and Lake Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot is then portrayed {{through the}} eyes of Ramza Beoulve, who is the player {{character}} of the story. His exploits in the war introduced him to a number of characters; each with their own roles and agenda concerning the war and the fictional world, Ivalice, that <b>they</b> <b>inhabit.</b> The most prominent factions {{at the beginning of the}} story are those of Prince Goltana and Prince Larg, both are nobles seeking to obtain control of the throne by being the guardian to the monarch's young heir and were thus engaged in a war. The story progresses to include characters from the Murond Glabados Church, which have been controlling Ivalice silently and engineering the war in question.|$|E

5|$|They are {{relatively}} abundant from the poles to the equator and {{are found in}} all the oceans. <b>They</b> <b>inhabit</b> the Mediterranean Sea, but not the Black Sea, while {{their presence in the}} Red Sea is uncertain. The shallow entrances to both the Black Sea and the Red Sea may account for their absence. The Black Sea's lower layers are also anoxic and contain high concentrations of sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide. First ever sighting in Pakistan was made in 2017. First ever record on west coast of Korean Peninsula (Yellow Sea) was made in 2005. followed by one on Ganghwa Island in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are ectothermic, {{tetrapod}} vertebrates of {{the class}} Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. <b>They</b> <b>inhabit</b> {{a wide variety of}} habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the related}} grey and brown {{smoothhounds}} that share its range, the leopard shark has {{smaller and more}} numerous red blood cells, allowing it to process oxygen more efficiently. This may be an adaptation for foraging in deoxygenated estuary environments. Their eyes contain very few cone cells, likely due to the murky water <b>they</b> <b>inhabit.</b> Small leopard sharks fall prey to larger sharks such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). On one occasion, a sevengill shark was seen ambushing a leopard shark on a tidal mudflat in Humboldt Bay, striking with such momentum that the larger predator momentarily beached itself. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Phyllobothrium riseri, Lacistorhynchus dollfusi and Paraorygmatobothrium barber, {{as well as the}} copepods Echthrogaleus eoleoptratus and Achtheinus oblongatus.|$|E

5|$|Mole crickets are {{relatively}} common, {{but because they}} are nocturnal and spend nearly all their lives underground in extensive tunnel systems, they are rarely seen. <b>They</b> <b>inhabit</b> agricultural fields and grassy areas. They are present in every continent with the exception of Antarctica; by 2014, one hundred and seven species had been described and more species are likely to be discovered, especially in Asia. Neoscapteriscus didactylus is a widespread pest species, originating in South America it has spread to the West Indies and New South Wales in Australia. Gryllotalpa africana is a major pest in South Africa; other Gryllotalpa species are widely distributed in Europe, Asia and Australia. They are native to Britain (as to western Europe), but the former population of G. gryllotalpa may now be extinct in mainland Britain, surviving in the Channel Islands.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart frog (also {{known as}} dart-poison frog, poison frog or {{formerly}} known as poison arrow frog) is the common name {{of a group of}} frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity, while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity. The species that have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants, mites and termites. Other species however, that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity, eat a much larger variety of prey. Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the places <b>they</b> <b>inhabit.</b>|$|E
5|$|The alpine pika is a generalist herbivore, mainly {{foraging}} for mosses, trees branches, pine nuts, {{and plant}} stems, which it gathers {{during the summer}} to create haypiles for use in winter. These haypiles were estimated by I.V. Travina in 1984 {{to be as much}} as 30kg per hectare (12kg per acre) when the population density is around 10 to 12 individuals per hectare. This store would sometimes be shared with other species such as reindeer. In 1978, Khlebnikova documented the influence exerted by the alpine pika on plant diversity and composition in the regions <b>they</b> <b>inhabit.</b> These include reduced seed content of the soil, decreased ratio of flowering plants, and slow succession of plants such as the Siberian pine due to the pika's foraging on young trees. The remnants of the haypiles, however, might facilitate plant growth and the accumulation of pellets that create spots of nitrophilic vegetation (vegetation rich in nitrogen).|$|E
50|$|The penestae (in Greek oἱ Πενέσται, hoi penéstai) were a {{class of}} unfree labourers in Thessaly, Ancient Greece. These labourers were tied to the land <b>they</b> <b>inhabited,</b> {{comparable}} in status with the Spartan helots.|$|R
50|$|The Tapajós were an {{indigenous}} people in Brazil {{that are now}} considered extinct, <b>they</b> <b>inhabited</b> {{the area around the}} Madeira and the Tapajós rivers, in the Brazilian state of Amazonas in the 17th century.|$|R
25|$|The Empusae were a {{class of}} supernatural demons that Lamia {{was said to have}} birthed. Hecate would often send them against travelers. They {{consumed}} or scared to death any of the people where <b>they</b> <b>inhabited.</b> <b>They</b> bear many similarities to lilim. It has been suggested that later medieval lore of the succubi or lilim is derived from this myth.|$|R
