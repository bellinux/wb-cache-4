500|$|The slide tower {{near the}} {{entrance}} contains the park's main thrill slides. The Wedgie is a body slide featuring a trap-door release into a near-vertical [...] drop. Riders then enter a fast, downward-spiralling turn and reach speeds of nearly [...] before they are slowed in a run-out chute. The ride was the first ProSlide SuperLOOP in the world. The Green Room consists of four people boarding a cloverleaf-shaped tube in which they traverse a [...] long tunnel followed by a [...] drop into a funnel. Within the funnel, riders oscillate back and forth up the walls at the side and drop into a splash pool. Since its opening, The Green Room has been Australia's largest ProSlide Tornado beating Wet'n'Wild Water World's Tornado in height and <b>tunnel</b> <b>length.</b> On the Super Tubes Hydrocoaster, three people sit on a [...] raft, whose weight is mainly attributable to a large magnet on its underside. Riders experience several steep drops followed by magnet-powered inclines, ending with a splashdown in a small pool. The Super Tubes Hydrocoaster was the second ProSlide Hydro Magnetic Rocket Slide {{in the world and}} continues to be Australia's only water coaster.|$|E

2500|$|Along a 50-metre {{length of}} tunnel, the {{normally}} 0.4-metre thick tunnel lining {{was reduced to}} a mean depth of 0.17metres, with the thinnest area being 0.02metres. [...] The chalk marl showed no signs of failing or collapsing but colliery arches were installed as a precaution. Over a 240-metre long section (70metres towards Britain, 170metres towards France), damage to the concrete extended {{as far back as the}} first set of reinforcement bars. Superficial damage to the surface of the concrete segments was evident along a further 190metres of <b>tunnel</b> <b>length.</b> In the vicinity of the fire, services were destroyed, including high-voltage cables, low-voltage cables, communications, lighting systems, traction and junction boxes over a length of 800metres. Five hundred metres of track had to be replaced, as did 800metres of overhead line, 800metres of refrigeration pipe and signalling equipment over a length of 1,500metres. [...] Four escape cross-passages and five pressure relief ducts had to be refitted with new doors and dampers. The damage was in interval 3. Service through the tunnel restarted using single track working over the parallel interval 4. [...] In a phased re-opening, freight train service was restored on 29 November 1996, followed by Eurostar services on 4 December, and tourist shuttles on 10 December for cars and 6 January 1997 for coaches. Agreement had been reached on the repairs by 24 January 1997. The civil engineering work, repairing the tunnel wall, was completed by the French contractor Freyssinet in 60 days. This was followed by the replacement of the track, overhead line and signalling by Eurotunnel and, completed in less than a month, the tunnel was fully reopened on 15 May 1997.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to evaluate the effect that knee flexion angle while femoral tunnels are being drilled may have on the <b>length</b> of these <b>tunnels,</b> in anatomical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament. Methods: We measured the lengths of anteromedial and posterolateral tunnels for the anterior cruciate ligament in 20 unpaired anatomical knee specimens (10 right and 10 left knees), all with the cartilage and cruciate ligaments intact. Tunnels were drilled with the knees flexed at 90 °, 110 ° and 130 °, through the accessory anteromedial portal, with a 2. 5 mm drill. The statistical analysis was done by means of Friedman's variance analysis and the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The mean anteromedial femoral <b>tunnel</b> <b>lengths</b> measured with the knees flexed at 90 °, 110 ° and 130 ° were 33. 7 (± 3. 72) mm, 37. 4 (± 2. 93) mm and 38. 8 (± 3. 31) mm, respectively. For the posterolateral femoral <b>tunnel</b> <b>lengths,</b> the results were 32. 1 (± 4. 24) mm, 37. 3 (± 4. 85) mm and 38. 4 (± 2. 51) mm, respectively. Friedman's variance analysis showed {{that there was a}} significant difference between the <b>lengths</b> of the <b>tunnels</b> drilled with 90 ° and 110 ° of flexion angle, but showed that there was no significant difference between the tunnels drilled with flexion of 110 ° and 130 ° (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: It is possible to drill the femoral tunnels through the accessory anteromedial tunnel with the knee flexed at 110 ° in such a way as to produce a <b>tunnel</b> of sufficient <b>length</b> for a good bone-graft interface...|$|R
