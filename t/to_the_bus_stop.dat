5|$|Stan and Kyle meet Wendy at Stark's Pond, {{where she}} {{suggests}} using the machine lodged inside Cartman {{to contact the}} visitors. To lure them back, the children tie Cartman to a tree and, {{the next time he}} farts, a massive satellite dish emerges from his anus. The alien spaceship arrives and Ike jumps to safety. In the meantime, the visitors communicate with the cows in the area, having found them to be the most intelligent species on the planet. Cartman is again abducted by the aliens and returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>stop</b> the following day with pinkeye.|$|E
5|$|Clark, Chloe, and Pete {{arrive at}} the dance, and say their goodbyes to Whitney before he leaves for training. The weather begins to deteriorate, and a storm picks up, as Lana takes Whitney <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>stop.</b> Jonathan (John Schneider) and Martha (Annette O'Toole) decide {{to head to the}} storm cellar to seek cover from the storm, and they {{discover}} Nixon just as the octagonal disk activates the ship. Nixon attempts to escape with the videotape, and Jonathan chases out into the storm after him. The ship levitates off the ground and flies out of the storm cellar. Lana says goodbye to Whitney and drives home. On her way, storm winds force her off the road, right next to three tornadoes that have touched down. The students at the dance are alerted to the tornados that have been sighted, and Clark races off to make sure Lana is all right. The three tornadoes merge into one large tornado and move in Lana's direction. Clark arrives just as Lana, in the truck, is sucked into the tornado's vortex; Clark speeds into the tornado to rescue her.|$|E
25|$|The {{grant of}} new {{licences}} {{was rejected by}} the Commissioners on the basis of: (i) the lack of services to Barcombe Mills station – passengers were obliged to walk one mile <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>stop,</b> (ii) the poor off-peak train/bus connections at Uckfield and (iii) traffic congestion at peak times in Tonbridge and Lewes which had a serious effect on bus timings at Uckfield.|$|E

25|$|Southdown Motors {{operated}} three bus {{services at}} the time: no. 19 between Newick and Lewes via Barcombe Cross, and nos. 119 and 122 between Lewes and Uckfield via the A26 with a stop at Barcombe Lane. As a condition of the Minister's consent to closure, additional bus services were laid on from August 1968. No. 122 additionally called at Isfield Station and provided an hourly service to and from Uckfield, but no. 119 departed Uckfield two minutes before the incoming rail service arrived. Barcombe Mills and Isfield stations remained open to sell tickets. However, as the buses were unable to negotiate the narrow winding road to Barcombe Mills, they stopped one mile short of the station: BRB laid on taxis to ferry passengers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>stop,</b> but passengers first had {{to walk to the}} station to buy their tickets.|$|E
25|$|The {{video is}} set in a {{colorful}} city and has a futuristic theme to it. The storyline of the video begins with Jordan dropping off her boyfriend at a bus stop, as they appear to be breaking up. She is seen sitting in the backseat of her orange AMC Pacer, and starts to sing the song's first verse, just as the wind begins to pick up, sliding her car and the bus stop, where her boyfriend is at, in opposite directions. Throughout the video, the city moves in motion. It is intercut with other scenes, including Jordan dancing with four other back-up dancers at a swimming pool, a man reading a newspaper while holding a Dalmatian dog by its leash, and also a woman with a few shopping bags. During the car scenes, Jordan sees flashbacks of her boyfriend in the car's rear-view mirror. She later realises that he makes her happy and moves to the driver's seat, to stop the car. Jordan then reverses the car, sending her back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|E

500|$|Julia visited Mimi's house {{nearly every}} day, {{where they would}} chat over tea and cakes in the morning room or stand in the garden when it was warm. On the evening of 15July 1958, Nigel Walley went to visit Lennon and found Julia and Mimi talking by the front gate. Lennon was not there, as {{he was at the}} Blomfield Road house. Walley {{accompanied}} Julia <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>stop</b> further north along Menlove Avenue, with her telling jokes along the way. At about 9:30, Walley left her to walk up Vale Road and she crossed Menlove Avenue to the central reservation between two traffic lanes, which was lined with hedges that covered disused tram tracks. Five seconds later, Walley heard [...] "a loud thud", and turned to see her body [...] "flying through the air"—which landed about [...] from where she had been hit. He ran back to get Mimi and they waited for the ambulance, with Mimi crying hysterically.|$|E
500|$|Stan's new dog Sparky {{follows the}} boys <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>stop</b> one morning. Stan {{believes}} Sparky {{to be the}} toughest dog in South Park; but, when Sparky suddenly jumps {{on top of another}} male dog and begins humping him energetically, Cartman declares that Sparky is homosexual. At football practice for the school's team, the South Park Cows, Stan's Uncle Jimbo and his friend Ned show up and ask Coach Chef whether the boys can beat the betting spread of 70 points for the Cows' game against the Middle Park Cowboys. Impressed by a play from Stan, who is the quarterback and star of the team, Jimbo and Ned go to the bookmaker, where Jimbo bets $500 on the Cows. As a result, everyone else bets all their money on the team, and they threaten Jimbo if the Cows lose. Intimidated, Jimbo and Ned seek a back-up plan and learn that John Stamos' brother Richard will be singing [...] "Lovin' You" [...] at half-time. Consequently, they plan to detonate the mascot for Middle Park, by placing a bomb to explode when Richard Stamos sings the high F note in the song.|$|E

Eventually, she gave up and tried to flee to a bus stop through the mob of segregationists who surrounded and threatened to lynch her. Once Eckford got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>stop,</b> she couldn't stop crying. A reporter, Benjamin Fine, having in mind his own 15-year-old daughter, {{sat down next to}} Eckford.

His statement was condemned by Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall, with Cooper stating that Corbyn's plan was [...] "turning the clock back instead of tackling the problem", while Conservative Women's Minister Nicky Morgan said she was [...] "uncomfortable with the idea", it sounding to her like [...] "segregation".|$|E

2500|$|Roberts was at {{the time}} a {{resident}} of nearby Georgetown, another unincorporated area of Bart Township. His wife last saw him at 8:45a.m. when they walked their children <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>stop</b> before she left. When Mrs. Roberts returned home a little before 11:00a.m., she discovered four suicide notes; one addressed to herself and one to each of their three children. Roberts called his wife from the schoolhouse on his cell phone and told her that he had molested two young female relatives (between the ages of 3 and 5) 20 years previously (when he was 12) and had been daydreaming about molesting again. One note Roberts left behind indicated his despondency over a daughter who died approximately 20 minutes after birth nine years earlier. He stated that he had [...] "been having dreams {{for the past couple of}} years about doing what he did 20 years ago and he has dreams of doing them again", according to State Police Commissioner Colonel Jeffrey Miller. On October 4, 2006, the two relatives whom Roberts said he molested 20 years ago told police that no such abuse had ever happened, throwing a new layer of mystery over the gunman's motive and mental state during the shooting. KY Jelly was also found in the schoolhouse among Roberts's belongings, possibly suggesting multiple motives for the incident.|$|E
