5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, many in <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>community</b> have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The structural breakdown of the plantar fascia {{is believed to be}} the result of repetitive microtrauma (small tears). Microscopic examination of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E

5|$|Despite the police-backed intervention, the {{university}} continued on strike.

In the following week, on April 19, 1982, the intervention was lifted, and academic activities resumed normally.|$|E
5|$|Gregory {{lacked the}} {{administrative}} ability {{of his brother}} Basil or the contemporary influence of Gregory of Nazianzus, but he was an erudite theologian who {{made significant contributions to}} the doctrine of the Trinity and the Nicene Creed.

40|$|Today the {{business}} world claims for professionals able to interact in society in an emotionally intelligent way. In the last century, the Universities around the world {{did not address the}} issue in an explicit way. They form students technically competent, but not necessarily emotionally competent, limited to interact or collaborate in a professional community. This paper shows the importance of ”hot cognition” 1 in the human decision-making during the knowledge creation process. We describe how the knowledge creation process is running in <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>communities</b> during their daily activities. We also propose a prototype to register the subtle and tacit knowledge extracted during <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>communities</b> interactions. That knowledge can improve the way to develop/update systematically the psychological abilities of students during their graduate experience...|$|R

5|$|In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio. While this news was met with excitement at first, scholars—after reading the work—began {{to argue that the}} manuscript was a fraud, with humanist Antonio Riccoboni being among the most vocal. However, Sigonio continued to defend the work until his death, even mentioning in two different orations his belief in the truthfulness of the text. The scholar Latino Latini, however, later claimed in a letter that Sigonio had admitted to the forgery on his deathbed. By and large, <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>community</b> concluded that the version of the Consolatio discovered was not genuine, and the document later earned the name the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the novel, varying {{perceptions}} of reality that arise due to cultural differences between its characters are emphasized and contrasted. Carpentier explores hybridization, nature, voodoo, ethnicity, history and destiny, confusion, violence, and sexuality {{in a style}} that blends history with fiction and uses repetition to emphasize the cyclical nature of events. The novel was largely well-received with much attention paid to Carpentier's inclusion of magic realism and The Kingdom of This World {{has been described as}} an important work in the development of this genre in Caribbean and Latin American literature. However, some technical aspects of his style have been ignored by <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>community,</b> and the novel's narrative organization has been criticized.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of This World is {{considered}} to be Alejo Carpentier's first great novel. He is praised for his skillful inclusion of Haitian voodoo, myth, and history in the work, as well as for contributing to the definition of Latin American identity. Although the presence of magic realism in The Kingdom of This World has been acclaimed by critics and discussed at length within <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>community,</b> this concern is paralleled by a lack of interest in Carpentier's technical work in the novel. In particular, his vision of time has been widely ignored. The Kingdom of This World has also been criticized for its narrative organization, which predominantly relies on opposition rather than on succession: the novel does not present history in terms of a sequence of events and their consequences. The gaps within chronological time that occur throughout this novel as well as the sudden changes of perspective and minimal transitional narrative have led some to criticize the book for the chaotic first impression it gives the reader.|$|E
5|$|The motte-and-bailey castle is a {{particularly}} northern European phenomenon, most numerous in Normandy and Britain, but also seen in Denmark, Germany, Southern Italy and occasionally beyond. European castles first emerged in the 9th and 10th centuries, {{after the fall of}} the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes and local territories became threatened by the Magyars and the Norse. Against this background, various explanations have been put forward to explain the origins and spread of the motte-and-bailey design across northern Europe; there is often a tension among <b>the</b> <b>academic</b> <b>community</b> between explanations that stress military and social reasons for the rise of this design. One suggestion is that these castles were built particularly in order to protect against external attack– the Angevins, it is argued, began to build them to protect against the Viking raids, and the design spread to deal with the attacks along the Slav and Hungarian frontiers. Another argument is that, given the links between this style of castle and the Normans, who were of Viking descent, it was in fact originally a Viking design, transported to Normandy and Angers. The motte-and-bailey castle was certainly effective against assault, although as historian André Debord suggests, the historical and archaeological record of the military operation of motte-and-bailey castles remains relatively limited.|$|E
