25|$|On July 27, 2016, {{a federal}} judge ruled that Hinckley {{would be allowed to}} be {{released}} from St. Elizabeth's on August 5, as he was no longer considered a threat to himself or others. The pivotal conditions of his release are that he has no contact with the Reagan family, the Brady family, or Jodie Foster. He will live with his 90-year-old mother and be restricted to a 50-mile zone around her home in Williamsburg, Virginia. Hinckley was released from institutional psychiatric care on September 10, 2016, and will live full-time at his mother's home.

25|$|For Fitzpatrick, {{the key to}} {{establishing}} financially viable models for university presses and modes of scholarly publishing more generally is the reconceptualization of the university’s mission. Universities must recognize that their mission is, {{in addition to the}} production of knowledge, the communication of knowledge. Fitzpatrick conceptualizes scholarship as an ongoing conversation between scholars that can only continue if participants have the means to contribute to it. Publishing and disseminating information via the university press is one possible mode of communication. This reconceptualization of the university’s mission is part and parcel to the restructuring of its press’s functioning. If the university is reimagined as a center of communication, rather than principally as a credential-bestowing organization, its central mission becomes the production and dissemination of scholarly work. In this rethinking, <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>has</b> a future as the knowledge-disseminating organ of the university. For this to happen, the press must be integrated within the university and be provided sufficient funding so that its mission is not financially based but, rather, aligns with that of the university.|$|E

25|$|Purdue's {{library system}} {{consists}} of fifteen locations throughout the campus, including an archives and special collections research center, an undergraduate library, and several subject-specific libraries. More than three million volumes, including one million electronic books, are held at these locations. An administrative unit of Purdue University Libraries, Purdue University Press {{has its roots}} in the 1960 founding of Purdue University Studies by President Frederick Hovde on a $12,000 grant from the Purdue Research Foundation. This was the result of a committee appointed by President Hovde after the Department of English lamented the lack of publishing venues in the humanities. Since the 1990s, the range of books published by <b>the</b> <b>Press</b> <b>has</b> grown to reflect the work from other colleges at Purdue University especially in the areas of agriculture, health, and engineering. Purdue University Press publishes print and ebook monograph series in a range of subject areas from literary and cultural studies to the study of the human-animal bond. In 1993 Purdue University Press was admitted to membership of the Association of American University Presses. Purdue University Press publishes around 25 books a year and 20 learned journals in print, in print & online, and online only formats in collaboration with Purdue University Libraries.|$|E

The King's private secretary, Alec Hardinge, wrote to him on 13 November, warning: [...] "The silence in the British Press on the subject of Your Majesty's friendship with Mrs Simpson {{is not going to be}} maintained... Judging by the letters from British subjects living in foreign countries where <b>the</b> <b>Press</b> <b>has</b> been outspoken, the effect will be calamitous."

500|$|While {{a segment}} of <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>has</b> {{described}} Kapoor as friendly and extremely close to her family, others have criticized her for being arrogant and vain—an image she gained {{in the wake of}} her superficial character, Poo, in Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001). She subsequently featured in films portraying similar characters, and this further established her off- and on-screen personae. Before the release of Chameli (2004) (in which she played a sex worker), Kapoor stated that [...] "there is a certain image that people identify you with [...] t always follows you whichever role you play. I am trying to transgress this image and become more screen-friendly than image-friendly." [...] Chameli helped Kapoor reinvent her on-screen persona, and she later explained that her honesty and openness was often perceived by the media as arrogance.|$|E
500|$|Stane's {{scientists}} cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at {{his home}} and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages {{to get to his}} original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane, but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane {{to the top of the}} Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being the superhero <b>the</b> <b>press</b> <b>has</b> dubbed [...] "Iron Man".|$|E
