25|$|Direct-drive reels have <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> {{and handle}} {{directly}} coupled. When the handle moves forwards, <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> moves forwards, and vice versa.

25|$|Baitcasters {{are known}} as {{multiplier}} reels in Europe, on account of their geared line retrieve (one turn of the handle resulting in multiple turns of <b>the</b> <b>spool).</b>|$|E
25|$|Spinning reels {{have two}} types of drag: front or rear. Front drags, which have the {{adjustment}} located on <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> itself, are mechanically simpler, usually more consistent in performance and capable of higher drag forces. Rear drags, with the adjustment screw {{on the back of}} the reel, are more complicated mechanically and usually not as precise or smooth as front drags since the drag itself is often part of the drive shaft and not <b>the</b> <b>spool.</b> They are however, easier to adjust in mid-fight.|$|E

25|$|At {{the core}} of the XPS print path is XPSDrv, the XPS-based printer driver which {{includes}} the filter pipeline. It contains a set of filters which are print processing modules and an XML-based configuration file to describe how the filters are loaded. Filters receive <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> file data as input, perform document processing, rendering and PDL post-processing, and then output PDL data for the printer to consume. Filters can perform a single function such as watermarking a page or doing color transformations or they can perform several print processing functions on specific document parts individually or collectively and then convert <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> file to the page description language supported by the printer.|$|E
25|$|Lever drags {{work through}} cam action to {{increase}} or decrease pressure on the drag washers located on <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> itself. Most lever drags offer preset drag positions for strike (reduced drag to avoid tearing the hook out of the fish), full (used once the hook is set) and freespool (see above). Lever drags are simpler and faster to adjust during the fight. And, since they use <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> for the washer stack rather than the drive gear, the washers can be larger, offering more resistance and smoother action. The disadvantage is that in freespool, there can be residual and unwanted resistance since the drag mechanism may not be {{completely out of the}} picture without resorting to more complex mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Albert Illingworth, 1st Baron Illingworth a {{textiles}} magnate, patented {{the modern}} form of fixed-spool spinning reel in 1905. When casting Illingworth's reel design, {{the line was}} drawn off {{the leading edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>spool,</b> but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup, a device which orbits around the stationary spool. Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels.|$|E

25|$|Applications {{which use}} the Windows Presentation Foundation for the display {{elements}} can directly print to the XPS print path {{without the need}} for image or colorspace conversion. The XPS format used in <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> file, represents advanced graphics effects such as 3D images, glow effects, and gradients as Windows Presentation Foundation primitives, which are processed by the printer drivers without rasterization, preventing rendering artifacts and reducing computational load. When the legacy GDI Print Path is used, the XPS spool file is used for processing before it is converted to a GDI image to minimize the processing done at raster level.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanics}} of drag systems usually consist of {{any number of}} discs (drag washers) arranged in a stack on <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> shaft or in some cases, on the drive shaft. There is generally a screw or lever mechanism that presses against the washersâ€”the higher the pressure, the greater the resistance. Drag washers are commonly made of materials such as steel, Teflon, carbon fiber, other reinforced plastics or metal alloys. Since large fish can generate a lot of pulling power, reels with higher available drag forces (which generate greater heat) for higher-test lines will use stronger and more heat-resistant materials than reels designed for low-test lines. A good drag system is consistent (generates the same force over and over), durable and smooth (no jerkiness).|$|E
25|$|A few knots {{have become}} more or less {{standard}} for attaching the {{various parts of the}} fly lines and backing, etc., together. A detailed discussion of most of these knots is available in any good book on fly fishing. Some of the knots that are in most every fly angler's arsenal are: the improved clinch knot which is commonly used to attach the fly to the leader, the overhand slip knot or arbor knot which is used to attach the backing to <b>the</b> <b>spool,</b> the albright knot which can be used to attach the fly line to the backing. A loop can also be put in fly line backing using a bimini twist. Often, a loop is added to the business end of the fly line to facilitate the connection to the leader. This loop may take one of several forms. It may be formed by creating a loop in the end of the fly line itself or by adding a braided loop or a loop of monofilament nylon (as in Gray's Loop). Alternatively, a single length of monofilament nylon, or fluorocarbon, may be tied {{to the end of the}} fly line using a nail or tube knot or a needle knot. A loop can then be tied at the end of this monofilament butt length or butt section using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, to which the tapered or untapered leader, also looped using a double surgeon's knot or a perfection loop, may in turn be connected via a loop to loop connection. The use of loop to loop connections between the fly line and the leader provides a quick and convenient way to change or replace a tapered leader. Many commercially produced tapered leaders come with a pre-tied loop connection.|$|E

2500|$|Fly reels are {{normally}} manual, single-action designs. Rotating {{a handle on}} the side of the reel rotates <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> which retrieves the line, usually at a 1:1 ratio (i.e., one complete revolution of the handle equals one revolution of <b>the</b> <b>spool).</b> [...] Fly reels are one of the simplest reels and have far fewer parts than a spinning reel. [...] The larger the fish the more important the reel becomes. [...] On the outside of the reel there are two levels of knobs these are <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> release and the drag adjustment.|$|E
2500|$|Fly-reel drag {{systems have}} two {{purposes}} 1.) They prevent spool overrun when stripping {{line from the}} reel while casting 2.)Tire out running fish by exerting pressure on the line that runs in the opposite direction. There are four main drag systems that are used with the fly reel {{and these are the}} ratchet-and-pawl, caliper drags, disc drags, and center-line drags. [...] The ratchet-and-pawl drag clicks automatically while <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> is spinning. [...] The caliper drag causes the calipers to brush up against the reel spool. [...] A disc drag is when pressure is applied on the plates which then applies pressure on <b>the</b> <b>spool.</b> Center-line drags also known as the best kind of drag because the pressure is directly on <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> close to the axis of rotation.|$|E
2500|$|Fixed spool reels {{are cast}} by opening the bail, {{grasping}} {{the line with}} the forefinger, and then using a backward snap of the rod followed by a forward cast while releasing the line with the forefinger at the same time. [...] The forefinger is then placed {{in contact with the}} departing line and the leading edge of <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> in order to slow or stop the outward cast. [...] On the retrieve, the left hand normally operates the crank handle, while the large rotating wire cage or bail (either manually or trigger-operated) serves as the line pickup, restoring the line to its original position on <b>the</b> <b>spool.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Though {{spinning}} reels do {{not suffer}} from backlash, line can occasionally be trapped underneath itself on <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> or even detach from the reel in loose loops of line. [...] Some {{of these issues}} {{can be traced to}} overfilling <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> with line, while others are due {{to the way in which}} the line is wound onto <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> by the rotating bail or pickup. [...] Various oscillating spool mechanisms have been introduced over the years in an effort to solve this problem. [...] Spinning reels also tend to have more issues with twisting of the fishing line. [...] Line twist in spinning reels can occur from the spin of an attached lure, the action of the wire bail against the line when engaged by the crank handle, or even retrieval of line that is under load (spinning reel users normally pump the rod up and down, then retrieve the slack line to avoid line twist and stress on internal components). [...] In order to minimize line twist, many anglers who use a spinning reel manually reposition the bail after each cast with the pickup nearest the rod in order to minimize line twist.|$|E
2500|$|The centrepin reel (or centerpin, center pin, or float reel) is {{one which}} runs freely enough on its axle (its [...] "centrepin") to permit {{distance}} casting {{by allowing the}} line to be drawn off by {{the momentum of the}} cast from the rotating reel. [...] The centrepin reel uses a large diameter spool typically mounted to a 12â€“17 foot surfcasting rod. [...] A bracket attached to the reel that allows it to be rotated 90Â° to the rod for casting and returned to a position to retrieve line. In the casting position <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> is perpendicular to the rod, opening the face of the reel allowing the line to run off the side of <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> when released in the cast.|$|E
2500|$|To cast a baitcasting rod and reel, {{the reel}} {{is turned on}} its side, the [...] "free spool" [...] feature engaged, and the thumb placed on <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> to hold the lure in position. [...] The cast is {{performed}} by snapping the rod backward to the 2 o'clock position, then casting it forward in a smooth motion, allowing the lure to pull the line from the reel. [...] The thumb is used to contact the line, moderating the revolutions of <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> and braking the lure when it reaches the desired aiming point. [...] Though modern centrifugal and/or magnetic braking systems help to control backlash, using a bait casting reel still requires practice and {{a certain amount of}} finesse {{on the part of the}} fisherman for best results.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} doped-fiber's {{spooling}} on performance of short wavelength band erbium-doped fiber amplifier (S-band EDFA) is demonstrated.

2500|$|While {{with the}} T.I. Group Dolphin invented and {{patented}} a 'Jumping apparatus' {{consisting of a}} tubular post with footrests supported by a spring on a post, mounted on a three-wheeled carriage. [...] The user would have to {{jump up and down}} to 'establish a forward drive to wheels through a free-wheel device'. More successful was his invention of an exercising machine [...] consisting of 'a flywheel rotatably mounted in fixed bearings, a winding spool fixed to rotate with the flywheel and a cable one end of which is connected to the core of <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> {{in such a way that}} on rotation of the flywheel with the cable fully unwound, the cable winds onto <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> in one or other direction depending on the direction of rotation of the flywheel.' From the patent it can be seen that this was the principle used for rowing machines and exercise equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Pressing {{a button}} on the rear of the reel {{disengages}} the line pickup, and the button is then released during the forward cast to allow the line to fly off <b>the</b> <b>spool.</b> The button is pressed again to stop the lure at the position desired.

2500|$|The Baitcasting reel or revolving-spool reel, {{like the}} {{conventional}} reel, is a multiplying reel â€“ {{that is to}} say that the line is stored on a bearing-supported revolving spool that is geared so that a single revolution of the crank handle results in multiple revolutions of <b>the</b> <b>spool.</b> [...] The bait casting reel is mounted above the rod, hence its other name given to it in New Zealand and Australia, the overhead reel. [...] The baitcasting reel dates from at least the mid-17th century, but came into wide use by amateur anglers during the 1870s. [...] Early bait casting reels were often constructed with brass or iron gears, with casings and spools made of brass, German silver, or hard rubber. [...] Featuring multiplying gears ranging from 2:1 to 4:1, these early reels had no drag mechanism, and anglers used their thumb on <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> to provide resistance to runs by a fish. [...] As early as the 1870s, some models used bearings to mount the spool; as the free-spinning spool tended to cause backlash with strong pulls on the line, manufacturers soon incorporated a clicking pawl mechanism. [...] This 'clicker' mechanism was never intended as a drag, but used solely to keep <b>the</b> <b>spool</b> from overrunning, much like a fly reel. [...] Baitcasting reel users soon discovered that the clicking noise of the pawls provided valuable warning that a fish had taken the live bait, allowing the rod and reel to be left in a rod holder while awaiting a strike by a fish.|$|E
