5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> code. <b>The</b> <b>genetic</b> code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E
5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence of a gene, which is encoded in <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> code. In general, <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which can be called prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E

5|$|Domestication is {{also studied}} by using <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> {{material}} of present-day horses and comparing it with <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> material {{present in the}} bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in <b>the</b> <b>genetic</b> material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This {{is reflected in the}} difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA. There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation. In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BC.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} an {{improved}} adaptive parallel genetic {{algorithm is proposed}} to solve problems of grid resources distribution and matching, comparing with <b>the</b> traditional <b>genetic</b> algorithms, a new adaptive selection operator is introduced, which can prevent the premature convergence of genetic algorithm efficiently. Besides, in this paper, the migration strategy of <b>the</b> parallel <b>genetic</b> algorithm can prevent the population trapped in the local extreme. And a pc-cluster containing eight computers is constructed to execute <b>the</b> coarse-grained parallel <b>genetic</b> algorithm and series genetic algorithm, and different scale resources and tasks are tested on the pc-cluster.
