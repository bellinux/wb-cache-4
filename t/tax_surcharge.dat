5|$|Aside from {{complaints}} {{regarding the}} high retail {{price for the}} three-record set, particularly in Britain – {{a result of the}} government's refusal to waive its <b>tax</b> <b>surcharge</b> – controversy soon surrounded the project's fundraising. Because the event had not been registered as a UNICEF benefit beforehand, and was therefore not granted tax-exempt status – the blame for which Harrison lay squarely at Klein's feet – most of the money generated was held in an Internal Revenue Service escrow account for ten years. In interview with Derek Taylor for his autobiography in the late 1970s, Harrison put this figure at somewhere between $8 million and $10 million. Before then, in early 1972, New York magazine reported that some of the proceeds remained unaccounted for and had found their way into Klein's accounts. Klein responded by suing the magazine for $150 million in damages, and although the suit was later withdrawn, the accusations attracted unwelcome scrutiny at a time when questions were also being asked about Klein's mismanagement of the Beatles' finances. That year, an estimated $2 million had gone to the refugees via UNICEF before the IRS audit of Apple got under way; finally, in 1981, $8.8 million was added to that total following the audit.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} framing effects in taxation. In October 1994 the German Minister of Family Affairs, Mrs. Ronsch, expectedly withdrew her candidacy {{for a second}} term after she had triggered off a storm of public indignation, owing to her plan to introduce <b>tax</b> <b>surcharges</b> for childless households in order to finance higher tax reliefs for families with children. Using data of 219 employees of North German firms, we are able to demonstrate that tax rebates for married couples and families with children are conceded more generous than corresponding <b>tax</b> <b>surcharges</b> for singles and childless households. The framing effect is, however, unambigously evidenced for aggregated data only. Analysing individual data allows this conclusion for only some 10 % of all respondents. Moreover, we show that a self [...] serving bias is at work for married respondents. Keywords.

25|$|In 1997 Barbados {{implemented}} a general taxation which covers most items. Known as the Value-Added Tax ("VAT") it covers almost all items at a 17.5% tax rate and an 8.75% for hotel accommodations. Exported goods and services, {{prescription drugs and}} a few other specific items are zero rated under the legislation. The VAT replaced several other taxes such as: the Consumption <b>Tax,</b> <b>Surcharge,</b> Excise Tax and an Environmental Levy. People operating under Barbados' VAT regime must be registered for VAT and from 1 December 2010, the threshold for VAT registration has been BDS$80,000 (previously BDS$60,000).|$|E
25|$|Commissaries still sell {{products}} at cost {{today as they}} have since 1825. Today's customers also pay a surcharge on their purchases, which was mandated by Congress in 1952 to make commissaries more self-sustaining. The surcharge, which has been set at 5 percent since April 1983, provides modern shopping facilities for service members at a reduced cost to taxpayers. Unlike a <b>tax,</b> <b>surcharge</b> funds go right back into the commissary to work for commissary customers, paying {{for the cost of}} building new stores, renovating and repairing existing ones and purchasing equipment and store-level information technology systems such as cash registers.|$|E

25|$|Dulles is {{accessible}} via the Dulles Access Road/Dulles Greenway (State Route 267) and State Route 28. The Dulles Airport Access Highway (DAAH) is a toll-free, limited access, highway {{owned by the}} Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) to facilitate car access to Dulles from the Washington Capital Beltway and Interstate 66. After it opened, non-airport traffic between Washington and Reston became so heavy that a parallel set of toll lanes were added on the same right-of-way to accommodate non-airport traffic (Dulles Toll Road). However, the airport-only lanes are both less congested as well as toll-free. As of November 1, 2008, MWAA assumed responsibility from the Virginia Department of Transportation both for operating the Dulles Toll Road and {{for the construction of}} a rapid transit rail line down its median. Route 28, which runs north–south along the eastern edge of the airport, has been upgraded to a limited access highway, with the interchanges financed through a property <b>tax</b> <b>surcharge</b> on nearby business properties. The Dulles Toll Road has been extended to the west to Leesburg as the Dulles Greenway.|$|E
500|$|On 1 September 2017 the Legislature, {{after meeting}} {{for a week}} in a special session on rail financing, {{approved}} further taxes to raise $2.4$nbsp;billion for the project. [...] The taxes include a further three year extension to the 0.5 percent General Excise <b>Tax</b> <b>surcharge,</b> which will now expire in 2030, and a thirteen year, 1.0 percent surcharge on the existing 9.25 percent statewide Transient Accommodation Tax (TAT) which is charged to tourists. [...] Efforts to pass a funding bill in May 2017 had failed and the impetus for the special session was a FTA deadline of September 15 for a funding plan to cover the shortfall.. [...] The bill also grants the state government oversight over the project including the appointment of two non-voting representatives on the HART board and calls for an audit of HART by the state auditor.

500|$|The Concert for Bangladesh was {{released}} in the United States on 20 December 1971, and in Britain on 10 January 1972, with the same Apple Records catalogue number (STCX 3385) in both territories. The retail price for the lavishly packaged triple album was set at $12.98 in America and an extraordinarily high £5.50 in the UK, due to the purchase <b>tax</b> <b>surcharge</b> there. The prices drew some criticism, from Harrison for one, {{even if it was}} accepted that the proceeds were going to those in desperate need – or, as Beatles Forever author Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1977, to [...] "a nation still viewed as the worst pocket of misery on earth". Similarly, the relief project's funds controversy and tax problems, which came to light shortly after the release of the live album, were a source of frustration and embarrassment to Harrison, but commentators have noted that these problems took nothing away from the [...] "resounding success" [...] of Harrison and Shankar's Bangladesh relief project.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} in marketing and public economics suggests that consumers underestimate {{the effects of}} <b>taxes</b> and <b>surcharges</b> on total purchase prices when <b>taxes</b> and <b>surcharges</b> are made less salient. The leading explanation is that consumers anchor on base prices and underadjust for surcharges. We perform experiments that: extend the tax salience and price partitioning literatures to the labor supply context; test the anchoring hypothesis by examining the effects {{of positive and negative}} wage surcharges on willingness to work; and test whether responses to price partitioning result from imperfect calculation of all-inclusive prices or from deeper preferences. We reject the anchoring hypothesis and find that subjects are less willing to work both when their wages are partitioned with positive and with negative surcharge components. We also find evidence that partitioned pricing effects result from cognitive limitations and possibly from responses to complexity...|$|R
500|$|Labor campaigned {{under the}} slogan [...] "It's Time", {{an echo of}} Menzies' {{successful}} 1949 slogan, [...] "It's Time for a Change". Surveys showed that even Liberal voters approved of the Labor slogan. Whitlam pledged an end to conscription {{and the release of}} individuals who had refused the draft; an income <b>tax</b> <b>surcharge</b> to pay for universal health insurance; free dental care for students; and renovation of aging urban infrastructure. The party pledged to eliminate university tuition fees and establish a schools commission to evaluate educational needs. The party benefited from the support of the proprietor of News Limited, Rupert Murdoch, who preferred Whitlam over McMahon. Labor was so dominant in the campaign that some of Whitlam's advisers urged him to stop joking about McMahon; people were feeling sorry for him. The election saw the ALP increase its tally by 12seats, mostly in suburban Sydney and Melbourne, for a majority of nine in the House of Representatives. [...] The ALP gained little beyond the suburban belts, however, losing a seat in South Australia and two in Western Australia.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Over a {{three year}} period from July 1997 to July 2000, the Australian {{government}} introduced three successive policy changes {{designed to increase}} private health insurance coverage. The combined effect {{was an increase in}} the population coverage from a low point of 30. 1 percent to 45. 7 percent. The motivation for the policy changes was to induce more Australians to use the private sector for their hospital care and in so doing reduce the pressure on the public sector. Most of the increase in coverage occurred after the last policy, prompting many commentators [1, 2] to attribute almost all the increase to this last policy. We use trend analysis and estimates of the elasticities of demand for health insurance to delineate the impact of each successive policy on insurance coverage. The policy changes The three new policies designed to promote private health insurance were introduced over a three year period.
