5|$|Modern historians, doubting that a Persian {{commander}} {{would have}} sabotaged his own invasion, have suggested several other possible scenarios. It is, however, {{impossible to know}} exactly how the Naxians {{became aware of the}} invasion, but undoubtedly <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware,</b> and began to make preparations. Herodotus tells us that the Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition, but that when news arrived they brought everything in from the fields, gathered enough food with which to survive a siege and reinforced their walls.|$|E
5|$|As the day wore on, {{conditions}} {{appeared more}} and more favorable for thunderstorms, and {{more and more}} similar to the events of March 20. Weather radar images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> of the small chance of success, they felt they had no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20. Equipment which could be was moved to bomb-proof shelters, and base personnel were moved to safer areas.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand tackled the centrifugal pumps.|$|E

5|$|The {{third phase}} {{received}} the least consideration, but naval planners {{were aware that}} Singapore was too far from Japan to provide an adequate base for operations close to Japan. Moreover, the further the fleet proceeded from Singapore, the weaker it would become. If American assistance was forthcoming, there was the prospect of Manila {{being used as a}} forward base. The idea of invading Japan and fighting its armies on its own soil was rejected as impractical, but the British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. They were therefore drawn to the concept of a blockade. From personal experience <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> of the impact it could have on an island nation {{at the heart of a}} maritime empire, and felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E
5|$|Cathedral {{officials}} also described {{the use of}} guns in a city which has a gun crime problem as irresponsible. The Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend Nigel McCulloch, stated that it was well known that Manchester had a gun crime problem, {{and that it was}} beyond belief that a global manufacturer would re-create one of their Cathedrals with photo-realistic quality. Insomniac, the game's developer, declined to comment, referring all inquires to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe issued a statement, stating that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> of the concerns expressed by the Bishop of Manchester and the Cathedral authorities, and take them seriously. However, they added that Resistance: Fall of Man is a fantasy science fiction game and not based on reality and that they believed they had sought and received all permissions necessary. Sony also stated that it would be contacting the Cathedral on 11 June 2007 to understand their concerns in more detail. David Wilson, a Sony spokesman, told The Times that it was game-created footage, and not video or photography. Further, he compared it to science fiction shows such as Doctor Who, claiming that it was not based on reality at all.|$|E
5|$|Land {{was also}} {{an issue in the}} coming of the war. While the French colonists—most of whom were farmers who {{seasonally}} engaged in fur trade—had always been relatively few, {{there seemed to be no}} end of settlers in the British colonies, who wanted to clear the land of trees and occupy it. Shawnees and Delawares in the Ohio Country had been displaced by British colonists in the east, and this motivated their involvement in the war. On the other hand, Native Americans in the Great Lakes region and the Illinois Country had not been greatly affected by white settlement, although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> of the experiences of tribes in the east. Historian Gregory Dowd argues that most Native Americans involved in Pontiac's Rebellion were not immediately threatened with displacement by white settlers, and that historians have therefore overemphasized British colonial expansion as a cause of the war. Dowd believes that the presence, attitude, and policies of the British Army, which the Native Americans found threatening and insulting, were more important factors.|$|E

5|$|Whatever event {{eventually}} {{triggered the}} battle, it obviously altered the strategic or tactical balance sufficiently to induce the Athenians {{to attack the}} Persians. If the first theory is correct (see above), then the absence of cavalry removed the main Athenian tactical disadvantage, {{and the threat of}} being outflanked made it imperative to attack. Conversely, if the second theory is correct, then the Athenians were merely reacting to the Persians attacking them. Since the Persian force obviously contained a high proportion of missile troops, a static defensive position would have made little sense for the Athenians; the strength of the hoplite was in the melee, and the sooner that could be brought about, the better, from the Athenian point of view. If the second theory is correct, this raises the further question of why the Persians, having hesitated for several days, then attacked. There may have been several strategic reasons for this; perhaps <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> (or suspected) that the Athenians were expecting reinforcements. Alternatively, since they may have felt the need to force some kind of victory—they could hardly remain at Marathon indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Howard Thurman {{became the}} Dean of the Boston University School of Theology and, {{after ten years}} in California, the couple moved to Boston. The move was {{prompted}} {{by the desire to}} share their ideas of outreach and inclusion in a university setting, though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> that the arrival of the first black pastor in a white university would lead to difficulties. From the beginning, Thurman tried to create an inclusive environment, organizing monthly dinners for the Marsh Chapel Choir members and their friends. Shortly after they arrived, a Japanese student committed suicide leaving a note that she had no friends. Not only was she not known well at the university, finding her family to notify them was difficult. In response, Thurman organized the International Student Hostess Committee to keep international students from feeling isolated. By 1965, the committee was serving 500 international students at Boston University. The Thurmans were at times criticized by those who felt they should be visibly active in the Civil Rights Movement, but they believed their commitment was to addressing the spiritual needs of those who were visible, rather than participating in marches, protests and demonstrations. Among the papers of MLK were many letters from people such as Homer A. Jack, who co-founded the Congress of Racial Equality; Lillian Smith, author of the novel Strange Fruit; Glenn E. Smiley, national field secretary of Fellowship of Reconciliation, as well as King's own acknowledgement, which credited their spiritual guidance.|$|E
