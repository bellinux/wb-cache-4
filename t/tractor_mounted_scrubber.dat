40|$|Problem statement: The most {{important}} design criterion of mechanized device is safety; safety comprises both {{the safety of}} operator and safety of maintenance personnel. Failures and safety of harvesting platform of <b>Tractor</b> <b>Mounted</b> Hydraulic Elevator (TMHE) powered by tractor PTO was tested by Finite Element Method for the mechanical harvesting of coconut orchards using digital Ergonomic hart rate meter. The objective {{of this study was}} to study the stability of the THME by finite element method, operational safety and power requirement for the use of this elevator for coconut harvesting. Also to provide sufficient adjustment and space to account for variation in body sizes, ensure controls are situated within suitable reach and are properly marked. Approach: The Modal analysis was carried out for the whole assembly of <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> hydraulic elevator by using Ansis software. The digital polar hart rate meter RS 400 TM having infrared connectivity sensor is used for recording the hart rates. The research work was conducted at, Dr. Balasaheb Sawant Kokan Krishi Vidyapeeth Dapoli. The harvesting of coconuts was performed by manual climbing labor and by <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> hydraulic elevator. The technical assessments included the use of biomechanical models, vibration testing equipment, ODR, BPDS. The ergonomical evaluation results of the above study are correlates to decide the feasibility, safety and efficiency of <b>Tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> hydraulic elevator for coconut harvesting. The PTO rpm influence for the lifting and lowering of the harvesting platform was studied experimentally by using digital tachometer. Results: The better stability results with the controlled vibrations and frequency of the lifting platform and welded joints were recorded by keeping constrained boundary conditions. Ergonomically operational safe and controlled heart rates are recorded. Hence the labors can continuously do the coconut harvesting work by using the <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> hydraulic elevator. The minimum PTO power is required for the coconut harvesting by using <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> hydraulic elevator. Conclusion/Recommendation: The <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> hydraulic elevator is suitable, safe, less hazardous and economical as compared to manual climbing for coconut harvesting. Hence it is recommended to use <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> hydraulic elevator for harvesting, cleaning and breeding of coconut orchards upto 14 m height...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, the <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> {{boom sprayer}} {{is used in}} many {{agricultural}} fields. These sprayers have many advantages compared to other sprayers, but in Iran, their field efficiency is much {{lower than that of}} the developed countries, because the tank volume and consumption of pesticides per hectare is often so highthat spraying per hectare takesa long time for handling the solutions and transporting the sprayers. Also spray droplet size is ordinarily high and its distribution is unknot uniform. So, often spraying and dropping top parts of plants on the earth is inevitable. According to studies carried out in the country during the years 2005 - 2008 in the agricultural research centers in several provinces such as Khuzestan, four types of sprayers including <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> sprayer, atomizer, microner, and electrostatic atomizer were studied and some of the results obtained include the following. From {{the point of view of}} percentage of crash crop, <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> sprayer has the highest percentage, but microner sprayer had the lowest. From the point of view of the solution of consumption amount and spraying cost per hectare, the operation of the <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> sprayer and electrostatic sprayer had the highest and the lowest ranks, respectively. Atomizer sprayer had the highest effect on the percentage amount of weed control, but it requires a high amount of water consumption, high drift and low operation (Safari and Lovaimi, 2010). Materials and Methods: The experiment was carried out during 2012 - 2013 in the field of agricultural research located in the Mollasani city located 20 km near Ahvaz. In this study, <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> spinning disk sprayer (mounted microner sprayer) was evaluated in comparison with conventional boom sprayer on weeds control. The treatments included medium (3500 rpm) and low (2000 rpm) speed rotation disk sprayer and two types of nozzle in conventional boom sprayer. One of them was an Italian tee jet nozzle and the other one was flowage nozzle and they were compared with control treatment. Experiment design was Randomized Completed blocks Design (RCBD) with seven replications. Parameters such as spraying quality, diameter, volume mean diameter and numerical mean of droplets, spray quality factor, the percentage of crash crop, weeds dry weight and number, percentage of weed control and the drift were measured. The results were compared with a control treatment. For comparative tests between the sprayers, the measured parameters were compared with each other using SAS software. Results and Discussion: Volume mean diameter and numerical mean diameter in <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> microner sprayer with medium and low speed rotation disk treatment and also <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> boom sprayer with Italian fan nozzle treatment were metered 162. 5, 461 and 635. 5 micron, and 138. 5, 355 and 452. 5 micron, respectively. Volume mean diameter related to numerical mean diameter was obtained to be 1. 17 and 1. 3 for <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> microner sprayer with medium and low levels of speed rotation disk, and 1. 4 for <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> boom sprayer with Italian fan nozzle, respectively. Whenever the spray quality coefficient is closer to one, the spray quality is better. So microner sprayer treatment with 1. 17 coefficient has the best spray quality. The results about weeds control numbers showed all treatments had significant difference with control treat in 1...|$|R

Based on recorded increasing of average of heart rate, conventional knapsack sprayer {{was found to be}} most strenuous operation, with an increasing of average of hemi rate of 28. 13 beats /min. There were significant differences in the increasing of average of heart rates of batteries operated knapsack sprayer and <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> sprayer (power sprayer) with the increasing of average of heart rates for these two field operations being 14. 63 and 17. 83 beats /min, respectively. There highest average of energy expenditure of 6. 90 kcal/ min was observed for conventional knapsack sprayer and the lowest average of energy expenditure of 3. 80 Kcal/ min was for <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> sprayer. The highest field capacity was recorded for <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> sprayer (Power Sprayer) was about 6. 77 acre per hour; while the lowest was recorded for conventional knapsack sprayer (manual) was about 1. 40 acre per hour. The results indicate that the average increasing of heart rate Beats / Min was positively linked to the human energy expenditure Kcal/ Min of the subjects, while the human energy expenditure Kcal / Min was negatively linked to the field capacity. In the operation cost, it indicate that the <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> sprayer was highest that estimated of total operation cost was about RM 52. 621 hour, while the lowest was conventional knapsack sprayer (manual) that estimated to be RM 9. 08 /hour.

40|$|Theme: 1 st International Research Conference On Driving Socio-Economic Development Through Value Addition And Sustainable Use Of Resources,Food {{is basic}} human need. Without food, human body fails to {{function}} normally. Yet, globally food insecurity is a problem. The {{severity of the}} problem varies from one continent to the other {{as well as from}} one country to the other. Generally food shortages are more intense in developing counties than in developed countries. Reasons for these variations are many and diverse; they include level of technology used in production, processing and storage of food. Food production policies may either support or stifle food productivity. The study was centred on three fundamental objectives. The first one was to identify attributes of food insecurity in Gokwe South district. The second one was to highlight the opportunities and challenges of CA technology on food security in the district. The last objective was to assess CA attribution to food security in Gokwe South district. CA is a farming system or practice which aims to conserve soil, labour and water by using blanket cover (mulch) to minimise runoff and improve the conditions for plant establishment and growth. This practice includes various mechanisms like use of hand hoes for basin formation, jab-planter, animal drawn direct seeder, animal drawn ripper and motorised equipment like <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> direct seeder, <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> sub-soiler and multi row <b>tractor</b> <b>mounted</b> direct seeder. Survey results indicated that although CA contributes significantly to household food security, â€˜as a best practiceâ€™ but itâ€™s not a â€˜best fitâ€™ practice since results fluctuates from one area to the other. Introduction of CA in Zimbabwe was input driven supported mostly by non-governmental organisations hence sustainability of the concept is highly questionable. The results revealed that CA is more of a farming system than technology and its key principles are not of equal eminence and farmers are practising CA at a small scale citing labour constraints.

The purpose of the work: {{studying}} {{the influence of the}} suspension over the tractor axles for smoothness of the MTU travel; the foundation of the rational parameters of the <b>mounting</b> of the <b>tractor</b> and the seat of the wheel tractor of general purpose. When studying, a complex approach has been used to the determination of influence of the loads redistribution over the axles on the level of the low-frequency vubration of the tractor and to the selection of the rational characteristic of the <b>tractor</b> <b>mounting</b> and seat, using the mathematical analysis, experimental investigations, and complex of measure-register equipment. The mathematical model has been consisted for the MTU with the combined characteristics of the <b>tractor</b> <b>mounting</b> and the seat shock absorbers accounted for. The influence of the suspension over the tractor axles on smoothness of its travel has been determined. The rational characteristics of the shock absorbers have been determined. The combined characteristic of the hydraulic shock absorbers of the <b>tractor</b> <b>mounting</b> has been recommended with the coefficient of relative attenuation psi = 0. 4 in the middle part of the dynamic travel of its piston and psi = 0. 5 on the brake sections; for the seat mounting shock absorber psi = 0. 3 and psi = 0. 5. Created and tested have been the experimental specimens of the shock absorbers. The results have been delivered to the Charkovsky Tractor Plant.
