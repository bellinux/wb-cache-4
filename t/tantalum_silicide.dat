40|$|As a {{consequence}} of device shrinking the resistivity of the widely used TaN/Ta double barrier layer becomes an increasingly important parameter for device speed beyond the 32 nm technology node. In this study we describe the optimization of the deposition of TaN/Ta stacks {{in such a way}} that tantalum nitride layer thickness is minimized and tantalum grows in the favorable conducting -phase. In the first part of the study we used in situ ARXPS to investigate the growth of different tantalum nitride layers on SiO 2 and SiOCH as a function of deposition time, nitrogen flow and deposition power. In the second part we analyzed the crystalline phase of a 20 nm thick tantalum layer deposited on top of the same series of tantalum nitride layers characterized in the growth study. The main findings are the appearance of tantalum carbide and <b>tantalum</b> <b>silicide</b> as interface species for the deposition on SiOCH and only <b>tantalum</b> <b>silicide</b> for the deposition on SiO 2. We found that -tantal um grows preferably on tantalum carbide and nitrogen rich intermediate layers whereas silicide at the interface promotes the growth of -tantalum. To verify these findings we studied two additional modifications of the interface. A lower bias power for a deposition of tantalum nitride on SiO 2 was used to confirm the role of <b>tantalum</b> <b>silicide</b> and a thermal treatment of a thin tantalum layer on SiOCH was applied to confirm the role of tantalum carbide. Finally, the contact resistance in via chains on patterned wafers for four selected processes showed the same trends as the sheet resistance of the corresponding barrier films on blanket wafer experiments...|$|E
40|$|Many {{refractory}} metal silicides have received great attention {{due to their}} potential for innovative developments in the silicon-based microelectronic industry. However, <b>tantalum</b> <b>silicide,</b> Ta 2 Si, has remained practically unnoticed since its successful application in silicon carbide technology as a simple route for a high-k dielectric formation. The thermal oxidation of Ta 2 Si produces high-k dielectric layers, (O-Ta 2 Si) -based {{on a combination of}} Ta 2 O 5 and SiO 2. In this work, we investigate the interfacial properties of thermally oxidized (850 - 1050 degrees C) Ta 2 Si on commercial silicon substrates. The implications of diffusion processes in the dielectric properties of an oxidized layer are analyzed. In particular, we observe migration of tantalum pentoxide nanocrystals into the substrate with increasing oxidation temperature. An estimation of the insulator charge and interfacial O-Ta 2 Si/Si trap density is also presented. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{that the use of}} an absorbing layer on top of an interlevel oxide can be used in lieu of the normal antireflective layer approaches to isolate the lithography of a via or contact window level from the reflections of an underlying metal l yer. Specifically, we show the use of a sputtered amorphous silicon layer of 500 A thickness in a double level metal process using g-line lithography. Unwanted substrate reflections during lithography pro-cesses associated with the manufacture of integrated cir-cuits can result in the distortion of the desired feature ei-ther in terms of shape or size. To negate or minimize the effects of the extraneous reflections, processes using anti-reflective coatings (ARCs) or dyed resists have been used. 1 -~ The materials used for ARCs include: sputtered amorphous silicon, sputtered amorphous <b>tantalum</b> <b>silicide,</b> TiN, TiW, and absorbing polymers. Such films typically have a high index of refraction and are highly absorbing at the wave...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring of the {{electrical}} {{resistance of the}} Ta catalyst during the hot wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) of thin silicon films gives information about filament condition. Using Ta filaments for silane decomposition not only the well known strong changes at the cold ends, but also changes of {{the central part of}} the filament were observed. Three different phenomena can be distinguished: silicide (stoichiometric TaxSiy alloys) growth on the filament surfaces, diffusion of Si into the Ta filament and thick silicon deposits (TSD) formation on the filament surface. The formation of different <b>tantalum</b> <b>silicides</b> on the surface as well as the in-diftusion of silicon increase the filament resistance, while the TSDs form additional electrical current channels and that result in a decrease of the filament resistance. Thus, the filament resistance behaviour during ageing is the result of the competition between these two processes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|If {{tantalum}} filaments {{are used}} for the hot wire chemical vapour deposition (HWCVD) of thin film silicon, various types of tantalum silicides are formed, depending on the filament temperature. Under deposition conditions employed for device quality amorphous and microcrystalline silicon (Twire ≈ 1750 °C) a Ta 5 Si 3 (as determined by XRD) shell is formed around the Ta core. After 8 h of accumulated deposition time this shell has a thickness of around 20 μm. Upon annealing of the filament in vacuum at 2100 – 2200 °C the <b>tantalum</b> <b>silicide</b> shell becomes thinner, while a Ta layer is reappearing at {{the surface of the}} wire. After 4 h of annealing the silicide is completely removed, whereas the total diameter of the wire has not significantly changed. The resistance of the filament has been monitored and after the annealing procedure, it completely recovered to that of a fresh wire. This regeneration procedure greatly helps to avoid frequent replacement of the filaments...|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{electron}} emission {{can have a}} strong effect, usually detrimental, upon ion dose control and uniformity. We have measured secondary electron yields, using a commercially available ion implant machine, for various materials en-countered in silicon device technology. Measurements were made for arsenic and boron implants at various implant en-ergies and ion beam currents, and at various bias voltages of the electron collector. We find that <b>tantalum</b> <b>silicide</b> has a higher secondary electron yield than aluminum, which has a higher yield than silicon. The implantation of energetic ions into a material causes the release of secondary electrons. Unless these secondaries are accounted for, they can affect the ion dose control and uniformity (1). It is useful to know the secondary ield (number of secondary electrons per inci-dent ion) of various materials, {{in order to determine}} any potentially troublesome situations which they might cause. Although there are data in the literature for sec-ondary yields from metals caused by incident noble ga...|$|E
40|$|Iridium Interfacial Stack (IrIS) is the sputter {{deposition}} of high-purity <b>tantalum</b> <b>silicide</b> (TaSi 2 - 400 nm) /platinum (Pt- 200 nm) /iridium (Ir- 200 nm) /platinum (Pt- 200 nm) in an {{ultra-high vacuum system}} followed by a 600 C anneal in nitrogen for 30 minutes. IrIS simultaneously acts as both a bond metal and a diffusion barrier. This bondable metallization that also acts as a diffusion barrier can prevent oxygen from air and gold from the wire-bond from infiltrating silicon carbide (SiC) monolithically integrated circuits (ICs) operating above 500 C in air for over 1, 000 hours. This TaSi 2 /Pt/Ir/Pt metallization is easily bonded for electrical connection to off-chip circuitry and does not require extra anneals or masking steps. There are two ways that IrIS {{can be used in}} SiC ICs for applications above 500 C: it can be put directly on a SiC ohmic contact metal, such as Ti, or be used as a bond metal residing on top of an interconnect metal. For simplicity, only the use as a bond metal is discussed. The layer thickness ratio of TaSi 2 to the first Pt layer deposited thereon should be 2 : 1. This will allow Si from the TaSi 2 to react with the Pt to form Pt 2 Si during the 600 C anneal carried out after all layers have been deposited. The Ir layer does not readily form a silicide at 600 C, and thereby prevents the Si from migrating into the top-most Pt layer during future anneals and high-temperature IC operation. The second (i. e., top-most) deposited Pt layer needs to be about 200 nm to enable easy wire bonding. The thickness of 200 nm for Ir was chosen for initial experiments; further optimization of the Ir layer thickness may be possible via further experimentation. Ir itself is not easily wire-bonded because of its hardness and much higher melting point than Pt. Below the iridium layer, the TaSi 2 and Pt react and form desired Pt 2 Si during the post-deposition anneal while above the iridium layer remains pure Pt as desired to facilitate easy and strong wire-bonding to the SiC chip circuitry...|$|E
