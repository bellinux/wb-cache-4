5000|$|TAPI is used {{primarily}} to control either modems or, more recently, to control business <b>telephone</b> system (<b>PBX)</b> handsets.

This is traditionally called [...] "third-party control". Other manufacturers provide drivers that allow the control of a single handset. This is called [...] "first-party control". Third-party drivers are designed to allow applications to see and/or control multiple extensions at the same time. Some telephone systems only permit one third-party connection at a time. First-party drivers are designed to allow applications to monitor and/or control one extension at a time. Telephone systems naturally permit many of these connections simultaneously. Modem connections are by nature first-party.|$|R

50|$|Some private branch {{exchange}} (<b>PBX)</b> <b>telephone</b> systems use a paging facility {{that acts as a}} liaison between the telephone and a PA amplifier. In other systems, paging equipment is not built into the telephone system. Instead the system includes a separate paging controller connected to a trunk port of the telephone system. The paging controller is accessed as either a designated directory number or central office line. In many modern systems, the paging function is integrated into the telephone system, and allows announcements to be played over the phone speakers.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{standard}} Private Branch Exchange <b>telephone</b> systems (<b>PBX)</b> {{designed for}} general office users, Trading turret system architecture has historically relied on highly distributed switching architectures that enable parallel processing of calls and ensure a [...] "non-blocking, non-contended" [...] state {{where there is}} always a greater number of trunks (paths in/out of the system) than users as well as fault tolerance which ensures that any one component failure can not affect all users or lines. As processing power has increased and switching technologies have matured, voice trading systems are evolving from digital time-division multiplexing (TDM) system architectures to Internet Protocol (IP) server-based architectures. IP technologies have transformed communications for traders by enabling converged, multimedia communications that include, in addition to traditional voice calls, presence-based communications such as: unified communications and messaging, instant messaging (IM), chat and audio/video conferencing. Some of modern trading turret models are optimised to integrate with PBX platform. By natively register on CUCM, for example, office users and turret users can have tighter collaborate and reduce total cost of ownership.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. A PBX, {{or private}} branch exchange, {{is a private}} {{telephone}} network used within an enterprise. The <b>PBX</b> <b>telephone</b> migration problem arises when an enterprise acquires a new PBX to replace an existing one. Phone numbers need to migrate from the old system to the new system over a time horizon. A penalty, assigned to the each pair of phones, is incurred if the pair is migrated in different time periods. The objective is to assign phones to time periods such that {{no more than a}} given number of phones is assigned to any period and the total penalty is minimized. We present a GRASP (greedy randomized adaptive search procedure) for this problem. 1...|$|R
