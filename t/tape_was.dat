5|$|The Skanska case {{occurred}} during Kirchner's presidency, during which {{several members of}} de Vido's ministry were accused of bribery in requests for tender for pipeline construction, based on a tape recording of Skanska employees discussing the bribes. The case was closed in 2011, when it was ruled that the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> not acceptable evidence {{and there was no}} overpricing. It was reopened in 2016 (with Cristina Kirchner out of the government), and the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> accepted as evidence.|$|E
5|$|On February 8, 2008, Van der Sloot {{met with}} Aruban {{investigators}} in the Netherlands and denied {{that what he}} said on the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> true, stating that he was {{under the influence of}} marijuana at the time. Van der Sloot indicated that he still maintains that he left Holloway behind on the beach.|$|E
5|$|The house stood empty {{until the}} Manhattan Project support {{personnel}} arrived in early 1945. The northeast room (the master bedroom) was designated the assembly room. Workbenches and tables were installed. To keep dust and sand out of instruments and tools, {{the windows were}} covered with plastic. <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> used to fasten {{the edges of the}} plastic and to seal doors and cracks in the walls.|$|E
50|$|Water-activated <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{used for}} closing and sealing boxes. Before closing {{corrugated}} fiberboard boxes, the <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> wetted or remoistened, activated by water. The <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> mostly 3 inches (7.5 cm) wide.|$|R
5000|$|Drafting <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> nearly {{identical}} to [...] "masking tape" [...] and [...] "painters tape", the main difference <b>is</b> width. Painters <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> the widest, averaging about 2½ inches(approx. 6.4 cm), while masking tape and drafting <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> {{less than half that}} width.|$|R
50|$|Like barbed wire, barbed <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{available}} as either straight wire or spiral concertina wire. Unlike barbed wire, which usually {{is available only}} as plain steel or galvanized, barbed <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> also manufactured in stainless steel, to prevent the points from rusting to bluntness. Typically the core wire is galvanized and the <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> stainless, although fully stainless barbed <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> used for expensive permanent installations or under water.|$|R
5|$|The script of The Stone <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> published, {{along with}} the scripts of The Road and The Year of the Sex Olympics in 1976 by Ferret Fantasy under the title The Year of the Sex Olympics and Other TV Plays.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E
5|$|Copies were {{leaked to}} the press via a Dutch news agency during the 1983 general {{election}} campaign. The U.S. State Department and British Government believed the tape to be propaganda produced by the KGB (as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and The Sunday Times). Although the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> produced anonymously, The Observer linked the tape with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the prime minister was personally aware of the tape and had discussed it with her cabinet.|$|E
50|$|Shin <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> a medical-type <b>tape,</b> used on shin pads or socks {{over the}} shin pads {{to help keep}} them in position. The {{pressure-sensitive}} <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> self-adhesive and water resistant, and is elastic {{so that there is}} no risk of cutting off circulation to the legs. Shin <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> available in a variety of colors, with clear tape being the most popular. Shin pad <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> discarded after use.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tapes</b> <b>are</b> an {{effective}} replacement for paints. <b>Tapes</b> <b>are</b> much faster {{and easier to}} install and replace, which dramatically reduces down times related to painting aisles and rails. Many floor <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> scuff and break resistant, unlike paints that will chip and scratch off. And most of all, <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> much easier to store and transport; they have much higher shelf lives than paints that, if stored improperly, won't last long.|$|R
50|$|Nowadays masking <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> {{widely used}} for {{decorative}} purposes. They are printed with different patterns, some Japanese <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> made of washi paper.|$|R
5|$|The {{members of}} 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in federal {{district}} court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album {{could result in}} a prosecution for obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech, the court ruled that the album was in fact obscene. However, an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.|$|E
5|$|During {{their brief}} existence, Wicked Lester {{performed}} in public twice. The first show {{took place at}} the Rivoli Theatre in South Fallsburg, New York on April 23, 1971. The second, in late summer 1971, was at an Atlantic City, New Jersey hotel hosting a B'nai B'rith Youth Organization event. Not long after that show, the band suffered a major setback when they had all of their musical gear stolen. After a chance meeting with Electric Lady Studios engineer Ron Johnsen, Wicked Lester was given the opportunity to record some demos in late 1971. Johnsen, who produced the demo tape, shopped it to a few labels, with no success. Eventually the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> screened by Epic Records, who purchased the masters and agreed to fund the recording of a full album. One of the conditions, however, was that Stephen Coronel be fired and replaced with a better guitarist.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{analysis}} of an audio tape {{recording of the}} shooting made by freelance reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski appeared to indicate, according to forensic expert Philip Van Praag, that thirteen shots were fired, even though Sirhan's gun held only eight rounds. Van Praag states that the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible. The presence of more than eight shots on the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> corroborated by forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena, California, forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen in Copenhagen, Denmark, and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. Some other acoustic experts, however, have stated that no more than eight shots were recorded on the audio tape.|$|E
5000|$|ATS/360 {{provided}} its own access {{methods and}} file formats. Offline [...] "format and print" [...] <b>tapes</b> could <b>be</b> printed using standard OS utilities as these <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> compatible with BSAM, although these <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> created using EXCP.|$|R
50|$|Medical <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{useful to}} both prevent and repair minor injuries. For example, <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{often used to}} fix flappers. Many climbers use tape to bind fingers or wrists to prevent {{recurring}} tendon problems. <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> also highly desirable for protecting hands on climbing routes that consist mostly of repeated hand jamming.|$|R
50|$|Although gaffer <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> used {{within the}} film/TV Industry {{as a strong}} cloth-backed {{adhesive}} tape, many other types of <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> also used, such as paper tape, pressure-sensitive tape (A.K.A. snot tape), electrical tape, J-LAR, and cloth <b>tape.</b> Gaffer <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> typically utilized by set lighting technicians under the supervision of, and not directly by, a gaffer.|$|R
25|$|Bass Communion's 2004 album Ghosts on Magnetic <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> {{inspired}} by EVP.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{test for the}} presence of PCP in Rodney King's body {{at the time of the}} arrest was negative. The incident was captured on a camcorder by local resident George Holliday from his apartment in the vicinity. The <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> roughly 12 minutes long. While the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> presented during trial, some clips of the incident were not released to the public.|$|E
25|$|These songs, however, {{were pulled}} from the album before the final master <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> compiled.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{a medium}} for {{magnetic}} recording, made of a thin, magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic film. It was developed in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording. Devices that record and play back audio and video using magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> <b>tape</b> recorders and video tape recorders. A device that stores computer data on magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> a <b>tape</b> drive (tape unit, streamer).|$|R
50|$|Hazard <b>Tape</b> - <b>is</b> used in {{locations}} {{containing a}} substantial danger. Examples include electrocution hazards or areas within {{which there is}} a risk of exposure to toxic chemicals. Hazard <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> available in different color combinations, each of which indicates certain classes of threat. For example, yellow-black <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> used to signal the presence of a physical hazard (e.g., a hole), while magenta-yellow denotes a radiation hazard. This type of barrier <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> commonly used in laboratories, production areas, and industrial zones.|$|R
5000|$|Gorilla <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> a {{brand of}} {{adhesive}} tape sold by Sharonville, Ohio based Gorilla Glue Inc. Introduced in late 2005, Gorilla <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> a reinforced form of duct <b>tape</b> and <b>was</b> featured in Popular Sciences [...] "Best of What's New 2006". [...] Gorilla <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> available in several sizes and colors, including camouflage, white and clear. In 2013, The Gorilla Glue Company launched an advertising campaign which brings the Gorilla mascot to life, as {{he comes to the}} aid of a hapless Do-it-Yourselfer.|$|R
25|$|In the 1973 film The Exorcist, {{a tape of}} noises {{from the}} possessed victim was {{discovered}} to contain a message when the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> played backwards. This scene might have inspired subsequent copycat musical effects.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, {{the song}} was {{originally}} written and recorded in E major, one semitone lower, then the entire master <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> sped up to place it in F major. Many live performances show the band performing the song in E.|$|E
25|$|Popularly {{known by}} the brand name Band-Aid, an {{adhesive}} bandage is a self-sticking taped and small dressing used for injuries not serious enough to require a full-size bandage. This easy-to-use dressing with adhesive <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> invented by Earle Dickson in 1921.|$|E
50|$|Precision {{diameter}} <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} measuring the true diameters of both round and out-of-round forms. Used in the metal working industry, these <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> precision tools made of 1095 clock spring steel.|$|R

50|$|Double-sided <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{created by}} {{applying}} a thin adhesive layer {{to each side}} of a carrier material. For example, double-sided tissue tape, an easy-to-rip double-sided <b>tape,</b> <b>is</b> created by applying adhesive to two sides of tissue paper, which is then wound with a siliconed paper to avoid it sticking to itself. Most adhesive <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> manufactured in log form, such as a large 1 to 3 meter wide roll, and then an adhesive <b>tape</b> converter <b>is</b> used to slit the rolls into the required widths.|$|R
25|$|Scantlin's {{big break}} in the music {{business}} came after a copy of his demo <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> delivered to Fred Durst. Durst contacted Scantlin, and after hearing that his band had broken up, decided to bring him to California to attempt to put a new band together.|$|E
25|$|Essentially a re-enactment {{of a radio}} performance, {{the three}} Goons were joined by John Cleese as {{announcer}} for a special shown on Thames Television. While the original video <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> wiped, an almost-complete copy of this broadcast is held by the British Film Institute.|$|E
25|$|A {{few hours}} before Mirza's {{scheduled}} execution a video <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> released on Electronic Media of Mirza's confession, in which he accused MQM of ordering him to perform the crime. The MQM chief Altaf Hussain denied having met with Saulat and {{said there was no}} evidence, but instead claimed a conspiracy against MQM.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} of Ultrium <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> going to be available with four types of cartridge, holding 10 GB, 30 GB, 50 GB, and 100 GB. Only the full length 100 GB <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> produced.|$|R
30|$|The mass {{contents}} of fiber of the insulation tube wounded by glass fiber filament and glass fiber <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> 70 – 75  % and almost 59  % respectively. The volume {{contents of}} fiber of the insulation tube wounded by glass fiber filament and glass fiber <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> almost 55  % and almost 39  %. Obviously, the mass content and volume content of fiber of the insulation tube wounded by glass fiber <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> lower.|$|R
