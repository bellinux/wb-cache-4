5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as paralogous genes, or {{are the result of}} divergence of the genes after a speciation event, where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as orthologous genes, and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the difference is minimal.|$|E
5|$|Because of the breeds {{that make}} up the Azteca, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> for their athleticism. They have been seen in {{competition}} in western riding events such as reining, cutting, team penning and roping, as well as English riding events such as dressage and other events such as polo and bullfighting. They are also used for pleasure riding.|$|E
5|$|During the Brooke era, Sarawak Malays were {{predominantly}} fishermen, leading to their villages being concentrated along river banks. However, {{with the advent}} of urban development, many Malays have migrated to seek employment in public and private sectors. Traditionally, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> for their silver and brass crafts, wood carvings, and textiles.|$|E
50|$|Although crempog is {{the term}} most {{commonly}} associated with Welsh pancakes <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>known</b> by different names around the country. Crempog was the term most often used in north Wales, while in parts of Carmarthenshire and Glamorgan <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>known</b> as Cramwythen (singular: cramoth). In other parts of Glamorgan <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>known</b> as ffrosen (plural: ffroes), while in Cardiganshire <b>they</b> <b>were</b> called poncagen (plural: poncagau). In some areas of both Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>known</b> as pancosen.|$|R

5|$|Seizures {{may also}} {{occur as a}} {{consequence}} of other health problems; if they occur right around a specific cause, such as a stroke, head injury, toxic ingestion or metabolic problem, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as acute symptomatic seizures and are in the broader classification of seizure-related disorders rather than epilepsy itself.|$|E
5|$|Sperm {{whales are}} not known for forging bonds with other species, but it was {{observed}} that a bottlenose dolphin with spinal deformity had been accepted into a pod of sperm whales. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> to swim alongside other cetaceans such as humpback, fin, minke, pilot, and orca whales on occasion.|$|E
5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> to rest and bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water.|$|E

5|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} twenty-eight Treehouse of Horror episodes, with one airing every year. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> for being more violent than an average Simpsons episode and contain several {{different}} trademarks, including the alien characters Kang and Kodos who {{have appeared in}} every episode. Quite often the segments will parody well-known movies, books, radio shows, and television shows. The Twilight Zone has been parodied quite often, and {{has served as the}} inspiration for numerous segments.|$|E
5|$|Boletus pinophilus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with pine (Pinus), fir (Abies) and spruce (Picea). It {{can therefore be}} located wherever those trees grow, particularly with Scots pine in Britain, preferring the poor, acidic, and sandy soils associated with coniferous forests. It appears to favour Pinus, while {{the form of the}} mushroom occurring in association with Abies and Picea has been labeled Boletus pinophilus var. fuscoruber. However, it is not confined to coniferous trees and may also be found fruiting in deciduous forests, such as under chestnut trees. Fruiting bodies can occur singly, or in small groups throughout the summer and autumn months, although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> to appear as early as April in Italy.|$|E
5|$|During the day, tammars {{stay close}} to scrub for shade and move out to more open {{grassland}} by nightfall. Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> to both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on them. When eating large leaves, tammars handle them with their forelimbs. This species spends more time chewing its food than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants.|$|E

5|$|Mithra: The Mithra are a race {{of hunters}} who live {{alongside}} the Tarutaru in Windurst. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> for their energy, curiosity, and their penchant for causing playful mischief. Due to a gender imbalance in their race males are a rarity, and so only female mithra leave the home, making females the only playable gender. Mithra possess high dexterity and agility, but lower HP and charisma. Mithra are cursed with envy.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as the jumper ant or jumping jack, is an ant of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known for their ability to jump several inches, and they also have a powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> to pollinate certain flowers.|$|E
5|$|Reflections in {{more complex}} scenarios, such as {{found on a}} network of cables, can result in very {{complicated}} and long lasting waveforms on the cable. Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home can result in an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ring waves as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> persist for far longer than the original pulse and their waveforms bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing high frequency components {{in the tens of}} MHz range.|$|E

5|$|Taiko {{groups in}} Australia began forming in the 1990s. The first group, called Ataru Taru Taiko, {{was formed in}} 1995 by Paulene Thomas, Harold Gent, and Kaomori Kamei. TaikOz was later formed by percussionist Ian Cleworth and Riley Lee, a former Ondekoza member, and has been {{performing}} in Australia since 1997. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> for their work in generating interest in performing taiko among Australian audiences, such as by developing a complete education program with both formal and informal classes, and have a strong fan base. Cleworth {{and other members of}} the group have developed several original pieces.|$|E
5|$|The Pomeranian (often {{known as}} a Pom or Pom Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in Germany and Poland in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from the larger Spitz type dogs, {{specifically}} the German Spitz. It has been determined by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale {{to be part of}} the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as the Zwergspitz ("Dwarf-Spitz").|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch at night, and {{the larvae}} swim {{to the water}} surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on zooplankton. This stage {{involves}} three moults and lasts for 15–35 days. After the third moult, the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult, and adopts a benthic lifestyle. The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild, and are poorly known, although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> {{to be capable of}} digging extensive burrows. It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20,000 survives to the benthic phase. When they reach a carapace length of , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives.|$|E

5|$|The purest form of Limousins have {{ancestors}} {{that can}} all be traced to Full French entries in the French Limousin Herd Book (known in France as Le livre généalogique). These Limousins are known by different names. In the USA and Canada <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> as Fullbloods, in Australia and New Zealand as French Pure, and in European countries such as Britain as Pure Bred (also purebred) or simply Limousin.|$|E
5|$|These {{monitors}} {{will rise}} {{up on their}} hind legs to check their surroundings, a behavior that has also been documented in Gould's monitors (V.gouldii). <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> to exhibit a warning posture, in which they carry their tails rolled up behind them. According to native belief, they will give a warning call if they see crocodiles. In general V.salvadorii avoids human contact, but its bite is capable of causing infection, like the Komodo dragon's. One fatality was reported from a bite in 1983 when a Papuan woman was bitten and later died from an infection.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>known</b> {{for their}} {{elongated}} record titles, usually inspired by B movies. They have released three EPs, How Am I Supposed to Kill You If You Have All the Guns?
