5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's <b>ticketing</b> system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their <b>ticketing</b> systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus <b>ticketing</b> system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E
