5|$|In March 2010, {{underwater}} searches {{were conducted}} by Aruban authorities after an American couple {{reported that they were}} snorkeling when they photographed what they <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> be human skeletal remains, possibly those of Holloway. Aruban authorities sent divers to investigate, but no remains were ever recovered.|$|E
5|$|Punk made {{a special}} {{appearance}} at the ROH show Unscripted II on February 11, 2006, when the original card had to be scrapped due to Low Ki leaving ROH the week prior. In addition, most of the ROH roster contracted to TNA were pulled from the show because of a snowstorm that TNA officials <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> prevent performers from reaching a pay-per-view scheduled the next day. In the main event, Punk teamed with Bryan Danielson to defeat Jimmy Rave and Adam Pearce in a tag team match.|$|E
5|$|The one-act opera genre {{had become}} {{increasingly}} popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno {{for the best}} such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> {{be made into a}} trilogy of one-act operas.|$|E

5|$|There was no {{need for}} the Mint to produce any pennies in 1933 because they was no {{commercial}} demand, and it possessed ample stocks from prior years in storage. There was a custom at that time for the King to place a set of coins of the current year under the foundation stone of important new buildings, and the Mint struck three 1933 pennies for this purpose, also one each for its own museum and for the British Museum, and at least two others. The result was a rarity that people <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> turn up in their pocket change, and that is probably the best-known British rare coin.|$|E
5|$|Patricia Jones {{never made}} it to her house that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police the next day and began calling people he <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> have seen his wife. He got a lead when he spoke to friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at a street corner in Independence, which he had done. The occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E
5|$|Work {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> be their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing respirators, several rescuers were overcome by the effects of firedamp. During {{the course of the}} day, 56 bodies were raised to the surface and, that evening, a new water supply, connected by three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) of pipes to a nearby reservoir, was installed in the Lancaster shaft.|$|E
50|$|The {{goal here}} is a passive attitude. Deep {{relaxation}} will not always occur, and distracting <b>thoughts</b> <b>might</b> come. When conscious of them, they are ignored and breathing exercise are sustained.|$|R
5000|$|In depression, exaggerated all-or-nothing {{thinking}} {{can form}} a self-reinforcing cycle: these <b>thoughts</b> <b>might</b> be called emotional amplifiers because, {{as they go}} around and around, they become more intense. Typical all-or-nothing thoughts: ...|$|R

25|$|Lacy {{graduated}} from Armstrong Technical High School in Washington, {{where he played}} football, baseball, and basketball.

60|$|But Little Tim said never a word. Whatever his <b>thoughts</b> <b>might</b> {{have been}} after that, he kept them to himself, and, imitating his Indian brother, {{maintained}} profound silence as he galloped {{between him and}} Brighteyes over the rolling prairie.|$|R
25|$|From 1916 to 1917, Goddard {{built and}} tested {{experimental}} ion thrusters, which he <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> {{be used for}} propulsion in the near-vacuum conditions of outer space. The small glass engines he built were tested at atmospheric pressure, where they generated a stream of ionized air.|$|E
25|$|Iraq {{disarmament}} crisis : Issue of Iraq's disarmament {{reached a}} crisis in 2002–2003, after demands of the complete end to Iraqi production and use {{of weapons of mass}} destruction and that Iraq comply with UN Resolutions requiring UN inspectors unfettered access to areas those inspectors <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> have weapons production facilities.|$|E
25|$|The first {{experimental}} antivirals {{were developed}} in the 1960s, mostly to deal with herpes viruses, and were found using traditional trial-and-error drug discovery methods. Researchers grew cultures of cells and infected them with the target virus. They then introduced into the cultures chemicals which they <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> inhibit viral activity, and observed whether the level of virus in the cultures rose or fell. Chemicals {{that seemed to have}} an effect were selected for closer study.|$|E
60|$|It did {{not occur}} to Honora that her <b>thoughts</b> <b>might</b> be more of the castle than of the rock: of the heaven he was to hold on his {{shoulders}} than of the Hercules she had chosen to hold it.|$|R
6000|$|I {{stood before}} {{him for a}} space, speculating what <b>thoughts</b> <b>might</b> fill the gaps between these broken words. I found his lethargy, and the dimly shaped mental attitudes his words indicated, abominable. I said abruptly, [...] "You have her letter?" ...|$|R
60|$|For {{thirty years}} before, {{it has been}} said, a very few earnest Christians among the {{fishermen}} of the fleet had been praying that some such <b>thoughts</b> <b>might</b> be put into the hearts of men who {{had the power to}} render help.|$|R
25|$|He {{recorded}} {{new insights}} {{in his later}} work on ethnic groups of the USSR. For example, he noted that while in most Russian villages the witches were male, Ukrainian villages had many more female witches, which he <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> be due to western European influence via Poland. He noted that the Slavonic people, from the steppes, worshipped stones, streams and hills, while the Finno-Ugrian people, from the forests, worshipped trees or groves.|$|E
25|$|The Army's {{response}} to McNamara's memo was {{to form a}} board organized like the earlier Rogers Board. Howze, who had served on the Rogers Board (and was named in McNamara's memo), was selected to chair the Tactical Mobility Requirements Board on 25 April. The actual directive establishing the board was not issued until 3 May, after the board had started working, and Howze was given wide authority to deal with any agencies (military or civilian) he <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> be necessary for the board to complete its evaluation.|$|E
25|$|Ian Chappell... made {{it clear}} more than once that he {{regarded}} the control of his side on the field as the concern solely of the umpires. Poor wretched men! I wonder what Ian <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> have happened if either Tom Brooks or Robin Bailhache had applied the full sanction of Law 46, and had banned either Lillee or Thomson on that emotion-charged Sunday afternoon. How many beer-cans might have bespattered the field, and angry spectators invaded the playing area? As it was the umpires contented themselves with friendly warnings afterwards described as 'unofficial'. In the circumstances {{it was hard to}} blame them.|$|E

40|$|Descartes famously {{argued that}} animals were mere machines, without thought or {{conscious}}ness. Few would now share this view. But if other animals have conscious lives, {{what are they}} like, how do they differ from ours, and how would we ever know anything about them? This lecture will address this question {{by looking at the}} kinds of <b>thoughts</b> we <b>might</b> share with animals, and looking at philosophical and empirical arguments for how our <b>thoughts</b> <b>might</b> differ from theirs...|$|R

25|$|Shane Warne {{continued}} {{after lunch}} {{by taking the}} wicket of Kevin Pietersen for 14. Andrew Flintoff emerged to form a vital partnership of 143 with Andrew Strauss, before to falling to Glenn McGrath for 72 an hour after tea. Strauss made his 2nd century of the series, before being dismissed by Shane Warne off an acrobatic catch by Simon Katich. The day ended with Geraint Jones and Ashley Giles at the crease, with England 319 for 7. Certain forecasts for London called for showers sometime during the weekend, which, it was <b>thought,</b> <b>might</b> wipe up to a day of action or more from the ledger.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} turmoil of Germany's troubled interwar years greatly affected the School's development. Its thinkers were particularly {{influenced by the}} failure of the communist revolution in Western Europe (precisely where Marx had predicted that a communist revolution would take place) and by the rise of Nazism in such an economically and technologically advanced nation as Germany. This led many of them to take up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> serve to clarify contemporary social conditions that Marx himself had never seen. Another key influence also came from the publication in the 1930s of Marx's Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts and The German Ideology, which showed the continuity with Hegelianism that underlay Marx's thought.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 the Association of Independent Navigation Authorities (AINA) {{published}} a report called Demonstrating {{the value of}} waterways, in which they outlined methods for assessing restoration projects, and their likely social and economic benefits. British Waterways produced {{a report in the}} following year, called Waterways 2025 – Our vision for the shape of the Waterways Network, which used many of the methods suggested by the AINA report to identify 18 restoration schemes which they <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> be completed before 2025, and which they would support. The Wendover Arm appeared in the list, but the report was abandoned two years later, after other groups claimed that not being included undermined their ability to raise funds.|$|E
