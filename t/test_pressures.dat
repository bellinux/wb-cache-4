40|$|The {{objective}} was to investigate sensor measurement uncertainty for intracerebral probes inserted during neurosurgery and remaining in situ during neurocritical care. This describes a prospective observational study of two sensor types and including performance of the complete sensor-bedside monitoring and readout system. Sensors from 16 patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) were obtained {{at the time of}} removal from the brain. When tested, 40 % of sensors achieved the manufacturer temperature specification of 0. 1 [*]°C. Pressure sensors calibration differed from the manufacturers at all <b>test</b> <b>pressures</b> in 8 / 20 sensors. The largest pressure measurement error was in the intraparenchymal triple sensor. Measurement uncertainty is not influenced by duration in situ. User experiences reveal problems with sensor 'handling', alarms and firmware.
