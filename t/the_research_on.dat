After Ripley 8 is cloned and her Queen embryo is extracted, Perez is uneasy with her enhanced physical and psychological abilities but allows her to live; Dr. Wren and Dr. Gediman continue their research on her. Perez hires Elgyn to abduct a number of humans in cryostasis as incubators for the cloned Aliens; he gives the Betty crew food and lodging, emphasizing that they cannot interfere with <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> the Auriga. When the Aliens board an escape craft, he sabotages them with a grenade. An Alien bites the back of Perez' head, exposing his brain.|$|E

The method of this study, <b>the</b> group <b>research</b> in physical education were drawn out from "Research Journal of Physical Education" (published by Japsnese Society of Physical Education) and their researches were classified and examined. Main findings were as follows: (1) Till about 1960, the studies on the group learning, learning by the small groups, were remarkable. Also, <b>the</b> <b>researches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> learning group in physical education, especialy concerning with the play group were started in this term. (2) Later, these researches were differentiated tnto "the <b>research</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> learning method", which were developed and used in the practice of school physical education, and <b>the</b> "positive <b>researches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mechanism of the learning group in physical education". (3) <b>The</b> positive <b>researches</b> were futher being specialized into the reesarches on "the play group" or "the learning group in physical education" and <b>the</b> <b>researches</b> <b>on</b> "the sports group". (4) As the methods, the experiments by model small group in <b>the</b> <b>researches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> play group, and a questionnire in <b>the</b> <b>researches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sports group have been chiefly used. (5) As the themes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> groups <b>research</b> in future, <b>the</b> following points may be indicated.

5|$|In 1921, Rollin Woodyatt {{reviewed}} <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> {{diet and}} diabetes. He reported that three water-soluble compounds, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone (known collectively as ketone bodies), were {{produced by the}} liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Russel Wilder, at the Mayo Clinic, built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced {{a high level of}} ketone bodies in the blood (ketonemia) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate. Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely. His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{his team}} at NIMH {{admitted}} {{a patient with}} depression who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought previous research regarding melatonin release at night {{may be able to}} help him. Rosenthal and his colleagues treated the patient with bright lights, which helped to successfully manage the depression. They conducted a formal follow-up study to confirm the success. The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. <b>The</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and in some ways controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions on the effect of light therapy and at what time of day the light should be administered.|$|E

They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Combining the {{advantages}} of hard-disk magnetic recording and magneto-optical recording, hybrid recording is regarded as promising candidate for extremely-high density recording technology beyond Tera bits/in 2. To obtain such high areal density, hybrid recording media are required to have high coercivity and large remanent magnetization at room temperature, the desired temperature dependence of coercivity and magnetization, as well as very short thermal response time. Currently, <b>the</b> <b>researches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hybrid recording media mainly involve the magnetic hard-disk polycrystalline recording media and the magneto-optical amorphous media. This report presents the latest progresses in <b>the</b> <b>researches</b> <b>on</b> these two kinds of media for hybrid recording. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{study of}} the Hungarian {{language}} {{is one of the}} main sources of <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> the ethnogenesis of the Hungarian people because a language shows the circumstances of its own development and its contacts with other idioms.

The study of loan words from other languages is instrumental in determining direct contacts between the ancient speakers of the Hungarian language and other peoples. Loan words also reflect changes in the way of life of the Magyars.|$|E

5|$|Agrilus planipennis, {{commonly}} known as the emerald ash borer, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much of <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France.

The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management.

5|$|Cell theory led {{biologists}} to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages {{of individual}} cells. Scientists in the rising field of cytology, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new staining methods, soon {{found that even}} single cells were far {{more complex than the}} homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. Robert Brown had described the nucleus in 1831, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: chromosomes, centrosomes mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 Walther Flemming described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not artifacts of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of <b>the</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> cell reproduction came together in August Weismann's theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between somatic cells and germ cells (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of meiosis), and adopted Hugo de Vries's theory of pangenes. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental embryology.|$|E
