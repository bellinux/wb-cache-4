5|$|Several {{villages of}} Christian Delawares lay between <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> on the Sandusky River and the Americans at Fort Pitt. The villages were {{administered}} by the Moravian missionaries David Zeisberger and John Heckewelder. Although pacifists, the missionaries favored the American cause and kept American officials at Fort Pitt informed about hostile British and Indian activity. In September 1781, to prevent further communication between the missionaries and the American military, hostile Wyandots and Delawares from Sandusky forcibly removed the missionaries and their converts to a new village (Captive Town) on the Sandusky River.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} a two-player mode that retains the single-player mechanics but {{is set in}} one of three specially designed stages and uses a vertically split screen to separate each player's view. Each player chooses one of the available charactersShadow, two metallic versions of him, and palette-swapped variants of each. <b>The</b> <b>combatants</b> attack each other and steal each other's rings until all but one are eliminated. Additionally, in single-player mode, a second player may take control of Shadow's sidekick character in some stages.|$|E

50|$|In the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, Congress {{clarified}} {{the command}} line to <b>the</b> <b>combatant</b> commanders and preserved civilian {{control of the}} military. The Act states that the operational chain of command runs from the President to the Secretary of Defense to <b>the</b> <b>Combatant</b> Commanders. <b>The</b> Act permits the President to direct that communications pass through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from the Secretary of Defense, and to <b>the</b> <b>Combatant</b> Commanders. This authority places the Chairman in the communications chain. Further, the Act gives the Secretary of Defense wide latitude to assign the Chairman oversight responsibilities for the activities of <b>the</b> <b>Combatant</b> Commanders.|$|R

5|$|The terrain {{complicated}} battle tactics {{for both}} sides, but the Russians and the Austrians, having {{arrived in the}} area first, were able to overcome many of its difficulties by strengthening a causeway between two small ponds. They had also devised a solution to Frederick's deadly modus operandi, the oblique order. Although Frederick's troops initially gained {{the upper hand in}} the battle, the sheer number of Allied troops gave the Russians and Austrians an advantage. By afternoon, when <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> were exhausted, fresh Austrian troops thrown into the fray secured the Allied victory.|$|E
5|$|Deceptive {{markings}} on helicopters further complicated matters for NATO pilots. Many of <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> painted their helicopters {{to look like}} those of organizations that the UN's Zagreb Flight Coordination Center had authorized to fly in restricted space. For example, {{the army of the}} Republika Srpska often painted a Red Cross logo on their helicopters, and Croatian helicopters were given markings similar to those of UN humanitarian aid helicopters. The questionable identity of these helicopters became particularly problematic after the Black Hawk Incident in Iraq, because NATO pilots became more reluctant to engage potential belligerents without clear identification. As a result of the rules of engagement and difficulties in aircraft identification, NATO forces proved unable to stop most unauthorized helicopter flights, resulting in a documented total of 5711 unauthorized flights during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Ermac fights {{alongside}} the Earthrealm heroes {{in the opening}} cinematic sequence of the 2006 compilation game , in which a battle royal commences among <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> at the Pyramid of Argus in the fictional realm of Edenia. He and Nightwolf are overpowered by Sheeva until Kenshi intervenes, and after Quan Chi attacks Kenshi, Ermac hurls Quan Chi off the pyramid but stomps on Kenshi before revealing himself as Shang Tsung in disguise. Midway created a computer-animated concept biography showing Ermac performing a kata routine over the soundtrack of a voiceover of his Deception biography, {{but he was not}} among the seventeen characters who received an official biography for Armageddon and he therefore played no part in the storyline.|$|E
50|$|In grappling, {{side control}} (often also called side mount, cross mount or {{sometimes}} scarfhold) is a dominant ground grappling position where <b>the</b> top <b>combatant</b> is lying perpendicularly over <b>the</b> face-up bottom <b>combatant</b> {{in such a}} way that the legs are free and he or she exerts no control over <b>the</b> <b>combatant</b> on <b>the</b> bottom. <b>The</b> top <b>combatant</b> is referred to as having side control, and is in a stable position, with <b>the</b> other <b>combatant</b> pinned beneath him or her. From there <b>the</b> top <b>combatant</b> can proceed with elbows, knees, various submissions, or transition into a mounted position. It is high priority for <b>the</b> bottom <b>combatant</b> to sweep <b>the</b> top <b>combatant</b> or otherwise escape the position, for instance by entangling the opponent's free legs and trying to obtain the half guard or guard.|$|R

5|$|However, on {{the morning}} of 16 October Newman spotted Loire on the horizon and {{immediately}} ordered his ships in pursuit. Loire was faster than Mermaid in the high winds but was unable to outrun Kangaroo, which directly engaged the far larger frigate in a distant artillery duel. The difference in weight of shot between <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> was greatly unbalanced, and Kangaroo eventually fell behind after suffering damage to her rigging. Loire too had been damaged, and by 06:45 the following morning Captain Segond realised he could not escape his pursuers and instead shortened sail, intending to engage Mermaid—by then the only pursuer still within reach.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, the {{retreating}} Patriot force held drumhead courts-martial of Loyalists on various charges (treason, desertion from Patriot militias, incitement of Indian rebellion). Passing through the Sunshine community {{in what is}} now Rutherford County, N.C., the retreat halted on the property of the Biggerstaff family. Aaron Biggerstaff, a Loyalist, had fought in the battle and been mortally wounded. His brother Benjamin was a Patriot and was being held as a prisoner-of-war on a British ship docked at Charleston, S.C. Their cousin John Moore was the Loyalist commander at the earlier Battle of Ramsour's Mill (modern Lincolnton, N.C.), in which many of <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> at Kings Mountain had participated on one side or the other.|$|E
5|$|On {{reaching}} the battlefield, the Yorkists found themselves heavily outnumbered. Part of their force under the Duke of Norfolk {{had yet to}} arrive. The Yorkist leader Lord Fauconberg turned the tables by ordering his archers {{to take advantage of}} the strong wind to outrange their enemies. The one-sided missile exchange, with Lancastrian arrows falling short of the Yorkist ranks, provoked the Lancastrians into abandoning their defensive positions. The ensuing hand-to-hand combat lasted hours, exhausting <b>the</b> <b>combatants.</b> The arrival of Norfolk's men reinvigorated the Yorkists and, encouraged by Edward, they routed their foes. Many Lancastrians were killed while fleeing; some trampled each other and others drowned in the rivers, which are said to have made them run red with blood for several days. Several who were taken as prisoners were executed.|$|E
50|$|Half guard, or {{alternatively}} half mount, is a ground grappling position where one combatant {{is lying on}} the other, with <b>the</b> bottom <b>combatant</b> having one leg entangled. Sometimes <b>the</b> bottom <b>combatant</b> {{is said to be}} in half guard, while <b>the</b> top <b>combatant</b> is in a half mount. In wrestling and catch wrestling half mount is called Turk ride. The half guard is the position that is in between a full guard and side control or full mount. <b>The</b> <b>combatant</b> on top will try to untangle the leg and obtain side control or mount, while <b>the</b> bottom <b>combatant</b> will try to transition into a full guard {{or alternatively}} attempt a sweep or submission. <b>The</b> <b>combatant</b> on top is however in a better position, and can strike or attempt submission holds, although not as well as in side control.|$|R

5|$|On the day decreed, Le Gris and Carrouges {{travelled}} through Paris to the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs in the city's Northern suburbs. The abbey's field {{had been}} converted from a jousting ground to a wooden arena especially for the combat, surrounded by banks for the spectators and a royal box. Attending the duel {{was not only the}} King and his uncles John, Duke of Berry, Philip the Bold and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon and his brother the Duke of Orléans, but thousands of ordinary Parisians, Normans and visiting French. Thousands of people had flooded into the city {{in the days before the}} combat to see the spectacle but all had been warned not to physically aid <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> on pain of death, nor call out during the fight on pain of losing a hand.|$|E
5|$|At the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Romanian woman, Marichka, who {{provides}} {{a room where}} Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd finds them in their room, and informs Theo and Kee that war has broken out between the British Army and the refugees, including the Fishes. Having learned {{that they have a}} bounty on their heads, Syd attempts to capture them, but Marichka and Theo fight him off and escape. Amidst the fighting, the Fishes capture Kee and the baby. Theo tracks them to an apartment under heavy fire where he confronts Luke, who is then killed by a tank shell, and escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> temporarily stop fighting; staring at the screaming baby, they allow the group to leave. Marichka leads Theo, Kee, and the baby to a boat in a sewer, and Theo rows away whilst Marichka stays behind.|$|E
5|$|Ernest had {{the support}} of the {{previous}} Elector, now Salentin IX of Isenburg-Grenzau, Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, and, probably most important, several thousand Spanish troops hired by the pope. While representatives from the Cathedral chapter, the seven imperial electors, the emperor, and the pope tried to resolve differences around the negotiating table, first in Frankfurt am Main, and then in Muhlhausen in Westphalia, the armies of both sides rampaged throughout the southern portion of the Electorate, called the Oberstift, plundering abbeys and convents, burning villages and small cities, and destroying crops, bridges, and roads. None of <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> were prepared to commit their troops in a fixed battle; it was far more lucrative, and safer as well, to use them in a show of force, intimidating the peasantry, besieging walled towns and small cities, and limiting trade and the sale of food-stuffs in the marketplaces.|$|E

5|$|In two {{panels of}} the famous Bayeux tapestry, {{standards}} are shown which appear to be raven banners. The Bayeux tapestry was commissioned by Bishop Odo, the half-brother of William the Conqueror; as one of <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> at the Battle of Hastings, Odo would have been familiar with the standards carried into the fight. In one of the panels, depicting a Norman cavalry charge against an English shield-wall, a charging Norman knight is depicted with a semicircular banner emblazoned with a standing black bird. In a second, depicting the deaths of Harold Godwinson's brothers, a triangular banner closely resembling that shown on Olaf Cuaran's coin lies broken on the ground. Scholars are divided as to whether these are simply relics of the Normans' Scandinavian heritage (or for that matter, the Scandinavian influence in Anglo-Saxon England) or whether they reflect an undocumented Norse presence in either the Norman or English army.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game's release, Warner Bros. Interactive and DC Entertainment {{launched}} a 10-week-long online marketing campaign called the Injustice Battle Arena. The web series, hosted by Taryn Southern, featured weekly match-ups between the playable {{cast in a}} tournament-style format. Each week, the arena was updated with different versus scenarios. Fans could vote for their favorite characters, and a video, depicting the winner of each round, would be released following each voting period. Videos detailing the skills and strengths of <b>the</b> <b>combatants,</b> including vox pop and celebrity interviews, were released alongside each new pair of challengers. Voters could redeem free rewards, ranging from Xbox Live avatar accessories to a downloadable character skin based on Green Arrow's appearance in the television series Arrow.

5|$|Schmitt {{arrived at}} dusk, {{and the action}} {{continued}} well after dark; in mid-November night falls at close to 17:00 in the upper Danube climes. Despite the darkness, Schmitt descended out of the defiles and deployed his troops to assail Dupont's flank. As his Russians entered the fray, they came between a battalion of French and another of Russians. With the additional force, the French were overwhelmed, {{but most of the}} shooting subsided when <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> could not tell apart friend from foe in the dark. Under the cover of darkness, aided by a waning moon, Mortier used the French flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank. The French and Russians continued to skirmish fitfully into the night as sentries encountered one another in the dark. Portions of Gazan's force provided any necessary rear guard action, and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the Danube, while they maintained possession of only Spitz and Weissenkirchen on the north bank.|$|E

50|$|The mount, or mounted position, is a {{dominant}} ground grappling position, where one <b>combatant</b> sits on <b>the</b> other <b>combatants</b> torso with <b>the</b> face pointing towards the opponent's head. This is very favourable for <b>the</b> top <b>combatant</b> in several ways. <b>The</b> top <b>combatant</b> can generate considerable momentum for strikes such as punches or elbows {{to the head}} of the opponent, while <b>the</b> bottom <b>combatant</b> is restricted by the ground and by <b>the</b> <b>combatant</b> on top. Another advantage are various chokeholds and joint locks which can be applied from the top, while such holds are not feasible from the bottom. The top priority for <b>the</b> bottom <b>combatant</b> is to sweep the opponent or transition into a better position such as the guard.|$|R

5|$|The Battle of the Chesapeake, {{also known}} as the Battle of the Virginia Capes or simply the Battle of the Capes, was a crucial naval battle in the American Revolutionary War that took place near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on 5 September 1781. <b>The</b> <b>combatants</b> were a British fleet led by Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Graves and a French fleet led by Rear Admiral Francois Joseph Paul, the Comte de Grasse. The battle was {{strategically}} decisive, in that it prevented the Royal Navy from reinforcing or evacuating the forces of Lieutenant General Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia. The French were able to achieve control of the sea lanes against the British, allowing them to provide the Franco-American army with siege artillery and French reinforcements—all of which proved decisive in the Siege of Yorktown, effectively securing independence for the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E
5|$|Wilson had a combative {{streak and}} {{sometimes}} initiated fights with opposing players and fans. On June 22, 1928, a near-riot {{broke out in}} the ninth inning at Wrigley Field against the St. Louis Cardinals when Wilson jumped into the box seats to attack a heckling fan. An estimated 5,000 spectators swarmed the field before police could separate <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> and restore order. The fan sued Wilson for $20,000, but a jury ruled in his favor. The following year he took offense at a remark by Cincinnati Reds pitcher Ray Kolp, and – upon reaching first base after hitting a single – he charged into the Reds dugout, punching Kolp several times before they could be separated. Later that evening at the train station, Wilson exchanged words and blows with Cincinnati player Pete Donohue. In late 1929 he signed a contract to fight Art Shires of the Chicago White Sox in a boxing match, but reneged after Cubs president William Veeck, Sr. enlisted Hack's wife Virginia to dissuade him, and then Shires lost a fight to George Trafton of the Chicago Bears. There was nothing to gain, Wilson said, by fighting a defeated boxer.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations that <b>the</b> <b>combatants</b> inflict {{upon each}} other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E
50|$|The cattle catch (also {{referred}} to as reverse crucifix, iron cross or stocks) is a hyperflexing neck crank involving trapping the opponent's hands and forcing the head towards his or her chest. The technique is performed with the opponent lying {{on his or her}} back, and <b>the</b> <b>combatant</b> performing <b>the</b> neck crank perpendicularly face-down in a side mount position above the head of the opponent, with the opponent's head resting towards his armpit. <b>The</b> <b>combatant</b> traps one arm using the legs, and the other using the arms.
