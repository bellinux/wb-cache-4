5|$|Dan Albone {{constructed}} the first commercially successful gasoline-powered {{general purpose tractor}} in 1901, and the 1923 International Harvester Farmall tractor marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters (combines), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture. These inventions allowed farming tasks {{to be done with}} a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms <b>to</b> <b>output</b> much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.|$|E

5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case a DVI-D monitor {{would have the same}} level of basic interoperability unless there are content protection issues with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI, instead of RGB. An HDMI source such as a Blu-ray player may demand HDCP-compliance of the display, and refuse <b>to</b> <b>output</b> HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication {{is that there is a}} small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with HDMI inputs but not HDCP-compliant.|$|E
5|$|The main CPU of the Sega CD is a 12.5MHz 16-bit Motorola 68000 processor, {{which runs}} 5MHz {{faster than the}} Genesis processor. It {{contains}} 1 Mbit of boot ROM, allocated for the CD game BIOS, CD player software, and compatibility with CD+G discs. 6 Mbit of RAM are allocated to data for programs, pictures, and sounds; 512 Kbit to PCM waveform memory; 128 Kbit to CD-ROM data cache memory; and an additional 64 Kbit are allocated as the backup memory. Additional backup memory {{in the form of}} a 1 Mbit Backup RAM Cartridge was also available as a separate purchase, released near the end of the system's life. Audio is able to be supplied through the Ricoh RF5C164, and two RCA pin jacks allow the Sega CD <b>to</b> <b>output</b> stereophonic sound separate from the Genesis. Combining stereo sound from a Genesis to either version of the Sega CD requires a cable between the Genesis's headphone jack and an input jack on the back of the CD unit. This is not required for the second model of the Genesis.|$|E

25|$|DJ {{software}} requires specialized hardware {{in addition}} to a computer to fully take advantage of its features. The consumer grade, regular sound card integrated into most computer motherboards can only output two channels (one stereo pair). However, DJs need to be able <b>to</b> <b>output</b> at least four channels (two stereo pairs, thus Left and Right for input 1 and Left and Right for input 2), either unmixed signals to send to a DJ mixer or a main output plus a headphone output. Additionally, DJ sound cards output higher quality signals than the sound cards built into consumer-grade computer motherboards.|$|E
