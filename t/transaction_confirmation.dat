However, {{due to the}} delay of the <b>transaction</b> <b>confirmation</b> in Bitcoin, it is not used for payments that rely on quick <b>transaction</b> <b>confirmation.</b> We present a concept that addresses this drawback of Bitcoin and allows it {{to be used for}} fast transactions. We evaluate the performance of the concept using double-spending attacks and show that, employing our concept, the success of such attacks diminishes to less than 0. 09 %. Moreover, we present a real world application: We modified a snack vending machine to accept Bitcoin payments and make use of fast transaction confirmations. I...|$|E

The trade-off between <b>transaction</b> <b>confirmation</b> throughput and centralization of hash power do not allow Bitcoin to perform at the same level as modern payment systems. Block Advertisement Protocol is proposed as a step to resolve this issue. The protocol allows block mining and block relaying to happen in parallel. The protocol dictates a miner to advertise the block it is going to mine allowing other miners to collect all the transactions in advance.

In this {{paper we propose a}} new system, built on the Bitcoin blockchain, which enables strong consistency. Our system, PeerCensus, acts as a certification authority, manages peer identities in a peer-to-peer network, and ultimately enhances Bitcoin and similar systems with strong consistency. Our extensive analysis shows that PeerCensus is in a secure state with high probability. We also show how Discoin, a Bitcoin variant that decouples block creation and <b>transaction</b> <b>confirmation,</b> can be built on top of PeerCensus, enabling real-time payments.

40|$|Abstract—With {{rapid growth}} of mobile devices and the {{emergency}} of mobile cloud services, it is a trend to use mobile devices for mobile-centric applications, and expand the mobile capabilities and provide needed security by mobile cloud services. However, due to the mobility of the device and the semitrust of the mobile cloud, how to build trust in the mobile applications is a big concern. In this paper, we propose a dual-root trust online transaction model that provides a dualroot trust model including both the user’s mobile device and a delegation mobile cloud. We design a dual-root trust protocol by leveraging a modified CP-ABE cryptography and the trust execution environment embedded in a mobile device to provide device-specific <b>transaction</b> <b>confirmations</b> for online <b>transactions</b> initiated by the mobile user. The performance evaluation of the protocol demonstrates {{that it is a}} lightweight scheme for mobile devices since most cryptographic functions are delegated from users to the mobile cloud.

40|$|In recent years, {{the desire}} for {{financial}} privacy and anonymity spurred the growth of electronic cash and cryptocurrencies. The introduction of decentralized cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, accelerated their adoption in society. Since digital information is easier to reproduce, digital currencies are vulnerable to be spent more than once – {{this is called a}} double-spending attack. In order to prevent double-spending, Bitcoin records transactions in a tamper-resilient shared ledger called the blockchain. However, the time required to generate new blocks in the blockchain causes a delay in the <b>transaction</b> <b>confirmation.</b> This delay, typically around one hour in Bitcoin, is impractical for real world trade and limits the wide-spread use of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. In this thesis, we propose a solution to prevent double-spending attacks and thus enable fast transaction confirmations using the security guarantees of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). We achieve this by enforcing sign-once semantics that prevent the payer from reusing designated signing keys to sign more than one transaction. We also provide a way for the payee to verify whether a specific signing key is subject to sign-once semantics. The payee, however still receives the funds later, once the transaction is verified similarly to existing credit card payments. In this way, our solution reduces <b>transaction</b> <b>confirmation</b> times of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and is also compatible with existing deployments since it does not require any modifications to the base protocol, peers, or miners. We designed and implemented a proof-of-concept of our solution using Intel SGX technology and integrated it with Copay, a popular Bitcoin wallet from BitPay. This thesis also presents the security evaluation of our system along with other possible extensions and enhancements...|$|E
40|$|Current {{phishing}} attacks focus {{primarily on}} stealing user credentials such as passwords. In response, web sites are deploying stronger authentication and back-end analytics systems that {{make it harder for}} phishers to extract value from stolen passwords. As defenses against traditional phishing improve, we expect to see huge growth in the use of a different type of malware called a Transaction Generator (TG). Instead of relying on stolen credentials, a TG simply waits for the user to log in to his account and then issues transactions on behalf of the user. Since strong authentication is ineffective against TGs, mitigation must focus on transaction integrity. We discuss rootkit-like methods that allow TGs to hide their tracks, and explore a number of mitigation techniques, including <b>transaction</b> <b>confirmation.</b> These results suggest that recent identity systems such as CardSpace and OpenID must also address transaction integrity. ...|$|E
40|$|Consensus, {{or state}} machine {{replication}} is a foundational building block of distributed systems and modern cryptography. Consensus in the classical, "permissioned" setting {{has been extensively}} studied in the 30 years of distributed systems literature. Recent developments in Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies popularized {{a new form of}} consensus in a "permissionless" setting, where anyone can join and leave dynamically, and there is no a-priori knowledge of the number of consensus nodes. So far, however, all known permissionless consensus protocols assume network synchrony, i. e., the protocol must know an upper bound of the network 2 ̆ 7 s delay, and transactions confirm slower than this a-priori upper bound. We initiate the study of the feasibilities and infeasibilities of achieving responsiveness in permissionless consensus. In a responsive protocol, the <b>transaction</b> <b>confirmation</b> time depends only on the actual network delay, but not on any a-priori known upper bound such as a synchronous round. Classical protocols in the partial synchronous and asynchronous models naturally achieve responsiveness, since the protocol does not even know any delay upper bound. Unfortunately, we show that in the permissionless setting, consensus is impossible in the asynchronous or partially synchronous models. On the positive side, we construct a protocol called Hybrid Consensus by combining classical-style and blockchain-style consensus. Hybrid Consensus shows that responsiveness is nonetheless possible to achieve in permissionless consensus (assuming proof-of-work) when 1) the protocol knows an upper bound on the network delay; 2) we allow a non-responsive warmup period after which <b>transaction</b> <b>confirmation</b> can become responsive; 3) honesty has some stickiness, i. e., it takes a short while for an adversary to corrupt a node or put it to sleep; and 4) less than 1 / 3 of the nodes are corrupt. We show that all these conditions are in fact necessary - if only one of them is violated, responsiveness would have been impossible. Our work makes a step forward in our understanding of the permissionless model and its differences and relations to classical consensus...|$|E
40|$|Password {{collection}} by keyloggers {{and related}} malware is increasing {{at an alarming}} rate. We investigate client-only defenses and methods that require server-side assistance. Password hashing and password injection, in which passwords are isolated from spyware, provide protection against phishing, commonpassword attacks, and spyware on the client platform. To protect against network sniffing and dictionary attacks, we suggest an appropriate combination of password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) and SSL. As further defense against pharming, cookie sniffing, and session hijacking, we propose a form of <b>transaction</b> <b>confirmation</b> over an authenticated channel. Our implemented and freely distributed client-side system providing all of these mechanisms consists of two components: a browser extension that runs in an untrusted environment, and an authentication agent that runs {{in an environment that}} is protected from spyware. Using a virtual machine monitor, the trusted and untrusted components can both run on the same physical machine. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{decentralized}} {{payment system}} is not secure if transactions are transferred directly between clients. In such a situation {{it is not possible}} to prevent a client from redeeming some coins twice in separate transactions that means a double-spending attack. Bitcoin uses a simple method to preventing this attack i. e. all transactions are published in a unique log (blockchain). This approach requires a global consensus on the blockchain that because of significant latency for <b>transaction</b> <b>confirmation</b> is vulnerable against double-spending. The solution is to accelerate confirmations. In this paper, we try to introduce an alternative for PoW because of all its major and significant problems that lead to collapsing decentralization of the Bitcoin, while a full decentralized payment system is the main goal of Bitcoin idea. As the network is growing and becoming larger day-today, Bitcoin is approaching this risk. The method we introduce is based on a distributed voting process: RDV: Register, Deposit, Vote...|$|E
