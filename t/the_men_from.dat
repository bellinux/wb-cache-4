5|$|On November 1, 1780, Washington issued orders {{approved}} by Congress that specified {{plans for the}} comprehensive reorganization of the Continental Army effective January 1, 1781.

The much-diminished unit comprised only 2 officers and 50 enlisted men in late December 1780.

Relocation of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> their remote post at Fort Pitt to their new assignments, however, was not completed until November 1781, at least in part because their officers were not present to supervise the process.|$|E

5|$|Unknown to the brigade, {{units of}} the German 1st Parachute Division had parachuted onto Catania {{airfield}} to reinforce the Italians guarding the bridge and quickly moved to regain the crossing.

5|$|A second {{senior officer}} {{was killed in}} action, when Brigadier-General Arthur Lowe, {{commanding}} the divisional artillery, was killed near Ypres on 24 November. In late December 1917, a new commanding officer, Major-General Neill Malcolm {{was appointed to the}} 66th Division. Malcolm was a decorated veteran of several colonial wars, who had served in staff posts since being wounded in the Second Boer War and had most recently served as {{chief of staff of the}} Fifth Army. The division was reorganised over the winter, with the brigade machine-gun companies being consolidated into a battalion and a pioneer battalion, the 1/5th Border Regiment joining the division. The most substantial change was the loss of three battalions, the 3/5th Lancashire Fusiliers and 2/8th and 2/10th Manchester Regiment, one from each brigade. This was a change made in all British divisions, to bring the remaining battalions in France up to strength and to increase the ratio of artillery to infantry. At this point, there was a general exchange of men between the 42nd and 66th Divisions; the core of the 1/6th Lancashire Fusiliers, 1/4th East Lancashires, and 1/9th Manchesters were transferred to the 66th Division, where they amalgamated with their second-line counterparts, while the 42nd Division received <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> the disbanded battalions in the 66th Division.

5|$|After docking in Kiel, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> Asar-i Tevfik were {{transferred}} to İzmir, but with no funds to buy coal, the men were stranded in Germany. Germaniawerft stripped down Asar-i Tevfik, but then halted work to await the first Ottoman payment. By mid-1901, the men had accumulated significant debt and the Ottoman government had {{made no effort to}} return them or pay the installments for the modernization program. Even Kaiser Wilhelm II became involved in an attempt to press the Ottoman government to settle the debts incurred by the sailors. Instead, the Ottomans demanded that Krupp, the owner of the Germaniawerft shipyard, make an advance of 6,000lira so that İzmir could be prepared for the voyage back to Constantinople. The Ottomans were at the time negotiating for a large armament contract with Krupp for the Army, and used this as leverage; by late 1901, Krupp conceded, rather than risk the lucrative contract. The debts in Kiel were paid and İzmir finally departed for home.|$|E
5|$|At 8:00pm the Japanese {{sent two}} Type 95 tanks with bright {{headlights}} into the plantation. <b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> the 2/10th tried to disable them with sticky bombs, {{but due to}} the humid conditions the bombs failed {{to adhere to the}} Japanese armour. In the fighting that followed over the course of two and a half hours, the Australians suffered heavy casualties. Receiving indirect fire support from the 2/5th Field Regiment's 25 pounder guns situated near Gili Gili, they repelled four frontal attacks. However, by midnight the Japanese were inside the Australian position and in the confusion the 2/10th withdrew in some disorder to a number of scattered positions on {{the west bank of the}} Gama, which they reached by about 2:00am on 28 August. A further assault, however, by tank-mounted infantry forced them back further, moving back through the 61st and 25th Infantry Battalions towards No. 3 Airstrip, which was still under construction, south of Kilarbo. During the brief engagement around KB Mission, they had lost 43 men killed and another 26 wounded.|$|E

Following their capture, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> the 2/4th in Singapore were concentrated in Changi prison, before being split up and sent to various prison camps around the Pacific, including Borneo, Burma, Thailand, Java, Sumatra, Japan and Formosa. There they were used as slave labour on the Burma–Thai Railway, in coal mines and on wharves, during which they were subjected to harsh treatment, starvation, disease and extreme brutality, which took a heavy toll. Many soldiers from the 2/4th were also killed while being taken to Japan, when the ships were sunk by Allied submarines.|$|E
5|$|Gibson's Brigade {{continued}} south, waking the 37th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry. This unit fled in all directions, and Gibson's men did {{not need}} to shoot. This left the 36th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, between Gibson's Brigade and General Johnson's headquarters at the McNeill house. The 36th offered the best resistance Gibson had faced so far, but the surprised Confederates were forced to retreat toward the McNeill farm. Near the McNeill house <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> the Confederate Baltimore Battery attempted to fire canister from their two guns, but the unit and guns were captured by the 8th Ohio Cavalry before they could be fired.

5|$|The first glider {{casualties}} {{had occurred}} on take off, when two aircraft towing Waco gliders crashed. While on route, {{one of the}} gliders was released early by its towing aircraft, and crashed into the sea. When they did arrive over Sicily, {{the element of surprise}} was gone, and four gliders were shot down by the coastal anti-aircraft batteries. By the time the gliders arrived at their landing zones, two hours had lapsed since the parachute landings had started. One glider pilot later commented that they did not need the pathfinders, as the tracer and lights from explosions were brighter than any of the landing markers. Of the surviving glider force, only four gliders managed to land relatively unscathed, all the others being caught by the Fallschirmjäger machine gun fire and destroyed on their approach. The four intact gliders had been carrying three of the anti-tank guns, which were now included in the bridge's defences. Including <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>from</b> the gliders, the 1st Parachute Brigade had 295men at the bridge. Shortage of manpower was not their only problem; their only support weapons were the anti-tank guns, two 3-inch mortars and a Vickers machine gun.|$|E
5|$|The second assault proved no more successful. The red-coated English and the blue-coated Dutch {{advanced}} {{side by side}} {{in perfect}} order for a second attempt.

Again the Allies left many dead and wounded at the enemy palisade including Marshal Count von Limburg Styrum who had led the second assault. With broken ranks, and in confusion, the attacking troops fell once more back down the hill. With the Allies repulsed for a second time the exultant Bavarian grenadiers, with bayonets fixed, poured over their breastworks to pursue the attackers and drive them to defeat. But English guardsmen, aided by Lumley's dismounted cavalrymen, prevented a total rout, compelling the Bavarians back behind their defences.|$|E
