The general algorithm is to construct an evaluating function to evaluate the features. As feature set, information gain, cross entropy, mutual information, and odds ratio are usually used.The classifier and pattern analysis methods of <b>text</b> <b>data</b> <b>mining</b> {{are very similar to}} traditional data mining techniques.

50|$|Text mining, also {{referred}} to as <b>text</b> <b>data</b> <b>mining,</b> roughly equivalent to text analytics, is the process of deriving high-quality information from text. High-quality information is typically derived through the devising of patterns and trends through means such as statistical pattern learning. Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text (usually parsing, along with the addition of some derived linguistic features and the removal of others, and subsequent insertion into a database), deriving patterns within the structured data, and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. 'High quality' in text mining usually refers to some combination of relevance, novelty, and interestingness. Typical text mining tasks include text categorization, text clustering, concept/entity extraction, production of granular taxonomies, sentiment analysis, document summarization, and entity relation modeling (i.e., learning relations between named entities).|$|E

In this study, we discuss text mining as a young interdisciplinary field in the intersection of the related areas such as information access- otherwise known as information retrieval, computational linguistics, data mining, statistics and natural language processing.

This case study uses <b>text</b> <b>data</b> <b>mining</b> techniques to analyse 12 years of data from dam pump station maintenance logs stored as free text in a spreadsheet application. The goal was to classify the data as scheduled maintenance or unscheduled repair jobs. Data preparation steps required to transform the data into a format appropriate for <b>text</b> <b>data</b> <b>mining</b> are discussed. The data is then mined by calculating term weights to which clustering techniques are applied. Clustering identified some groups that contained relatively homogeneous types of jobs.
