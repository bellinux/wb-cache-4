5|$|No {{significant}} difference appears in treatment success rates between linezolid, glycopeptides, or appropriate beta-lactam antibiotics {{in the treatment}} of pneumonia. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the causative organism, or when MRSA infection is suspected based on <b>the</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>presentation.</b> The guidelines of the British Thoracic Society do not recommend it as first-line treatment, but rather as an alternative to vancomycin. Linezolid is also an acceptable second-line treatment for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin resistance is present.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Amebic liver abscess is a {{tropical}} disease {{with a wide}} spectrum of <b>clinical</b> <b>presentations.</b> Given <b>the</b> often nonspecific nature of the complaints related to amebic abscess, a retrospective review of patients with confirmed disease to recognize the most common patterns of presentation is useful. Here, we study <b>the</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>presentations</b> of 62 Thai patients with amebic liver abscess. We also compare <b>the</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>presentations</b> of Anti HIV seronegative and Anti HIV seropositive patients. Methods A retrospective case review was carried out for 62 Thai patients who had been diagnosed with amebic liver abscess. Clinical information was collected, including symptoms and signs, location and number of abscesses. The Anti HIV serology laboratory investigation was also reviewed. Results According to our study, <b>the</b> common <b>clinical</b> symptoms and signs are abdominal pain (85. 5 %), fever and chills (74. 2 %), and abdominal tenderness (69. 4 %). The location of the abscess was predominantly in the right lobe (74. 2 %), and most of patients had a single abscess (77. 4 %). Similar trends in <b>clinical</b> <b>presentations</b> were observed in both Anti HIV seropositive and Anti HIV seronegative subjects. Conclusions In conclusion, <b>the</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>presentations</b> of our amebic liver abscess patients were similar to those in previous reports. A similarity to those in the pyogenic liver abscess patients can be observed. Nevertheless, we could not detect important significant differences in <b>the</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>presentations</b> between Anti HIV seropositive and Anti HIV seronegative groups of patients. </p...|$|R

5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on <b>the</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>presentation</b> of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of benzodiazepine overdose may be difficult, but is usually made based on <b>the</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>presentation</b> {{of the patient}} along {{with a history of}} overdose. Obtaining a laboratory test for benzodiazepine blood concentrations can be useful in patients presenting with CNS depression or coma of unknown origin. Techniques available to measure blood concentrations include thin layer chromatography, gas liquid chromatography with or without a mass spectrometer, and radioimmunoassay. Blood benzodiazepine concentrations, however, {{do not appear to be}} related to any toxicological effect or predictive of clinical outcome. Blood concentrations are, therefore, used mainly to confirm the diagnosis rather than being useful for the clinical management of the patient.|$|E

By contrast patients with HPV+ cancer are younger (4th–6th decades), male (ratio 8:1) with no or only a minimum history of smoking, generally Caucasian, reached higher education levels, are married, and have higher income. The risk factors for HPV-OPC and HPV+OPC tend to be independent, {{with the exception of}} smoking which has an adverse effect on both. The presenting features are also different between HPV+ and HPV- OPC. HPV+ tumours have smaller primary lesions (less than 4nbsp&cm) but more advanced nodal disease resulting in higher TNM staging.

25|$|Cephalic tetanus is {{the rarest}} {{form of the}} disease (0.9–3% of cases) and is limited to muscles and nerves in the head. It usually occurs after trauma to the head area, {{including}} skull fracture, laceration, eye injury, dental extraction, and otitis media, {{but it has been}} observed from injuries {{to other parts of the}} body. Paralysis of the facial nerve is most frequently implicated, which may cause lockjaw, facial palsy, or ptosis, but other cranial nerves can also be affected. Cephalic tetanus may progress to a more generalized form of the disease. Due to its rarity, clinicians may be unfamiliar with <b>the</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>presentation</b> and may not suspect tetanus as the illness. Treatment can be complicated as symptoms may be concurrent with the initial injury that caused the infection. Cephalic tetanus is more likely than other forms of tetanus to be fatal, with the progression to generalized tetanus carrying a 15–30% case fatality rate.|$|E
500|$|Conditions of {{the human}} {{integumentary}} system constitute {{a broad spectrum of}} diseases, also known as dermatoses, as well as many nonpathologic states (like, in certain circumstances, melanonychia and racquet nails). [...] While {{only a small number of}} skin diseases account for most visits to the physician, thousands of skin conditions have been described. [...] Classification of these conditions often presents many nosological challenges, since underlying etiologies and pathogenetics are often not known. [...] Therefore, most current textbooks present a classification based on location (for example, conditions of the mucous membrane), morphology (chronic blistering conditions), etiology (skin conditions resulting from physical factors), and so on. [...] Clinically, the diagnosis of any particular skin condition is made by gathering pertinent information regarding the presenting skin lesion(s), including the location (such as arms, head, legs), symptoms (pruritus, pain), duration (acute or chronic), arrangement (solitary, generalized, annular, linear), morphology (macules, papules, vesicles), and color (red, blue, brown, black, white, yellow). [...] Diagnosis of many conditions often also requires a skin biopsy which yields histologic information that can be correlated with <b>the</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>presentation</b> and any laboratory data.|$|E
