30|$|Eyewitness {{confidence}} is frequently {{used to determine}} the accuracy of eyewitness memory. However, metamemory judgments of confidence can be assessed at numerous times and how well these judgments predict eyewitness accuracy is likely to vary. In the legal system, the focus has been on eyewitness confidence collected {{at the time of the}} identification test (i.e. postdictive confidence) because what happens at this stage is typically better documented. Under unbiased <b>testing</b> <b>conditions,</b> eyewitnesses can accurately assess the strength of their memories at test, with high confidence indicative of high accuracy. These unbiased <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> include using a double-blind procedure, showing a fair lineup, and collecting confidence immediately after the initial identification (Wixted & Wells, 2017). In addition, semi-contaminated <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> also produce a reliable confidence-accuracy relationship, although the utility of a high confidence identification is still better in unbiased than biased <b>testing</b> <b>conditions</b> (Mickes, Clark, & Gronlund, 2017; Wixted & Wells, 2017).|$|R

25|$|The {{efficiency}} of the solar cells used in a photovoltaic system, in combination with latitude and climate, determines the annual energy output of the system. For example, a solar panel with 20% efficiency and an area of 1m2 will produce 200W at Standard <b>Test</b> <b>Conditions,</b> but it can produce more {{when the sun is}} high in the sky and will produce less in cloudy conditions and when the sun is low in the sky. In central Colorado, which receives annual insolation of 5.5kWh/m2/day, such a panel can be expected to produce 440kWh of energy per year. However, in Michigan, which receives only 3.8kWh/m2/day, annual energy yield will drop to 280kWh for the same panel. At more northerly European latitudes, yields are significantly lower: 175kWh annual energy yield in southern England.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} better {{determine}} whether a fuel/air vapor explosion in the CWT would generate sufficient pressure to break apart the fuel tank and lead {{to the destruction of}} the airplane, tests were conducted in July and August 1997, using a retired Air France 747 at Bruntingthorpe Airfield, England. These tests simulated a fuel/air explosion in the CWT by igniting a propane/air mixture; this resulted in the failure of the tank structure due to overpressure. While the NTSB acknowledged that the <b>test</b> <b>conditions</b> at Bruntingthorpe were not fully comparable to the conditions that existed on TWA 800 {{at the time of the}} accident, previous fuel explosions in the CWTs of commercial airliners such as Avianca Flight 203 and Philippine Airlines Flight 143 confirmed that a CWT explosion could break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of an airplane.|$|E
500|$|A typical {{test setup}} with a {{waveguide}} slotted line {{is shown in}} figure 2. [...] Referring to this figure, power from a test equipment source (not shown) [...] enters the apparatus through the co-axial cable on the left and is converted to waveguide format by means of a launcher (1). [...] This is followed by a section of waveguide (2) providing a transition to a smaller size of guide. [...] An important component in the setup is the isolator (3) which prevents power being reflected back into the source. [...] Depending on the <b>test</b> <b>conditions,</b> such reflections can be large and a high-power source may be damaged by the returning wave. [...] The power entering the slotted line is controlled by a rotary variable attenuator (4). [...] This is followed by the slotted line itself (5) above which is the probe mounted on a movable carriage. [...] The carriage also carries the probe adjustements: (6) is the probe depth adjustment, (7) is a length of co-axial section with tuning adjustments, and (8) is a crystal detector. [...] The right-hand end of the slotted line is terminated in a matched load (9) which absorbs all the power exiting the end of the waveguide. [...] The load can be replaced by the component or system that it is desired to test. [...] It can also be replaced with a reference short-circuit (10) which is used to calibrate the slotted line. [...] The carriage can be moved along the slotted line by means of a rotary knob (11) which simultaneously moves a vernier gauge (12) for accurate measurement of the probes position along the line.|$|E

Until very recently, local Tb theorems in the non-homogeneous case had only been proved {{assuming}} scale invariant (L^∞ or BMO) <b>testing</b> <b>conditions.</b> The combination of non-scale-invariance and general measures is a delicate issue. In a previous paper we overcame this obstacle in the model case of square functions defined using general measures.
