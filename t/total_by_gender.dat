40|$|Objectives: Previous {{studies have}} {{documented}} that overweight and obese adults have substantially higher medical care expenditures than adults of normal weight, {{but there is}} little comparable data for children or adolescents. This study examines medical care expenditure and utilization patterns in a sample of adolescents in North Carolina enrolled in Medicaid, stratified by body mass index (BMI) categories. Methods: North Carolina public health department records, which include clinically measured height and weight, were linked to 2004 North Carolina Medicaid enrollment records. For the 3, 528 adolescents ages 12 - 18 whose records matched, we examined their entire paid claims history for 2004. <b>Total</b> expenditures <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> and race, hospital expenditures, physician expenditures, and prescription drug expenditures were tabulated, stratified by BMI.

40|$|The paper aims {{to analyze}} post-employment {{benefits}} provided by multinational firms, focusing on retirement advantages and pension systems in Romania and Serbia from a comparative empirical perspective. Economic literature highlights the essential {{role played by}} pension schemes in assuring a proper level of income after retirement, thus reducing poverty and increasing productivity, with significant positive implications upon overall economic activity. our research is based on developing several double-log fixed and random effects models, {{as well as a}} dynamic and distributed lags model, using a panel structure over the 2005 - 2013 period and a complex set of indicators (national accounts - GDP total and per capita; labor market - employment, unemployment, productivity, earnings; secondary and tertiary education; pension specific data - general beneficiaries, old age and survivor pensioners, <b>total</b> and <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> and pension expenses as percentage of GDP). The results show that pensions represent an incentive for employees leading to an increase in resource productivity. At the same time, old age pensions are positively shaping economic growth and employment for the two countries considered, significantly reducing the poverty rate for pensioners. Nevertheless, the two pensions systems are modelled by the economic activity, educational background of employees, {{as well as by the}} level of net earnings...|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between working hours and work ability was examined in a cross-sectional study of male (N = 156) and female (N = 1092) nurses in three public hospitals. Working hours were considered {{in terms of}} their professional and domestic hours per week and their combined impact; total work load. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant {{association between}} total work load and inadequate work ability index (WAI) for females only. Females reported a higher proportion of inadequate WAI, fewer professional work hours but longer domestic work hours. There {{were no significant differences in}} <b>total</b> work load <b>by</b> <b>gender.</b> The combination of professional and domestic work hours in females seemed to best explain their lower work ability. The findings suggest that investigations into female well-being need to consider their total work load. Our male sample may have lacked sufficient power to detect a relationship between working hours and work ability. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|Some {{limitations}} {{were evident}} in this study. First, {{the current study}} was conducted at a single university, which limits its generalizability to other population groups. Filling out the FANTASTIC checklist by self-reporting could have led to memory bias. Nevertheless, such limitations did not compromise the results obtained here as they were similar regarding <b>total</b> score <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> and similar to that reported in studies carried out in Colombian (Ramírez-Vélez and Agredo-Zúñiga 2012; Triviño et al. 2009), Canadian (Wilson and Ciliska 1984), Brazilian (Rodriguez et al. 2008) and Mexican populations (López-Carmona et al. 2000) and their content led to evaluating LS found in the population. Sociocultural and economic profiles of the students participated to this study may be different from the students attended to other universities in the Colombia. Nevertheless, the confusion variables most frequently associated with LS were included in the regression models (e.g. sex, age and BMI). Such findings are useful as dependent variables or for determining how to orientate the general population, especially the university population, concerning the benefits for health of adopting active LS. The target population should be extended to different age groups as the FANTASTIC checklist is open to problems inherent in all self-reporting questionnaires (i.e., sensitivity to social prejudice, coexistence and coherence). Further studies should be orientated towards contributing evidence regarding LS concerning other variables concerning physical and mental health and healthy environments and other population samples in Latin populations.|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiovascular {{diseases}} show {{high incidence}} and prevalence in Brazil; however, participation in Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) is limited {{and has been}} poorly investigated in the country. The Cardiac Rehabilitation Barriers Scale (CRBS) was developed to assess the barriers to participation and adherence to CR. Objectives: To translate, cross-culturally adapt and psychometrically validate CRBS to Brazilian Portuguese. Methods: Two independent initial translations were performed. After the reverse translation, both versions were reviewed by a committee. The new version was tested in 173 patients with coronary artery disease (48 women, mean age = 63 years). Of these, 139 (80. 3 %) participated in CR. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach’s alpha, test-retest reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and construct validity by factor analysis. T-tests {{were used to assess}} criterion validity between participants and non-participants in CR. The applied test results were evaluated regarding patient characteristics (gender, age, health status and educational level). Results: The Brazilian Portuguese version of the CRBS had Cronbach’s alpha of 0. 88, ICC of 0. 68 and disclosed five factors, most of which showed to be internally consistent and all were defined by the items. The mean score for patients in CR was 1. 29 (SD = 0. 27) and 2. 36 for ambulatory patients (SD = 0. 50) (p < 0. 001). Criterion validity was also supported by significant differences in <b>total</b> scores <b>by</b> <b>gender,</b> age and educational level...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the psychometric properties and cross-cultural validity of the Beck Depression Inven-tory (BDI) among ethnic Chinese living in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The study was conducted on 208 community individuals. Reliability and discriminant analysis were used to test the psychomet-ric properties and validity of the BDI. Principal component analysis was performed to assess the BDI’s factor structure for the <b>total</b> sample and <b>by</b> <b>gender.</b> The mean BDI score was lower (6. 74, SD = 5. 98) than observed in Western counterparts and showed no gender difference, good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha 0. 82), and high discrimi-nation of depressive symptoms (75 - 100 %). Factor analysis extracted two factors for the total sample and each gender: cognitive-affective dimension and somatic dimension. We conclude that depressive symp-toms can be reliably assessed by the BDI in the Brazilian Chinese population, with a validity comparable to that for international studies. Indeed, cultural and measurement biases might have influenced the response of Chinese subjects...|$|R

40|$|The psychometric {{properties}} of the Portuguese version of the trait form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) and its relation to the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were evaluated in a large Brazilian college student sample containing 845 women and 235 men. STAI-T scores tended to be higher for women, singles, those who work, and subjects under 30 years. Factor analysis of the STAI-T for <b>total</b> sample and <b>by</b> <b>gender</b> yielded two factors: the first representing a mood dimension and the second being related to worrying or cognitive aspects of anxiety. In order to study the relation between anxiety and depression measures, factor analysis of the combination of the 21 BDI items and the 20 STAI-T items was also carried out. The analysis resulted in two factors that were analyzed according to the tripartite model of anxiety and depression. Most of the BDI items (measuring positive affectivity and nonspecific symptoms of depression) were loaded on the first factor and four STAI-T items that measure positive affectivity. The remaining STAI-T items, all of them measuring negative affect, remained in the second factor. Thus, factor 1 represents a depression dimension and factor 2 measures a mood-worrying dimension. The findings of this study suggest that, although widely used as an anxiety scale, the STAI-T in fact measures mainly a general negative affect...|$|R
