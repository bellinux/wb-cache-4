5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scenes</b> at Baskerville were filmed at {{a number}} of locations. The {{exterior}} was filmed at the gas works by Baverstocks near Llwydcoed in Mid Glamorgan. The labs meanwhile were filmed in two separate locations, one of which was a microchip processing facility. The switch between two locations meant that the crew had to transport a lift set. <b>The</b> <b>scenes</b> in Dewer's Hollow, where the hound was sighted, was filmed near Castell Coch. The reveal scenes in the hollow took two nights to film. At some point filming <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> were delayed due to rain. <b>The</b> <b>scenes</b> shot in Dartmoor took place in areas such as Haytor and Hound Tor, the latter of which was said to be where the original story was set.|$|E

40|$|The {{appearance}} of a static scene as sensed by a camera changes considerably {{as a result of}} changes in the illumination that falls upon it. Scene appearance modeling is thus necessary for understanding which changes in the {{appearance of}} a <b>scene</b> are <b>the</b> result of illumination changes. For any camera, the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> {{is a function of the}} illumination sources in <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> <b>the</b> three-dimensional configuration of the objects in <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> and <b>the</b> reflectance properties of all the surfaces in <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> A scene appearance model is described here as a function of the behavior of static illumination sources, within or beyond <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> and arbitrary three-dimensional configurations of patches and their reflectance distributions. Based on the suggested model, a spatial prediction technique was developed to predict the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> given a few measurements within it. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> appearance model and the prediction technique were developed analytically and tested empirically. Two potential applications are briefly explored...|$|R

5|$|Filming began October 2000. From {{the onset}} of filming, {{difficulties}} with the studio slowed the film's development and caused a rift between the director and Universal Pictures, as executives were unhappy with the film's pacing, emphasis on small scale action sequences, and the general relationship between themselves and Liman, who was suspicious of direct studio involvement. A number of reshoots and rewrites late in development, plus scheduling problems, delayed the film from its original release target date of September 2001 to June 2002 and took it $8,000,000 over budget from the initial budget of $60 million; screenwriter Tony Gilroy faxed elements of screenplay rewrites almost throughout the entire duration of filming. A particular point of contention {{with regard to the}} original Gilroy script were <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> set in the farmhouse near the film's conclusion. Liman and Matt Damon fought to keep <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> in the film after they were excised in a third-act rewrite that was insisted upon by the studio. Liman and Damon argued that, though <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> were low key, they were integral to the audience's understanding of the Bourne character and the film's central themes. The farmhouse sequence consequently went through many rewrites from its original incarnation before its inclusion in the final product.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> second <b>scene</b> was a <b>scene</b> toward <b>the</b> end of {{the episode}} in which Don and Charlie talk while Don prepares for <b>the</b> arrest. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> was in <b>the</b> {{original}} script as Charlie's emotional reward and as the reformation of Don and Charlie's partnership. During production, the production crew realized {{that they did not}} have enough time to film <b>the</b> <b>scene,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> was removed from the production schedule.

5|$|Filming {{took place}} over a 13 to 14 days period in December 2001. It was not filmed on order of the script; <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> set around the Osbourne {{residence}} for instance, were all filmed at once, during two to three days, though during the episodes, <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> took place in separate parts of the episode. Parts of the introduction scenes, where Danny's team break into Osbourne's house, was actually filmed on the Grid set. Parts of the sequence were originally filmed without sound; the sound would later be added during post production. The footage of the drowned immigrants found at the shore were shot by the second unit headed by producer Simon Crawford Collins on a pebbled courtyard in Kensington to double as a beach.|$|E
