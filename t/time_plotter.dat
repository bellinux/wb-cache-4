5000|$|An X-Y plotter is a plotter that {{operates}} in two axes of motion ("X" [...] and [...] "Y") {{in order to}} draw continuous vector graphics. The term was used to differentiate it from standard plotters which had control only of the [...] "y" [...] axis, the [...] "x" [...] axis being continuously fed to provide a plot of some variable with <b>time.</b> <b>Plotters</b> differ from Inkjet and Laser printers in that a plotter draws a continuous line, much like a pen on paper, while inkjet and laser printers use a very fine matrix of dots to form images, such that while a line may appear continuous to the naked eye, it in fact is a discrete set of points.|$|R
50|$|As a nobleman, {{government}} official, {{and army}} officer, Schulenburg had multiple contacts, {{which he used}} over <b>time</b> to recruit <b>plotters.</b> Due to these ties, especially with the civilian resistance circles surrounding Carl Friedrich Goerdeler and the socialist group (Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold) about Julius Leber, he stood out as an important link.|$|R
5|$|Speidel {{met with}} former foreign {{minister}} Konstantin von Neurath and Strölin on 27 May in Germany, ostensibly at Rommel's request, although {{the latter was}} not present. Neurath and Strölin suggested opening immediate surrender negotiations with the West, and, according to Speidel, Rommel agreed to further discussions and preparations. However, around the same <b>time</b> the <b>plotters</b> in Berlin were not aware that Rommel had reportedly decided {{to take part in}} the conspiracy. On 16 May, they informed Allen Dulles, through whom they hoped to negotiate with the Western Allies, that Rommel could not be counted on for support.|$|R
2500|$|In 1980 Lange {{and a group}} {{consisting}} of Roger Douglas, Michael Bassett, Richard Prebble and Mike Moore tried to remove Bill Rowling {{as leader of the}} Labour Party. After Labour lost the 1981 general election, the group, later known as the [...] "Fish and Chip Brigade" [...] (in reference to a picture published at the <b>time</b> showing the <b>plotters</b> eating fish and chips) succeeded in their second attempt in 1983.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the loss}} of the East Coast Bays by-election, Muldoon faced an {{abortive}} attempt in October–November 1980 to oust him as leader. Known as the Colonels' Coup after its originators—Jim Bolger, Jim McLay and Derek Quigley—it took place to replace Muldoon with his more economically liberal deputy, Brian Talboys. Muldoon, who was overseas at the <b>time</b> saw the <b>plotters</b> off with relative ease, especially since Talboys himself was a reluctant draftee. No other serious challenge to his leadership occurred in his years as Prime Minister until after the 1984 election.|$|R
500|$|By the <b>time</b> the <b>plotters</b> reconvened at {{the start}} of the old style new year on Lady Day, 25March, three more had been {{admitted}} to their ranks; Robert Wintour, John Grant, and Christopher Wright. [...] The additions of Wintour and Wright were obvious choices. [...] Along with a small fortune, Robert Wintour inherited Huddington Court (a known refuge for priests) near Worcester, and was reputedly a generous and well-liked man. [...] A devout Catholic, he married Gertrude Talbot, who was from a family of recusants. [...] Christopher Wright (1568–1605), John's brother, had also taken part in the Earl of Essex's revolt and had moved his family to Twigmore in Lincolnshire, then known as something of a haven for priests. John Grant was married to Wintour's sister, Dorothy, and was lord of the manor of Norbrook near Stratford-upon-Avon. Reputed to be an intelligent, thoughtful man, he sheltered Catholics at his home at Snitterfield, and was another who had been involved in the Essex revolt of 1601.|$|R
500|$|In Flanders he met Juan Fernández de Velasco, 5th Duke of Frías and Constable of Castile, who {{was holding}} court there before his journey to England to {{conclude}} the Treaty of London. Thomas again stressed the plight of English Catholics, hoping to influence the forthcoming treaty negotiations due to take place at Somerset House in London. [...] The Constable was [...] "friendly rather than forthcoming". [...] Thomas also met the Welsh spy Hugh Owen, and Sir William Stanley, who were both disparaging of Catesby's hopes of Spanish assistance. [...] Owen did, however, introduce Thomas to Guy Fawkes, a committed Catholic who had served under Stanley as {{a soldier in the}} Southern Netherlands. Although at that <b>time</b> the <b>plotters</b> had no detailed plans, Thomas told Fawkes of their ambition to [...] "do somewhat in England", should Spanish support be lacking. [...] In late April therefore the two men returned together to Catesby's lodgings at Lambeth, and told him that despite positive noises from the Spanish, [...] "the deeds would nott answere".|$|R
5000|$|While Fawkes {{was being}} tortured, on 6 November the {{government}} began to round up anyone they thought might be involved. Rookwood's servants, still in the house their master had so hastily departed, were questioned on the same day. His belongings at Clopton—including several incriminating Catholic symbols—were also taken, and by the <b>time</b> the <b>plotters</b> had reached Catesby's family home at Ashby St Ledgers, Rookwood's name was among the list of suspects drawn up by the Lord Chief Justice. The fugitives continued on to Dunchurch, where they met the recently recruited conspirator Everard Digby, with his hunting party. [...] The next day the group stole horses from Warwick Castle, although with his fine cortège, Rookwood avoided the town. They then collected stored weapons from Norbrook, and continued on to Huddington. The party {{tried in vain to}} expand their number, but were shunned; no one was prepared to risk being labelled a traitor. Father Garnet, contacted at Coughton Court by Bates, wrote Catesby a letter in which he implored the group to stop their [...] "wicked actions", before himself fleeing.|$|R

25|$|Some <b>time</b> {{after the}} <b>plotters</b> {{had made their}} broadcast, Kỳ {{consolidated}} the troops on Saigon's outskirts at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base, {{the largest in the}} country and where the military was headquartered. He barricaded the soldiers into defensive positions and vowed a “massacre” if the rebels attacked the base. A stand-off of tanks and troops {{around the perimeter of the}} base occurred, but it petered away without any violence as the rebels were withdrawn. Kỳ had apparently been angered by comments made by a rebel source who claimed that he was part of the coup attempt. At the same time, Kỳ was known for his hawkish attitude and close relations with the U.S. military establishment in Vietnam, and American opposition to the coup was thought to have been conveyed to him efficiently. Đức mistakenly thought that Kỳ and his subordinates would be joining the coup, but was wrong.|$|R
5|$|About a {{month before}} Minh's junta was overthrown, Khánh was {{approached}} {{by one of the}} principal tacticians in the removal of Diệm, General Đỗ Mậu. A colonel {{at the time of the}} previous coup, Mậu had been head of military security under Diệm. Although he did not explicitly command troops, Mậu had a thorough knowledge of the backgrounds of most of the senior ARVN officers and their strengths and weaknesses. This had allowed him to help engineer the previous coup. The MRC respected Mậu, but their fears about his shrewdness led them to place him in the relatively powerless post of Minister of Information. Mậu's closest aides were posted further away from any real power in an attempt to fragment his networks of influence. Mậu began to search for officers to replace the junta, searching for exiles in Cambodia and France as well as those who had returned to Vietnam after the overthrow of Diệm. The most important link in Mậu's plan was Colonel Nguyễn Chánh Thi, the former paratroop commander who had fled to Cambodia in the wake of the failed 1960 coup attempt against Diệm. Mậu persuaded the junta to install Thi as Khánh's deputy in I Corps. He tricked the junta into doing so by reasoning that as Khánh had largely been responsible for putting down the 1960 revolt, Thi would be an ideal mechanism for keeping Khánh in check, claiming that the two would be implacably opposed to one another. Privately, Mậu predicted that Thi would be a bridge between him in Saigon and Khánh in Huế. He was correct in thinking that the 1960 conflict would be irrelevant in the shifting of allegiances over time and that the pair would work together for their current aims of advancement. Mậu recruited a second figure in the form of General Trần Thiện Khiêm, who was one of Khánh's fellow cadets and had worked with Mậu during the November coup. Khiêm had assisted Diệm in putting down the 1960 plot and had since been demoted from being Chief of Staff of the ARVN to the commander of the III Corps that surrounded Saigon. Khiêm readily joined the plot and controlled the 5th and 7th Divisions of the ARVN, which were based in Biên Hòa and Mỹ Tho north and south of Saigon respectively. This brought the two division commanders subordinate to Khiêm into the plot, as long as they would obey his orders. Khiêm, Khánh and Mậu kept in touch surreptitiously on a regular basis, supplementing their forces with an assortment of Marine, Air Force and Special Forces officers. Another was General Dương Văn Đức, who had recently returned from exile in Paris and was an assistant to Kim, the chief of the junta's general staff. During this <b>time,</b> the <b>plotters</b> received encouragement from Harkins through their American advisers, something seen as crucial to the plot's increasing momentum.|$|R
