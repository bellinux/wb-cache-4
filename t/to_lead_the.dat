5|$|St. Clair {{continued}} his preparations for invading the northwest {{despite the fact}} that, by now, he admitted he was unfit for combat due to his ill health. Like Harmar, he was also unpopular in Kentucky, and Scott had to conduct a draft to raise the militiamen needed for St. Clair's expedition. He and most other officers in Kentucky claimed they were too ill <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> men; most actually feared losing the respect of Kentuckians through their association with St. Clair. Colonel William Oldham was the highest-ranking soldier willing <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Kentuckians.|$|E

5|$|Aristagoras {{had brought}} all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently {{realised}} that the Greeks would need other allies {{in order to}} successfully fight the Persians. In the winter of 499 BC, he first sailed to Sparta, the pre-eminent Greek state in matters of war. However, despite Aristagoras's entreaties, the Spartan king Cleomenes I turned down the offer <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Greeks against the Persians. Aristagoras therefore turned instead to Athens.|$|E

There were rumours that Baird would leave provincial politics to contest the 2004 election, but this did not happen. In 2005 he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the Conservative Party.|$|E

5|$|Before his {{appointment}} <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Discovery Expedition, Scott {{had followed the}} career of a naval officer in the Royal Navy. In 1899, {{he had a chance}} encounter with Sir Clements Markham, the president of the Royal Geographical Society, and thus learned of a planned Antarctic expedition, which he soon volunteered to lead. Having taken this step, his name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic, the field of work to which he remained committed during the final 12 years of his life.|$|E

A few days later, in the Portuguese Cup, a home loss against Gondomar cost Ferreira his job. Fernando Chalana replaced him for one match, before the appointment of José Antonio Camacho.|$|E
5|$|By 1867, church {{authorities}} {{deemed the}} problems with the tower as severe enough to warrant a major reconstruction of the church.

5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had {{a conflict of interest}} in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in the explosion. After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated the explosion using an electrical or chemical detonator.|$|E
5|$|Chase was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General in March 1943 on assuming command of the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. He was chosen <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> assault on the Admiralty Islands in February 1944. He resisted the temptation to swiftly overrun the island, and thereby overextend his forces, and formed a defensive perimeter that made good use of the terrain. From this position, {{he was able to}} defeat a series of counterattacks by the numerically superior Japanese garrison.|$|E
