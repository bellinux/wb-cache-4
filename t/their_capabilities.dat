5|$|Holt {{tractors}} {{were widely}} used as artillery tractors during World War I and <b>their</b> <b>capabilities</b> and reliability had become well-known. Benjamin Holt also gained valuable experience securing government contracts. These capabilities separated {{him from his}} competition. Holt had obtained significant loans and begun a large expansion to meet the war planners' need for his tractors. Holt also made a steam powered tank for evaluation using Doble steam engines.|$|E
5|$|The Special Operations Executive were {{approached}} {{to see if}} its agents could destroy the dock gates. They decided that the mission was beyond <b>their</b> <b>capabilities</b> because the weight of explosives required would have needed too many agents to carry them. The Royal Navy was also unable to mount an operation, as St Nazaire is 8km (5 miles) up the Loire estuary. Any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were within range.|$|E
5|$|They were {{designed}} to be lighter in weight than their sister locomotives, the Merchant Navy class, to permit use on {{a wider variety of}} routes, including in the south-west of England and the Kent coast. They were a mixed-traffic design, being equally adept at hauling passenger and freight trains, and were used on all types of services, frequently far below <b>their</b> <b>capabilities.</b> A total of 110locomotives were constructed between 1945 and 1950, named after West Country resorts or Royal Air Force (RAF) and other subjects associated with the Battle of Britain.|$|E

The level of each unit {{is identified as}} I, II, or Vet, with Vet being the highest level. While units with higher levels are more powerful than new units, the power increase is slight. Unit experience is not persistent, and the player begins each mission with new units.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving in}} World War II, Loxton was demobilised and {{rose through the}} cricketing ranks to make his {{first-class}} debut in 1946–47. He was an all rounder—a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. During the 1947–48 Australian season, India toured Australia for five Tests, and the home team dominated, taking an unassailable 3–0 series lead after the first four matches. The Australian selectors then {{decided to use the}} Fifth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to give opportunities to players on the fringes of the national team to show <b>their</b> <b>capabilities</b> ahead of the 1948 tour of England. Loxton was one of several debutants, and he seized his chance. He scored 80 and took three wickets as an all rounder in the Australian victory, and was rewarded with inclusion in the 17-man touring party.|$|E
5|$|The F/A-18 Hornets are modern {{all-weather}} strike fighter jets, {{designed to}} attack both ground and aerial targets. Australia's F/A-18s were built during the 1980s and early 1990s and {{are currently being}} upgraded to improve <b>their</b> <b>capabilities</b> and extend their service lives. ACG operates a total of 71 F/A-18A and F/A-18B Hornets. The F/A-18A is a single-seat fighter and the F/A-18B is a two-seat variant which is mainly used for pilot training. The Australian Government is planning to replace the F/A-18A and Bs with the F-35A Lightning II from 2013 onwards. The F/A-18F Super Hornet is a dedicated strike aircraft in RAAF service and are considered superior to the F-22 Raptor {{in their ability to}} acquire and track moving ground targets, {{and will continue to be}} upgraded until the F-35s are delivered.|$|E

5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing <b>their</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the transponder code used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the transponder stopped working. The radar position symbols for the transponder code used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off. Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon radar system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|E

40|$|In this study, several two-parameter-concepts are {{analyzed}} experimentally and numerically {{with respect to}} <b>their</b> <b>capability</b> of characterizing in-plane and out-of-plane crack tip constraint effects. Different approaches utilizing the second term T-stress of the linear-elastic crack tip stress field, a higher term A(2) of the power-law hardening crack tip stress field, a hydrostatic correction term Q for a reference stress field or the local triaxiality parameter h are compared. Experimental results for a pressure vessel steel 22 Ni-MoCr 3 - 7 are investigated {{by means of the}} different approaches regarding <b>their</b> <b>capability</b> of constraint characterization for enhanced transferability. Theoretical aspects are investigated in a modified boundary layer analysis and in three-dimensional nonlinear elastic-plastic finite element analyses of the specimens.

25|$|Assessment of VC/NVA {{performance}} {{must look}} beyond the American interlude, and the guerrilla warfare phases to the final outcome of the Vietnam War in 1975. Well before the end, the Viet Cong were reduced to a minor force, and regular PAVN formations controlled the field. While final victory was aided by absence of American airpower, the PAVN/VPA armies were no longer the light-infantry formations mauled at the Battle of Ia Drang in 1965, but a tough, proficient, well-equipped modern force. <b>Their</b> <b>capabilities</b> had grown considerably, and several shortcomings of the conventional 1972 Easter Offensive were remedied.|$|E

For example, the most urgent need might be for public health specialists or airfield construction crews, which operate on a level far beyond the medical or engineering specialists of a US Special Forces unit. Public health or construction organizations, however, have limited or no self-defense capability and will need protection in insecure areas.|$|E

Their existence only became generally known in the 1970s, though knowledge of <b>their</b> <b>capabilities</b> remained among their UK staff and invited Americans. All but two of the machines were dismantled in 1945; the remaining two were used in GCHQ until the 1960s. Work on the ABC at Iowa State University was stopped in 1942 after John Atanasoff was called to Washington, D.C., to do physics research for the U.S. Navy, and it was subsequently dismantled.|$|E
