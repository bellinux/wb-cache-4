5|$|On 8 June 2006, {{during the}} lead-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, an {{information}} board was installed {{to mark the}} location of the Führerbunker. The board, including a schematic diagram of the bunker, {{can be found at the}} corner of In den Ministergärten and Gertrud-Kolmar-Straße, two small streets about three minutes' walk from Potsdamer Platz. Hitler's bodyguard, Rochus Misch, one of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>people</b> living who was in the bunker at the time of Hitler's suicide, was on hand for the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Prior to his suicide, Joseph Goebbels finally {{released}} Misch {{from further}} service; {{he was free}} to leave. Misch and mechanic Johannes Hentschel were two of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>people</b> remaining in the bunker. They exchanged letters to their wives in case anything happened to either of them. Misch then went upstairs through the cellars of the Reich Chancellery to where Schädle had his office to report one last time. According to Hentschel, by that time Schädle's shrapnel leg wound had turned gangrenous. Misch told Schädle that Goebbels had released him. Schädle told Misch of the route he should take to try to get through the Soviet encirclement of the area. After helping Misch, Schädle shot himself. Misch fled the bunker in the early morning of 2 May, only hours before the Red Army seized it. He met up with some other soldiers and they travelled north through the U-Bahn tunnels. Shortly thereafter, they were taken prisoner by Red Army soldiers. Misch was brought to Lubyanka Prison in Moscow, where he was tortured by Soviet NKVD officers in an attempt to extract information regarding Hitler's last days. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was extremely interested in learning of Hitler's fate and theories about possible escape. Misch spent eight years in Soviet forced labour camps.|$|E

25|$|Tamerlan Tsarnaev had {{formerly}} described {{murder victim}} Brendan Mess, who lived {{a few blocks}} from him in Cambridge and was a year younger than Tamerlan, as his best friend.

25|$|Bartolomeu Anania {{was among}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>people</b> {{to be sentenced}} in {{connection}} with the Burning Pyre movement.

He was severely weakened by repeated torture, terminally ill with Pott disease, and only survived into 1963. The other Burning Pyre affiliates were all released from prison in 1964, when the communist regime enforced a set of liberalization measures.|$|E

25|$|There were 72 {{restaurant}} staff {{present in}} the restaurant, including acting manager Christine Anne Olender, whose desperate calls to Port Authority police represented the restaurant's final communications. 16 Incisive Media-Risk Waters Group employees, and 76 other guests/contractors were also present. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>people</b> to leave the restaurant before Flight 11 collided with the North Tower at 8:46 AM were Michael Nestor, Liz Thompson, Geoffrey Wharton, and Richard Tierney.

25|$|Following {{the death}} of Warmaster Slaydo, a {{splinter}} fleet of Chaos slipped past the picket {{set up by the}} Imperial Navy thanks to the newly appointed Warmaster Macaroth's change of tactics. This small fleet attacked and conquered six worlds, one of which was Tanith. The Chaos armada bombarded Tanith from orbit, and deployed ground troops to kill whatever the shelling missed. The forests of Tanith burned under the crippling firepower of the fleet. It is not clear if Tanith had any functioning planetary defence artillery batteries, but {{it is likely that the}} Tanith Militia fought back against the invaders. Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt was one of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>people</b> to leave the planet before its demise, and was saved by a youth called Brin Milo, whom he took with him in gratitude. Milo confirms that he was the only civilian to leave Tanith alive, being too young to join the Guard.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{discovered}} that one of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>people</b> to see Paula alive {{was a man who}} lived along Harbour Road. He {{was in the midst of}} an argument with his girlfriend when she walked by. The man stormed off in a jealous rage shortly thereafter and depending on different statements he made, he went to his shack and spent the evening by himself, or he drove his truck up the travel portion of the trail (where Paula was heading). He lied to police on several occasions and was a person of interest in 1946 and again in 1952 when the case was revisited. Reportedly, he told at least two people that he knew within a hundred feet where Paula was buried but later claimed it was just idle talk. When no evidence was found that a crime had actually been committed, no body was ever discovered, and no forensic clues were identified, this avenue of the investigation ended.|$|E
