5|$|On June 12, 2008, Paul finally {{withdrew his}} bid for the Republican nomination. He later {{said that one of}} <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> did not run in the general {{election}} as a third-party candidate, after losing the primaries, was that, as a concession to gain ballot access in certain states, he had signed legally binding agreements to not run a third-party campaign if he lost the primary. Some of the $4 million remaining campaign contributions was invested into the new political action and advocacy group called Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty.|$|E
5|$|Antioch was Diocletian's primary {{residence}} from 299 to 302, while Galerius swapped {{places with}} his Augustus on the Middle and Lower Danube. Diocletian visited Egypt once, {{over the winter}} of 301–2, and issued a grain dole in Alexandria. Following some public disputes with Manicheans, Diocletian ordered that the leading followers of Mani be burnt alive along with their scriptures. In a 31 March 302 rescript from Alexandria, he declared that low-status Manicheans must be executed by the blade, and high-status Manicheans must be sent {{to work in the}} quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island, Turkey) or the mines of Phaeno in southern Palestine. All Manichean property was to be seized and deposited in the imperial treasury. Diocletian found much to be offended by in Manichean religion: its novelty, its alien origins, the way it corrupted the morals of the Roman race, and its inherent opposition to long-standing religious traditions. Manichaeanism was also supported by Persia at the time, compounding religious dissent with international politics. Excepting Persian support, <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> disliked Manichaenism were equally applicable, if not more so, to Christianity, his next target.|$|E

25|$|Walken married Georgianne Walken (née Thon), {{a casting}} director, in 1969. She is most notable for The Sopranos. The couple have no children.

25|$|At {{the time}} DOD denied Begg's account and, despite {{military}} coroner's having ruled the deaths as homicides, military spokesmen {{at that time}} attributed the deaths to natural causes. However a Department of Defense investigation, whose results were reported in May 2005, concluded that the deaths of Dilawar and Habibullah were wholly due to mistreatment by American soldiers. Begg wrote after his release that, he believed, one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> had continued to be detained was {{because he had been}} a witness to the two killings.|$|E
25|$|It was a {{pitch to}} sell Ladd to women filmgoers, {{though he had}} not changed one iota {{and he did not}} have a {{noticeable}} romantic aura. But Paramount hoped that women might feel that beneath the rock-like expression there smouldered fires of passion, or something like. His black-lashed eyes, however, gave nothing away; it was 'take me as I am' or 'I'm the boss around here'. He never flirted nor even seemed interested (which is one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> and Lake were so effective together).|$|E
25|$|After his {{disagreement}} with Milk over the proposed rehab center, White frequently clashed with Milk {{as well as}} other members of the board. On November 10, 1978, White resigned his seat as supervisor. <b>The</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> cited were his dissatisfaction with what he saw as the corrupt inner workings of San Francisco city politics, as well as the difficulty in making a living without a police officer's or firefighter's salary, jobs he could not retain legally while serving as a supervisor. White had opened a baked-potato stand at Pier 39, which failed to become profitable. He reversed his resignation on November 14, 1978, after his supporters lobbied him to seek reappointment from George Moscone.|$|E

As a result of his early training he was the first one to see the wakes of the two torpedoes coming from the port side. Both torpedoes went between the Helena and the San Francisco and when both ships turned, the torpedoes went past us and one of them hit the Juneau. We were not able to warn the Juneau in time to save her.|$|E
25|$|Though one of {{the most}} {{politically}} experienced of Sinn Féin's TDs, Cosgrave was not among the major leadership of the party. Nevertheless, after Cathal Brugha, the first President of Dáil Éireann, resigned and Éamon de Valera, who with the help of Michael Collins had just escaped from prison with a key made from a candle, took over, he was appointed to de Valera's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, his close friendship with de Valera being one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> was chosen. Another reason was his long experience on Dublin Corporation, most recently as Chairman of its Finance Committee. His chief task as minister was the job of organising the non-cooperation of the people with the British authorities and establishing an alternative system of government. Cosgrave was very successful in his role at the Department of Local Government.|$|E
25|$|Since 2016 the cycling team acted {{under the}} name Tinkoff, as Saxo Bank {{has decided not to}} renew {{sponsorship}} contract further than 2015. At the end of 2015 he announced {{that by the end of}} the 2016 season he will leave the cycling sport and sell the team. Oleg Tinkov as the sole title sponsor of the team was spending on it about 20 million euros per year, and for all time, together with the bank invested in it about 50 million euros. In addition to the increased financial burden among <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> mentions lack of potential for bank-branding, losses for the cycling teams, absence of reforms in the sport, as well as the long-running conflict between the Union Cycliste Internationale and Amaury Sport Organisation. In the last season the team won the second place and was finally disbanded in November 2016.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the militants}} active in Kashmir {{were trained in}} the same Madrasahs as Taliban and al-Qaeda. Fazlur Rehman Khalil of Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen was a {{signatory}} of al-Qaeda's 1998 declaration of Jihad against America and its allies. In a 'Letter to American People' written by bin Laden in 2002 he stated that one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> was fighting America is because of its support to India on the Kashmir issue. In November 2001, Kathmandu airport went on high alert after threats that bin Laden planned to hijack a plane from there and crash it into a target in New Delhi. In 2002, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, {{on a trip to}} Delhi, suggested that al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir though he did not have any hard evidence. He proposed hi tech ground sensors along the line of control to prevent militants from infiltrating into Indian administered Kashmir.|$|E
25|$|The {{occupation}} of Western Russia ultimately proved a costly blunder for Berlin as {{over one million}} German troops lay sprawled out from Poland nearly to the Caspian Sea, all idle and depriving Germany of badly needed manpower in France. The hopes of utilizing Ukraine's grain and coal proved abortive and in addition, the local population became increasingly upset at the occupying army. Revolts and guerrilla warfare began breaking {{out all over the}} occupied zone, many of them inspired by Bolshevik agents. German troops had to intervene in Finland to put down an attempted Bolshevik coup, and Ludendorff became increasingly paranoid about his troops being affected by propaganda emanating from Moscow; this was one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> was reluctant to transfer divisions to the Western Front. The attempt at establishing an independent Ukrainian state under German guidance was unsuccessful as well. Despite all this, Ludendorff completely ruled out the idea of marching on Moscow and Petrograd to remove the Bolshevik government from power.|$|E
25|$|Suda was {{disappointed}} {{with the quality of}} Travis' wrestling techniques, and performed some of them on the animators to demonstrate. Certain other details of Travis are based on Suda, including the sound of a key ring jingling in his pocket and his love of cats. A Ubisoft contest was held to allow one winner's design to be used in Desperate Struggle for one of Travis' T-shirts. In an interview with Nintendo Power, Suda stated that he wanted Travis to become a huge star, stating that this was one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> wanted to make Desperate Struggle as interesting as possible. Nintendo Power editors told Joystiq that Suda considers Travis his favorite character. Suda states that No More Heroes 2 will be Travis' last appearance in the series, as his story will be completely finished. The Californian setting of No More Heroes is partially based on Travis, who Suda stated had a variety of frustrations and emotions that helped him fit in with that setting.|$|E

25|$|Leguizamo {{was born}} in Bogotá, the son of Alberto and Luz Leguizamo. His father was once an {{aspiring}} film director and studied at Cinecittà, but eventually dropped out {{due to lack of}} finances. According to Leguizamo, his paternal grandfather was of Italian and Puerto Rican descent, and his maternal grandmother was Lebanese. He has also described himself as being of Amerindian and Mestizo heritage. On June 10, 2011, Leguizamo's father declared in an interview with New York Hispanic newspaper El Diario that he is Colombian and not Puerto Rican, and that Leguizamo is therefore not half Puerto Rican as he has always stated. Leguizamo had always declared that he was Puerto Rican on his father's side, which was one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> was selected as the Puerto Rican Day Parade Global Ambassador of the Arts. In response to his father's allegations, Leguizamo reiterated that his grandfather was of Puerto Rican descent. A National Puerto Rican Day Parade spokesman stated that Leguizamo would keep his ambassadorship. He marched in the parade on June 12, 2011.|$|E
25|$|In a 'Letter to American People' {{written by}} Osama bin Laden in 2002, {{he stated that}} one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>he</b> was {{fighting}} America was because of its support for India on the Kashmir issue. While {{on a trip to}} Delhi in 2002, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld suggested that Al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir, though he did not have any hard evidence. An investigation by a Christian Science Monitor reporter in 2002 claimed to have unearthed evidence that Al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with tacit approval of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI). In 2002, a team comprising Special Air Service and Delta Force personnel was sent into Indian-administered Kashmir to hunt for Osama bin Laden after reports that he was being sheltered by the Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. US officials believed that Al-Qaeda was helping organise a campaign of terror in Kashmir to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan. Their strategy was to force Pakistan to move its troops to the border with India, thereby relieving pressure on Al-Qaeda elements hiding in northwestern Pakistan. US intelligence analysts say Al-Qaeda and Taliban operatives in Pakistan-administered Kashmir are helping terrorists trained in Afghanistan to infiltrate Indian-administered Kashmir. Fazlur Rehman Khalil, the leader of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, signed al-Qaeda's 1998 declaration of holy war, which called on Muslims to attack all Americans and their allies. In 2006 Al-Qaeda claim they have established a wing in Kashmir, which worried the Indian government. Indian Army Lieutenant General H.S. Panag, GOC-in-C Northern Command, told reporters that the army has ruled out the presence of Al-Qaeda in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. He said that there no evidence to verify media reports of an Al-Qaeda presence in the state. He ruled out Al-Qaeda ties with the militant groups in Kashmir including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. However, he stated that they had information about Al Qaeda's strong ties with Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed operations in Pakistan. While on a visit to Pakistan in January 2010, US Defense secretary Robert Gates stated that Al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilise the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.|$|E
