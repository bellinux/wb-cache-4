The Admiralty ordered Tyrwhitt to detach Carysfort and four destroyers to reinforce Vice-Admiral Reginald Bacon's Dover Patrol as they feared that the transfer was in preparation for a concerted attack on the shipping protected by the latter. Three nights later, the newly arrived German destroyers did exactly what the Admiralty feared and attacked. Carysfort played no role in the resulting action, but was kept in reserve and helped to search for damaged vessels the following morning. German destroyers made another attack {{on the night of}} 20/21 April 1917 and were driven off, losing two destroyers, without the cruiser's intervention.|$|E

5|$|After a night-time advance, the 20th Battalion was {{positioned}} {{on the ridge}} in reserve behind the 18th and 19th Battalions.

The supporting British armour {{was nowhere to be seen}} and the supporting artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger had difficulty with his radio communications and made a dash through enemy lines <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the British armour. On reaching one of the British brigades, its commanding officer resisted Kippenberger's entreaties to advance and it was not until a passing British general authorised the move that the British mounted up. By the time the armoured support arrived, the flanking battalion of the 5th Brigade had been overrun, leaving the battalions of the 4th Brigade even more exposed and receiving fire from the enemy.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wine}} {{business}} began to prosper, Schnaufer also gave thought to alternative employment possibilities in peacetime aviation. With his wartime friend Hermann Greiner, he traveled from Weil am Rhein to Bern in Switzerland to meet South American diplomats; the two {{hoped to find}} employment as pilots in South America. To get to Bern, they crossed the Swiss-German border illegally. The meeting was a failure. As they returned to Germany, they were caught by Swiss border guards attempting to make a second illegal border crossing. The Swiss handed {{them over to the}} French occupation authorities and they were imprisoned in Lörrach, where they remained until Schnaufer managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> a French general, who was a customer of the Schnaufer winery and had them released.

5|$|B-29s {{began to}} arrive over Yawata at 00:38 local {{time and the}} attack on the city lasted almost two hours. Only 15 of the American {{aircraft}} were able to aim their bombs visually as the city was blacked out and obscured by smoke or haze; the other 32 bombed by radar. Two further B-29s bombed Laoyao harbor and another five struck targets of opportunity; overall 107 tons of bombs were dropped during the raid. After the first bombs were released regular updates on the operation were transmitted to the Twentieth Air Force's headquarters in Washington, from where they were relayed to Arnold who was in London at the time. The raiders were met with heavy but inaccurate anti-aircraft fire and the searchlights stationed around Yawata were not effective. The 4th Air Regiment achieved the only kill of the night when one of its fighters shot down a B-29. The Regiment's other aircraft struggled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the bombers and achieved few interceptions.|$|E

McDowell, but was unable to arrange for the Chetniks to be placed under American command.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{fearing a}} {{possible}} night encounter with Japanese surface forces, and believing Yamamoto still intended to invade, {{based in part}} on a misleading contact report from the submarine , Spruance changed course and withdrew to the east, turning back west towards the enemy at midnight. For his part, Yamamoto initially decided to continue the engagement and sent his remaining surface forces searching eastward for the American carriers. Simultaneously, he detached a cruiser raiding force to bombard the island. The Japanese surface forces failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> the Americans because Spruance had decided to briefly withdraw eastward, and Yamamoto ordered a general withdrawal to the west. It was fortunate Spruance did not pursue, for had he come in contact with Yamamoto's heavy ships, including , in the dark and considering the Japanese Navy's superiority in night-attack tactics at the time, there is a very high probability his cruisers would have been overwhelmed and his carriers sunk.|$|E
