5|$|The second {{scenario}} {{revolved around}} the discovery of an ancient mausoleum by archaeologists. An ancient virus contained in <b>the</b> <b>mausoleum</b> has quickly killed all the archaeological team, but prior to their death they radioed that a very important and undocumented tapestry is hanging inside. The local government is planning to cleanse the area with a fuel-air explosion in 15 minutes, so the scientists will send in an autonomous aerial robot to find <b>the</b> <b>mausoleum,</b> enter it (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the tapestry back prior {{to the destruction of}} <b>the</b> <b>mausoleum</b> and its contents.|$|E
5|$|Dinah {{continues}} {{searching the}} vaults and discovers that Edaniel and Edrear's sister, Eniri, is missing, {{and that the}} seed of the mausoleum—its link to the Host in the afterlife—has been stolen. Additionally, Edaniel and Edrear's other sister, Elala, is found dead. After Edaniel and Edrear lock down <b>the</b> <b>mausoleum,</b> they send Dinah home and she discovers that Maphohetka, a girl hanged for witchcraft and who now as a ghost can control minds in the real world, is manipulating Eniri and the townspeople. Unsuccessful in her attempt to stop her, Dinah flees to <b>the</b> <b>mausoleum</b> and receives a special outfit melted from the gold tolls that she and Vincent paid {{to gain access to}} <b>the</b> <b>mausoleum.</b> Returning, she confronts Maphohetka, who then orders Edaniel to kill her.|$|E
50|$|Revash's mausoleums are architectonical rests {{found in}} the Amazonas region of Peru. Last century, Charles Wiener {{discovered}} <b>the</b> <b>mausoleums</b> of Utcubamba; <b>the</b> <b>mausoleums</b> of Revash in Santo Tomás were studied later by the archaeologists Henry and Paule Reichlen primarily because the roof of one of <b>the</b> <b>mausoleums</b> had collapsed, covering and protecting the cultural remains.|$|R
50|$|Temple Beth El {{purchased}} {{two sections}} at Woodmere, Section Beth El {{and part of}} the adjacent Section NF. Many of <b>the</b> <b>mausoleums</b> in Section NF were vandalized in December 2012. The bronze doors were removed, leaving <b>the</b> <b>mausoleums</b> open to <b>the</b> elements.

5000|$|Presbitero Maestro is a {{cemetery}} in Lima, {{the capital city}} of Peru. It is also a museum, though attempts to make it a museum exclusively have failed. The architectural styles of <b>the</b> <b>mausoleums</b> found within are broad ranging. It houses the remains of several important political, military and literary figures. Most prominent of all <b>the</b> <b>mausoleums</b> is <b>the</b> Panteón de los Próceres where heroes of the War of the Pacific (1879 - 1884) are buried. <b>The</b> <b>mausoleum's</b> entrance reads [...] "La Nación a sus Defensores" [...] (Meaning [...] "The Nation, to its Defenders").|$|R

The building has massive marble columns in the front with a heavy metal door; on the back above the sarcophagus is a stained glass window. There are two sarcophagi {{in the center of}} the building, for Garret Hobart and his wife. Around the tomb are niches for other members of the family.

It was designed in the neo-Jacobean style by Paul Phipps, and is rectangular in shape, with two storeys and a three-bay north front. The central bay contains a door, above which is the Stanley crest, a three-light window and a date plaque in the gable. On {{the sides of the}} upper storey are three four-light windows.

50|$|Some {{other reasons}} can be stated for Ka'ba-ye Zartosht being a mausoleum; {{one is the}} triad and heptad units that are seen in <b>the</b> Achaemenid <b>mausoleums.</b> For example, <b>the</b> three-tomb {{chambers}} of <b>the</b> <b>mausoleums</b> connect them to making Ka'ba-ye Zartosht three-floor and its platform having three stairs; and the seven hatches of each floor of the structure remarks the Seven Persian Noblemen on <b>the</b> <b>mausoleums</b> and <b>the</b> Tomb of Cyrus having seven floors.|$|R

5|$|Unlike Germanicus, Drusus {{was given}} a full funeral, and his body was interred in <b>the</b> <b>Mausoleum</b> of Augustus, {{alongside}} other deceased members of the imperial family.

5|$|A grand {{funeral was}} held for the Prince Imperial two days after his death. The streets were crowded with {{ordinary}} people who greatly mourned the prince's death.

5|$|After Cain's disappearance, Mary becomes {{head of the}} Hargreaves. Augusta {{possesses}} Alexis, {{and seeks}} out Mary in <b>the</b> <b>mausoleum</b> Cain had built before leaving to confront Alexis. Augusta reveals that she manipulated Alexis into abusing his sons and trying to resurrect her for her amusement. Before she can kill Mary, Augusta triggers Cain's trap in <b>the</b> <b>mausoleum</b> and dies. Years later, Mary is married to Oscar and pregnant with their child, although she still waits for his return. Crehador, a medium close to Cain, sets up a tea party for Mary, fulfilling Cain's promise; he then reminisces on how he found Cain being held by Riff's corpse within the ruined tower. The bunkoban-exclusive epilogue expands the ending slightly. It shows an elderly Mary, who lies on her deathbed attended by a woman nearby and hears the laughter of Jizabel's ghost as he plays with his pet sheep. Sensing a presence nearby, she dies, and taking the form of her ten-year-old self, her soul joins Cain hand-in-hand at a tea party with their friends and loved ones—although they exist as spirits, a boy nearby can hear them.|$|E

Vincent dies while in one of the vaults, causing Dinah to become depressed. Later, the hooded angel, which normally guards the entrance to <b>the</b> <b>mausoleum,</b> appears as two stones that talk to Dinah and help her overcome the depression which resulted from Vincent's death.|$|E
