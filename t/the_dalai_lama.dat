5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>Dalai</b> <b>Lama,</b> {{among the}} many images in the temple was an image of Chenrizi, made of clay in the temple, within which the small wooden statue of the Buddha brought from Nepal was hidden.

5|$|The monastery hosts an {{impressive}} festival, {{popularly known as}} the ‘Sera Bengqin Festival’, which is largely attended by monks and devotees. The festival is held some time in February as per the Gregorian calendar corresponding to specific date fixed by the monastery according to the Tibetan calendar. On the festival day, a Dorje Pestle is ceremoniously taken to the Potala Palace. <b>The</b> <b>Dalai</b> <b>Lama</b> offers prayers to the Buddha to bestow strength and blesses the Pestle.

5|$|Following The Red Sea Sharks (1958) and {{its large}} number of characters, Tintin in Tibet differs from other stories in the series in that it {{features}} only a few familiar characters and is also Hergé's only adventure not to pit Tintin against an antagonist. Themes in Hergé's story include extrasensory perception, the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, and friendship. Tintin in Tibet has been translated into 32 languages, is highly regarded by critics, and has been praised by <b>the</b> <b>Dalai</b> <b>Lama,</b> who awarded it the Light of Truth Award. The story was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition.

5|$|GPI is {{the product}} of the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) and {{developed}} in consultation with an international panel of peace experts from peace institutes and think tanks with data collected and collated by the Economist Intelligence Unit.

In 2014 it ranked 162 countries, up from 121 in 2007. The study is the brainchild of Australian technology entrepreneur Steve Killelea, founder of Integrated Research, and is endorsed by individuals such as Kofi Annan, <b>the</b> <b>Dalai</b> <b>Lama,</b> archbishop Desmond Tutu, Finland's President Sauli Niinistö, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, economist Jeffrey Sachs, former president of Ireland Mary Robinson, former Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Jan Eliasson and former United States president Jimmy Carter.|$|E

5|$|The Ming {{initiated}} sporadic armed {{intervention in}} Tibet during the 14th century, {{but did not}} garrison permanent troops there. At times the Tibetans also used armed resistance against Ming forays. The Wanli Emperor (r.1572–1620) made attempts to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations after the Mongol-Tibetan alliance initiated in 1578, which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent Qing dynasty (1644–1912) of China in their support for <b>the</b> <b>Dalai</b> <b>Lama</b> of the Gelug school. By the late 16th century, the Mongols were successful armed protectors of the Gelug Dalai Lama, after increasing {{their presence in the}} Amdo region. This culminated in Güshi Khan's (1582–1655) conquest of Tibet from 1637–1642 and the establishment of the Ganden Phodrang regime by the 5th Dalai Lama with his help.|$|E
5|$|The Ming {{sporadically}} sent armed {{forays into}} Tibet during the 14th century, which the Tibetans successfully resisted.

By the late 16th century, the Mongols proved to be successful armed protectors of the Yellow Hat Dalai Lama after their increasing presence in the Amdo region, culminating in the conquest of Tibet by Güshi Khan (1582–1655) in 1642, establishing the Khoshut Khanate.|$|E
5|$|The hermitage is {{believed}} to have been founded by Phrin las rgya mtsho (d. 1667), who was the regent of Tibet from 1665 to his death. He was a student of the Fifth Dalai Lama and requested his permission to build a hermitage for eight to sixteen monks in the foothills above his native Nyangbran and invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to perform a “site investigation” (sa brtag) to determine the most auspicious location on which to build the monastery. <b>The</b> <b>Dalai</b> <b>Lama</b> made the treasure (gter) discovery of the self-arisen stone image of the Buddha that is still located in Chupzang’s lower temple.

5|$|Disney was keen {{to promote}} Mulan to the Chinese, hoping to {{replicate}} their {{success with the}} 1994 film The Lion King, {{which was one of}} the country's highest-grossing Western films at that time. Disney also hoped it might smooth over relations with the Chinese government which had soured after the release of Kundun, a Disney-funded biography of <b>the</b> <b>Dalai</b> <b>Lama</b> that the Chinese government considered politically provocative. China had threatened to curtail business negotiations with Disney over that film and, as the government only accepts ten Western films per year to be shown in their country, Mulans chances of being accepted were low. Finally, after a year's delay, the Chinese government did allow the film a limited Chinese release, but only after the Chinese New Year, so as to ensure that local films dominated the more lucrative holiday market. Box office income was low, due to both the unfavorable release date and rampant piracy. Chinese people also complained about Mulan's depiction as too foreign-looking and the story as too different from the myths.|$|E
5|$|Several Weiquan lawyers, {{including}} Teng Biao, Jiang Tianyong, and Li Fangping, offered {{legal aid}} to Tibetans {{in the wake}} of the March 2008 Tibetan protests. The protests resulted in the imprisonment of at least 670 Tibetans, and the execution of at least four individuals. Chinese government sources asserted that the unrest and violence in Tibet had been masterminded by <b>the</b> <b>Dalai</b> <b>Lama</b> and executed by his followers for the purpose of fomenting unrest and disrupting the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The Open Constitution Initiative (OCI), operated by several Weiquan lawyers and intellectuals, issued a paper in May 2009 challenging the official narrative, and suggesting that the protests were instead a response to economic inequities, Han Chinese migration, and religious sentiments. The OCI recommended that Chinese authorities better respect and protect the rights and interests of the Tibetan people, including religious freedom, and pursue the reduction of economic inequality and official corruption.|$|E
5|$|The Ngakpa Tratsang, also spelled Ngaba Zhacang, was the {{smallest}} of the three colleges that was set up in the complex. It was a three storied building originally built in 1419 by Jetsun Kunkhen Lodroe Rinchen Senge. It was refurbished in the 18th century by Lhazang Khan. Devoted to tantric studies, the college had an assembly hall and two chapels in the ground floor. The Assembly hall was built with four tall and 42 short columns with elegantly carved capitals. The main image in the centre of the hall was of Jamchen Chojey (wearing a black hat), founder of the monastery. It was believed that the Yongle Emperor (1360–1424) presented this image to Sera. Other images enshrined in the hall were of Maitreya, Gyeltsen Zangpo (first religious teacher of Sera), Pawangka Rinpoche, Tsongkhapa (with his principle disciples), Dalai Lama XIII, Chokyi Gyeltsen and Lodro Rinchen (founder of Sera Je). The two chapels housed many statues; in the Neten Lhakhang chapel of Shakyamuni Buddha along with images of 16 elders in double series (Upper series made in Tibetan style and the lower series in Chinese lacquer given by the Chinese Emperor); and the Jigje Lakhang chapel housed the 15th century image of Bhairava along with those of Mahakala, Dharmaraja, Shridevi and many others. While the third story was the residence of <b>the</b> <b>Dalai</b> <b>Lama,</b> the second floor had the images Amitayus and also eight 'Medicine Buddhas', as also reliquaries (stupas) of Gyeltsen Zangpo and Jetsun Chokyi Gyeltsen.
