5|$|Otto Kuntze and Howard James Banker later {{independently}} {{sought to}} restore Linnaeus' species name, but the resulting combination (Auriscalpium auriscalpium) is a <b>tautonym</b> and disallowed {{under the rules}} for botanical nomenclature (ICBN 2005 rule 23.4), and these combinations are therefore no longer validly published. Other names given to the fungus and now considered synonyms include Hydnum fechtneri, named by Josef Velenovský in 1922, and later combinations based on this name. A.vulgare is the type species of the widely distributed genus of eight species that it belongs to.|$|E
5|$|Early writers {{claimed the}} Mascarene parrot {{was found on}} Madagascar, an idea that led the French naturalist and ornithologist René Primevère Lesson to coin the junior synonym Mascarinus madagascariensis in 1831. His new genus name prevailed and, when Tommaso Salvadori {{combined}} it with the earlier specific name in 1891, it became a <b>tautonym</b> (a scientific name {{in which the two}} parts are identical). Lesson also included species of the Tanygnathus and Psittacula genera in Mascarinus, but this was not accepted by other writers. The following year, the German herpetologist Johann Georg Wagler erected the genus Coracopsis for the Mascarene parrot (which became Coracopsis mascarina under this system) and the lesser vasa parrot (Coracopsis nigra). The English zoologist William Alexander Forbes, believing that mascarinus was invalid as a specific name, since it was identical to the genus name, coined the new name Mascarinus duboisi in 1879, in honour of Dubois. The binomial name was emended from M. mascarinus to M. mascarin by the IOC World Bird List in 2016, to conform with how other species epithets by Linnaeus have been treated.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the scientific literature as Thelephora cantharella by the American Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822, based on specimens collected in Ohio. Elias Magnus Fries later transferred it to Craterellus in his 1838 Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici. In 1856, Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis mentioned the fungus in their analysis of Schweinitz's specimens, but changed the epithet, calling it Craterellus lateritius. The motivation for the name change is unclear; Ronald H. Petersen, in a 1979 publication, suggests that Berkeley [...] "was apparently reluctant to surrender his own name for the organism". Petersen suggests that Berkeley may have foreseen the necessity to avoid giving the species a <b>tautonym</b> (a situation where both the generic name and specific epithet are identical). However, as Petersen indicates, a future publication renders this explanation dubious: in 1873 Berkeley again referred to the species using his chosen name Craterellus lateritius, and indicated a type location (Alabama) different than the one mentioned by Schweinitz. Petersen considers Berkeley's name to be a nomen novum (new name), not a new species, as Berkeley clearly indicated that he thought Craterellus lateritius was synonymous with Schweinitz's Thelephora cantharella. Normally in these circumstances, Schweinitz's specimen would be considered the type, but Petersen was unable to locate Schweinitz's original specimen, and thus {{according to the rules}} of botanical nomenclature, Berkeley's epithet has precedence as it is the earliest published name that has an associated type specimen.|$|E
40|$|The article 2 ̆ 2 Unsolved Problems 2 ̆ 2 in the February 1973 Word Ways {{posed the}} problem of {{constructing}} a tautonymic 10 -by- 10 word square consisting entirely of words, names and terms taken from books published since 1950. Dmitri Borgmann and I joined together for three months {{during the spring of}} 1973 to search for a sufficient number of <b>tautonyms</b> to make the construction of such a word square possible.

2500|$|Numerous place-names like Cheadle and Cheddleton, in the Midlands {{suggest a}} link with Chad. However [...] "suggestions" [...] based on late {{forms of the}} name count for little: a {{hypothesis}} should be framed instead from documentary and topographical evidence. Mostly names of this sort are derived from other Celtic roots, generally ced, cognate with modern Welsh coed, signifying a wood or heath. Cheadle, for example, is generally reckoned a <b>tautonym,</b> with the Old English leah, also meaning a wood, glossing the original Celtic term. This means that the origins of its name {{are closely related to}} those of Lichfield (originally derived from the Celtic for [...] "grey wood"), to which it bears little superficial resemblance, rather than Chad or even his brother, Cedd.|$|E

5000|$|Reduplication is the {{standard}} term for this phenomenon in the linguistics literature. Other terms that are occasionally used include cloning, doubling, duplication, repetition, and <b>tautonym</b> when it is used in biological taxonomies, such as [...] "Bison bison".|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the topics}} studied in logology are lipograms, acrostics, palindromes, <b>tautonyms,</b> isograms, pangrams, bigrams, trigrams, tetragrams, transdeletion pyramids, and pangrammatic windows.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{differences}} in the way codes work. For example, the ICN (the code for algae, fungi and plants) forbids <b>tautonyms,</b> while the ICZN, (the animal code) allows them.|$|R
25|$|Taxonomic {{names are}} written in italics (or {{underlined}} when handwritten) with a majuscule first letter {{with the exception of}} epithets for species and subspecies.

50|$|The {{black rat}} {{was one of}} the many species {{originally}} described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work, Systema Naturae, and it still bears its original <b>tautonym</b> of Rattus rattus. It is the type species of the genus Rattus.|$|E
50|$|For animals, a <b>tautonym</b> implicitly {{indicates}} that the species {{is the type of}} its genus. This can also be indicated by a species name with the specific epithet typus or typicus, although more commonly the type species is designated another way.|$|E
50|$|In {{the current}} rules for botanical {{nomenclature}} (which apply retroactively), tautonyms are explicitly prohibited. One {{example of a}} botanical <b>tautonym</b> is 'Larix larix'. The earliest name for the European larch is Pinus larix L.

His proposed name created a <b>tautonym.</b> Under rules first established in 1906, which are applied retroactively, 'Larix larix' does not and cannot exist (as a formal name). In such a case either the next earliest validly published name must be found, in this case Larix decidua Mill. (1768), or (in its absence) a new epithet must be published.|$|E

5000|$|Auriscalpium is a {{compound}} of the Latin, auris, [...] "ear"; and scalpo, [...] "I scratch", generally meaning ear pick.

Gray recognized the cone-inhabiting fungus as a new genus, named after its type species, Auriscalpium vulgare. <b>Tautonyms,</b> such as [...] "Auriscalpium auriscalpium" [...] are illegitimate under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.|$|R
