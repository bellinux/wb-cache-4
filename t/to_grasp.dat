40|$|Abstract — In grasping, shape {{adaptation}} between {{hand and}} object {{has a major}} influence on grasp success. In this paper, we present an approach <b>to</b> <b>grasping</b> unknown objects that explicitly considers the effect of shape adaptability to simplify perception. Shape adaptation also occurs between the hand and the environment, for example, when fingers slide {{across the surface of the}} table to pick up a small object. Our approach <b>to</b> <b>grasping</b> also considers environmental shape adaptability <b>to</b> select <b>grasps</b> with high probability of success. We validate the proposed shape-adaptability-aware grasping approach in 880 real-world grasping trials with 30 objects. Our experiments show that the explicit consideration of shape adaptability of the hand leads <b>to</b> robust <b>grasping</b> of unknown objects. Simple perception suffices to achieve this robust grasping behavior. I...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} compared <b>grasps</b> <b>to</b> real surfaces with <b>grasps</b> <b>to</b> virtual surfaces, {{and used}} virtual surfaces {{to examine the}} role of cues to surface shape in grasp. The first experiment investigated the kinematics of overhand <b>grasps</b> <b>to</b> real and virtual objects. The results showed that compared <b>to</b> <b>grasps</b> <b>to</b> real surfaces, <b>grasps</b> <b>to</b> virtual objects were different in the deceleration phase and were more variable in their endpoint position. The second experiment examined how, for several real and virtual surface conditions, {{the decision to use}} either an over or underhand grasp switched as a function of object orientation and compared these results with data obtained for visual matching of orientation to the same stimuli. The decision to switch between types of grasp showed no difference between actual grasp movements and verbal reports of grasp choice that were not accompanied by arm movement. It was also found that variability in the decision to switch between over and under hand <b>grasps</b> was correlated <b>to</b> variability in visual matching of orientation. The third experiment used virtual surfaces to examine how the removal of visual cues to shape affected the decision to switch from over <b>to</b> underhand <b>grasp.</b> Results showed that the orientation at which the decision switched was dependent on the visual information content. In summary, it was shown that grasps were affected by the information available in virtual surfaces and that, compared with real surfaces, <b>grasps</b> <b>to</b> virtual surfaces appear identical in choice of a grasp type, but differ in the kinematics of the execution of the grasp...|$|R

5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue {{at the tip}} of the beak of all birds in the family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the tip to form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There is evidence that the nail may help a bird <b>to</b> <b>grasp</b> things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E
5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained <b>to</b> <b>grasp</b> either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E

5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails <b>to</b> <b>grasp</b> branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability <b>to</b> <b>grasp</b> very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not <b>to</b> <b>grasp</b> a perch or when holding on.|$|E

She failed, however, <b>to</b> <b>grasp</b> the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} {{in the field of}} robotics is to build machines that can function intelligently in unstructured environments. Because of this, the field has witnessed a trend away from the sense-plan-act paradigm where the robot makes an attempt to model everything before planning and acting. Nevertheless, few approaches <b>to</b> robotic <b>grasping</b> and manipulation have been proposed that do not require detailed geometric models of the manipulation environment. One exception is the control-based approach where closed-loop controllers reactively generate grasping and manipulation behavior. This thesis develops and extends the control-based approach <b>to</b> <b>grasping</b> and manipulation and proposes a new framework for learning control-based skills based on generalized solutions. ^ This thesis extends control-based approaches <b>to</b> <b>grasping</b> and manipulation in several ways. First, several new controllers relevant <b>to</b> reaching and <b>grasping</b> are proposed, including a grasp controller that slides contacts over the surface of an object toward good grasp configurations by using haptic feedback. The number of different grasps that can be generated using grasp controllers is expanded through the use of virtual contacts. In addition, a new approach to statically-stable dexterous manipulation is proposed whereby the robot navigates through a space of statically stable grasp configurations by executing closed-loop controllers. In a series of experiments, grasp controllers are shown to be a practical approach <b>to</b> synthesizing different <b>grasps</b> from a variety of different starting configurations. This thesis also proposes a new approach to learning control-based behaviors by applying a generalized solution in new situations. Instead of searching the entire space of all controller sequences and combinations, only variations of a generalized solution, encoded by an action schema, are considered. A new algorithm, known as schema structured learning, is proposed that learns how to apply the generalized solution in different problem contexts through a process of trial and error. This approach is applied <b>to</b> the <b>grasp</b> synthesis problem, enabling a robot <b>to</b> learn <b>grasp</b> skills with relatively little training experience. The algorithm learns to select an appropriate reach-grasp strategy based on coarse visual context. In an experiment where a dexterous humanoid robot grasps a range of grocery items it had no prior experience with, the learned grasp skills are shown to generalize well to new objects and object configurations. ...|$|R
