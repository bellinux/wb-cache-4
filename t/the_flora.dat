40|$|Sub-Saharan Africa {{includes}} some 45, 000 plant species. The spatial patterns of this diversity {{have been well}} explored. We can group the species into a set of biogeographical regions (largely co-incident with regions defined for terrestrial vertebrate groups). Furthermore, {{we know that the}} diversity is unevenly distributed, with southern Africa (especially the south-western tip) disproportionally species rich, while the West African interior is disproportionally species poor. However, the origins of this diversity have only been explored for two anomalous African <b>Floras</b> (<b>the</b> Tropic-alpine <b>Flora</b> and <b>the</b> Cape <b>Flora),</b> whereas <b>the</b> origins of the diversity of <b>the</b> other <b>floras</b> are still unknown. Here I argue that six floras, with distinct geographical centres, different extra-African affinities, ages of radiation and radiation rates, can be delimited: the Austro-temperate, Tropic-alpine, Lowland forest, Tropic-montane, Savanna and Arid <b>Floras.</b> <b>The</b> oldest <b>flora</b> may be <b>the</b> Lowland forest <b>Flora,</b> and <b>the</b> most recent is the Tropic-alpine, which probably evolved during the Plio-Pleistocene on the summits of the East Africa volcanoes. My results suggest that the most rapidly radiating <b>flora</b> is <b>the</b> Austro-temperate <b>Flora,</b> while <b>the</b> other <b>floras</b> are all diversifying at {{more or less the same}} rate, this is also consistent with the current massive species richness in this flora (about half of the African species richness). <b>The</b> Austro-temperate <b>Flora</b> appears to be related to <b>the</b> <b>floras</b> of <b>the</b> other southern continents, <b>the</b> Tropic-alpine <b>Flora</b> to that of the Northern Hemisphere, and <b>the</b> four tropical <b>floras</b> to <b>the</b> tropical regions of the other continents, consistent with the theory of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Current African diversity may be the result of the sequential adding of new <b>floras</b> to <b>the</b> continent. Possibly the species poverty especially of <b>the</b> Lowland forest <b>Flora</b> may be <b>the</b> result of the spread of C 4 grasslands and associated regular fires...|$|R

40|$|As {{currently}} understood, <b>the</b> Lejeuneaceae <b>flora</b> of Australia {{consists of}} 122 species in 27 genera.
