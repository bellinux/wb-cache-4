40|$|Abstract—Advances in the {{development}} of colorless and nondirectional reconfigurable optical add–drop multi-plexers (ROADMs) enable flexible predeployment of optoelectronic regenerators (reshaping, retiming, and reamplifying known as 3 R) in future optical networks. Compared to the current practice of installing a regenera-tor only when a circuit needs them, predeployment of regenerators in specific sites will allow service providers to achieve rapid provisioning such as bandwidth-on-demand service and fast restoration. Concentrating the predeployment of regenerators in a subset of ROADM sites will achieve high utilization and reduces the network operational costs. We prove the resulting optimization problem is NP-hard and provide the proof. We present an efficient heuristic for this problem that <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>accoun...</b>|$|E

40|$|We study {{synchronization}} in two neurons using two-dimensional neuronal models coupled through threshold delayed inhibition, acting for a {{fixed duration}} T. We explain {{the mechanism of}} synchronization between the two coupled units by means of phase-plane analysis. Using a piecewise linear approximation, we compute the firing times of two mutually coupled neurons, which allows a quantitative study of synchronization. The results are in good agreement, both quantitatively and qualitatively, with the numerical simulations of the full nonlinear coupled system describing the two neurons. We first show that, with simple inhibition, only phase-lagged synchronization can be achieved except for {{a particular set of}} T-values.

Two approaches are currently followed: in summary the GD algorithm[5] has been written based on APM[6], detecting point sources and extended sources, while SWA[2] looks for maxima and is for point sources only. The versions of the algorithms which have been evaluated are 1. 4. 1 for GD and 2. 4 for SWA (sent for PDHE input on Jan 03). SWA is currently considered as stable and current development focuses primarily on GD.

40|$|Multimedia {{information}} {{is most often}} stored, browsed, and transmitted as simply “raw” data, a set of opaque files. Digital video and audio in particular benefit tremendously from “content-aware ” processing; as the salient content {{information is}} often temporal in nature, we study both the extraction and applications of the temporal structure of media streams. We begin by examining some of the fundamental issues behind and goals of automated temporal processing. From there, the problem of gradual transition detection in video is explored, and we present methods to detect both dissolve and wipe-based transitions, even {{in the presence of}} special graphical effects. Combining video transition detection with neural network-based predictors, we apply the principles of content-aware processing to improve the channel multiplexing efficiency of variable bit rate video streams. The integration of video, audio, and other data is essential to any temporal analysis of media streams. Segmentation in these modalities, as well as distance metrics between segments of the same stream, are developed.

40|$|Percutaneous {{procedures}} are minimally invasive medical procedures that use needles to locally {{operate on a}} target in a patient’s body. The precise placement of the needle in the body is a challenging task that can affect the quality and efficiency of these procedures. Needle insertion accuracy may be improved by robot-assisted control of steerable needles. The type of steerable needles considered {{in this study are}} needles that are being developed at the Delft University of Technology (TUD) and are intended to be used in liver biopsy procedures. The goal of this research is to prove that these needles are able to reach a predetermined target accuracy during straight needle insertion. First, the uncontrolled insertion is tested in different tissue stiffness samples and with different insertion speeds. The results show that the target is reached with an accuracy that is smaller than 1 mm only when the insertion speed and the tissue stiffness are low. Other conditions require a control of the needle steering during its insertion, so that its deviations from the straight path can be corrected for. Two controllers are applied and tested. They both use direct position feedback that comes from optical strain sensors in the needle stylet and act on the servomotors with a proportional controller.

Based on the stereo result, we can automatically segment the albedo map (which istaken to be piece-wise constant) using a Minimum Description Length (MDL) based metric, to identify areas suitable for SFS (typically smooth textureless areas) and to deriv e illumination information. The shape and the illumination parameter estimates are re ned using a deformable model SFS algorithm, which iterates bet w een computing shape and illumination parameters. Our method <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>accoun</b> tthe viewing angle dependent foreshortening and specularity e ects, and compensates {{as much as possible}} by utilizing information from more than one images.

We demonstrate our method by applying it to face shape reconstruction. Experimental results indicate a signi cant improvement over SFS-only or stereo-only based reconstruction. Model accuracy and detail are improved, especially in areas of low texture detail. Albedo information is retrieved and can be used to accurately re-render the model under di erent illumination conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is part of}} {{an ongoing}} {{research}} programme to study possible primordial black hole formation in the early universe. Working within spherical symmetry, a curvature profile K(r) is used to specify initial deviations away from the homogeneous solution described by the Friedmann Robertson Walker model. The formulation allows to consider an effective equation of state that <b>takes</b> <b>into</b> <b>accoun</b> the possibility of the cosmological fluid to be a mixture of different components. Initial conditions which lead to black hole formation are already characterised at early times by large deviations of the metric away from the Friedmann model, even if the perturbations of the density and velocity fields are then of small amplitude. The solution can still, however, be treated analytically when the perturbation length scale is much larger than the cosmological horizon, and we show that in this regime the perturbations which we are using are equivalent to pure growing modes of cosmological perturbation theory (the modes of interest for discussing perturbations originating from inflation). In this regime the curvature profile K(r) is also directly connected to the time-independent comoving curvature perturbation. We use initial conditions specified in this way and then follow their evolution numerically using two different parametrisations of K(r) within the radiation dominated era. The results obtained confirm the possibility of forming primordial black holes if the initial curvature perturbation is large and the correspondent amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, which is consistent to the critical value δ_c evaluated by previous authors...|$|E
