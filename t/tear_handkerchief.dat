60|$|He <b>tore</b> a <b>handkerchief</b> {{into two}} parts, made wads, and {{pressing}} them close over the wounds he bound them there with Ladd's scarf.|$|R
50|$|Muhterem Nur {{returned}} to cinema and starred sparsely in movies until 2002. Muhterem Nur {{is considered the}} first real star of Turkish cinema. She portrayed the ignored and discriminated-against woman, digressing from role of the bourgeoisie woman. She {{was known as the}} Yeşilçam's most weepy actress, who at the same time drew tears and made spectators <b>tear</b> <b>handkerchiefs.</b> Even though it is not documented, {{she is one of the}} most important female figures of Turkish cinema due to the box office record of her films shot in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
60|$|She stopped short, and {{suddenly}} <b>tearing</b> the <b>handkerchief</b> {{which she had}} been carrying into shreds threw the pieces upon the floor, and stamped upon them. Then she laughed shortly, and turned towards the door.|$|R
60|$|He {{answered}} vaguely. She {{turned back}} to Hunterleys. She was busy <b>tearing</b> up her <b>handkerchief.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Drawing by John Hamilton Mortimer from Act 1, Scene 4 (The Duke of York wipes {{away his}} <b>tears</b> with a <b>handkerchief</b> soaked in Rutland's blood).|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I won't. I mean to--keep them--for--my child." [...] Then {{there came}} forth a sob, and a <b>tear,</b> and Lizzie's <b>handkerchief</b> {{was held to}} her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "The idea {{is a good}} one, Pierre;" [...] and Philip {{took out}} his <b>handkerchief,</b> <b>tore</b> it in two and, handing half of it to Pierre, {{fastened}} the other round his arm.|$|R
40|$|Sailor departing {{to fight}} on British man-o'-war <b>tears</b> his <b>handkerchief</b> in two and gives half to his lover who begs him not to go.

60|$|Balbi, in his red flannel {{waistcoat}} and his puce-coloured leather breeches, {{might have}} passed for a peasant; but Casanova, in torn garments that were soaked in blood, presented an appearance that was terrifying and suspicious. This {{he proceeded to}} repair. <b>Tearing</b> a <b>handkerchief,</b> he made shift to bandage his wounds, and then from his bundle he took his fine taffeta summer suit, which on a winter's day must render him ridiculous.|$|R
60|$|Dominique {{had told}} Frank that the guide {{had made some}} remark about the two blacks {{dropping}} behind so often, and the latter took out his <b>handkerchief,</b> <b>tore</b> it into eight pieces, {{and gave it to}} him.|$|R
60|$|But now Ojo {{rushed up}} and threw his arms joyfully about his uncle, {{and the old}} man hugged his little nephew tenderly and stroked his hair and wiped away the boy's <b>tears</b> with a <b>handkerchief,</b> for Ojo was crying from pure happiness.|$|R
60|$|He made {{no reply}} as he <b>tore</b> her <b>handkerchief</b> into strips and bound her arm. His swift motions and his silence {{gave her a}} hint of how he might meet a more serious emergency. She felt safe. And because of that impression, when {{he lifted his head}} and she saw that he was pale and shaking, she was surprised. He stood before her folding his scarf, which was still wet, and from which he made no effort to remove the red stains.|$|R
6000|$|HANDKERCHIEF, n. A small {{square of}} silk or linen, used in various ignoble offices about {{the face and}} {{especially}} serviceable at funerals to conceal the lack of <b>tears.</b> The <b>handkerchief</b> is of recent invention; our ancestors knew nothing of it and intrusted its duties to the sleeve. Shakespeare's introducing it into the play of [...] "Othello" [...] is an anachronism: Desdemona dried her nose with her skirt, as Dr. Mary Walker and other reformers have done with their coattails in our own day--an evidence that revolutions sometimes go backward.|$|R
60|$|The {{king was}} delighted, and all dread of his enemy at once disappeared. The princesses were there too, {{and they were}} very {{friendly}} with the prince and begged him to get into their carriage so as to talk to them. But he declined, and remained on horseback, as he did not know at what moment the battle might begin; and whilst they were all talking together the youngest princess, who was also the loveliest, took off her ring, and her sister <b>tore</b> her <b>handkerchief</b> in two pieces, and they gave these gifts to the prince.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Ballindine, upon my soul I {{congratulate you}} sincerely, though, of course, you've seen nothing at Grey Abbey but <b>tears</b> and cambric <b>handkerchiefs.</b> I'm very glad, now, that what Kilcullen told me wasn't true. He left Dublin for London yesterday, and I suppose he won't hear of his cousin's death {{before he gets}} there." ...|$|R
60|$|Some {{shame and}} {{bitterness}} against her burned {{him in the}} question. She noticed how his moustache was soddened wet with <b>tears.</b> Taking her <b>handkerchief,</b> she wiped his face. The driver's heavy, stolid back remained always turned to them, as if conscious but indifferent. Skrebensky sat motionless whilst Ursula wiped his face, softly, carefully, and yet clumsily, not {{as well as he}} would have wiped it himself.|$|R
60|$|And my boot was chafing {{two of my}} toes. That always happens. I {{had come}} down to a wide, shallow valley-bed, marshy. So about a mile out of the village I sat down by a stone bridge, by a stream, and <b>tore</b> up my <b>handkerchief,</b> and bound up the toes. And as I sat binding my toes, two of the elders in black, with {{umbrellas}} under their arms, approached {{from the direction of the}} village.|$|R
6000|$|The {{services}} that day, I am told, were specially interesting and impressive, but I {{had a good}} deal else on my mind--was preoccupied, absent, inattentive. They might have varied from the usual profane exhibition in any respect and to any extent, and I should not have observed it. The first thing I clearly perceived was a rank of [...] "converts" [...] kneeling before the [...] "altar," [...] Tom at {{the left of the}} line. Then the Rev. Mr. Swin approached him, thoughtfully dipping his fingers into a small earthern bowl of water {{as if he had just}} finished dining. I was much affected: I could see nothing distinctly for my <b>tears.</b> My <b>handkerchief</b> was at my face--most of it inside. I was observed to sob spasmodically, and I am abashed to think how many sincere persons mistakenly followed my example.|$|R
60|$|He paced his {{apartment}} like a leopard. There was danger in Otto, for a flash. Like a pistol, he could kill at one moment, {{and the next}} he might be kicked aside. But just then, as he walked the long floors in his alternate humours, <b>tearing</b> his <b>handkerchief</b> between his hands, he was strung to his top note, every nerve attent. The pistol, you might say, was charged. And when jealousy {{from time to time}} fetched him a lash across the tenderest of his feeling, and sent a string of her fire-pictures glancing before his mind's eye, the contraction of his face was even dangerous. He disregarded jealousy's inventions, yet they stung. In this height of anger, he still preserved his faith in Seraphina's innocence; but the thought of her possible misconduct was the bitterest ingredient in his pot of sorrow.|$|R
60|$|She counted them idly. One, two, three, four {{now he was}} on {{the next}} landing. She heard them again, less distinctly, always less distinctly. Then silence. She ran to the window. There he was upon the pavement, now he was {{crossing}} the road {{on his way to the}} underground station. She <b>tore</b> at her <b>handkerchief,</b> waved it wildly for a moment--and then stopped. He was gone--and she. The hot colour came rushing painfully into her cheeks. She threw herself face downwards upon the sofa.|$|R
5000|$|According to some observers, {{this song}} could {{summed up by}} itself, the entire universe, {{atmosphere}} and themes evoked in Farmer's work. The name of the song ends with three suspension points - not a question mark - suggesting [...] "the singer had doubts about her usefulness on Earth". The black and white cover's photograph shows Farmer in her dressing room after one of her concerts at the Palais des Sports (Paris) drying a <b>tear</b> with a <b>handkerchief.</b> As a result, the song could refer to the [...] "loneliness that invades an artist after his exit from the stage".|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the second}} morning after he had left her; {{but he could see}} that she had lived long since their parting. He thought, [...] "That is the way she will look as she grows old." [...] The {{delicate}} outline of her cheeks showed a slight straightening of its curve; her lips were pinched; the aquiline jut of her nose was sharpened. There was no sign of tears in her eyes; but Adeline wept, and constantly dried her <b>tears</b> with her <b>handkerchief.</b> She accepted her affliction meekly, as Suzette accepted it proudly, and she seemed to leave all the conjectures and conclusions to her sister.|$|R
60|$|He was amazed, {{he might}} indeed have been troubled and even alarmed by this passion he had aroused {{had his own}} passion not been at the flood. And as he wiped away her <b>tears</b> with his <b>handkerchief</b> he could {{scarcely}} believe his senses {{that this was the}} woman whose resistance had demanded all his force to overcome. Indeed, although he recognized the symptoms she betrayed as feminine, as having been registered--though feebly compared to this! by incidents in his past, precisely his difficulty seemed to be in identifying this complex and galvanic being as a woman, not as something almost fearful in her significance, outside the bounds of experience....|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed, Mr. Pickwick, I am {{very much}} obliged {{to you for}} your {{kindness}} and consideration,' replied Arabella, drying her <b>tears</b> with her <b>handkerchief.</b> She would probably have said much more, had not Mr. Pickwick's head disappeared with great swiftness, in consequence of a false step on Sam's shoulder which brought him suddenly to the ground. He was up again in an instant however; and bidding Mr. Winkle make haste and get the interview over, ran out into the lane to keep watch, with all the courage and ardour of youth. Mr. Winkle himself, inspired by the occasion, was {{on the wall in}} a moment, merely pausing to request Sam to be careful of his master.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{next morning}} I volunteered in the [...] "B" [...] Grays of Petersburg, {{and on the}} 20th of April, 1861, we boarded a train enroute to Norfolk. Our {{organization}} was then known as the [...] "Petersburg Battalion," [...] comprising two companies of Grays (A and B), each 108 men, the [...] "City Guard," [...] "Petersburg Rifles," [...] "The Lafayette Guards," [...] and the [...] "Nichols Battery of Artillery," [...] The whole of Petersburg seemed to have turned out on that eventful April morning to bid us farewell, and mingled with <b>tears,</b> banners and <b>handkerchiefs</b> waving, we sped away over the Petersburg and Norfolk Railroad, {{as it was then}} known.""The Richmond Grays had preceded us a day, but were made a unit of the 12th Virginia." ...|$|R
60|$|They laid it bare, and {{did what}} they could. It was violently swollen and inflamed, and I could {{scarcely}} endure to have it touched. But, they <b>tore</b> up their <b>handkerchiefs</b> to make fresh bandages, and carefully replaced it in the sling, until we {{could get to the}} town and obtain some cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the quarry on our way back. Trabb's boy--Trabb's overgrown young man now--went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come in at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter. The white vapor of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as I had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.|$|R
6000|$|May 25.--A three hours' bay-trip from 12 to 3 this afternoon, {{accompanying}} [...] "the City of Brussels" [...] down {{as far as}} the Narrows, in behoof of some Europe-bound friends, to {{give them}} a good send off. Our spirited little tug, the [...] "Seth Low," [...] kept close to the great black [...] "Brussels," [...] sometimes one side, sometimes the other, always up to her, or even pressing ahead, (like the blooded pony accompanying the royal elephant.) The whole affair, from the first, was an animated, quick-passing, characteristic New York scene; the large, good-looking, well-dress'd crowd on the wharf-end--men and women come to see their friends depart, and bid them God-speed--the ship's sides swarming with passengers--groups of bronze-faced sailors, with uniform' d officers at their posts--the quiet directions, as she quickly unfastens and moves out, prompt to a minute--the emotional faces, adieus and fluttering handkerchiefs, and many smiles and some tears on the wharf--the answering faces, smiles, <b>tears</b> and fluttering <b>handkerchiefs,</b> from the ship--(what can be subtler and finer than this play of faces on such occasions in these responding crowds?--what go more to one's heart?)--the proud, steady, noiseless cleaving of the grand oceaner down the bay--we speeding by her side a few miles, and then turning, wheeling,--amid a babel of wild hurrahs, shouted partings, ear-splitting steam whistles, kissing of hands and waving of handkerchiefs.|$|R
