5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. <b>The</b> <b>rattle</b> grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E
5|$|Allen's men marched southward {{from the}} base, with the {{intention}} of entering the enemy base camp from a slightly different direction to the west. Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front, rear and both flanks. At 9:56am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail. Almost immediately, the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of the trail and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared. George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail, but {{by the time they were}} in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared and everything was quiet. About 10–15 minutes later, the 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving, in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> of ammunition.|$|E

25|$|Like other rattlesnakes, C. molossus has a rattle {{composed}} of keratin {{on the end}} of its tail. Each time the snake sheds its skin, a new segment is added to <b>the</b> <b>rattle.</b> They can shed their skin several times a year, and <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> is fairly fragile and can be broken, so the length of a rattlesnake's rattle is not an accurate measure of its age, unless the terminal button is intact.|$|E

25|$|From 1829, to 1839, Metropolitan Police {{officers}} wore blue swallow tail coats {{with high}} collars to counter garroting. This was worn with white trousers in summer, and a cane-reinforced top hat, {{which could be}} used as a step to climb or see over walls. The sleeves of the dark blue coats originally had a pattern of white bars, roughly 6mm wide by 50mm high, set roughly 6mm apart. This immediately distinguished them from naval or maritime personnel. In the early years of the Metropolitan Police, equipment was little more than a rattle to call for assistance, and a wooden truncheon. As the years progressed, <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> was replaced with the whistle, swords were removed from service, and flintlock pistols were removed in favour of revolvers.|$|E

500|$|In 2008 Trygve Nordwall, {{the manager}} of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, invoked new EU rules forbidding more than 85 {{decibels}} in the workplace, as a reason for dropping the planned world premiere of Dror Feiler's composition Halat Hisar (State of Siege) because it was [...] "adverse to the health" [...] of the musicians. The twenty-minute composition [...] "starts with <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> of machine-gun fire and gets louder" [...] ("Das Stück beginnt mit Schüssen aus Maschinengewehren, die vom Band zugespielt werden, und das ist noch die leiseste Stelle.") Orchestra manager Trygve Nordwall reported that [...] "readings were taken during rehearsals and even when toned down, Halat Hisar measured about 130 decibels, equivalent to hearing a jet aircraft taking off", and one member of the orchestra reported suffering headaches and permanent tinnitis after sustained exposure for three hours during rehearsals ("Ein Orchestermusiker habe nach der Probe des Stückes drei Stunden lang permanente Ohrgeräusche (Tinnitus) gehabt"). Headphones for the musicians were suggested, but they objected they could not hear each other and the composer also rejected the idea, adding that his composition was [...] "no louder than anything by Shostakovich or Wagner".|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>rattle</b> {{consists}} {{of a series of}} loosely interlocking hollow shells, each of which was at one point the scale covering the tip of the tail. In most other snakes, the tail tip, or terminal spine, is cone-shaped, hardly any thicker {{than the rest of the}} skin, and is shed along with it at each successive molt. In this case, however, the end-scale, or [...] "button", is much thicker and shaped like a bulb, with one or two annular constrictions to prevent it from falling off. Before each molt, a new button will have developed inside the last one and before the skin is shed, the tip of new button shrinks, thereby loosening the shell of the previous one. This process continues so the succession of molts produces an appendage consisting of a number of interlocking segments that make an audible noise when vibrated. Since younger specimens may shed three or four times in a year, every time adding a new segment to <b>the</b> <b>rattle,</b> the number of segments bears no relation to the age of the snake. In theory, <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> could become very long indeed, but in practice, the older segments tend to wear out and fall off. How quickly this happens depends on the snake's environment, but end segments tend to break off after <b>the</b> <b>rattle</b> becomes about six or seven segments long; it is uncommon to find specimens with as many as a dozen segments. In captive specimens, however, as many as 29 segments have been found.|$|E

2500|$|Heaney's work is used {{extensively}} on school syllabuses internationally, including the anthologies <b>The</b> <b>Rattle</b> Bag (1982) and The School Bag (1997) (both edited with Ted Hughes). Originally entitled The Faber Book of Verse for Younger People on the Faber contract, Hughes and Heaney decided {{the main purpose}} of <b>The</b> <b>Rattle</b> Bag was to offer enjoyment to the reader: [...] "Arbitrary riches." [...] Heaney commented [...] "the book in our heads was something closer to The Fancy Free Poetry Supplement." [...] It included work that they would have liked to encountered sooner in their own lives, as well as nonsense rhymes, ballad-type poems, riddles, folk songs and rhythmical jingles. Much familiar canonical work was not included, since they took it for granted that their audience would know the standard fare. Fifteen years later, The School Bag aimed at something different. The foreword stated that they wanted [...] "less of a carnival, more like a checklist." [...] It included poems in English, Irish, Welsh, Scots and Scots Gaelic, together with work reflecting the African-American experience.|$|E

2500|$|Before the {{existence}} of a formal police department, the first night watch was established in Boston in 1635. In 1703, pay in the sum of 35 shillings a month was set for members of the night watch. In 1796, the watch was reorganized, and the watchmen carried a badge of office, a rattle, and a six-foot pole, which was painted blue and white with a hook on one end and a bill on the other. The hook was used to grab fleeing criminals, and the rounded [...] "bill" [...] was used as a weapon. <b>The</b> <b>rattle</b> was a noise-making device used for calling for assistance.|$|E
