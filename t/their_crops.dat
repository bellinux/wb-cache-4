5|$|The tax on whiskey was bitterly and {{fiercely}} opposed on {{the frontier}} from {{the day it was}} passed. Western farmers considered it to be both unfair and discriminatory. As the Lower Mississippi River had been closed to American shipping for nearly a decade, farmers in western Pennsylvania were forced to turn their grain into whiskey. The substantial reduction in volume resulting from the distillation of grain into whiskey greatly reduced the cost to transport <b>their</b> <b>crops</b> to the populous east coast, which was the only place where there were markets for <b>their</b> <b>crops.</b> By the third quarter of 1794, tensions reached a fevered pitch all along the western frontier as the settlers' primary marketable commodity was threatened by the federal taxation measures.|$|E
5|$|Farming in Egypt was {{dependent}} on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water <b>their</b> <b>crops.</b> From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest <b>their</b> <b>crops,</b> which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.|$|E

He then attached a burning torch to each pair of foxes' tails and turned them loose in the grain fields and olive groves of the Philistines. The Philistines learned why Samson burned <b>their</b> <b>crops</b> and burned Samson's wife and father-in-law to death in retribution.|$|E

5|$|A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's {{presence}} and numbers late on Thursday March 21. The next morning, a Muslim conference of war convened, {{and there was}} dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad {{and many of the}} senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying <b>their</b> <b>crops,</b> and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter, and readied the Muslim force for battle.|$|E
5|$|Adverse weather {{such as a}} storm or hail could devastate crop {{fields and}} orchards, and thus {{jeopardize}} the livelihood of farmers in the affected area. A role of zduhaći, according to folk tradition, was to lead storms and hail clouds away from their family estates, villages, or regions, to save <b>their</b> <b>crops.</b> A zduhać could take the storms and hail clouds over the territory of another zduhać to destroy its crops. The other zduhać would fly up to confront the bringer of bad weather, {{and there would be}} a fight between the zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's {{first major}} {{achievement}} came in 1917 with the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were {{backed by the}} local administration. The peasantry was forced to grow Indigo, a cash crop whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell <b>their</b> <b>crops</b> to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Pursuing a strategy of nonviolent protest, Gandhi took the administration by surprise and won concessions from the authorities.|$|E

30|$|No {{noticeable}} socio-cultural {{differences were}} observed {{between these two}} groups of farmers. Almost all the inhabitants within the catchment {{belong to the same}} tribe (Frafra) with a common culture and way of doing things. The differences that exist between them appear to reflect the distances between the various communities and their location to the irrigation facility as well as the financial ability of each farmer to afford irrigation charges and land ownership. However, a few of the farmers who reside in close proximity to dug-outs within the catchment are able to practice dry season vegetable farming. Notably, the farming types differ in the frequency of use of <b>their</b> <b>crop</b> lands. While farmers using a combination of rain-fed and irrigation will use <b>their</b> <b>crop</b> lands more frequently (at least twice a year), those who practice only rain-fed will use <b>their</b> <b>crop</b> lands less frequently (once a year).|$|R

5|$|Harold {{had spent}} mid-1066 {{on the south}} coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade. The bulk of his forces were militia who needed to harvest <b>their</b> <b>crops,</b> so on 8 September Harold {{dismissed}} the militia and the fleet. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he rushed north, gathering forces as he went, and took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Harald Hardrada and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory came at great cost, as Harold's army was left in a battered and weakened state.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect <b>their</b> <b>crops</b> from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|In early 1066, Harold's exiled brother, Tostig Godwinson, raided southeastern England with a fleet he had {{recruited}} in Flanders, later {{joined by}} other ships from Orkney. Threatened by Harold's fleet, Tostig moved north and raided in East Anglia and Lincolnshire, {{but he was}} driven back to his ships by the brothers Edwin, Earl of Mercia, and Morcar, Earl of Northumbria. Deserted by most of his followers, Tostig withdrew to Scotland, where he spent the summer recruiting fresh forces. King Harold spent the summer on the south coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade, {{but the bulk of}} his forces were militia who needed to harvest <b>their</b> <b>crops,</b> so on 8 September Harold dismissed them.|$|E

5|$|Many {{farmers in}} central Washington build dams on their {{property}} for irrigation and to control frost on <b>their</b> <b>crops.</b> The Washington Department of Ecology, using new techniques involving aerial photographs, estimated there may {{be as many as}} a hundred such dams in the area, most of which are illegal. Six such dams have failed in recent years, causing {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} of damage to crops and public roads. Fourteen farms in the area have gone through the permitting process to build such dams legally.|$|E
5|$|Power {{companies}} from several states sent workers {{to help restore}} service to the hardest-hit areas of the Gulf Coast. Most of Alabama Power's affected customers had power within 24 hours of the storm, though restoration of service to Dauphin Island took significantly longer. Power was fully restored to Central Louisiana Electric customers by September 4. Alabama's two coastal counties were declared federal disaster areas on September 7. Special loan assistance was made available by the Small Business Administration and the Farmers Home Administration, the latter of which sought to help commercial growers who lost <b>their</b> <b>crops</b> to the storm.|$|E
5|$|The Kaqchikel kept up {{resistance}} against the Spanish {{for a number}} of years, but on 9 May 1530, exhausted by the warfare that had seen the deaths of their best warriors and the enforced abandonment of <b>their</b> <b>crops,</b> the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds. A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja. The former inhabitants of Iximche were dispersed; some were moved to Tecpán, the rest to Sololá and other towns around Lake Atitlán.|$|E

30|$|One {{question}} asked {{of the respondents}} was to estimate the annual percentage of crop losses due to bad weather (such as drought, high temperature, and heavy rain) in the last 5  years. The estimation result was 34 %, comparable with China’s average crop losses due to natural hazards and disasters (Balzer and Hess 2009). Almost all respondents (96 %) reported that extreme high temperatures and drought caused reduction of <b>their</b> <b>crop</b> yields in 2012. Of the respondents, 97 % thought that <b>their</b> <b>crop</b> yields {{would be affected by}} change in the local climate in the future. Respondents’ subjective beliefs of the probability of crop losses due to weather events in the coming growing season was 29 %, lower than the probability that respondents estimated on <b>their</b> actual <b>crop</b> losses.|$|R
5|$|The most Mesa Verdeans practiced dry farming, which {{relied on}} rain to water <b>their</b> <b>crops,</b> but others {{utilized}} runoff, springs, seeps, and natural collection pools. Starting in the 9th century, they dug and maintained reservoirs that caught runoff from summer showers and spring snowmelt; some crops were watered by hand. Archaeologists believe {{that prior to}} the 13th century, springs and other sources of water were considered shared public resources, but as Mesa Verdeans moved into increasingly larger pueblos built near or around water supplies control was privatized and limited {{to members of the}} surrounding community.|$|E

In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax. The British responded with more laws, {{including}} censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal.

5|$|Before {{the siege}} began, Skanderbeg exited Krujë with 8,000 men—among whom were many Slavs, Italians, Frenchmen and Germans. 2,000 {{of these were}} {{infantry}} and 6,000 were cavalry. Skanderbeg found Mount Tumenishta (now known as Mount Skënderbeu) to be a suitable position from which to attack the Ottomans. Krujë was left with a garrison of 4,000 men {{under the command of}} Vrana Konti. Vrana had under his command several Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen, to whom he emphasized the importance of the siege and also ordered them to their positions. Krujë had enough supplies for a sixteen-month siege. The women and children of Krujë were sent for protection to Venetian possessed cities, whereas the others were ordered to burn <b>their</b> <b>crops</b> and move into the mountains and fortresses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is {{important}} to understand factors that influence management decisions that determine the level of diversification within cropping systems. Because of the wide variety of cropping systems within a region, our study focused on a single county (Marshall) in northwestern Minnesota. This county was selected because it is in an area where farmers were reevaluating <b>their</b> <b>cropping</b> practices during the 1990 s in response to severe plant disease outbreaks and economic stresses. A survey (n = 153) and follow-up interviews (n = 9) ofrepresentative farmers in Marshall County showed that they were approaching <b>their</b> <b>cropping</b> systems management decisions under these conditions through a dominant conceptual framework (scientific) and two secondary conceptual frameworks (institutional and spiritual), which we termed “mental causal models. ” The study illustrates the ways farmers define and make decisions affecting <b>their</b> <b>cropping</b> systems diversity under conditions of agronomic and economic adversity. It also challenges agricultural professionals to expand their thinking about educational strategies that are sensitive to the varied perspectives of farmers beyond just the scientific mental causal model...|$|R

5|$|During the Contact period, it {{is known}} that certain {{military}} positions were held by members of the aristocracy, and were passed on by patrilineal succession. It is likely that the specialized knowledge inherent in the particular military role was taught to the successor, including strategy, ritual, and war dances. Maya armies of the Contact period were highly disciplined, and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male was available for military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; the needs of <b>their</b> <b>crops</b> usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's passage, the Mauritius {{government}} opened 130shelters, {{and also}} provided 5,000rupees to each homeless family. The crop damage from Hollanda, {{in addition to}} a drought, decreased the following year's output by 22%. In response, the government provided seeds to farmers so they could replant <b>their</b> <b>crops.</b> Most of the island had their power restored by ten days after the storm. The country's prime minister issued an appeal to the European Union for 67million rupees ($3.6million 1994USD) in assistance, although later dropped it to less than half that total. The requested aid was for the restoration of phone and power utilities. The storm's severe impact on Mauritius caused a sharp drop in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the overall GDP decreased by 10%.|$|E
5|$|López de Salcedo moved Trujillo upslope {{from its}} {{previous}} swampy location. In 1528, López de Salcedo {{spent a month}} in the Olancho Valley, which at this time was likely to have been inhabited by Pech. He attempted to bring the inhabitants under his control, spurring them into preparation to resist further Spanish incursions. He hanged several indigenous leaders who taken part in the attack on Natividad de Nuestra Señora, and imposed such harsh obligations upon the natives that they burned their villages and <b>their</b> <b>crops</b> and fled into the mountains. In Olancho, López de Salcedo unsuccessfully clashed with rival Spaniards that he found still there. Unrest among the natives spread widely, from Comayagua to as far south as Nicaragua, causing difficulties in procuring provisions, and presenting constant danger to the expedition. Nevertheless, he continued onwards to León, in Nicaragua. At about this time, Pedrarias was appointed governor of Nicaragua after vigorously protesting his loss of governorship over Castilla del Oro.|$|E
