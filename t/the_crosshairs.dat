5|$|What {{was needed}} was a new bombsight, one that could be very quickly set up, had useful {{illumination}} of <b>the</b> <b>crosshairs</b> for night use and was stabilized so the bomb aimer could watch the approach as the bomber was manoeuvring. An early attempt was the Mk. XI, which mounted a cut-down CSBS {{on the front of}} a gyro unit taken from a Sperry Gyroscope artificial horizon, to provide stabilization in the horizontal plane, useful for aiding drift measurements and corrections. It was no easy task to manually calculate the range angle on the Course and Speed Calculator. Although introduced in 1941, only a small number were produced.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{were carried}} out {{starting}} in October 1940, and quickly demonstrated a number of minor problems. One of the minor issues is that <b>the</b> <b>crosshairs</b> on the tube that indicated the center would block the spot. A more serious concern {{was the lack of}} range information, which the FIU pilots considered critical. Hanbury Brown went to work on these issues, and returned an updated version in December. A U-shaped reticle {{in the center of the}} display provided a centre location that left the spot visible. Additionally, the circuitry included a second timebase that produced a longer signal as the fighter approached its target. The output was timed so the line was centred horizontally on the dot. This presented the range in an easily understandable fashion; the line looked like the wings of an aircraft, which naturally grow larger as the fighter approaches it.|$|E
25|$|Conventional bombsights {{are set up}} {{pointing}} at a fixed angle, the range angle, which accounts for the various effects on the trajectory of the bomb. To the operator looking through the sights, <b>the</b> <b>crosshairs</b> indicate the location on the ground the bombs would impact if released at that instant. As the aircraft moves forward, the target approaches <b>the</b> <b>crosshairs</b> from the front, moving rearward, and the bombardier releases the bombs as the target passes through {{the line of the}} sights. One example of a highly automated system of this type was the RAF's Mark XIV bomb sight.|$|E
50|$|The {{joystick}} {{moves the}} soldier and <b>the</b> <b>crosshair</b> {{left and right}} of the area. The A Button is used for shooting the gun where <b>the</b> <b>crosshair</b> is positioned. If the firing button is held down, the player can move <b>the</b> <b>crosshair</b> while keeping <b>the</b> soldier in the same spot. The B Button is used for throwing grenades where <b>the</b> <b>crosshair</b> is positioned. <b>The</b> C Button held down and the joystick pulled left or right enables the soldier to run. If the player pulls the joystick Diagonal-Left or Diagonal-Right during a run, the soldier will do an evasive roll that will prevent him getting killed.|$|R
50|$|Players {{control a}} Strategic Defense Initiative {{satellite}} orbiting the Earth and must destroy enemy missiles and satellites with its weapons, when activated the satellite's weapon systems fire at <b>the</b> <b>crosshair</b> present onscreen during play. The arcade version features a joystick {{to control the}} satellite and a trackball to control <b>the</b> <b>crosshair.</b> Home computer versions use different control schemes, such as depressing the fire button to control <b>the</b> <b>crosshair,</b> alternating between controlling the satellite and its weapons. It is also possible to use a joystick and mouse in combination to control <b>the</b> satellite and <b>crosshair</b> at <b>the</b> same time, emulating the arcade game's controls.|$|R

25|$|The camera, fighting, and {{targeting}} {{controls were}} reworked to incorporate concepts from another Rockstar game, Manhunt, including various stealth elements, {{as well as}} improved target crosshairs and a target health indicator which changes from green to red to black depending on the target's health.

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the shooting, Democrats and Republicans both called for a cooling of {{political}} rhetoric and a return to bipartisanship. On the eve of the shooting, Giffords had written to a Republican friend, Trey Grayson, Secretary of State of Kentucky, saying, [...] "we need {{to figure out how to}} tone our rhetoric and partisanship down." [...] In March 2010, Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats, including Giffords's, in Arizona's 8th district. Shortly after the map's posting and the subsequent vandalizing of her office that month, Giffords said, [...] "We're in Sarah Palin's 'targeted' list, but the thing is that the way she has it depicted, we're in <b>the</b> <b>crosshairs</b> of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they've got to realize that there are consequences to that action." [...] At that point in the interview, however, the interviewer said, [...] "campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years." [...] The image was removed from Palin's [...] "takebackthe20" [...] website following the January shootings. Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting, and accusing the press of manufacturing a [...] "blood libel" [...] to blame her and the right wing for the attacks.|$|E
500|$|The South Park creators and animators {{said they}} were still {{developing}} the characters {{and trying to figure}} out the future direction of the show with [...] "Weight Gain 4000", which was more slow-paced than the series would eventually become. The 30-page script was shorter than in later episodes, which would average between 45 to 50 pages. The child protagonists also spoke slower. While recording their voice performances, the actors read the lines slowly and the dialogue was then sped up to create the characters' distinctive voices. At that time, Parker and Stone had not mastered the pace at which they needed to speak. The crowd shots in [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] took a particularly long time to animate due to the large number of people featured, and the animators were especially proud of the use of depth and motion in the perspective of <b>the</b> <b>crosshairs</b> in Mr. Garrison's rifle scope as he tried to assassinate Kathie Lee Gifford. Mr. Garrison's hatred for Gifford was foreshadowed in [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", where the sentence [...] "I'm not positive, but I think Cathy [...] Lee Gifford is much older than she claims to be", can be seen on his classroom's chalkboard. During a flashback scene in [...] "Weight Gain 4000", an eight-year-old Mr. Garrison is shown to already be bald on top with gray hair on the side of his ears. This led to an inconsistency in the first season episode [...] "Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut", in which he has a full head of hair during a flashback.|$|E

5000|$|The {{downside}} {{of this method}} is that it's not as accurate as a traditional light gun.

2500|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of slow motion attacks in the game, called [...] "Concentration mode." [...] Ray and Thomas' concentrations modes are charged by killing enemies, with headshots charging their meters faster than body shots. However, once the player has filled their concentration meter, they have only sixty seconds in which to activate it, or it empties by half, and they must recharge it. In Ray's mode, once slow motion begins, Ray is free to rotate 360 degrees from a fixed position. If <b>the</b> <b>crosshairs</b> pass over an enemy, that enemy will be [...] "tagged". Up to twelve enemies in total can be tagged (or less than twelve enemies can be tagged multiple times, up {{to a total of}} twelve tags) during concentration mode, but the amount of time the player has to do so is limited (indicated by an on-screen meter). Once the time is up, Ray fires at all tagged enemies with perfect accuracy. In Thomas' concentration mode, the player does not need to manually aim. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>crosshairs</b> automatically moves from visible enemy to visible enemy, pausing on each one momentarily. As <b>the</b> <b>crosshairs</b> moves, the player must hold down a button permanently, and when <b>the</b> <b>crosshairs</b> pause, the player must pull back on the analog stick or move the mouse backwards to fire at the target (mimicking the action of real-life fanning). The third type of concentration mode is dual concentration, which happens automatically at certain points of the game, always at doorways. Ray and Thomas simultaneously burst into the room, and the game goes into slow motion. Two targeting reticles appear {{on either side of the}} screen, with each moving towards the center. The player cannot control the movement of either reticle, or move their character during concentration mode, but they can control the positioning of the screen, allowing them to maneuver the character's vision so as to position the reticles over an enemy. They can also shoot independently from either their left or right gun, or both simultaneously.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2010, Palin {{posted to}} her Facebook page to seek {{contributions}} to SarahPAC to help defeat 20 House Democrats in the 2010 Congressional election. [...] Her post featured a graphic that used gunsight crosshairs {{to mark the}} Democrats' districts. [...] She also tweeted to her supporters, [...] "'Don't Retreat, Instead – RELOAD!' Pls see my Facebook page." [...] Palin critics said she was inciting violence. [...] One of the targeted Democrats, Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, objected to the graphic, saying, [...] "we're in <b>the</b> <b>crosshairs</b> of a gun sight over our district.

50|$|Precise level {{designs were}} {{often used for}} large {{leveling}} projects where utmost accuracy was required.

Furthermore, there are many photos where {{the middle of the}} crosshair is [...] "washed-out" [...] but the rest is intact. In some photos of the American flag, parts of one crosshair appear on the red stripes, but parts of the same crosshair are faded or invisible on the white stripes.

2500|$|Speculation has {{sometimes}} focused on Rosario, Hedgepeth's roommate at the time, {{due to her}} 9-1-1 call, the last texts sent from Hedgepeth's phone to her former boyfriend suggesting [...] " [...] needs you more than you know", the woman addressed as [...] "Rosie" [...] on the voicemail conversation and her decision to leave the apartment unlocked with, she claims, a sleeping Hedgepeth inside, to go sleep somewhere else at 4:30 {{the morning of the}} killing.

2500|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{the plate}} is inserted between the perpendicular polarizers {{at an angle}} of 45 degrees. This allows two different procedures {{to be carried out}} to investigate the mineral under <b>the</b> <b>crosshairs</b> of the microscope. More simply, in ordinary cross polarized light, the plate can be used to distinguish the orientation of the optical indicatrix relative to crystal elongation – that is, whether the mineral is [...] "length slow" [...] or [...] "length fast" [...] – based on whether the visible interference colors increase or decrease by one order when the plate is added. A slightly more complex procedure allows for a tint plate to be used in conjunction with interference figure techniques to allow measurement of the optic angle of the mineral. The optic angle (often notated as [...] "2V") can both be diagnostic of mineral type, as well as in some cases revealing information about the variation of chemical composition within a single mineral type.|$|E
