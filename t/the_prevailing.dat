5|$|Wind roses are tools used to {{determine}} the direction of <b>the</b> <b>prevailing</b> wind. Knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>prevailing</b> wind allows the development of prevention strategies for wind erosion of agricultural land, such as across the Great Plains. Sand dunes can orient themselves perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>prevailing</b> wind regime within coastal and desert locations. Insects drift along with <b>the</b> <b>prevailing</b> wind, while birds are able to fly more independently of it. Prevailing winds in mountain locations can lead to significant rainfall gradients within the topography, ranging from wet across windward-facing slopes to desert-like conditions along their lee slopes. Prevailing winds can have differences due to the uneven heating of the Earth.|$|E

5|$|The Westerlies or <b>the</b> <b>Prevailing</b> Westerlies are <b>the</b> <b>{{prevailing}}</b> winds in {{the middle}} latitudes between 35 and 65degrees latitude. These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east, and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere. They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, and weakest {{during the summer and}} when pressures are higher over the poles.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prevailing</b> {{hypothesis}} is that the Earth–Moon system formed {{as a result of}} the impact of a Mars-sized body (named Theia) with the proto-Earth (giant impact), that blasted material into orbit about the Earth that then accreted to form the present Earth-Moon system.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prevailing</b> winds in the {{interior}} are light to moderate northeast or southwest; in the coastal area, <b>the</b> <b>prevailing</b> winds are determined by local area features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as buras or less frequently as siroccos. The sunniest {{parts of the country}} are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2,700hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the southern Adriatic Sea area in general, northern Adriatic coast, and Slavonia, all with more than 2,000hours of sunshine per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{second reason}} is the general path of {{tropical}} cyclones in the eastern Pacific. They generally move north-westward or westward due to steering by <b>the</b> <b>prevailing</b> upper level winds, which takes them far out to sea and away from land.|$|E
5|$|The wind enables this moderating effect. The {{windward}} {{side of a}} land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, <b>the</b> <b>prevailing</b> wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear {{on the east coast}} on parallels with mild climates {{on the other side of}} the ocean. In the Southern Hemisphere, <b>the</b> <b>prevailing</b> wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.|$|E

5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies.

5|$|In 1919, when Hooker Telescope was completed, <b>the</b> <b>prevailing</b> view {{still was}} that the Universe {{consisted}} entirely of the Milky Way Galaxy.

5|$|In addition, Euler made {{important}} contributions in optics. He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory {{of light in}} the Opticks, which was then <b>the</b> <b>prevailing</b> theory. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the quantum theory of light.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s <b>the</b> <b>prevailing</b> {{view was that}} the genes in a {{chromosome}} acted like discrete entities, indivisible by recombination and arranged like beads on a string.
