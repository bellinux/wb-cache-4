5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|The {{sperm whale}} {{characteristically}} has a large, squarish head one-third {{the length of}} its body; the blowhole is slightly to the left hand side; the skin is usually wrinkled; and it has no <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> the upper jaw.|$|E

5|$|The {{two species}} of manta differ in color patterns, dermal denticles, and dentition. M. birostris has more angular {{shoulder}} markings, larger ventral dark spots on the abdominal region, charcoal-colored ventral outlines on the pectoral fins and a dark colored mouth. The shoulder markings of M. alfredi are more rounded, while its ventral spots are located near the posterior end and between the gill slits, and the mouth is white or pale colored. The denticles have multiple cusps and overlap in M. birostris, while those of M. alfredi are evenly spaced and lack cusps. Both species have small square shaped <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> the lower jaw but M. birostris also has enlarged <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> the upper jaw. Unlike M. alfredi, M. birostris has a caudal spine near its dorsal fin.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsid teeth, {{including}} those of Styracosaurus, were arranged in groups called batteries. Older <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike hadrosaurids, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some scientists have suggested that ceratopsids like Styracosaurus ate palms and cycads, while others have suggested ferns. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down angiosperm trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.|$|E
5|$|For an implant {{to become}} {{permanently}} stable, the body must grow bone {{to the surface}} of the implant (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> implants (restoring them).|$|E

5|$|In 1981, {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} revealed fine grooves or striations on the teeth in lemuriform toothcombs. These grooves were only found {{on the sides of}} the <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> the concave surfaces between the sides, as well on the back ridge of the teeth. Between 10 and 20µm wide, these grooves indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth. Inside these grooves were even finer grooves, less than 1µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair.|$|E
5|$|The {{head has}} an unusual shape for a crocodilian, with a {{dome-shaped}} skull {{and a short}} smooth, concave snout with an upturned tip, the shape rather resembling {{the head of a}} dog. The upper jaw extends markedly further forward than the lower jaw. There are four pre-maxillary and fourteen to fifteen maxillary <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> either side of the upper jaw and twenty-one or twenty-two <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> each side of the lower jaw giving a total of about eighty teeth. The neck is relatively slender and the dorsal scutes are less prominent than in the smooth-fronted caiman (Paleosuchus trigonatus). The double row of scutes on the tail are small and project vertically. Adults are dark brownish-black with a dark brown head while juveniles are brown with black bands. The iris of the eye is chestnut brown at all ages and the pupil is a vertical slit.|$|E
5|$|The jaws {{contained}} {{sharp teeth}} which were compressed laterally and unequal {{in size and}} shape, and this variation of tooth shape is known as heterodonty. The <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> the premaxillae (bones at the very tip of the upper jaw) were slender, unlike those of the maxillae (the main tooth-bearing bones in the upper jaw) which had a straight posterior edge. The upper jaw bore 30 teeth, with each premaxilla carrying about 4 teeth and each maxilla 11, while the lower jaw held 22 teeth.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Rosendo Pascual {{and colleagues}} {{described}} a lower jaw of Sudamerica, which had previously only been known from isolated teeth. This jaw fragment showed that Sudamerica had four molariform <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> {{each side of}} the lower jaws, more than any multituberculate, and consequently they removed gondwanatheres from Multituberculata and regarded their affinities as uncertain. As a consequence, Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues excluded Gondwanatheria from multituberculates, but identified the jaw fragment and a few upper premolars of Ferugliotherium as indeterminate multituberculates in a 2001 paper and a 2004 book. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck identified these fossils as Ferugliotherium and argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotheriidae) and multituberculates.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the sublingua in lemurs {{was thought}} to be a vestigial organ {{inherited}} from their mammalian ancestors. In lemuriform primates, the sublingua is used to remove hair and debris from the highly specialized toothcomb, an arrangement of four or six long, forward-facing teeth in the lower jaw used in oral grooming. The toothcomb of lemuriforms consists of both incisors and canine teeth (which reinforce the incisors), and together, these finely spaced teeth act like <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> a comb. Although the cleaning function has been suspected for nearly a century, there has been no clear confirmation of this. However, a study from 1941 presented evidence that the toothcomb accumulated a mat of hair during oral grooming, and the author did observe that lemurs extend and retract their tongue rapidly, possibly to use the sublingua to clean the toothcomb.|$|E
5|$|After its closure the {{pumping station}} lay {{derelict}} {{until the late}} 1960s, when the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust proposed to the British Waterways Board that students from the University of Bath conduct a survey and report on the viability of returning the pumping station to working order. Work started in 1969 with engineering students from Bath providing the labour {{under the supervision of}} John Butt, and the Trust providing the funding. Within the building rotten woodwork was replaced and electric lighting installed. To work on the sluices and the waterwheel the leat was dammed. Specialist wood and metal work was undertaken by apprentices from the British Aircraft Corporation in Filton. By 1972 some progress had been made; John Butt retired and Derrick Dudden took over as restoration manager, with more volunteers from the Canal Trust helping to provide the labour. Silt was removed from the pond, hatches replaced and the waterwheel restored. The 408 oak <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> the pitwheel were replaced and the pumps overhauled with new rope packing. By February 1976 all the machinery was working and water could be pumped from the river to the canal. The pumping station was formally re-opened in 1978.|$|E

5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Homologues {{of most of}} {{the bones}} of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods, aside from a few bones in the skull, such as interfrontals, internasals, and interparietals, that have {{developed}} in some temnospondyl taxa. Most temnospondyls have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls, rounded projections of bone separated {{from the rest of the}} skull by indentations called otic notches; in some temnospondyls, such as Zatrachys, they are pointed and very prominent. Among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities, two large holes in the back of the palate. Another pair of holes, choanae, are present in front of these vacuities, and connect the nasal passage with the mouth. Temnospondyls often have <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> their palates, as well as in their jaws. Some of these teeth are so large, they are referred to as tusks. In some temnospondyls, such as Nigerpeton, tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull.|$|E
5|$|South-pointing chariot: Although {{the claim}} of Wei Dynasty {{mechanical}} engineer and statesman Ma Jun (fl. 220–265) that the south-pointing chariot was first invented by the mythological Yellow Emperor are dubious, his south-pointing chariot was successfully designed and tested in 255 AD with many later models recreated in subsequent dynasties; this device was a wheeled vehicle with differential gears that ensured a mounted wooden figurine would always point in the southern direction {{no matter how the}} vehicle turned, in essence a non-magnetic compass. The Book of Song written in the 6th century states that the device was successfully reinvented by the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–500) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). The Japanese historical text Nihon Shoki, compiled by 720, states that the device was crafted and presented as a gift to Emperor Tenji (661–672) on two different occasions (658 and 666) by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) Chinese Buddhist monks Zhi Yu and Zhi You. The wheeled vehicle device was described in intricate detail in the historical text covering the Song Dynasty (960–1279), i.e. the Song Shi (compiled 1345); for example, it revealed the number of gear <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> each mechanical gear wheel, the diameter of each gear wheel, and how these gear wheels were properly positioned.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{requirement}} in some locations that prime cattle have a dentition indication mark on them prior to auction. This is normally done by the vendor, or the stock agent. Fat cattle auctions in New South Wales, Australia identify the amount of teeth that prime animals have {{in the form of}} sprayed marks along the back. Thus two tooth cattle are marked on the wither, four <b>tooth</b> <b>on</b> the middle of the back and six <b>tooth</b> <b>on</b> their high bone (near tail). Milk and eight tooth cattle are not marked.|$|R

5|$|The large {{pectoral}} fins measure around one-fifth {{as long as}} the body, {{and have}} a falcate (sickle-like) shape tapering to a point. The first dorsal fin is of moderate size and somewhat falcate, with a pointed apex and a strongly concave rear margin; its origin lies over the pectoral fin free rear tips. The second dorsal fin is much smaller and is positioned about opposite the anal fin. A low dorsal ridge is present between the dorsal fins. The caudal fin is large and high, with a well-developed lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped and closely set, each bearing five horizontal ridges leading to <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> the posterior margin. This species is bronzy to bluish gray above and white below, which extends onto the flanks as a faint lighter stripe. The fins, particularly the underside of the pectoral fins and the lower caudal fin lobe) darken towards the tips; this is more obvious in juveniles.|$|E
5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are long}} and narrow. The first dorsal fin is large and high, with a rounded apex, and originating just behind the pectoral fin bases. The pelvic fins are {{much smaller than the}} first dorsal fin. The second dorsal and anal fins are smaller still, and placed about even with each other on narrow bases that allow pivoting from side to side. The sides of the caudal peduncle are expanded into prominent lateral keels. A second, shorter pair of keels are present below the main keels. The caudal fin is large and crescent-shaped, with the lower lobe almost as long as the upper; there are both dorsal and ventral depressions (precaudal pits) at the caudal fin base, and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper caudal fin lobe. The skin is soft and covered by tiny, flattened dermal denticles (scales), lending a velvety texture. Each denticle has three horizontal ridges that lead to <b>teeth</b> <b>on</b> the posterior margin.|$|E
