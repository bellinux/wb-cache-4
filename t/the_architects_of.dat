5|$|Cryptum {{takes place}} {{approximately}} 100,000 {{years before the}} present day in the Halo universe, {{telling the story of}} the Forerunners before their disappearance. It revolves around the journey of a young Forerunner, Bornstellar, and two humans, Chakas and Morning Riser, and how their lives change when they meet a Forerunner warrior, the Didact. The Forerunners are a type-three civilization on the Kardashev scale; they can build artificial planets and control stars. Forerunners are divided into classes by occupation, they are (in order of rank): Builders, <b>the</b> <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> the Forerunners' megastructures, Miners, Lifeworkers, experts in medicine and biology, and Warriors. Bornstellar's family are politically important Builders and particularly wealthy, enabling them to own an entire planet. Warriors introduced in this book called Prometheans were later featured as antagonists in the video game Halo 4.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met {{as young}} draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 {{and left to}} form Burnham & Root the {{following}} year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become <b>the</b> <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888.|$|E

50|$|He had {{a school}} built in 1856, {{followed}} by a church in 1865-1868, and a vicarage in 1874, using nationally regarded <b>architects.</b> <b>The</b> <b>architect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school was George Edmund Street (who went on to design the Royal Courts of Justice in <b>the</b> Strand). <b>The</b> <b>architect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church was William Butterfield. <b>The</b> <b>architect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vicarage (Elerch Vicarage) was John Prichard.|$|R
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, {{molecular}} biology was increasingly {{seen as a}} threat to the traditional core of evolutionary biology. Established evolutionary biologists—particularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, three of <b>the</b> <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> the modern synthesis—were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially when it came to the connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over the relative importance of mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution.|$|E
5|$|In the 1330s, when <b>the</b> <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from}} the Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and in the choir of York.|$|E
5|$|In total 283 magical spells, {{also known}} as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue {{on the walls of}} the corridor, antechamber, and burial chamber of Unas' pyramid. They {{constitute}} the most complete rendition of the Pyramid Texts existing today. These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and powers in the Underworld and thus join with the sun god Ra, his divine father in the afterlife. By writing the texts {{on the walls of the}} pyramid internal chambers, <b>the</b> <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> Unas' pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease.|$|E

5|$|Milner and British {{official}} Lionel George Curtis were <b>the</b> <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> the Round Table movement, {{a network}} of organizations promoting closer union between Britain and its self-governing colonies. To this end, Curtis founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs in June 1919 and, with his 1938 book The Commonwealth of God, began advocating {{for the creation of}} an imperial federation that eventually reannexes the U.S., which would be presented to Protestant churches as being the work of the Christian God to elicit their support. The Commonwealth of Nations was created in 1949 but it would only be a free association of independent states rather than the powerful imperial federation imagined by Rhodes, Milner and Curtis.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> early skyscrapers faced {{a number}} of challenges. The most fashionable {{architectural}} style in the late 19th century was the French Beaux-Arts movement, sometimes termed the Italian Renaissance style, which applied Classical aesthetic principles to modern buildings. American architects trained in the Beaux-Arts style at the Parisian Académie des Beaux-Arts began to return home in the 1880s, bringing these ideals and standards with them. Applying contemporary Beaux-Arts standards to early skyscrapers, however, was not straightforward. The buildings that the Beaux-Arts movement influenced were typically much shorter and broader than any skyscraper, and {{it was difficult to}} accurately reproduce the style in a tall, narrow building.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, {{the year}} that the War of Independence broke out, nine issues {{appeared}} between January and May. There is a special appendix {{to the issue of}} April 1, 1821, containing a Greek translation of an article dated March 29, taken from the Wiener Zeitung, which reports on the uprising of Alexandros Ypsilantis and Tudor Vladimirescu in the Danubian Principalities, that {{marked the beginning of the}} Greek War of Independence, and also states the official Austrian standpoint. In the issue of May 1, while Ypsilantis’ campaign was in full swing, the Austrian authorities required the editors to publish the excommunication issued by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Gregory V, against <b>the</b> <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> this uprising. This was the last issue of Hermes o Logios which then was closed down by the local authorities and Kokkinakis was arrested as a member of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia.|$|E

5|$|While medieval Indian {{artisans}} {{preferred to}} remain anonymous, Hoysala artisans signed their works, which has given researchers details about their lives, families, guilds, etc. Apart from the architects and sculptors, {{people of other}} guilds such as goldsmiths, ivory carvers, carpenters, and silversmiths {{also contributed to the}} completion of temples. The artisans were from diverse geographical backgrounds and included famous locals. Prolific architects included Amarashilpi Jakanachari, a native of Kaidala in Tumkur district, who also built temples for the Western Chalukyas. Ruvari Malithamma built the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura and worked on forty other monuments, including the Amruteshwara temple at Amruthapura. Malithamma specialised in ornamentation, and his works span six decades. His sculptures were typically signed in shorthand as Malli or simply Ma. Dasoja and his son Chavana from Balligavi were <b>the</b> <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> Chennakesava Temple at Belur; Kedaroja was the chief architect of the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu. Their influence is seen in other temples built by the Hoysalas as well. Names of other locals found in inscriptions are Maridamma, Baicoja, Caudaya, Nanjaya and Bama, Malloja, Nadoja, Siddoja, Masanithamma, Chameya and Rameya. Artists from Tamil country included Pallavachari and Cholavachari.|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} the spectators {{would now be}} able to see the players at night, they still suffered from the problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the 1966 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering on top of the roof, allowing every spectator a completely unobstructed view, while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of £350,000. <b>The</b> <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller), rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first private boxes at a British football ground. The east stand – the only remaining uncovered stand – was developed in the same style in 1973. With the first two stands converted to cantilevers, the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena. Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players would feel the full effects of a capacity crowd. Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the replay of the 1970 final between Chelsea and Leeds United; Chelsea won the match 2–1. The ground also hosted the second leg of the 1968 Intercontinental Cup, which saw Estudiantes de La Plata win the cup after a 1–1 draw. The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of football hooliganism in Britain, and a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forcing the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> Vladimir-Suzdal {{switched}} from brick to white limestone ashlar as their main building material, which provided for dramatically effective church silhouettes, but made church construction very costly. The ornamentation combined native carpentry, oriental, Italian Renaissance, and German Gothic motifs. <b>The</b> <b>architects</b> <b>of</b> Novgorod and Pskov constructed their churches of fieldstone and undressed blocks of limestone. As a result, the northwestern buildings have highly textured walls, as if hand-moulded of clay. A trefoil facade with pointed gables {{was a common}} arrangement in the later Novgorod Republic. The churches of Pskov were tiny and gabled; they developed an enclosed gallery {{which led to a}} porch and a simple belfry, or zvonnitsa.|$|E
