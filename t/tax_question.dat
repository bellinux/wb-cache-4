40|$|The {{three primary}} sources {{of funding for}} public {{education}} in America are the federal government, the state government, and the community. This paper presents an overview of trends in funding K- 12 public education; the stability of local-funding sources; the value of public education {{as a factor in}} cost; political influences on school funding; fiscal implications and local level influence; and the importance of linking educational goals, outcomes, and educational funding. A conclusion is that there are many fiscal (cost of doing business), political (the <b>tax</b> <b>question),</b> and educational reasons (21 Century global standards) for increasing fiscal allocations for public K- 12 education. Unfortunately, dependence on local taxpayers places schools in a precarious position. Outdated state-formula systems result in many school districts begging for funding on a biannual basis.

40|$|As {{described}} in the text, the data used in this paper stems from household surveys from 10 countries around the world, which were selected because they included questions on payments to local public good provision. Since each of the surveys is somewhat di¤erent in terms of sampling and questionnaire design, this section brie‡y describes each of these surveys one by one, including details on the informal <b>tax</b> <b>question,</b> sampling design, and the de…nition of a community used for community …xed e¤ects. Since the derivation of VAT tax rates is somewhat more involved, Section 2 separately discusses the construction of implied VAT rates in each country in more detail. In constructing the data, we use several normalizations to standardize the data. To standardize units of time (e. g, for labor contributions) between surveys, we assume that each “day ” worked is equivalent to 6 hours worked, {{and that there are}} 260 working days per year. When including “village”…xed e¤ects, we use the smallest geographic unit available in the data. When the smallest geographic unit includes both urban and rural areas, we interact the geographic unit with an urban/rural dummy, so that each “village”is entirely rural or entirely urban. We convert all local currency units to 2000 PPP dollars after obtaining the exchange rate by dividing each country’s GDP in local currency units for that year by the GDP in PPP constant 2000 international dollars. This data is available in the World Bank World Development Indicators. All our surveys (with exception of Ethiopia) provide a household level weight variable to account for the sampling procedure. We used these weights in calculating the descriptive statistics (Table 3), as well as in all our regression analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{electoral process}} in the United States {{is going through a}} major {{transition}} as money increasingly pours into non-candidate independent groups (“IGs”). Before 2000, IGs could engage in significant electoral advocacy without having to disclose the IG’s donors or its expenditures. Congress sought to address the lack of disclosure by requiring section 527 political organizations to disclose their contributions and expenditures. IGs quickly sought an alternative organizational form for engaging in political advocacy. The alternative organizational form of choice has been the tax-exempt section 501 (c) (4) social welfare organization. In a 2007 article, I explored whether such tax-exempt entities would be the next loophole used by IGs to avoid disclosure of contributions and expenditures. I concluded then that taxable entities would not be an attractive vehicle because there would be significant tax implications if an entity forwent tax-exempt status, and because taxable corporations were prohibited from expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. The Supreme Court, however, overturned the ban on independent corporate spending in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Taxable entities are now a far more attractive vehicle for campaign activity than they were in 2007. Social welfare organizations and other tax-exempt entities are now subject to increased scrutiny. In the campaign finance arena, regulation in one area often entices entities to conduct activities in another. As Congress and the Service consider further regulation of social welfare groups, they must also consider whether further regulation of tax-exempt organizations will encourage IGs to reorganize as taxable organizations. Since taxable entities are subject to less regulation, they will be attractive vehicles as long as the tax consequences to the IGs do not outweigh the economic and regulatory benefits of forgoing tax-exempt status. The key question is a <b>tax</b> <b>question,</b> not an election law question: Can taxable entities engage in campaign activity without incurring significant tax liability...|$|E

40|$|Did {{the mass}} media report in a {{different}} way about the real estate tax before the Swedish national election 2006 than they did after the election? If there were differences, what could be the cause? This study aims to answer these questions by using a quantitative analysis of articles about the real estate tax published in the Dagens Nyheter (DN), the biggest morning daily.   The summer before the election, the ‘Alliance’, (the non-socialist coalition, launched an election promise to abolish the real estate tax. Instead they planned to introduce a low community charge. The Alliance won the election and formed a government to implement their election promise.   The analysis was made on all the published articles in DN that covered the real estate tax issue. In total there were 43 such articles. These where all published between the launch of the campaign promise until the electionday and a month before the proposal was launched 19 / 9 2007, until the proposal was implemented in 2008.   The study results in three interesting conclusions. After the election, when the election promise was about to become political reality, DN reported more negatively about this specific issue. The genre of the articles varied heavily before and after the election. Before the election more news articles where published than after the election and the letters-to-the-editor about the real estate tax were published almost only before the election. This study also treats the intresting phenomenon that the Alliance, before the election, had the power to define their election promise but after the election they seem to have lost this power and instead the real estate <b>tax</b> <b>question</b> was defined by the media. The Alliance claimed that they would  ”abolish the real estate tax and introduce a low community charge” and DN used this definition in their newspaper. After the election, DN reported about the election as a new real estate tax, which is a very different thing...|$|E

40|$|Countries {{engaged in}} {{transitions}} from Communist rule {{to democracy and}} market economies face a considerable challenge to foster tax morale and to reduce tax evasion. Tax evasion, however, severely limits the capacities of these reformed states, which reduces in a vicious circle the citizens' incentives to pay <b>taxes.</b> The <b>question</b> then arises how this vicious circle may be broken. Several authors suggest that political institutions may do the trick. Based on insights that institutions allowing a direct say on policy issues (especially <b>tax</b> <b>questions)</b> may increase <b>tax</b> morale, we propose to study comparatively how the link between trust and tax morale is affected by these institutions.

40|$|This paper uses British data {{to examine}} the effects of {{dividend}} taxes on investors' relative valuation of dividends and capital gains. British data offer great potential to illuminate the dividends and <b>taxes</b> <b>question,</b> since there have been two radical changes and several minor reforms in British dividend tax policy during the last twenty-five years. Studying the relationship between dividends and stockprice movements during different tax regimes offers an ideal controlled experiment for assessing the effects of taxes on investors' valuation of dividends. Using daily data on a small sample of firms, and monthly data on a much broader sample, we find clear evidence that taxes change equilibrium relationships between dividend yields and market returns. These findings suggest that taxes are important determinants of security market equilibrium, and deepen the puzzle of why firms pay dividends. ...|$|R
