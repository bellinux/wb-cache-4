5|$|Conwell {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on December 2, 1820. The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy that preceded Conwell's arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, William Hogan, {{approached}} de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia. After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan {{was assigned to}} St. Mary's Church. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy. Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already {{moved out of the}} priests' residence at Old St. Joseph's Church to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>where</b> he should live.|$|E
25|$|In {{systematic}} chemical nomenclature, alkynes {{are named}} with the Greek prefix system without any additional letters. Examples include ethyne or octyne. In parent chains with {{four or more}} carbons, it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>where</b> the triple bond is located. For octyne, one can either write 3-octyne or oct-3-yne when the bond starts at the third carbon. The lowest number possible {{is given to the}} triple bond. When no superior functional groups are present, the parent chain must include the triple bond even if it is not the longest possible carbon chain in the molecule. Ethyne is commonly called by its trivial name acetylene.|$|E
25|$|After {{selling his}} house in Raheny, in 1969 Haughey bought Abbeville, located at Kinsealy in north County Dublin, an {{historic}} house once owned by Anglo-Irish politician John Beresford for whom it had been extensively re-designed by the architect James Gandon in the late 18th century. Haughey purchased its existing estate of approximately 250 acres at the same time; it became his family home and he lived there {{for the rest of}} his life. This marked the beginning of a long period when Haughey's spending was well beyond his income level. For the rest of his life Haughey would refuse <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>where</b> the extra money came from.|$|E

25|$|Olkar {{wants to}} seize the diadem of Vishnu, the great {{treasure}} of Benares, but Démaly refuses <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>where</b> it is hidden. Olkar places Laméa in Démaly's prison cell, hoping she will lure him into revealing the location. Instead, she tells Démaly that an army of rescuers {{is on its way}} from Ellabad. The bayaderes also have a plan to trick the Mahrattas. She tells Olkar she knows where the diadem is but will only bring it to him after a victory celebration in Benares. The festivities take place and the bayaderes lull the Mahrattas with their dancing and intoxicating drinks and secretly take away their weapons. Laméa now gives the signal for the rescuing army to attack. Led by Démaly, who has been freed from prison, they defeat the Mahrattas.|$|E
25|$|Troubled {{by family}} upsets, Frank is devastated in 1990 {{when his mother}} Mo (Edna Dore) {{develops}} dementia. Her deterioration is rapid. In a lucid moment, she writes Frank a letter asking him not to let her end up like her grandmother, who had gone senile, saying she would rather die than suffer the same fate. Frank is torn, but attempts to adhere to his mother's wish by almost smothering her with a pillow while she sleeps. However, he cannot {{go through with it}} and instead sends Mo to live with his sister Joan Garwood (Mary Miller) in Colchester. In 1992 Frank receives a huge tax demand, swiftly followed by a large VAT bill. This forces him to sell his B and the adjoining house and move his family into a small flat. Pat establishes her own cab firm, PatCabs, which starts making them some money. However, on Christmas Eve that year, Pat runs over and kills a teenage girl and is later sentenced to six months in prison. Frank struggles alone and the Butchers end 1993 in financial ruin. In desperation, Frank asks Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) to set fire to his car lot so he can claim on insurance in March 1994. The car lot catches fire as agreed, but unknown to Phil and Frank, a homeless man is sleeping in one of the cars and burns to death. Frank is arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, but is later released due to lack of evidence. However, doubts remain as to whether he conspired to defraud his insurance company and an investigation takes place. Frank tries covering his tracks by claiming his accounts have burnt but Pat gives the business's books to the investigating agent. The pressure becomes too much for Frank, who is suffering severe guilt over the death of the homeless man. He becomes so depressed and despondent, no one can get through to him. Unable to cope, Frank leaves Walford and his family without warning in April 1994, and does not contact them <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>where</b> he is.|$|E
500|$|After {{two more}} EPs on Kompakt, the Orb (now {{composed}} of only Paterson and Fehlmann) released Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt, which featured new material {{in addition to}} tweaked versions of their previous Kompakt output. By this stage, Allmusic observed, Thomas Fehlmann had become the primary creative figure in the Orb, [...] "inhibiting Alex Paterson's whimsical impulses". Because of this, Okie Dokie was considerably more focused and less [...] "goofy" [...] than Cydonia and Bicycles & Tricycles. Fehlmann's trademark hypnotic loops and delays made him the centre of Okie Dokie production and, according to Pitchfork Media, made it [...] "difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>where</b> [...] is in the picture". The Orb's releases with Kompakt gained them back much of their musical credibility with the press and showed that they could [...] "age gracefully".|$|E

500|$|When Jam and Lewis {{agreed to}} produce Jackson's third studio album, {{they wanted to}} appeal {{primarily}} to the African American community, in addition to achieving crossover success on the pop music charts. Jam commented {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "We wanted to do an album that would be in every black home in America... we were going for the black album of all time." [...] Before their association with Jackson, Jam and Lewis had originally planned to record an album with tracks they wrote for Sharon Bryant, but she found their lyrics and sound to be too [...] "rambunctious". The duo presented the same set of recordings to Jackson, who gave her input and took co-writing and co-production credits for the album's content. Jam and Lewis recalled that in order to collaborate with Jackson on the material, they spent the first week simply getting to know their new client. Lewis explained, [...] "We got into her head. We saw what she was capable of, what she wanted <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>where</b> she wanted to be, what she wanted to be. We put together some songs to fit her as we saw her, as she revealed herself to us. It was as simple as that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adults {{may find}} it {{particularly}} difficult to maintain meaningful friendships in the workplace. [...] "The workplace can crackle with competition, so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues. Work friendships often take on a transactional feel; it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>where</b> networking ends and real friendship begins." [...] Most adults value the financial security of their jobs more than friendship with coworkers.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Meijaard, et al., {{published}} the canonical linearized equations of motion, in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A, along with verification by two different methods.

2500|$|Over {{the next}} few days, however, Terohaute's {{behaviour}} {{became more and more}} erratic. He disappeared for short periods, refusing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>where</b> he had gone.

[...] He later accused the Britons of having eaten his uncle.|$|E
2500|$|Not all review {{evaluations}} were positive. Eli Hawkins, {{acting as}} a referee {{on behalf of the}} Journal of Physics A, suggested rejecting one of the Bogdanovs' papers: [...] "It would take up too much space to enumerate all the mistakes: indeed it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>where</b> one error ends and the next begins. In conclusion, I would not recommend that this paper be published in this, or any, journal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Claudia Rosett, a {{journalist}} with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a weekly columnist for Forbes, questioned {{the source of}} the funding for the project. Some U.S. politicians such as Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, who is an Independent Democrat, and Republicans Peter King and Rick Lazio (N.Y.-2), asked for an investigation of the group's finances, especially its foreign funding, despite the fact that fundraising for the project had not yet begun. King said: [...] "The people who are involved {{in the construction of the}} mosque are refusing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>where</b> their [...] funding is going to come from." [...] Lazio said: [...] "Let's have transparency. If they're foreign governments, we ought to know about it. If they're radical organizations, we ought to know about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alex could add, to {{a limited}} extent, {{correctly}} giving the number of similar objects on a tray. Pepperberg {{said that if he}} could not count, the data could be interpreted as his being able to estimate quickly and accurately the number of something, better than humans can. When he was tired of being tested, he would say [...] "Wanna go back", meaning he {{wanted to go back to}} his cage, and in general, he would request where he wanted to be taken by saying [...] "Wanna go...", protest if he was taken to a different place, and sit quietly when taken to his preferred spot. He was not trained <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>where</b> he wanted to go, but picked it up from being asked where he'd like to be taken.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the groups}} set up {{to carry out this}} work was the Coalition for Peace through Security (CPS), {{modelled}} on the US Coalition for Peace through Strength. [...] The CPS was founded in 1981. Its main activists were Julian Lewis, Edward Leigh and Francis Holihan. [...] Amongst the activities of the CPS were commissioning Gallup polls which showed the levels of support for British possession of nuclear weapons, providing speakers at public meetings, highlighting the left-wing affiliations of leading CND figures and mounting counter-demonstrations against CND. [...] These including haranguing CND marchers from the roof of the CPS's Whitehall office and flying a plane over a CND festival with a banner reading, [...] "Help the Soviets, Support CND!" [...] The CPS attracted criticism for refusing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>where</b> its funding came from while alleging that the anti-nuclear movement was funded by the Soviet Union. Although the CPS called itself a grass-roots movement, it had no members and was financed by The 61, [...] "a private sector operational intelligence agency" [...] said by its founder, Brian Crozier, to be funded by [...] "rich individuals and a few private companies". [...] It is said to have also received funding from the Heritage Foundation.|$|E
