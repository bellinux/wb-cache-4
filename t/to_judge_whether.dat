5|$|Subjects may be {{instructed}} not <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>whether</b> or not {{the sentence}} is grammatically acceptable or logical, but whether the proposition expressed by the sentence is true or false. This task is commonly used in psycholinguistic studies of child language.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first to use the newly {{developed}} MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors' facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>whether</b> or not they are lying. The game uses full motion capture actors to record the voices and movements of the characters. Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump {{followed}} in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from The Orrery. The painting, which measures 72 by 94½inches (183 by 244cm), shows a white cockatoo fluttering in panic {{as the air}} is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: {{one of the girls}} worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers {{to the left of the}} painting are absorbed only in each other. The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging the viewer <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>whether</b> the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatoo saved.|$|E

5|$|L.A. Noire {{is notable}} for using Depth Analysis's newly {{developed}} technology MotionScan, whereby the actors portraying the game's characters were recorded by 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle. The technology {{is central to}} the game's interrogation mechanic, as players must use the suspects' reactions to questioning <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>whether</b> or not they are lying. L.A. Noire was the first video game to be shown at the Tribeca Film Festival. Upon release, the game received wide acclaim for its advances in storytelling and facial animation technology. As of February 2012, both PC and console versions had shipped nearly five million copies combined. L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files, a subset of the game's cases for virtual reality support through the HTC Vive, will be released in November 2017.|$|E
5|$|In October and November 2004, the IOC {{established}} an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic programme and all non-Olympic recognised sports. The {{goal was to}} apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for each celebration of the Games. The commission formulated seven criteria <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>whether</b> a sport should be included on the Olympic programme. These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport. From this study five recognised sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash. These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash. Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic programme. In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Team Bondi {{began to}} develop L.A. Noire {{following}} their founding in 2004. Initially due {{to be published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment, the publishing rights were later handed over to Rockstar Games in September 2006. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, the work was shared between Team Bondi and multiple Rockstar studios around the world. Unlike other games by Rockstar, which run on their proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software. The game is notable for being the first to use MotionScan, developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>whether</b> or not they are lying. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at more than US $50 million, which would make {{it one of the most}} expensive video games ever made.|$|E
25|$|A speaker's {{linguistic}} competence, {{which is}} the knowledge that they have of their language, allows them <b>to</b> easily <b>judge</b> <b>whether</b> a sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical based on intuitive introspection.

40|$|It is {{essential}} for edge detection of Hough transform to enforce the plaform of its availabilities. One {{of the most important}} subject of these enforcements is to prepare a robust method for segmenting line segments. We propose two kinds of algorithms: First one is a local algorithm, where a local area moves along the straight lines <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> locally <b>whether</b> the edge points should be on an edge segment or not. Another one is a global algorithm, where a histogram of the edge points along the straight line and the discriminant measure for it collaborate <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> globally <b>whether</b> the straight line should be deviated into some edge segments or not. We discussed also about the integration of these two algorithms to realize a practical line segmentation method. 1...|$|R

These are cognitively complex tasks that require good generic memory.|$|R

25|$|Young {{children}} learn {{from experience that}} stating an untruth can avoid punishment for misdeeds, before they develop the theory of mind necessary to understand why it works.

25|$|Destructive {{surgeries}} are irreversible {{and involve}} removing entire functionality of most, if not all, {{of the affected}} ear; as of 2013, {{there was almost no}} evidence with which <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>whether</b> these surgeries are effective. The inner ear itself can be surgically removed via labyrinthectomy, although hearing is always completely lost in the affected ear with this operation. The surgeon can also cut the nerve to the balance portion of the inner ear in a vestibular neurectomy. Hearing is often mostly preserved; however, the surgery involves cutting open into the lining of the brain, and a hospital stay of a few days for monitoring would be required.|$|E

The mission included military medical personnel, members of Unit 669, Home Front Command officers, along with a cadre of IDF officers.

At Ben-Gurion International Airport, 24 ambulances and medical were deployed to ensure that the injured could be swiftly transferred to local hospitals upon arrival.|$|E
25|$|African {{slaves were}} not bought or sold in London but were brought by masters from other areas. Together {{with people from}} other nations, {{especially}} non-Christian, Africans were considered foreigners, not able to be English subjects. At the time, England had no naturalization procedure. The African slaves' legal status was unclear until 1772 and Somersett's Case, when the fugitive slave James Somersett forced {{a decision by the}} courts. Somersett had escaped, and his master, Charles Steuart, had him captured and imprisoned on board a ship, intending to ship him to Jamaica to be resold into slavery. While in London, Somersett had been baptized; three godparents issued a writ of habeas corpus. As a result, Lord Mansfield, Chief Justice of the Court of the King's Bench, had <b>to</b> <b>judge</b> <b>whether</b> Somersett's abduction was lawful or not under English Common Law. No legislation had ever been passed to establish slavery in England. The case received national attention, and five advocates supported the action on behalf of Somersett.|$|E
