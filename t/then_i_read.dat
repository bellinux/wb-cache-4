500|$|The {{film was}} criticised {{for the use}} of some [...] "sexist dialogues" [...] in the first half which were playing to a certain [...] "new generation" [...] audience. Sowmya Rajendran of Sify criticised the same and stated about one of such scenes in the film, [...] "it is such banter, which we often dismiss with a laugh, that helps {{perpetuate}} rape culture." [...] When asked about this, the director replied, [...] "I firmly believe such conversations are part of our lives. I don't want to elaborate, but it also throws an insight into each character featured in the sequences. Yes, frankly, I was a bit worried how the family audience would react to those scenes. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> out that part of the script to a select group of women and they nodded their heads in approval." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Unbroken" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by OneRepublic leader Ryan Tedder, {{who was behind}} singles such as Beyoncé Knowles' [...] "Halo" [...] (2009) and Leona Lewis' [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] (2007). [...] "Unbroken" [...] was recorded at Artisan Studios in Birmingham, England, and Phil Tan mixed the record at Soapbox Studios, Atlanta, Georgia. Walker was honoured by the opportunity to record a piece of Tedder's work. Walker told the Daily Telegraph, [...] "It is a privilege for me to record a song by the guy who wrote 'Halo' for Beyoncé and 'Bleeding Love' for Leona. He's the man, {{one of the best}} songwriters and producers in the world. I am so blessed." [...] In an interview with MTV Australia he said, [...] "The song is so amazing. When I first heard the song I was like this is a beat song and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> the lyrics and that's what won me over because it talks about my life, being nothing and being in pieces, but then becoming unbroken." [...] "Unbroken" [...] is a piano-driven pop music ballad, and features a repetitive chorus.|$|E
500|$|Television {{director}} Joe Wright {{was hired}} in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his directional feature film debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who {{were looking for a}} fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, [...] "I didn't know if I was really all that interested; I thought I was a little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it". He next read the novel, which he called [...] "an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people... things like that." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Door" [...] {{marks the}} final {{appearance}} of Kristian Nairn as Hodor, a role Nairn has played since the series pilot. Nairn, who was cast to play Hodor from previously knowing Game of Thrones casting director from an audition {{he did for}} the film Hot Fuzz, admitted {{in an interview that}} he was at first unaware of his impending death in the show. He stated, [...] "First I heard from friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I think I said laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They just gave me a look, and I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> the script – which I loved. I loved the scene. I can't think of a better way to go, really. He doesn't give up. He never lets go of that door. For all costs, he's going to stop them from getting to Bran." [...] Reflecting on playing the role, Nairn also went on to note, [...] "People always joke, [...] "Oh you've got the easiest role, you don't have any lines to learn." [...] Anyone who knows anything about acting has been like, [...] "You actually have one of the hardest roles." [...] Because you have to articulate so much without words." ...|$|E
500|$|Her first {{starring}} film {{role was}} in the 2007 horror–thriller P2, in which she played a businesswoman who becomes trapped inside a public parking garage with a deranged security guard. About the dress her character wears {{for much of the}} film, Nichols said, [...] "When I read the script originally, it wasn't a dress, it was a small nightgown with no bra or underwear. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> the first scene where she gets wet, and I went: 'OK, {{this has got to be}} altered! Nichols said in an interview that among the rules established in her contract were: [...] "I will not get wet and show nipples" [...] in addition to no nudity. A bra was sewn into the [...] "Marilyn Monroe dress" [...] she wore in the film. She said, [...] "I wasn't going to run around for two months without a bra, I thought that was inappropriate. But in place of the nipples there's clearly a lot of cleavage. So we made a compromise." [...] P2 was generally disliked by critics. Reviewer James Berardinelli said that her performance was [...] "admirable, although one wonders whether she was cast more for her physical assets than her acting ability." [...] John Anderson of Variety wrote that [...] "Nichols is in territory well trod over the years by everyone from Fay Wray and Grace Kelly to Heather Langenkamp, the terrified but gutsy heroine, who in this case has been chloroformed and put into a sheer white evening dress by her abductor—who must have anticipated that his captive would try to escape in an elevator, which he could then fill with water. (Nichols' considerable physical attributes, henceforth, seem to occupy most of the screen.) She's sympathetic, hysterical when required and likeable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Banville {{said in an}} {{interview}} with The Paris Review that he liked Vladimir Nabokov's style; however, he went on, [...] "But I always thought there was something odd about it that I couldn't quite put my finger on. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> {{an interview}} in which he admitted he was tone deaf." [...] He is highly influenced by Heinrich von Kleist, having written adaptations of three of his plays (including Amphitryon) and having used Amphitryon as a basis for his novel The Infinities.|$|E
5000|$|Eden Robinson praised [...] "the {{breadth of}} Cowpers imagination, the {{delicacy}} of his characterizations, {{the unpredictability of}} his plot" [...] in this book.

2500|$|The idea to base {{the album}} around the {{folklore}} {{concept of the}} seventh son of a seventh son came to bassist Steve Harris after he read Orson Scott Card's Seventh Son. Harris states, [...] "It was our seventh studio album and I didn't have a title for it or any ideas at all. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> {{the story of the}} seventh son, this mystical figure that was supposed to have all these paranormal gifts, like second sight and what have you, and it was more, at first, that it was just a good title for the seventh album, you know? But then I rang [...] and started talking about it and the idea just grew." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scates {{was highly}} {{competitive}} {{both as a}} player and a coach, and he designed his practices to underscore competition and intensity. Practices moved at a high pace, with high repetitions and little time between drills. [...] "I ran shorter drills and quicker, and I didn’t stop the drills to explain things very much. I just tried to coach and keep things going at the same time." [...] John Wooden was a major influence on Scates and eventually a lifelong friend. [...] "I used to sit up there and watch him when we weren’t practicing. I learned a lot from that. I liked how he changed drills very quickly. He didn’t have any down time. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> a book he wrote in 1965 called 'Practical Modern Basketball.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{acknowledge}} {{that you have}} not read the later scenes of the piece,' he said. 'Don't be childish, Henry!
