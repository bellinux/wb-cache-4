5|$|A {{population-based}} study {{completed by}} the National Alcohol Research Center found <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> identify as lesbian or bisexual {{are less likely to}} abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment for substance abuse programs. Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E
5|$|John Frederick Conway's book, The Canadian Family in Crisis, explores {{effects of}} the double burden by gender. In Conway's studies, he discovers the physical, emotional, and {{psychological}} {{differences between men and}} women faced with the double burden in Canada. In these studies it was found <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> are raising children and are in the workforce are more prone to have anxiety and many other stress related effects than the women who are just faced with one of the two burdens.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the University of L'Aquila, using ultrasonography, {{presented}} evidence <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> experience vaginal orgasms {{are statistically}} {{more likely to}} have thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall. The researchers believe these findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-spot. Professor of genetic epidemiology, Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.|$|E

5|$|As a {{reflection}} of categories of sexuality so sharply defined {{by the government and}} society at large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as butches: dressed in men's clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.|$|E

Juliet tries to stop Sun from leaving by telling Jin that Sun had an affair, causing him to angrily back out of the journey at the last minute. After having a heartfelt conversation while fishing with Bernard Nadler, the only other married man on the island, he forgives Sun, who assures him that the baby is his.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema was accepted for an engineering technician position {{in the construction of}} the Straight Creek Tunnel in 1970. Bonnema was restricted from entering the tunnel itself, however, due to the miners' superstition <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> entered underground mines and tunnels would bring bad luck. In 1972 Bonnema filed a $100,000 class action suit against the Colorado Department of Transportation, citing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As Colorado voters had passed the Equal Rights Amendment that year, the state settled Bonnema's case out of court for $6,730. Bonnema entered the tunnel for the first time on November 9, 1972, prompting 66 workers to temporarily walk off the job; most returned the next day. She continued with the project until the tunnel opened.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> have young children {{are less likely to}} die than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. Also, this study was conducted in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a more global perspective on the double burden.|$|E
