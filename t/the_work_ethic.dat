5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>ethic</b> of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E

25|$|With {{extensive}} iron deposits, {{especially in}} the western counties, Virginia was {{a pioneer in the}} iron industry. The first ironworks in the new world was established at Falling Creek in 1619, though it was destroyed in 1622. There would eventually grow to be 80 ironworks, charcoal furnaces and forges with 7,000 hands at any one time, about 70 percent of them slaves. Ironmasters hired slaves from local slave owners because they were cheaper than white workers, easier to control, and could not switch to a better employer. But <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>ethic</b> was weak, because the wages went to the owner, not to the workers, who were forced to work hard, were poorly fed and clothed, and were separated from their families. Virginia's industry increasingly fell behind Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Ohio, which relied on free labor. Bradford (1959) recounts the many complaints about slave laborers and argues the over-reliance upon slaves contributed to the failure of the ironmasters to adopt improved methods of production for fear the slaves would sabotage them. Most of the blacks were unskilled manual laborers, although Lewis (1977) reports that some were in skilled positions.|$|E

40|$|Orientation: As {{a result}} of the {{proliferation}} of unethical behaviour in the workplace, <b>the</b> study of <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> has received new impetus. Research purpose: The research study sought to determine <b>the</b> relationship between <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> and <b>work</b> values, with <b>the</b> objective of determining whether <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> statistically significantly predict work values. Motivation for <b>the</b> study: As <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> (i. e. behavioural intent) are a determinant of work values (i. e. overt behaviour), researchers are investigating their potential in preventing unethical behaviour. Research design, approach and method: A descriptive quantitative research design was employed in the study. A survey was conducted using <b>the</b> Multidimensional <b>Work</b> <b>Ethic</b> Profile and <b>the</b> Values Scale, which in previous studies have produced acceptable Cronbach’s alpha coefficients. Data were collected from 301 respondents in one geographical area in South Africa. Main findings: Work values {{did not appear to be}} highly esteemed by respondents, as only 6 of the 22 dimensions had a positive score. However, all seven dimensions of <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> had positive scores. A negative correlation was found between <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> and <b>work</b> values. In addition, <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> predicted 9 % of <b>the</b> variance in <b>work</b> values, providing sufficient evidence to accept the postulated research hypothesis. Practical implications: The findings of the study could be used by human resource managers to promote ethical behaviour, by focusing not only on <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> but also on <b>the</b> relationship between <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> and <b>work</b> values.
