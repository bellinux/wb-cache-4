Leisure {{is understood as}} a time of personal growth, creation, recreation and participation in society. The main article in this newsletter addresses the issue as a dimension of well-being for the region’s adolescents, explores the activities they carry out, highlighting some gender differences, and raises some challenges. Among them, it discusses the priority given to time spent on freely chosen activities, inclusive and equal access to cultural, recreational and leisure activities, the urgent need to prevent and eliminate child labour, the importance of digital media in adolescents’ recreation {{and the need for}} information sources that can provide a fuller picture of their experiences...|$|E
40|$|Few would {{doubt that}} the {{conditions}} of governance have changed-and continue to change-as the early 21 st century seems to enter a period of profound uncertainty. Yet, at the same time, the world seems alive with a cacophony of approaches-old and new-on how to improve governance and, ultimately, policy outcomes. This collection-the {{first in a series}} of annual editions-seeks to address the implications of the current state of the world in terms of "good governance", i. e. the effective, efficient, and reliable set of legitimate institutions and actors dedicated to dealing with matters of public concern, be it in the field of financial markets (<b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition),</b> health care, security, or migration, and across local, national and international levels. Researchers at The Hertie School of Governance (Berlin, Germany) and other experts examine the current state of governance challenges and innovations from a variety of inter-disciplinary perspectives. This edition features a special set of chapters on the challenges of financial and fiscal governance, the tradeoffs faced by governance actors, and the new arrangements that have emerged or are required to not only address the ongoing crisis but also ensure greater stability into the future. This special section is complemented by chapters introducing basic concepts and models; exploring other global challenges and the reasons behind seemingly lackluster responses to them and highlighting the need for responsible sovereignty; conceptualizing governance innovation and introducing key examples; and assessing existing indicators of governance, while proposing a new framework for collecting, interpreting and applying governance-related informatio...|$|E

40|$|Welcome to the 6 th {{edition of}} the Electronic Journal of Inclusive Education. Providing insight into {{changing}} the attitudes of regular educators concerning inclusive practice and knowledge concerning accommodating students with special learning needs is <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>edition.</b> We also have an article addressing concerns {{about the use of}} behavior modification in public school classrooms. As the conversation continues concerning including students with special needs in regular education classrooms, the need for greater awareness and acceptance of the diversity inherent in the human condition becomes clearer in light of the September 11 th attacks on the World Trade Center. One article highlights dispositions of caring and concern that can be taught in public school classrooms. We also welcome a new member to our editorial board, Dr. Kimberly G. Griffith. Dr. Karen A. Verbeke discusses and identifies strategies and approaches to accommodating students with special needs in the regular classroom. This article also highlights the need for ongoing communication and collaboration between regular and special educators to provide for the needs of all students. Dr. James D. Dunne writes a very cogent rebuttal to the recent criticism of the use of behavior analysis/behavior modification in public school situation. This article highlights four approaches to instruction that have proven to be extremely beneficial not only for students with disabilities but also for all students in general education classrooms. Dr. Dunne provides insight into these well-researched and proven instructional techniques. Dr. Julie K. Ivey and Dr. Kathryn Reinke document changes in pre-service teachers attitudes to inclusive practice due to the interactions and training they have received during a summer program in environmental education. This article reveals the need for pre-service preparation for inclusive practice for both regular and special educators and highlights the resistance by regular educators to inclusive practice and settings. Dr. Everington, Dr. Stevens, and Ms. Kozar-Kocsis surveyed regular educators efforts to differentiate instruction for students with disabilities as well as for unidentified students with different learning needs. Their study reveals that experienced educators can and do differentiate instruction and work 2 ̆ 2 in the spirit of inclusive education. 2 ̆ 2 Dr. Griffith, Dr. Cooper and Dr. Ringlaben provide a paradigm and model for full acceptance of student with disabilities in regular education classrooms. Unique to their approach is the effort to make 2 ̆ 2 students with disabilities part of a circle of relationships rather than the center of relationships 2 ̆ 2. This article highlights the need to teach caring dispositions in public education. This current edition continues the conversation and enhances the knowledge base concerning inclusive practice and access to knowledge within the public school. We hope you enjoy and learn from the reading of it...|$|E
