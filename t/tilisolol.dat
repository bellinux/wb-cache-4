40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to modify the {{biodistribution}} and pharmacokinetics of <b>tilisolol,</b> a Î²-blocker, using the palmitoyl prodrug approach. After intravenous administration of <b>tilisolol</b> and O-palmitoyl <b>tilisolol</b> in rats, drug concentrations were determined in blood, bile, urine, and several tissues. The concentration-time profiles of <b>tilisolol</b> and O-palmitoyl <b>tilisolol</b> were analyzed pharmacokinetically. The blood concentrations of O-palmitoyl <b>tilisolol</b> after intravenous administration of O-palmitoyl <b>tilisolol</b> were about 10 -fold higher than those of <b>tilisolol</b> after intravenous administration of <b>tilisolol.</b> The biliary excretion rates of O-palmitoyl <b>tilisolol</b> and <b>tilisolol</b> after intravenous administration of O-palmitoyl <b>tilisolol</b> were about 10 - to 100 -fold larger than those of <b>tilisolol</b> after intravenous administration of <b>tilisolol.</b> In addition, the hepatic uptake clearance of O-palmitoyl <b>tilisolol</b> after intravenous administration of O-palmitoyl <b>tilisolol</b> was 3. 6 -fold higher than that of <b>tilisolol</b> after the intravenous administration of <b>tilisolol.</b> In the in vitro experiments, it was demonstrated that the distribution ratios between blood cells and plasma (blood/plasma) of O-palmitoyl <b>tilisolol</b> and <b>tilisolol</b> was 95. 7 and 55. 5 %, respectively. These findings suggest that O-palmitoyl <b>tilisolol</b> exists as a binding form with biological components, especially blood cells, in systemic circulation. In conclusion, the palmitoyl prodrug approach is useful as a drug delivery system to deliver the parent drug to the liver...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{characterize}} the transport of <b>tilisolol</b> and timolol through the corneal epithelium, which is believed to be a tight barrier of ocular drug absorption. Cultured normal rabbit corneal epithelial cells (RCEC) were used to investigate drug transport. Primary RCEC were seeded on a filter membrane of Transwell-COL? insert coated with fibronectin and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F- 12 with various supplements. Beta-blocker permeability through the RCEC layer was measured to assess the transcellular permeability coefficient (Ptranscell) in the absence or presence of inhibitors. The transcellular permeability of <b>tilisolol</b> was dependent on drug concentration although timolol showed no concentration dependency. <b>Tilisolol</b> flux from the apical to the basal side was larger than in the opposite direction although timolol showed no direction dependency. The transcellular permeability of <b>tilisolol</b> from the apical to the basal side was inhibited by sodium azide, tetraethylammonium, quinidine, taurocholic acid, guanidine and carnitine. <b>Tilisolol</b> had an active mechanism in uptake to the corneal epithelium, probably by the organic cation transporter family, although timolol predominantly permeated via passive diffusion. This RCEC system was useful to characterize the ocular permeation mechanism of drugs...|$|E
40|$|In medical treatment, it is {{necessary}} to control the behav-ior of drugs for effective treatment, and many {{attempts have been made to}} deliver drugs to target sites by means of drug delivery systems. Recently, the use of high-density lipopro-tein, 1) low-density lipoprotein (LDL), 2, 3) liposomes, 4, 5) and lipid emulsions 5) as drug carriers have been focused on to control drug delivery. However, it is difficult to load hy-drophilic drugs to these hydrophobic carriers because of their poor affinity. Even if the drug carrier exhibited a favorable disposition profile, a rapid release of the incorporated drug often leads to failure to achieve therapeutic potency. 4, 6) Sasaki et al. 5) and Tokunaga et al. 7) demonstrated the drug delivery of mitomycin C lipophilic prodrugs using liposomes and/or lipid emulsions. Sqalli-Houssaini et al. 8) reported the drug delivery of lipophilic prodrugs for anti-HIV drugs to macrophages via LDL pathways. An effective approach to enhance the affinity of drugs to these hydrophobic carriers might be using highly lipophilic prodrugs. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the biodistribution and pharmacokinet-ics of highly lipophilic prodrugs after intravenous adminis-tration to develop these lipid carrier systems; however, little such information has been obtained. We previously synthesized the O-palmitoyl ester prodrug of <b>tilisolol</b> (O-palmitoyl <b>tilisolol)</b> and it showed high lipophilicity compared with <b>tilisolol.</b> 9, 10) In the present study, we evaluated the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics after intravenous administration of O-palmitoyl <b>tilisolol</b> in rats. <b>Tilisolol,</b> which is a b-blocker, was used as a model drug be-cause of its easy detection with fluorescence. 11...|$|E
