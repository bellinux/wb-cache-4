5|$|John Brownlee, who had {{previously}} been offered the job, succeeded Greenfield. Brownlee's reign as government leader was troubled by {{the onset of the}} Great Depression. He resigned in scandal after he was accused of sexual acts with a minor in the Attorney General's office. <b>This</b> <b>and</b> <b>another</b> scandalous divorce by UFA MLA Oran McPherson, speaker of the Legislative Assembly, gave the United Farmers an image of moral decay. In 1934 Richard Reid replaced Brownlee but served as premier for less than two years, leading the United Farmers government into total defeat {{at the hands of the}} new Social Credit party.|$|E
5|$|Scripps began {{trafficking}} in drugs, and carried heroin between Asia and Europe for a syndicate. Singapore authorities first encountered {{his name in}} 1987, {{when he was arrested}} at Heathrow Airport for possessing drugs. Police found a key on him that belonged to a safe deposit box in a bank in Orchard Road in Singapore, from which officers from Singapore's Central Narcotics Bureau seized 1.5kilogrammes (3.3lb) of heroin worth about US$1 million. For <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>another</b> drug offence, Southwark Crown Court in January 1988 sentenced him to seven years in jail. He escaped while on home leave but was later re-arrested. In July 1992, Winchester Crown Court added another six years to the original sentence, which would have kept him behind bars until 2001 had he not escaped again.|$|E

25|$|The decisive {{reckoning}} {{with the}} Ottoman Empire {{was supposed to}} have taken place in 1686, through a coordinated attack of the Holy League allies on the various Ottoman provinces. The coordination turned out to be poor and the large force gathered by John III for a Danube offensive conducted no significant military operations. <b>This</b> <b>and</b> <b>another</b> failed expedition into Moldavia in 1691 mark the twilight of the Commonwealth's military might.|$|E

The COS technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.|$|E

25|$|The network's {{troubles}} with sustaining existing series and gaining new hits {{spilled over into}} its 2010–11 schedule: ABC's dramas during that season continued to fail, with the midseason forensic investigation drama Body of Proof being {{the only one that}} was renewed for a second season. The network also struggled to establish new comedies to support the previous year's debuts, with only late-season premiere Happy Endings earning a second season. Meanwhile, the new lows hit by Brothers & Sisters led to its cancellation, and the previous year's only drama renewal, V, also failed to earn another season after a low-rated midseason run. Despite <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>another</b> noticeable ratings decline, ABC would manage to outrate NBC for third place by a larger margin than the previous year.|$|E

25|$|Governor Paterson's {{directive}} {{was challenged}} as both premature and unconstitutional in an Article 78 proceeding filed on June 3, 2008, against Governor Paterson by the Alliance Defense Fund {{on behalf of}} several state legislators and conservative leaders; this lawsuit failed at all levels. On September 2, 2008, Justice Lucy A. Billings, of the State Supreme Court in Bronx, New York, issued a decision that Governor Paterson acted within his powers when he required state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages from outside the state. Justice Billings found that the governor's order was consistent with state laws on the recognition of marriages from other jurisdictions. The Court of Appeals agreed to hear <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>another</b> case on same-sex marriage recognition in 2009. The Court decided these cases on narrow grounds, finding that the state acted within its authority without reaching the issue of marriage recognition; however, a three-justice minority would have ruled more broadly in support of marriage recognition.|$|E

500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2005, he {{took part in a}} Chicago Cultural Center artist {{exchange}} program exhibition featuring five emerging Chicago contemporary artists and five from Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Half of the ten were women (four from Taiwan). As part of the Crossings exhibition almost all artists had their first chance to exhibit in the country of the others. In this forum, Chicago Tribune art critic Alan G. Artner said Johnson's audio selection imposed his artistry on all the other exhibits since he chose a rap song combined with a blunt video. [...] Artner became a Johnson detractor in 2005 when Johnson had <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>another</b> simultaneous exhibit appearing in Chicago. He described Johnson's exploration of the politics of race as [...] "sloganeering or cute self-advertising" [...] in his two-dimensional works, and his apolytical three-dimensional installations as [...] "glib and superficial" [...] representations. He classified Johnson's work as more suitable for the audience seeking nothing more than American pop culture. [...] The following year, in 2006, Artner derided Johnson's short video contribution to the Art Institute of Chicago's Fool's Paradise exhibition as a [...] "conflation of gospel singing with beat boxing...that says nothing worth saying about race." [...] Other Chicago critics describe Johnson's subsequent work as relatively hip.|$|E

During this time he wrote Scrisorile, Luceafărul, [...] Odă în metru antic etc. Most of his notable editorial pieces belong to this period, when Romania was fighting the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 and throughout the diplomatic race that eventually brought about the international recognition of Romanian independence, but under the condition of bestowing Romanian citizenship to all subjects of Jewish faith.

As a result, the money previously earmarked for <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>another</b> controversial project, the Knik Arm Bridge, a total of $442 million, was to be made available for transportation projects generally.

Nevertheless, the government survived <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>another</b> interpellation on 31 October 1995. The situation changed after the collapse of two commercial banks in December 1995. It emerged that Prime Minister Šleževičius had withdrawn his savings from one of the two banks just days before its collapse. After refusing to resign, he was forced out by the Seimas in a secret-ballot vote on 19 December 1995, with 94 members supporting his ousting. Laurynas Stankevičius, a minister in the Šleževičius cabinet, was approved by the Seimas on 15 February 1996 as the Prime Minister of the seventh government and served until the end of the term of the Seimas.|$|E
