40|$|Nowadays, mortage {{business}} is not merely managed by State Pawnshop. Many {{people are likely to}} utilize the pawnshop as a beneficial business opportunity, considering the high demand of pawns in the society. Therefore, most people prefer the alternative pawnshop industry due to its more flexible requirements and regulations in getting loans than the State PawnshopÂ’s. Regarding the fact, the alternative pawnshop industry provides both small and large scale of loans easily, quickly, and safely. The research problems were how the social capital was generated by the alternative pawnshop industry Aneka Usaha Karya, and how the society preference worked on the industry. The study was conducted at the alternative pawnshop industry Aneka Usaha Karya, in Cepokomulyo sub-district, Kepanjen district, Malang Regency. In employed a descriptive qualitative design with proposive sampling. The data werw taken from observation, interview, and documentation. The analytical framework was based on Sociology theory, used social capital and <b>rational</b> <b>choise</b> <b>theory</b> of James Coleman. The findings showed that the social capital generated by the alternative pawnshop industry comprised aspects of trust, network, and norm influencing society preferences to fulfill their needs. The aspect of trust consisted of: (1) the quality of goods (2) well-maintained communication, and (3) customersÂ’ satisfaction. The aspect of social network covered the society and broker interaction. The aspect of norm involved: (1) the interest payment by the customer (2) the redemption limit for an auction (3) the pawnshopÂ’s obligation to compensate the broken pawn goods by returning it or paying some money to the customer. Certainly, the social capital led to society preference. The preferences provided benefits, such as: (1) more linient criteria of pawn goods (2) more flexible procedures, and (3) the bonus for loyal customers...|$|R

The writer used is <b>Rational</b> <b>choise</b> by James Coleman. The reason take James Coleman?s theory because a changing plants done by people there from rice and corn become commercial plant which give more advantages such as Kayu Sengon.

From kayu sengon disposal, people can build a house, buy motorcycle and also go to Mekkah so that can increase people social status especially in Meninjo village.
