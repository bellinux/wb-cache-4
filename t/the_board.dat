40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to clarify the pattern of ex-ante control of <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> of Education by mayors under <b>the</b> new <b>Board</b> of Education system, using the principal-agent theory.

According to the principal-agent theory, this system gives them a power to control over <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> of Education by mayors. The following is the finding of this research. In some municipalities, mayors tend to strengthen a control over <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> of Education: on the other hand, in the other municipalities, mayors tend to loosen a control over <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> of Education. As a result, mayors do not always exert power to control <b>the</b> <b>Boards</b> of Education...|$|R
