5|$|Mulder {{realizes that}} Crump is in a {{considerable}} amount of pain and that the only way <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be the only thing to help ease the pain of the increasing pressure.|$|E

Elizabeth gave birth to three {{children}} {{over the next four}} years: Mary Vinton, George Sears, and Francis Vinton Greene. While assigned to Fort Sullivan in Eastport, Maine in 1833, tragedy struck Greene's family: Elizabeth and all three of their children died within seven months, probably from tuberculosis. <b>To</b> <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> on his mind and to escape the isolation and loneliness of peacetime Army garrison duty, he immersed himself in study of both the law and medicine, coming close to professional certification in both by the time he resigned his commission in 1836 to become a civil engineer.|$|E

5000|$|Post the {{completion}} of the initial assessment, a more detailed diagnosis is done using questionnaires. The therapist shall diagnose both the actual profile as well as the structural profile of the patient. Such a diagnosis will define the target which both the therapist and the patient would want to achieve once the treatment is complete. Here, the therapist will evaluate different other ways to treat the patient. Often, relaxation tapes are used to calm down the patient. Besides psychotherapy, the therapist will try to include dietary measures and stress management programs to treat patient's associated psychiatric symptoms. The prime focus of the therapist would be <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> of <b>the</b> patient and fulfill his/her needs by studying his/her behavior and mannerisms.|$|R
25|$|While {{work with}} cadavers had aroused some opposition, {{primarily}} from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no <b>pain,</b> and <b>the</b> indignity of their situations was directly related <b>to</b> <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> of <b>the</b> living. Animal research, {{on the other}} hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights {{groups such as the}} ASPCA were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and tell them what they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen ethical dilemmas in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.|$|R
5000|$|According to the author's introduction, {{the book}} was {{originally}} conceived in 1970 as {{a call to action}} that would contain cautionary tales from Ellison's previous books. Over the ensuing protracted gestation period of four years, however, Harlan Ellison's personal outlook had gradually changed. This resulted in the inclusion of previously uncollected stories with underlying themes of disillusionment and futility in rebelling. Classic examples along these lines are the dystopian [...] "Knox" [...] and [...] "Silent in Gehenna". Other notable stories include [...] "One Life, Furnished in Early Poverty" [...] which depicts a man meeting a younger version of himself as a child and finding himself unable <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> of his own childhood. The encounter begins at Lathrop Grade School in Painesville, Ohio where the author himself attended elementary school and experienced many emotionally painful and physically brutal encounters with antisemitic prejudice recounted in the introduction.|$|R

25|$|In antiquity, {{pitches and}} resins were used {{commonly}} as medicines. Pliny mentions {{a variety of}} tar-like substances being used as medicine, including cedria and pissinum. Cedria was the pitch and resin of the cedar tree, being equivalent to the oil of tar and pyroligneous acid which {{are used in the}} first stage of distilling creosote. He recommends cedria <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> in a toothache, as an injection in the ear in case of hardness of hearing, to kill parasitic worms, as a preventative for impregnation, as a treatment for phthiriasis and porrigo, as an antidote for the poison of the sea hare, as a liniment for elephantiasis, and as an ointment to treat ulcers both on the skin and in the lungs. He further speaks of cedria being used as the embalming agent for preparing mummies. Pissinum was a tar water that was made by boiling cedria, spreading wool fleeces over the vessels to catch the steam, and then wringing them out.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{following}} Willow's {{reconciliation with}} Tara, Warren (Adam Busch), {{one of the}} Trio, shoots Buffy; a stray shot kills Tara {{right in front of}} Willow. In an explosion of rage and grief, Willow soaks up all the dark magic she can, which turns her hair and eyes black. In the final episodes of the season Willow becomes exceedingly strong, surviving unharmed when Warren hits her in the back with an axe. She hunts Warren, tortures him by slowly pushing a bullet into his body, then kills him by magically flaying him. Unsatisfied, she attempts to kill the other two members of the Trio but is unsuccessful due to her weakening power. She solves this problem by killing her 'dealer' from earlier in the season and draining him of his magic. When she is confronted by Buffy they begin to fight, only to be stopped by Giles who has borrowed magic from a coven of wiccans. Willow successfully drains him of this borrowed magic, fulfilling his plan and causing her to feel all the pain of everyone in the world. She tries <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> by destroying the world, finally to be stopped by Xander.|$|E

500|$|Marie {{gave birth}} to her first child, Prince Carol, only nine months after the marriage, on 15 October 1893. Although Marie {{requested}} the use of chloroform in order <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> of labour, doctors were reluctant to do so, believing that [...] "women must pay in agony for the sins of Eve". After Marie's mother and Queen Victoria insisted, King Carol eventually allowed the use of the drug on his niece-in-law. Marie did not derive much joy from the arrival of her firstborn, later writing that she [...] "felt like turning [...] head to the wall". Similarly, although Marie was constantly reminded by Carol's wife Elisabeth that childbirth is [...] "the most glorious moment in [...] life", she could only feel a longing for her mother at the birth of her second child, Princess Elisabeth, in 1894.

5000|$|The ode {{is written}} {{in the form of}} a prayer to Aphrodite, goddess of love, from a speaker who longs for the attentions of an unnamed woman. The sex of Sappho's beloved is {{established}} from only a single word, the feminine εθελοισα in line 24. This reading, now accepted as standard, was first proposed in 1835 by Theodor Bergk. [...] Sappho asks <b>the</b> goddess <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> of her unrequited love for this girl; after being thus invoked, Aphrodite appears to Sappho, telling her that the girl who has rejected her advances will in time pursue her in turn. The poem concludes with another call for the goddess to assist the speaker in all her amorous struggles. With its reference to a female beloved, the [...] "Ode to Aphrodite" [...] is (along with Sappho 31) one of the few extant works of Sappho that provides evidence that she loved other women. [...] The poem contains few clues to the performance context, though Stefano Caciagli suggests that it may have been written for an audience of Sappho's female friends.|$|R

2500|$|On {{arrival in}} Italy, {{he moved into}} a villa on the Spanish Steps in Rome, today the Keats–Shelley Memorial House museum. Despite care from Severn and Dr. James Clark, his health rapidly deteriorated. The medical {{attention}} Keats received may have hastened his death. In November 1820, Clark declared {{that the source of}} his illness was [...] "mental exertion" [...] and that the source was largely situated in his stomach. Clark eventually diagnosed consumption (tuberculosis) and placed Keats on a starvation diet of an anchovy and a piece of bread a day intended to reduce the blood flow to his stomach. He also bled the poet; a standard treatment of the day, but was likely a significant contributor to Keats's weakness. Severn's biographer Sue Brown writes: [...] "They could have used opium in small doses, and Keats had asked Severn to buy a bottle of opium when they were setting off on their voyage. What Severn didn't realise was that Keats saw it as a possible resource if he wanted to commit suicide. He tried to get the bottle from Severn on the voyage but Severn wouldn't let him have it. Then in Rome he tried again... Severn was in such a quandary he didn't know what to do, so in the end he went to the doctor who took it away. As a result Keats went through dreadful agonies with nothing <b>to</b> <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> at all."
