As corporations become larger and multinational, their influence and interests go further accordingly. Being able to influence and own most media companies, {{it is hard to}} be able to publicly debate the notions and ideals that corporations pursue. Some choices that corporations <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> profits can affect people all over the world. Sometimes fatally.|$|E
5|$|Welcome to Alflolol (Bienvenue sur Alflolol) brings Laureline's rebellious {{nature to}} the fore; unlike Valérian, {{she has not}} been born and raised by Galaxity and is {{prepared}} not only to question Galaxity's authorities but to rebel openly against them when their orders run contrary to her sense of morality. It also demonstrates her impulsive streak; she sides with the native Alflololians against Galaxity and Valérian with no thought for the personal consequences she may have to face herself. Her position as the true star of the series is cemented in Ambassador of the Shadows (L'Ambassadeur des Ombres), which is virtually a solo adventure for her as she searches the vast space station Point Central for the kidnapped Valérian and the Earth Ambassador. Later, when acting as independent agents, it is Laureline who questions the ethics of some of the jobs they are forced to <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> ends meet, notably in The Living Weapons (Les Armes Vivantes).|$|E

500|$|In the {{literature}} concerning artificial intelligence, Searle's essay has been {{second only to}} Turing's in the volume of debate it has generated. [...] Searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients it would <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a machine conscious: all he proposed was that what was needed was [...] "causal powers" [...] {{of the sort that}} the brain has and that computers lack. But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary (though perhaps still not sufficient) extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the Turing test, but the robotic version, which requires grounding the robot's words in the robot's sensorimotor capacity to categorize and interact with the things in the world that its words are about, Turing-indistinguishably from a real person. Turing-scale robotics is an empirical branch of research on embodied cognition and situated cognition.|$|E

500|$|The lead {{designer}} for the game's AI was Yoichiro Miyake, {{who was one}} of the core team members for the game's engine. Miyake, whose reputation designing quality AI had landed him the position, had an initial concept of creating an AI that would learn and memorize new actions, creating a smooth flow through the various steps it needed to <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a smoother and more advanced experience. At the start of its development, the developers used the two standard [...] "classic" [...] designs for AIs for reference: behavior-based, which revolved around adaptation and decision making, and state-based, which made decisions based on the environment. For XV, it was decided to create an advanced hybrid of these basic behavioral AI functions. Due to the way Luminous Studio's staff was structured, the team first needed to develop an easy-to-understand tool for managing and developing the AI. This tool was dubbed the [...] "Luminous AI Graph", which represented the multi-layered construction of an AI. The amount of effort put into the AI was directly inspired by experiences of developing games for the previous console generation: the emphasis had been put on graphics, causing the AI and other gameplay-related elements to suffer. Between the release of its commercial demo and the full release, the AI underwent further refinement.|$|E

2500|$|Among the ACA's other provisions, Price {{is opposed}} to the bill's elimination, under most health {{insurance}} plans, of co-pays for birth control. Price defended his position on this issue in a 2012 interview, by suggesting {{that there are no}} women in the country who have ever struggled to pay for birth control. He said, [...] "Bring me one woman who has been left behind. Bring me one. There's not one." [...] Numerous media outlets have refuted this assertion. In 2017, during his confirmation hearing to become Secretary of Health and Human Services, Price was questioned about this comment and responded, [...] ""What I meant is that when I had patients in my office who could not afford a medication we did everything we could to make sure they could have it.

2500|$|The {{title of}} A+E refers to Accident and Emergency rooms, while its cover {{art is a}} picture of a scraped knee. Coxon himself took the picture. Most of the songs on it feature synths and drum machine beats. The single [...] "What'll It Take" [...] is an upbeat song that {{features}} two vocal hooks: [...] "What'll it <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> you people dance?" [...] and [...] "I don't know what's really wrong with me". A music video was released for it. [...] "Seven Naked Valleys" [...] is a post-punk track featuring saxophone that ends with [...] "piercing synth frequency". Opening track [...] "Advice" [...] and [...] "Running for Your Life" [...] have [...] "buzzsaw-guitar" [...] and sardonic lyrics on culture. The former's lyrics are about a bad experience Coxon had at a house party in Brentwood, Essex. At the party, he and some other friends danced to a Smiths record that they used to replace another tape which was playing. As a result, they got beaten up and {{spent the rest of the}} night walking around Brentwood thinking of how they would get home. The latter's lyrics are about the [...] "violence of a suburban night out." [...] "Bah Singer" [...] has indecipherable distorted lyrics, and the following track, [...] "Knife in the Cast", is a ballad driven by bass guitar. [...] The final track, [...] "Ooh, Yeh Yeh", is a grunge-pop song that has been described as a [...] "cowboy lullaby".|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{factor for}} {{classifying}} the par {{of a relatively}} straight, hazard-free hole is {{the distance from the}} tee to the green. A typical par-3 hole is less than 250 yards (225 m) in length, with a par-4 hole ranging between 251 and 475 yards (225–434 m), and a par-5 hole being longer than 475 yards (435 m). The rare par-6s can stretch well over [...] These distances are based on the typical scratch golfer's drive distance of between a green further than the average player's drive will require additional shots from the fairway. However, other considerations must be taken into account; the key question is [...] "how many strokes would a scratch golfer <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the green by playing along the fairway?". The grade of the land from the tee to the hole might increase or decrease the carry and rolling distance of shots as measured linearly along the ground. Sharp turns or hazards may require golfers to [...] "lay up" [...] on the fairway in order to change direction or hit over the hazard with their next shot. These design considerations will affect how even a scratch golfer would play the hole, irrespective of total distance from tee to green, and must be included in a determination of par. However, a par score never includes [...] "expected" [...] penalty strokes, as a scratch player is never [...] "expected" [...] to hit a ball into a water hazard or other unplayable situation. So, the placement of hazards only affect par when considering how a scratch golfer would avoid them.|$|E
