40|$|Killer whales vocalisations include {{repertoires}} of stereotyped call types (Ford 1984). There {{is strong}} evidence that these vocalisations are learnt (Hoelzel and Osborne 1986; Bain 1989; Deecke et al. 2000; Yurk et al. 2002). Call types can be group specific or shared amongst a number of groups, depending upon the social structure of the population or the call type (Ford 1991; Deecke 2003). It is thought that these call types function in the group cohesion and coordination (Hoelzel and Osborne 1986; Ford 1989 1991; Miller 2000, 2002). Some call types contain two overlapping, independently modulated, components each having different transmission properties (Miller 2002), these call types have a higher estimated active space than single- component call types (Miller 2006). This thesis investigates the evolution of these call type repertoires, focusing on call type usage {{and structure of the}} Southern Resident population over a period of 27 years, but including comparisons with other populations. I present evidence of hetero-specific mimicry and further evidence for vocal production and usage learning in killer whales. I compared the relative frequency of use of call types between two time periods (1977 - 81 & 2001 - 2003) and between contexts, such as direction changes with directional travel and multi-pod aggregations with single pods. I found a strong correlation of relative call type usage for each pod between the two time periods and each pod was easily acoustically distinguishable from the other two pods in both periods. The implications of these results for a role of call type repertoires in kin recognition are discussed. The least cohesive pod produced a significantly higher proportion of two-component call types than the other two more cohesive pods. Lone whales separated from their pod also used a rare subset of two-component call types rather than their pod's main call types. In recordings of multi-pod aggregations I recorded a high proportion of the same subset of two-component call types not commonly produced by any of the three pods individually, these call types were used in significantly higher proportions when all three pods were converging or socialising rather than travelling. These contextual correlates suggest that call types are selectively used and shared between groups based on their transmission properties. Each of the Southern Resident pods, J к and L, were found to increase the duration of their primary call type 10 - 15 % in the presence of vessel noise in recordings made between 2001 & 2003. This response was not detected in recording from two earlier time periods, (1977 or 1989 - 1992). This change in behaviour correlated with an increase over the past decade in vessel presence around this population and may be an anti-masking strategy. I also compared the range and mean minimum and maximum fundamental frequency of the call types within the repertoires of six North Pacific killer whale populations. There was a degree of homogeneity in the range of call type fundamental frequencies within the repertoires of populations of the same ecotype, but differences between ecotypes. Offshore call types generally had a higher pitch fundamental frequency than transient or resident call types. All three resident populations had call types in their repertoires that had a maximum fundamental frequency 3 kHz higher than found in any <b>transient</b> <b>call</b> type...|$|E

40|$|Movement of Ca 2 + from {{intracellular}} stores {{into the}} cytosol {{is an essential}} component of excitation–contraction coupling in muscle. In cardiac and smooth muscle, Ca 2 + is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in response to Ca 2 + influx by a process of Ca 2 +-induced Ca 2 + release (CICR). First described by Lederer and coworkers in cardiac myocytes (Cheng et al., 1993), highly localized cytosolic Ca 2 + <b>transients,</b> <b>called</b> Ca 2 + sparks, originating from ryanodine-sensitive Ca 2 +-release channels (ryanodine receptors [RyRs]) in the SR membrane, are thought to be the elementary intracellular Ca 2 + release events in excitation–contraction coupling, not only in cardiac muscle but also in skeletal (Klein et al., 1996) and smooth muscle (Nelson et al., 1995). RyRs are formed by a family of intracellular Ca 2 + channel subunits (RyR 1 – 3), which span the SR membrane of all muscle cells. RyR 1 is limited primarily to skeletal muscle, and cardiac cells express chiefly RyR 2 (Fill and Copello, 2002). Although RyR 2 and RyR 3 may be functional there is sufficient evidence to suggest that RyR 2 predominates with respect to Ca 2 + sparks in smooth muscle (Ji et al., 2004). Smooth muscle Ca 2 + sparks, which result from a concerted opening of clusters of RyRs (Blatter et al., 1997; Mejia-Alvarez et al., 1999), generate microdomains of elevated (> 10 μM) Ca 2 + without changing global intracellula...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As {{the power}} system is very vast {{and it is}} having variety of loads {{connected}} to it, the chances of occurring transients are large. Transients occur in a power system due to a fault on transmission lines, loss of a large load or sudden loss of generation. The ability of a power system to maintain synchronism when subjected to a severe <b>transient</b> disturbance is <b>called</b> <b>transient</b> stability. The control of transient stability {{plays a significant role}} in ensuring the stable operation of power system when the large disturbances and faults occur in the power system. To improve the transient stability various FACTS devices are used.

40|$|Gravitational wave {{observations}} need accompanying electromagnetic {{signals to}} accurately determine the sky {{positions of the}} sources. The ejecta of neutron star mergers are expected to produce such electromagnetic <b>transients,</b> <b>called</b> macronovae. Characteristics of the ejecta include large velocity gradients {{and the presence of}} heavy $r$-process elements, which pose significant challenges to the accurate calculation of radiative opacities and radiation transport. For example, these opacities include a dense forest of bound-bound features arising from near-neutral lanthanide and actinide elements. Here we investigate the use of fine-structure, line-smeared opacities that preserve the integral of the opacity over frequency, which is an alternative approach to the expansion-opacity formalism. The use of area-preserving line profiles produces frequency-dependent opacities that are one to two orders of magnitude greater than those obtained with the use of expansion opacities in the Sobolev approximation. Opacities are calculated for four $r$-process elements (cerium, neodymium, samarium and uranium) using fully and semi-relativistic methods, as well as different amounts of configuration interaction in the atomic structure, in order to test the sensitivity of the emission to the underlying atomic physics. We determine the effect of these new opacities on simulated spectra and broad-band light curves by applying a multi-dimensional ray-trace method to the ejecta predicted from 3 -dimensional merger calculations. With our substantially larger opacities the simulations yield slightly lower luminosities that peak in the mid-IR. These results suggest that those radioactively powered transients that are related to the very heaviest $r$-process material are more difficult to observe than previously believed.

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) underlies many mitochondrial functions, including Ca(2 +) influx into the mitochondria, which {{allows them to}} serve as buffers of intracellular Ca(2 +). Spontaneous depolarizations of DeltaPsi(m), flickers, have been observed in isolated mitochondria and intact cells using the fluorescent cationic lipophile tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), which distributes across the inner {{mitochondrial membrane}} {{in accordance with the}} Nernst equation. Flickers in cardiomyocytes have been attributed to uptake of Ca(2 +) released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via ryanodine receptors in focal <b>transients</b> <b>called</b> Ca(2 +) sparks. We have shown previously that an increase in global Ca(2 +) in smooth muscle cells causes an increase in mitochondrial Ca(2 +) and depolarization of DeltaPsi(m). Here we sought to determine whether flickers in smooth muscle cells are caused by uptake of Ca(2 +) released focally in Ca(2 +) sparks. High-speed three-dimensional imaging was used to monitor DeltaPsi(m) in freshly dissociated myocytes from toad stomach that were simultaneously voltage clamped at 0 mV to ensure the cytosolic TMRE concentration was constant and equal to the low level in the bath (2. 5 nM). This approach allows quantitative analysis of flickers as we have previously demonstrated. Depletion of SR Ca(2 +) not only failed to eliminate flickers but rather increased their magnitude and frequency somewhat. Flickers were not altered in magnitude or frequency by ryanodine or xestospongin C, inhibitors of intracellular Ca(2 +) release, or by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the permeability transition pore. Focal Ca(2 +) release from the SR does not cause flickers in the cells employed here...|$|R

The shape of spikes and the pattern of oscillations in a given cell differ depending on the agonist of the phosphoinositide pathway that is applied. In this study, the response of individual rat hepatocytes to maximal stimulation by arginine vasopressin (AVP), phenylephrine and ADP was investigated by fluorescence microscopy and flash photolysis. Hepatocytes loaded with Ca 2 +-sensitive probes were stimulated with a first agonist to evoke a maximal response, and then a second agonist was added. When phenylephrine or ADP {{was used as the}} first agonist, AVP applied subsequently could elicit an additional response, which did not happen when AVP was first applied and phenylephrine or ADP was applied later. Cells microinjected with caged myo-inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) were challenged with the different agonists and, when a maximal response was obtained, photorelease of IP 3 was triggered. Cells maximally stimulated with AVP did not respond to IP 3 photorelease, whereas those stimulated with phenylephrine or ADP responded with a fast Ca 2 + spike above the elevated steady-state level, which was followed by an undershoot. In contrast, with all three agonists, IP 3 photorelease triggered at the top of an oscillatory Ca 2 + transient was able to mobilize additional Ca 2 +. These experiments indicate that the differential response of cells to agonists is found not only during Ca 2 + oscillations but also during maximal agonist stimulation and that potency and efficacy differences exist among agonists...|$|R

Ryanodine (10 µm) decreased the amplitude of NCTs by 45 ± 6 %. Cyclopiazonic acid slowed the recovery of NCTs (from a time course of 200 ± 10 ms to 800 ± 100 ms).
