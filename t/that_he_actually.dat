Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing in front of a live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb.

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Bleach in June 1989, Nirvana {{embarked}} on its first national tour, and the album became a favorite of college radio stations.

5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E

Bret Hart claimed in a 2014 interview that WWF owner Vince McMahon had worked out the title-change match with Flair and Savage before hand, {{and that he was}} angry when they returned to the dressing room after the match because they had failed to do much of what was agreed upon. McMahon was that angry <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> made them go straight back out and re-do the whole match.

5|$|This {{policy was}} {{realized}} as NSC-68, a classified report {{issued by the}} United States National Security Council in April 1950 and written by Paul Nitze, Kennan's successor as director of policy planning. Kennan and Charles Bohlen, another State Department expert on Russia, argued about the wording of NSC-68, which became the basis of Cold War policy. Kennan rejected the idea that Stalin had a grand design for world conquest implicit in Nitze's report and argued <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> feared overextending Russian power. Kennan even argued that NSC-68 {{should not have been}} drafted at all, as it would make U.S. policies too rigid, simplistic, and militaristic. Acheson overruled Kennan and Bohlen, endorsing the assumption of Soviet menace implied by NSC-68.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Nimoy {{begins the}} episode hosting {{a show about}} alien {{encounter}}s. He talks about an encounter in a town called Springfield. At Moe's on a Friday night, a drunk Homer is forced to walk home, but takes a wrong path and {{ends up in the}} woods. In a clearing, he sees a glowing, thin-boned alien. Homer panics and runs home screaming. The rest of the family do not believe Homer's story and his attempts to report the alien sighting to police are dismissed. Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the FBI hear of the sighting and go to investigate. After receiving no results from their psychological tests of him, Homer fails to provide any proof <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> saw an alien.

5|$|John Cena and Chris Jericho were {{involved}} in the main rivalry on the Raw brand over the World Heavyweight Championship. At WWE's November Survivor Series, Cena returned to the WWE after a legitimate neck injury (that he sustained at SummerSlam) and defeated Jericho to win the championship. On the November 24 episode of Raw, Jericho defeated Randy Orton and Batista in a Triple Threat match to earn a title match against Cena at Armageddon. Later that night, Chris Jericho attempted to steal Cena's thunder, claiming that he plans on winning back the title at Armageddon. When World Champion, John Cena could even make his much anticipated return to Raw, he then gave Jericho an opportunity to confront him face-to-face, Cena explained the difference between himself and Jericho, stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>actually</b> cares about the many members of the WWE Universe. After Jericho once again stated his intention to beat Cena at Armageddon and continued to belittle the WWE Universe, Cena snapped. He proceeded to brutalize Jericho, throwing him against the announce table, bludgeoning him with the steel stairs and locking him into an STFU. On the following week's episode of Raw, Jericho made his presence known {{in much the same way}} as Cena did the week before, addressing the audience as he made his way through the crowd down to the ring. The difference however, was that while Cena welcomed his fans, Jericho made pains to ignore them. He then went on to explain his resentment toward Cena, stating that while away from the WWE since August 2005, Jericho's son grew to be a fan, not of his father, but of John Cena. Now, Jericho hopes to show his son and all of the WWE what a real hero is, by beating Cena for the World Heavyweight Title at Armageddon. Later that night, Cena fought Kane in Raw's main event. Though Jericho attempted to become involved, Cena managed to fight off and then go on to defeat Kane. After the match, Cena chased Jericho, who was attempting to escape. The tables turned, however, when Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Manu emerged to attack Cena, allowing Jericho to lock Cena in the Walls of Jericho.|$|E
