5|$|The {{video is}} {{centered}} on Maroon 5 playing in a dimly-lit house/factory. Throughout {{the course of the}} video, items such as darts on a dart board, candles, pictures, and even members of the band with their instruments are shown fading in and out. Towards the end of the video, Adam Levine is seen walking through a narrow corridor dragging a guitar with pictures {{on both sides of the}} wall fading in and out. When he reaches <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor,</b> he is face to face with a wall with a small light coming out of it and then flings his guitar backwards and then pounds on the wall. The camera then quickly moves to a scene of the band playing and the lights suddenly flickering on.|$|E

They split into two groups – Trillian, Zaphod and Ford explore a tunnel, whilst Arthur and Marvin remain on the surface. Trillian, Zaphod and Ford's thread ends on a cliff-hanger, with them seeing something alarming at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are very}} few archaeological sources {{contemporaneous}} with Neferefre, a fact which is now seen by Egyptologists, including Miroslav Verner, to witness a very short reign. In particular, as of 2017, only one inscription dated to his rule is known. It was left by the builders of his pyramid on a corner block at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> leading down to the pyramid substructures. The inscription was written {{on the fourth day}} of the Akhet season in the year of first occurrence of the cattle count, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom although recent reappraisals have led Egyptologists to posit a less regular and somewhat more frequent count. Therefore, the inscription is likely to refer to Neferefre's first or second year on the throne, and his third year at the very latest. Finally, a few artefacts dated to Neferefre's rule or shortly after have been uncovered in his mortuary complex and elsewhere in Abusir, such a clay seals bearing his Horus name.|$|E

2500|$|Former inmate Leon [...] "Whitey" [...] Thompson, {{who worked}} as a guide at Alcatraz for many years and later visited it {{regularly}} before his death in 2005, believed that Alcatraz Island is haunted and has stated that [...] "he could feel it" [...] while he was incarcerated there. [...] He later believed the prison to be [...] "damned", and often had the sense of being watched by spirits. During his time in the prison, Thompson was friendly with an inmate named Johnny Haus, a big Texan. He last saw him on 25 October 1962 when he left Alcatraz and knew he'd never see Haus again. One day in the 1980s when Thompson was alone in the cellhouse waiting for visitors to arrive for a tour, he claimed to have seen a large dark figure {{at the end of the}} [...] "Michigan Avenue" [...] corridor. [...] He saw the apparition walk around the corner and out of sight. Thompson rushed to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor,</b> but nobody was there. He believed the ghost to be that of Haus, by the way he walked and the feeling which the figure gave off. [...] Afterwards, Thompson said [...] "I don't care what anybody says, that was Johnny Haus".|$|E
