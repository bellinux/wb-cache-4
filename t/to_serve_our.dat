25|$|The {{relationship}} of homo sapiens {{to the other}} animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>our</b> superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entail in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible {{that we do not}} notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.|$|E
