25|$|B {{were very}} strong characters, {{with a very}} {{specific}} type of humor and very loyal fans, {{and of course they}} were instantly identifiable. I felt that referencing them in Daria, while we were trying to establish the new characters and the different type of humor, ran the risk of setting up false expectations and disappointment in the viewers – which could lead to a negative reaction to the new show and its different tone. So we steered clear of B in the early going, and once the new show was established, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> need to harken back to the old one.|$|E
500|$|Elisabeth Moss {{said she}} was not told by Weiner that Peggy would be leaving SCDP [...] "until we were {{shooting}} episode 10, the one right before it. It was unusual that he didn't tell me. He usually tells me what's happening, pitches me things to ask me how they sound." [...] Moss' initial reaction [...] "was just one of feeling like <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> other logical way to go for her. After {{everything that had happened}} for five years, she can't just keep butting her head up against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don." [...] Moss also said, [...] "I will thank [...] forever for not telling me. It would have made my life harder. I knew about Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not be in my head. Not knowing Peggy would quit allowed me to find it for myself, to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season." ...|$|E

500|$|Hetfield {{stated that}} the album was written with [...] "a lot of passion". He said, [...] "There's two years of {{condensed}} emotion in this. We've gone {{through a lot of}} personal changes, struggles, epiphanies, it's deep. It's so deep lyrically and musically. [...] is just the best that it can be from us right now." [...] The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing. The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt {{and did not want to}} [...] "mess with it". Rock commented, [...] "I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else sounds. To me, this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> time to get amazing performances out of James. We liked the raw performances. And we didn't do what everyone does and what I've been guilty of for a long time, which is tuning vocals. We just did it, boom, and that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|Gooch thus {{took over}} again as England captain {{for the tour}} to West Indies {{in the winter of}} 1989–90 (he had not played well in the 1989 Ashes, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> other {{credible}} candidate as captain, and the West Indies made no objection, having officially ended the [...] "life" [...] bans of their own rebel South Africa tourists after six years) with only a couple of veterans in an otherwise almost new-look team: surprising everybody by winning one Test (their first victory over the Windies since 1974) and drawing another before injury forced him out of the team, his hand being broken by fast bowler Ezra Moseley - ironically, Moseley {{was the only one of}} West Indies' rebel tourists to play international cricket after their ban was lifted. [...] Gooch was replaced as captain for the remainder of the series by Allan Lamb (himself South African-born), who lost both of his matches in charge. Gooch went on to captain England the following summer against New Zealand and India at home, remaining in that position almost exclusively until 1993 and bringing England a degree of success that they had not experienced for almost a decade, at least at home: the 1991 home series against the West Indies, in fact, was a hard-fought 2-2 draw, and England reached the World Cup final for the second successive time the following winter (which was much less of a surprise - even when their Test record was at its worst, England were one of the leading one-day sides of the time, often winning the one-day series even when a Test series was lost, including both the otherwise disastrous 1988 and 1989 summers.) For much of this period, he was also rated as one of the world's leading batsmen. Away from home, though, England were not so strong, losing heavily to Australia in 1990-1 and to India and Sri Lanka in 1992-3, though these were either side of a series victory in New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|The CW {{initially}} considered {{bringing the}} show {{back for a}} shortened, 13-episode season but then decided against the idea. On May 3, 2007, the network announced that the series would not be renewed. Graham explained {{that the possibility of}} returning fell through because [...] "We were {{trying to find a way}} we [...] could have a slightly easier schedule, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> way to do that and still have it be Gilmore Girls." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have pointed out}} that the 1953 English translation of The Second Sex by H. M. Parshley, frequently reissued, is poor. The reviewer from The New York Times described the zoologist hired to do the translation as having [...] "a college undergraduate’s knowledge of French." [...] The delicate vocabulary of philosophical concepts is frequently mistranslated, and great swaths of the text have been excised. [...] The English publication rights to the book are owned by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc and although the publishers had been made aware of the problems with the English text, they long stated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> need for a new translation, even though Beauvoir herself explicitly requested one in a 1985 interview: [...] "I would like very much for another translation of The Second Sex to be done, one that is much more faithful; more complete and more faithful." ...|$|E
2500|$|In spring 2009, {{the band}} began {{recording}} material for its third studio album. However, on July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker announced via the band's official website {{that the two}} were leaving the band. In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want}} to do?' and I said, 'Well, I think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going to say the same thing,'" [...] Ross recalled. [...] "And <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." [...] Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross – and, by extension, Walker – was interested in making retro-inspired rock.|$|E
2500|$|Brando's {{performance}} was glowingly reviewed by critics. [...] "I {{thought it would}} be interesting to play a gangster, maybe for the first time in the movies, who wasn't like those bad guys Edward G. Robinson played, but who is kind of a hero, a man to be respected," [...] Brando recalled in his autobiography. [...] "Also, because he had so much power and unquestioned authority, I {{thought it would be}} an interesting contrast to play him as a gentle man, unlike Al Capone, who beat up people with baseball bats." [...] Duvall later marveled to A's Biography, [...] "He minimized the sense of beginning. In other words he, like, deemphasized the word action. He would go in front of that camera just like he was before. Cut! It was all the same. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> beginning. I learned a lot from watching that." [...] Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, but he declined it, becoming the second actor to refuse a Best Actor award (after George C. Scott for Patton). He boycotted the award ceremony, instead sending American Indian rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather, who appeared in full Apache attire, to state Brando's reasons, which were based on his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, Peter Steele {{had formed}} Type O Negative in 1990 {{out of the}} {{remnants}} of his former thrash metal band Carnivore. With their debut album Slow, Deep and Hard in 1991, the New York based outfit pursued a [...] "melodramatic goth rock style" [...] that [...] "encompasses long songs built on simple riffs, theatrical shouting vocals, churchy-sounding organ and vocal-harmony passages, and the odd mechanical noise". The Origin of the Feces followed in 1992, but it was their third album Bloody Kisses in 1993 that became their breakthrough album. AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey noted that the album had a [...] "twistedly affectionate send-up of goth rock conventions" [...] and lyrics that [...] "gleefully wallow in goth clichés— sex, death, Christianity, vampires, more sex, and death". The album has since sold nearly a million copies in the United States, a surprise success that [...] "obliged Goths to take notice" [...] of the group. The trademarks of Type O Negative's music {{include the use of}} [...] "downtuned, fuzzy guitars" [...] and a [...] "deep baritone croon" [...] from Peter Steele, an [...] "intimidatingly large, sarcastically self-deprecating original, whose dry, dirty one-liners and morbid machismo challenge those who insist the archetypal Goth is a po-faced androgyne". Type O Negative has since been recognized as a pioneer of the genre. In a review of their 2007 album Dead Again, critic Greg Prato of Allmusic declared that [...] "before Type O Negative, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> such thing as goth metal".|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker {{announced}} via the band's {{official website}} {{that the two}} were leaving the band. The statement, in part, read: [...] "Ryan Ross and Jon Walker will be leaving Panic at the Disco {{to embark on a}} musical excursion of their own. Though the four of us have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve. Over the years, we have remained close and honest with each other, which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us." [...] In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want to}} do?' and I said, 'Well, I think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going to say the same thing,' [...] " [...] Ross recalled.
