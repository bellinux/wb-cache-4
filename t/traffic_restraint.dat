More recent implementations in Costa Rica and Honduras have had the objective of reducing oil consumption, due to the high impact this import has on the economy of small countries, and considering the steep increases in oil prices that began in 2003.

5000|$|The first [...] "pedestrianisation" [...] of an {{existing}} street {{seems to have taken}} place [...] "around 1929" [...] in Essen, Germany. This was in a very narrow shopping street that could not accommodate both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Two other German cities followed this model in the early 1930s, but the idea was not seen outside Germany. Following the devastation of the Second World War a number of European cities implemented plans to pedestrianise city streets, although usually on a largely ad hoc basis, through the early 1950s, with little landscaping or planning. By 1955 twenty-one German cities had closed at least one street to traffic, although only four were [...] "true" [...] pedestrian streets, designed for the purpose. At this time pedestrianisation was not seen as a <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> policy, but rather as a complement to customers who would arrive by car in a city centre. Pedestrianisation was also common in the United States during the 1950s and 60s as downtown businesses attempted to compete with new suburban shopping malls. However, most of these initiatives were not successful in the long term, and about 90% have been changed back to motorised areas.|$|E

40|$|The Department of Transport's {{recently}} launched National Cycling Strategy has {{the aim of}} doubling the number of cycle trips by 2002 with a further doubling by 2012. The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution recommended a quadrupling of cycle trips to 10 % of all journeys by 2005. Given the increased level of interest in cycling and the role it could play in alleviating congestion and environmental problems, {{it is important that}} there are mode choice models which can evaluate the impact and benefits of investment in cycle schemes. The contribution of the research reported here is in the development of an enhanced mode choice model which examines cycling in a greater level of detail than is typically the case. The Stated Preference model provides values of the benefits of unsegregated cycle lanes and segregated cycle paths. Although investment in such facilities could lead to significant increases in cycle demand, such that even costly investments may be worthwhile in economic terms, our results indicate that they could not on their own achieve target levels of increased cycle use. Unsegregated facilities could not even satisfy the Department of Transport's medium term objective whilst only in the most favourable set of circumstances could segregated facilities achieve the longer term objective, in the commuting market, of a quadrupling of cycle share. Our results indicate, as might be widely expected, that other <b>traffic</b> management and <b>restraint</b> measures are needed in order to achieve target levels of increased cycle use. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} of transport energy use and emissions {{have been examined}} using an overview approach involving basic and multi-disciplinary research, consistent with the emerging discipline of environmental science. Facets of both problems and the inextricable link between them have been explained. An extensive literature review of the technological and land use options available for making contributions to the solution of both problems is presented. A wide range of criteria {{have been used in}} assessing the technological possibilities which reveal the complexity of planning for technological change. The potential for easy technological solutions when viewed in this total perspective is not apparent. The easy solutions tend to have the least potential for providing energy and emissions benefits; for example electronic ignitions were tested and the results were consistent with this hypothesis. The harder solutions tend to have other more fundamental implications which tend to mitigate against their use. Land use options were reviewed and they suggested considerable potential for improving energy and emissions through density, centrality and <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint.</b> To test this potential and to provide an overview of the their transport energy use, motor vehicle emissions and land use. The study showed that: 1) The cities with highest train usage have the highest per capita public transport usage and electric rail systems are the most energy efficient mode in Australian cities. 2) There is a significant difference between Australian cities. Perth and Adelaide are at one extreme with high energy (and emissions) per capita, Brisbane and Sydney are at the other extreme and Melbourne is intermediate. 3) These variations were explained by land use characteristics which correlated significantly with the transport patterns and hence suggested a potential to pursue energy conservation and air pollution abatement through land use. 4) The differences between Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney were accounted for by density, centralisation and <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> factors, whilst the anomalous patterns in Brisbane appeared to correlate most with <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> factors. 5) Because <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> seems so important in lowering private vehicle use and giving a competitive edge to public transport it appears that traffic engineering approaches designed to save energy and lower emissions by freeing traffic would be self-defeating...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper first {{describes}} <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> measures {{applied in}} urban and/or suburban areas and it assesses {{the role that}} these may play in easifying and calming traffic. The nature of these measures and some standard issues in their planning process are presented. The difficulties {{in the implementation of}} these measures are then discussed {{on the basis of a}} number of 17 traffic management studies carried out in the Athens’ northern suburban area of Maroussi. Following this, the paper proceeds to a further step in the design of such measures by introducing a set of environmental parameters in the whole planning process – the latter determine and affect the environmental quality of urban roads. These parameters are tested in practice for a representative network of roads in the urban complex of Maroussi forming an inner ring road, along which bicycle lanes are introduced and thermal comfort measures are taken. It is proposed these environmental parameters can be involved in the planning process and that can be used as potential tools of an advanced transport policy, which adds the environmental quality of roads to the targets of the whole <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> process...|$|E

This study investigates the causes of this {{dramatic increase in the}} popularity of both tram and bus use. Although <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> measures and improvements in the quality of the public transit service are significant factors, the main explanation lies in the introduction of low cost 'environmental' travel cards with the key characteristics of transferability across friends and family and wide regional validity across operators. These season tickets considerably augmented transit demand without seriously exacerbating the operating deficit. ...|$|E
40|$|Models used to {{simulate}} traffic flow and travel demand normally represent traveller behaviour by a single, averaged, group responding to cost, time, and distance changes. For systematic traffic-management measures, {{such as those}} of <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint,</b> it is desirable to examine shifts of benefits and costs between different groups of travellers. This requires equilibrium models of two or more types of traveller, each of which responds differently to charges or to travel-time changes. An appropriate technique has been developed to deal with this question, and results are presented in terms of two situations where benefit and cost transfers could arise: the effect of private parking places, and the differential impacts of road pricing. ...|$|E

We focus in this paper on the departure time choice of car drivers and on the within-day and day-to-day adjustment of the travel demand to the driving conditions and conversely. Taking into account the time of usage leads to the production of a richer set of evaluation indicators. We illustrate this statement on several experiments to advocate the modelling of the departure time choice and the segmentation of the population.

Policymakers now also have social well-being and sustainable development moving higher on their agendas alongside transport.

40|$|Many National Parks in the UK and Western Europe are {{involved}} in projects designed to reduce the impact of private car use by visitors and {{encourage the use of}} public transport. While it appears difficult to achieve a significant modal shift through marketing/behavioural measures, it is often equally difficult to secure local acceptance of the alternative of <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint.</b> A project in the Bayerischer Wald National Park, Germany, comprises both a high-quality bus system and the seasonal closure of selected roads to cars. Survey work during the project's first season established that the bus alternative was popular with its users, who generally favoured an extension of the road closure programme; however, local residents showed a lower level of support and opposed further closures. It is concluded that a danger exists of local residents succeeding in opposition to such schemes, believing that they would damage the local tourist economy, when in fact they enjoy visitor support. It is also concluded that projects which require public funding but which consist of "carrots" alone may fail to achieve both their financial targets and the objective of securing a significant change in mode of travel. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that precise estimation of road tolls for various pricing schemes requires {{a few pieces}} of information such as origin-destination demand functions, link travel time functions and users' valuations of travel time savings, which are, however, not all readily available in practice. To circumvent this difficulty, we develop a convergent trial-and-error implementation method for a particular pricing scheme for effective congestion control when both the link travel time functions and demand functions are unknown. The congestion control problem of interest is also known as the <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> and road pricing problem, which aims at finding a set of effective link toll patterns to reduce link flows to below a desirable target level. For the generalized traffic equilibrium problem formulated as variational inequalities, we propose an iterative two-stage approach with a self-adaptive step size to update the link toll pattern based on the observed link flows and given flow restraint levels. Link travel time and demand functions and users' value of time are not needed. The convergence of the iterative toll adjustment algorithm is established theoretically and demonstrated on a set of numerical examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{example of}} Singapore shows that rapid urban and {{economic}} growth {{does not have to}} bring traffic congestion and pollution. Singapore has chosen to restrain car traffic demand due to its limited land supply. Transport policy based on balanced development of road and transit infrastructure and restraint of traffic has been consistently implemented for the past 30  years. Combined with land use planning, it resulted in a modern transport system, which is free from major congestion and provides users with different travel alternatives. As the economic growth caused a substantial increase in demand for cars, several pricing policies were introduced with the aim of restraining car ownership and usage. Growth of the vehicle population is now controlled and potentially congested roads are subject to road pricing. These measures help to keep the roads free from major congestion, maintain car share of work trips below 25 % and keep the transport energy usage low. Although Singapore conditions are in many aspects unique, its travel demand experience can provide useful lessons for other rapidly growing cities in Asia.

40|$|It is {{recognized}} that traffic congestion usually comes {{out from the}} socially inefficient choices by individual travelers. To remove {{or at least to}} reduce such inefficiency in transportation system, road pricing has long been proposed and advocated by a bunch of economists. Now it further becomes one of the most favorable measures taken by transport policy makers throughout the world. Indeed, significant advance has been made towards better modeling and understanding of the essential mechanism of various road pricing schemes. There, however, still remain some questions around the actual design and implementation. One dilemma often being met is that the travel cost and demand functions are always referred to as the underlying elements in determination of optimal toll levels, but may not be fully available at ease. In practice, even with advanced transport modeling techniques, it is pretty hard to establish all of them. To overcome this practical difficulty, a novel trial-and-error idea was put forward. It shows us a promising way, but few algorithms have been presented to truly realize it, except for a certain marginal cost pricing problem with unknown demand functions. Therefore, this thesis is focused on the development of practical implementation methods for several typical road pricing schemes including: the first-best pricing scheme, the second-best pricing scheme and the <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> road pricing scheme. The fundamental idea behind the proposed sequential experimental approaches is to adjust toll charges at frequent intervals as traffic patterns changes brought about by price change. Given a set of trial link tolls, the revealed aggregate link flows can be observed easily, and based on the observed link flows, a new set of link tolls can be determined and used for the next trial. Through an iterative toll adjustment procedure, one can expect to identify the efficient toll rates without resort to the inaccessible demand functions. In the case of <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> and pricing schemes, link travel cost functions are also not required. This does allow for traffic planners to estimate or update optimal toll charges easily. In addition to describing those applicable methods with both theoretical convergence proof and numerical simulation tests, this thesis investigates the maximum efficiency gain of a first-best road pricing scheme as well. In other words, we are able to bound the maximum efficiency loss of any second-best toll patterns being tried in the iterative process. It thus helps us to determine when the sequential experiments could stop since the number of trials in real applications should be very limited. Besides of this, we also attempt to introduce some inexact criterion that allows the observed link flows not necessarily to be exactly in a deterministic user-equilibrium. This relaxed inexact manner reduces the requirement for operating time and resources and thereby makes the developed progressive methods more practical and cost-effective...|$|E
40|$|The rate of {{provision}} of bus-based {{park and ride}} facilities {{on the fringes of}} UK urban areas has grown in recent years. However, there has been a debate about whether the schemes reduce traffic. Research published in 1998 for the UK Government considered eight case studies and was interpreted by some as providing reassurance that park and ride can have traffic-reduction benefits. The present paper offers a new approach to the appraisal of the same eight park and ride schemes, separating the analysis into urban and extra-urban components. The urban-area analysis considers the net result of intercepting cars on the edge of urban areas and running additional dedicated bus services from the car parks. The finding is that traffic was avoided in seven out of eight cases. The analysis of the extra-urban effects of park and ride considers three sources of traffic increase: motorists that are intercepted detouring to reach sites, users switching from public transport services and motorists making additional trips. All are found to be important phenomena, with the total additional traffic generated outside the urban area being greater than that avoided within the urban area in every case study. It is concluded that the main effect of the schemes is traffic redistribution, and that their role within <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> policies is unlikely to be directly one of traffic reduction. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{consider}} the range of pricing methods available, {{it is first necessary}} to choose a definition for road pricing. The term "road pricing" has been criticised as an inaccurate description of systems which is applied to (Thompson, 1990) and there is some inconsistency regarding the extent of charging policies which are considered to be included. A liberal definition could cover any fiscal form of <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint,</b> affecting the mode, time, route, destination of frequency of journeys. In this case road pricing already exists worldwide through taxes imposed upon the purchase and licensing of vehicles and through fuel taxation. The extension of conventional taxation arrangements has been used as part of road pricing strategies in both Hong Kong and Singapore (Dawson and Brown, 1985; LPAC, 1991). However, the essence of most road pricing work has been to replace and supplement these existing charges, which do not discriminate by time, location or amount of vehicle use, with charging structures which are directly related to these issues. For this reason the descriptions road-use pricing, congestion pricing and road user charging are sometimes preferred, and some recent texts have attempted to impose a narrower definition for road pricing, in which only charging systems relating directly to the time and distance travelled are included (CIT, 1992). For the purposes of this review it is best to retain the conventional term of road pricing and apply the broadest definition...|$|E

Belfast {{is one of the}} most car dependent cities in the United Kingdom. A major household survey was intended to inform an understanding of the likely behavioural response to sustainable development policy initiatives. The survey was one of a series of linked tools within a wider EPSRC Sustainable Cities Project research project. Insights into consumer responses to the various policy measures considered in the overall project were drawn in part from the stated preference experiments included in the household survey. Initiatives included improved domestic energy efficiency, increased densification of housing, improved public transport and the introduction of <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> measures such as road user charges. There were signs of some willingness to accept moderately higher densities on the basis that residents would be compensated by a lower than otherwise purchase price. The typical effect of introducing road pricing say at £ 1. 00 per day equated to a reduction in property values of some 2. 5 % while the absence of any apparent statistical significance generated by the public transport variable reflects its current lack of credibility as an alternative to the car.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce traffic {{congestion}} and the associated problems, various policies have been put forward so far. In this way, {{it is believed that}} Transport Demand Management (TDM) offers an effective and economical solution. Since most TDM policies have both positive and negative impacts, public participation is, therefore, an efficient way to achieve better results. This paper attempts to evaluate a set of TDM policies and define their priorities through a Bottom-up Planning (BUP) approach for the metropolitan Shiraz, Iran. In this way, the possibility of developing common principles via the investigation of shared goals within an integrated framework for urban transport policies that are desired for sustainable transport is evaluated. The framework method was utilized through a BUP expert consultation process. A number of experts (n= 21) were asked to prioritize the components of each policy package. A set of policy measures as solutions to traffic congestion was provided in three different categories: sustainable transport approach, engineering approach, and <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> approach. Each category included 10 measures which were suggested after a primary survey on the metropolitan's traffic problems. These measures were weighted and rated using the Analytical Hierarchal Process (AHP) technique. Then the Weighted Scoring Method was applied to find performance priorities. Public bus and bicycle infrastructure development were found to be the two most favorite policies. In total, sustainable transport solutions were the most preferred policies in the bottom-up stages.

The transport sector will undoubtedly need to {{play a significant role}} in achieving carbon reductions if the government is to meet its ambitious long-term goal of a 60 % reduction by 2050. This article examines current carbon use by households for personal land-based transport and considers how feasible it would be to change that use over the period up to 2050 in the United Kingdom. It provides a unique insight into how much and in what way households and individuals may be willing to adapt their transport behavior to achieve carbon reductions. A computer-based transport carbon calculator was developed to investigate the CO 2 emissions of individual households from various modes based on travel diary information. This formed the focus of a series of interactive interviews in which participants were asked to consider how their future low carbon transport strategy could look. Views of households on various abatement measures were explored, including technological change in vehicle design or fuel source and behavioral change through, for instance, <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> and investment in public transport. Overall, a 40 % reduction in carbon emissions was seen to be feasible through a combination of behavioral change measures and a realistically achievable degree of technological improvement, falling well short of the UK government's goal of a 60 % reduction. Through changes in behavior alone, the households involved could only achieve around a 20 % cut in carbon emissions —seemingly a threshold beyond which further reductions will be difficult and may necessitate significant lifestyle change...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION This evidence, {{submitted}} to the Select Committee for its inquiry into Urban Congestion Charging, is based on my research into the subject, and professional involvement in studies of methods for managing the demand for urban travel, over the last twenty years. In the 1970 s I was responsible, within the Greater London Council, for their studies {{of the use of}} comprehensive parking control, physical restriction of road space, and supplementary licensing (a low technology method of congestion charging) as methods of <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint.</b> At the same time, I was an adviser to the World Bank in its study of Singapore's area licensing scheme which is still the only congestion charging system in operation. In the 1980 s I was an adviser to the US Transport Research Board in its investigation of appropriate methods for managing urban traffic, and to The MVA Consultancy in its study of electronic road pricing for Hong Kong. Since 1987 I have been involved, as a director of The MVA Consultancy, in a series of integrated transport studies in London (for the London Planning Advisory Committee), Birmingham, Edinburgh, Bristol and Merseyside, each of which has investigated the role of congestion charging as part of a wider transport strategy. I am currently directing a programme of research, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, which is assessing the relative impact on urban road networks of different methods of imposing congestion charging, on their own and in combination with traffic signal control and bus priorities.

40|$|In 1998 the UK Department for Transport {{commissioned}} a programme of 22 studies {{to examine the}} most acute congestion problems on the English road network. The studies promised {{a new approach to}} reducing road congestion by examining the contribution that all modes of transport could make to solve these problems. The studies have provided the most convincing evidence to date that road building alone {{will not be able to}} solve congestion and pollution problems. Extra road infrastructure will, in most cases, buy a few years’ respite from congestion on the inter-urban road network. The studies have proposed substantial packages of road and public transport improvements, combined with demand management and <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> measures, to tackle the problems. The evidence suggests that some form of road-user charging will be required in many areas to ensure that the efficiency benefits gained from the extra road capacity will not simply be eroded by traffic growth as has been seen to date on routes such as the M 25. The outcomes of the studies have prompted the Government to undertake a review of the potential for a national road-user charging system. The multimodal studies have undoubtedly brought about a more balanced and integrated approach to transport planning. There have been quite significant changes to the roads schemes that were initially remitted to the studies and evidence to suggest that significant environmental concerns are now playing a much stronger role in decisions taken by the Department for Transport. The challenge now is to ensure that all of the major parts of the integrated strategies proposed are delivered. A failure to do so will not only reduce the benefits the proposals offer but will also devalue the multi-modal approach taken to the studies...|$|E
40|$|Internet {{access and}} use in Great Britain and in many other {{countries}} around the world has increased dramatically in a very short space of time. That this communications medium can provide access to opportunities, services, social networks and other goods makes the nature and scale of its current and potential future impacts on society hugely significant. It should therefore be of considerable concern that monitoring and understanding of such impacts is failing to keep pace with developments which in turn seriously impedes the opportunities for informed policy interventions. In providing a means of access, the Internet has the potential to improve or change people’s quality of life and also to change levels and patterns of the alternatives means of access, notably personal travel. This paper reports on a GB survey which marks the first stage in a three year project which is seeking to begin addressing the gap in data and understanding concerning the (evolving) links between social participation, personal travel and Internet use. The results presented are based on responses from 1028 GB weekly Internet users to an online questionnaire survey. Presentation of results consider behaviour and attitudes concerning personal travel, Internet use and links between the two. Key findings relate to the growing array of online activities, access to which people believe is improving their quality of life. The suggestion is made that further to the prevalence of car dependence within society, the phenomenon of Internet dependence may now be emerging. Contrary to expectations, the motivation to engage in online rather than offline activities is derived in many cases not from the attraction of saving travel time but, it appears, from the activity time saving. Nevertheless, not only is the Internet improving access without increasing personal travel, stated intentions suggest that online activities have already become sufficient in quality and scope to offer a viable alternative or substitute to offline activities and associated physical travel, particularly if <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> or the cost of travel were to be increased...|$|E
40|$|Parking {{plays an}} {{important}} role in mobility, access and the economic development of cities; at the same time, it is a profitable business for both the private and public sectors. The city centre car parking market is a sector of the economy that has increased in importance as the market for cars has grown. Cars have become a fundamental element of journey mobility and, in consequence, parking has as well. The car-parking sector has always been of great importance in terms of urban mobility, since it is a fundamental element in achieving a high level of accessibility in the city centres. In fact, many businesses and municipalities see an adequate supply of parking, especially for visitors, as crucial for their competitive growth. Yet, at the same time parking is, and will remain for most cities, the most powerful means of <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> available. The economics of car parking is also important because it is, both for public and private organizations, a key source of revenue. Despite the importance of the sector, knowledge of the car parking market has been until very recently, sparse and limited. This thesis is focused on the car parking operator?s point of view, analysing and appraising this industry and the actors involved. The related literature investigates the car parking sector analysing the variables that influence its behaviour. The literature review also appraises whether and how far car parking operators are considered as key transport actors by local and national authorities, comparing Italy and the UK. The information collected is used to structure an econometric model, using the variables chosen as important and simulating the strategic behaviour of the car parking operator in a city centre context. The research also deepens the analysis of the car parking sector with a survey of car parking operators and policies in some Italian and UK cities. In this way the research achieves its aims to contribute to filling the knowledge gap on the city centre car parking market, both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically because the literature on car parking is very recent and little investigated; empirically, because research in this field is also sparse.

40|$|This paper focuses upon {{public attitudes}} to and public {{acceptance}} of road-user charging {{as an effective}} means of managing travel demand, with the overall aim of identifying the characteristics of key interest groups, the kinds of attitudes they hold and their preferences for the distribution of the benefits of generated net revenues and released roadspace. It is argued that this knowledge can play a pivotal role in the design of road-user charging systems that satisfy two important criteria – namely, that they are capable of achieving their stated objectives and are generally acceptable to the public. A case-study of three toll-rings used for revenue generation by the Norwegian cities of Bergen, Oslo and Trondheim is selected, where a team of Norwegian interviewers administered a computer-based survey to a total of 756 respondents. Results of the analyses of the attitudinal data collected raise concerns about the approach of introducing initially low levels of road-use charge, designed to have negligible impacts on travel behaviour but to raise revenues to fund necessary improvements to public transport, both to familiarise private car-users with the principles of a pay-as-you-go system of charging and hopefully to reduce levels of public opposition prior to the introduction of the longer term objective of higher charges for <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint.</b> The timescale over which charges are increased may be crucial in terms of balancing a resistance to change in the longer term against the credibility of a system whose objectives are modified in the relatively short-term. The key conclusion from the first Stated Preference exercise {{is that there is a}} high degree of consensus among individuals on the importance of investing significant amounts of net revenues in new road infrastructure as well as improved public transport. The second Stated Preference exercise highlights respondents' concerns that the benefits in improved network performance achieved by a reduction in traffic levels through higher toll-charges should not be eroded by new (induced) traffic attracted onto the network. It is suggested that this may be overcome by allocating released roadspace to environmental improvement measures and priority-measures for buses and cyclists, at the expense of improved vehicle-speeds for those willing to pay to continue to drive...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{decades have}} seen rapid {{change in the}} urban {{transport}} of many eastern Asian cities. Some cities have been hailed internationally as transport success stories while others have become known for their intense traffic crises {{to the extent of}} threatening both their environmental qualities and economic performance. Accordingly, there is great interest in better understanding urban transport patterns in the large cities of eastern Asia. However, the literature lacks clear internationally comparable information on these cities and their transport systems. A review of the literature on land use and transport in Asian cities reveals many misunderstandings and inaccurate interpretations of the current situation in these cities. This thesis attempts to redress this lack of sound urban data and to improve policy interpretations by focusing on nine major cities in Pacific Asia (Bangkok, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul, Singapore, Surabaya and Tokyo). The study provides an international comparative perspective on these cities using a large set of data on urban transport, land use and economic factors, as part of a wider study on 46 international cities. A historical review of transport and urban development between 1900 and the 1960 s found that, {{by the end of the}} period, most of the Asian cities were more vulnerable to problems from an influx of private vehicles than Western cities had been at the equivalent stage in their motorisation. This greater vulnerability was primarily due to higher densities and greater dependence on road-based public transport in most Asian cities, which could be described as “bus cities”, an archetype that is developed in the thesis. This archetype is found to be useful in better understanding Asian cities in relation to more Western-based theories of city evolution based on the dominant transport technology, as well as helping to interpret past and present transport problems. Analysis of comparative transport and other data for 1990 found that the Asian cities in the sample generally had much lower levels of private vehicle use than European, Canadian, Australian and American cities in the international sample. This is in line perhaps with general expectations, though not without significant variations within the group. The Asian cities also generally had greater roles for public transport and non-motorised transport and much higher urban densities than cities in the other regions, though variations were again significant. A detailed investigation of the special opportunities and challenges for transport of the highdensity urban forms of most of the Asian cities reveals new insights on the root causes of transport problems in such cities. High density offers the opportunity to foster successful public transport and non-motorised accessibility. However, it also means that very high levels of motorised traffic per unit of land area (and hence intense traffic impacts) can emerge quickly, even if vehicle use per capita remains low. Traffic congestion can also emerge rapidly as dense cities motorise. This is a result, not just of poorly developed road systems, but of the fact that road capacity per capita is inherently low in dense cities. This research thus challenges notions in the literature that congestion problems in Asian cities can be solved by road expansion. It establishes, through sound comparative urban data, that there are inherent limits to road provision in dense cities. Contrasting urban transport strategies or models were identified within the Asian sample of cities. In particular, upper-middle-income cities, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, were shown to have experienced very rapid motorisation and to have had little success in increasing the relative roles of public transport and non-motorised modes. These trends have led to a severe mismatch between emerging car and motorcycle-oriented transport patterns and the pre-existing highdensity urban form, especially in Bangkok. This “unrestrained motorisation” model is contrasted with the experiences of wealthier Seoul, Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo, which have all restrained and slowed the pace of motorisation to some extent and enhanced the role of public transport. In all four cities, 1990 levels of motorisation and vehicle use were low relative to their levels of income. This “restraint” model takes advantage of the transport opportunities that are inherent in existing dense urban forms while avoiding many of the problems. It is also shown to have encouraged, or complemented, the evolution of public transport-oriented patterns of urban development. Jakarta, Surabaya and Manila face the choice of following either of these models, but appear more likely to follow Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur, unless policy changes are made. The study then reviews key choices and policies in urban transport in the nine Asian cities over recent decades. It identifies which have been most decisive in defining the models “chosen” by each city. Although many decisions are important, the thesis argues that a particularly crucial choice is the decision of whether or not to restrain private vehicle ownership and use. The Asian cities following the “restraint” model began to restrain private vehicles at an early stage in their motorisation and generally well before they had developed high-quality or high-capacity public transport systems. This challenges the common view that a city must already have a first-class public transport system before <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> can be effective or politically acceptable. In fact, this study suggests that early introduction of <b>traffic</b> <b>restraint</b> can facilitate the gradual development of well-functioning transport systems, including mass transit systems. Insights drawn from the results of this study potentially have important implications for transport and urban policy debates in low-income and middle-income cities everywhere, particularly those that are beginning to motorise quickly from previously low levels of vehicle ownership...|$|E
