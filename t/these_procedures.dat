Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA.

5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} ascent {{is interrupted by}} stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} decompression, and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation. Staged decompression may include deep stops depending on the theoretical model used for calculating the ascent schedule. Omission of decompression theoretically required for a dive profile exposes the diver to significantly higher risk of symptomatic decompression sickness, and in severe cases, serious injury or death. The risk is related to the severity of exposure and the level of supersaturation of tissues in the diver. Procedures for emergency management of omitted decompression and symptomatic decompression sickness have been published. <b>These</b> <b>procedures</b> are generally effective, but vary in effectiveness from case to case.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. <b>These</b> <b>procedures</b> yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E

Since achieving an asymptotic linear representation typically requires a very delicate choice of tuning and smoothing parameters, inference based on the bootstrap for kernel-based semiparametric estimators may be misleading in empirical work.

5|$|Once all {{the tissue}} {{compartments}} have reached saturation {{for a given}} pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed {{only at the end}} of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of <b>these</b> <b>procedures</b> is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.|$|E
5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all <b>these</b> <b>procedures</b> have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E
