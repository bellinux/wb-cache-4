5|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, the roughtail {{stingray}} is listed under Least Concern; {{it is not}} targeted or utilized by commercial fisheries, though inconsequential numbers are captured incidentally in <b>trawls</b> and on demersal longlines. Historically, it was sometimes ground up for fertilizer. In the Mediterranean, intensive fishing occurs in the habitat of the roughtail stingray, and it is caught incidentally by artisanal and commercial fishers using <b>trawls,</b> longlines, gillnets, and handlines. Though no specific data is available on this species, declines of other species and its intrinsic susceptibility to depletion have led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in the region. In the southwestern Atlantic, the roughtail stingray and other large rays are heavily fished using demersal <b>trawls,</b> gillnets, longlines, and hook-and-line; this fishing pressure is liable to increase due to growing commercial interest in using large stingrays for minced fish products. Anecdotal reports suggest that landings of this species are decreasing, leading to a regional assessment of Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Small {{numbers of}} frill sharks are caught {{incidentally}} by various deepwater commercial fisheries around the world, using <b>trawls,</b> gillnets, and longlines. In particular, it is regularly taken in Suruga Bay in bottom gillnets meant for sea bream and gnomefish, and in midwater <b>trawls</b> {{meant for the}} shrimp Sergia lucens. Japanese fishermen regard it as a nuisance, as it damages the nets. This shark is sometimes sold for meat or processed into fishmeal, but is not economically significant. Because of its very low reproductive rate and the continuing expansion of commercial fisheries into its habitat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has previously listed it as Near Threatened, although the species was downlisted to Least Concern in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{milk shark}} is {{harmless}} to humans {{because of its}} small size and teeth. Caught using longlines, gillnets, <b>trawls,</b> and hook-and-line, this shark is marketed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, and is also used for shark fin soup and fishmeal. Its abundance makes it a significant component of artisanal and commercial fisheries across its range. Off northern Australia, it ranks among the most common sharks caught in <b>trawls,</b> and comprises 2% and 6% of the annual gillnet and longline catches, respectively. This species {{is also one of}} the most commercially important sharks caught off Senegal, Mauritania, Oman, and India. Some sport fishers regard it as a game fish.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trawling</b> can {{be divided}} into bottom <b>trawling</b> and {{midwater}} <b>trawling,</b> depending on how high the <b>trawl</b> (net) is in the water column. Bottom <b>trawling</b> is towing the <b>trawl</b> along (benthic <b>trawling)</b> or close to (demersal <b>trawling)</b> the sea floor. Midwater <b>trawling</b> is towing the <b>trawl</b> through free water above {{the bottom of the ocean}} or benthic zone.|$|R
50|$|Midwater <b>trawling</b> is <b>trawling,</b> or net fishing, {{at a depth}} that {{is higher}} {{in the water column}} than the bottom of the ocean. It is contrasted with bottom <b>trawling.</b> Midwater <b>trawling</b> is also known as pelagic <b>trawling</b> and bottom <b>trawling</b> as benthic <b>trawling.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Bottom <b>trawling</b> is <b>trawling</b> (towing a <b>trawl,</b> {{which is}} a fishing net) along the sea floor. It is also {{referred}} to as [...] "dragging". The scientific community divides bottom <b>trawling</b> into benthic <b>trawling</b> and demersal <b>trawling.</b> Benthic <b>trawling</b> is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean and demersal <b>trawling</b> is towing a net just above the benthic zone.|$|R
5|$|The viper dogfish has no {{economic}} value. It is very infrequently caught in commercial purse seines and bottom <b>trawls</b> targeting other species, though what effect, if any, fishing has on its population is unknown. As a result, the IUCN has listed it under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its range, the bowmouth {{guitarfish}} {{is caught}} incidentally or intentionally by artisanal and commercial fisheries using <b>trawls,</b> gillnets, and line gear. The fins are extremely valuable {{due to their}} use in shark fin soup, and are often the only parts of the fish kept and brought to market. However, the meat may also be sold fresh or dried and salted, and it is highly esteemed in India. When caught as bycatch in <b>trawls,</b> the bowmouth guitarfish is considered a nuisance because its strength and rough skin {{make it difficult to}} handle, and as the heavy ray thrashes in the net it can damage the rest of the catch. In Thailand, the enlarged thorns of this species are used to make bracelets.|$|E
5|$|Chlamys hastata, {{the spear}} scallop, spiny scallop or {{swimming}} scallop, is {{a species of}} bivalve mollusc in the family Pectinidae found {{on the west coast}} of North America from the Gulf of Alaska to San Diego, California. A limited number of these scallops are harvested by divers or by narrow <b>trawls</b> off the west coast of Canada.|$|E
5000|$|Bottom <b>trawling</b> is <b>trawling</b> (towing a <b>trawl,</b> {{which is}} a fishing net) along the sea floor. It is also {{referred}} to as [...] "dragging". The scientific community divides bottom <b>trawling</b> into benthic <b>trawling</b> and demersal <b>trawling.</b> Benthic <b>trawling</b> is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean and demersal <b>trawling</b> is towing a net just above the benthic zone. Bottom <b>trawling</b> targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic species such as cod, squid, shrimp, and rockfish.|$|R
25|$|Bottom <b>trawling</b> can be {{contrasted with}} {{midwater}} <b>trawling</b> (also known as pelagic <b>trawling),</b> where a net is towed {{higher in the}} water column. Midwater <b>trawling</b> catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, and mackerel, whereas bottom <b>trawling</b> targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic species such as cod, squid, shrimp, and rockfish.|$|R
40|$|Common shrimp <b>trawl</b> designs {{employed}} in the southeastern United States shrimp fishery are the flat, balloon, semiballoon, jib, and super X- 3. Recent innovations in <b>trawl</b> design and rigging, including the twin <b>trawl</b> rigging and tongue <b>trawl</b> design, have improved the efficiency of shrimp <b>trawling</b> gear. A description of the construction techniques for the different designs indicate differences which affect gear performance. Measurements of horizontal spread and vertical opening for 76 <b>trawl</b> configurations indicate the relative efficiencies of the different designs. Maximum horizontal spreading efficiency was achieved by the "twin" and "tongue" <b>trawl</b> designs followed by the super X- 3, jib, balloon, and semiballoon designs. Designs having the greatest vertical openings were the tongue and flat <b>trawl</b> designs followed by the semiballoon. Maximum total gape dimension was demonstrated by the "Mongoose" tongue <b>trawl.</b> Comparison of <b>trawl</b> spreading efficiency and door area to headrope length ratio indicates that a range of 70 - 80 in square (per door) of door area is required for each foot of <b>trawl</b> headrope length for maximum efficiency with conventional <b>trawl</b> designs and 66 - 75 in square per foot of headrope for tongue <b>trawl</b> designs.

5|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of no {{economic}} value, the slender smooth-hound is occasionally caught incidentally in bottom <b>trawls</b> and on bottom longlines. Much of its northern range lies in little-fished waters, {{and thus the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern. However, this shark's very low fecundity would render it susceptible to population depletion should fishing pressure increase in the future.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{angelshark}} {{is typically}} inoffensive towards humans, but if disturbed, can inflict a severe bite. Across {{much of its}} range, it is a frequent catch (intentional or not) in bottom <b>trawls</b> and probably also set nets and demersal gillnets; the meat is eaten and the rough skin is made into a type of leather called shagreen for use in wood finishing.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray lacks {{economic value}} and is discarded by fisheries. It is often caught incidentally in bottom <b>trawls,</b> {{and due to}} its small size does not benefit from Turtle Exclusion Devices. In particular, this species accounts for approximately 4.5% of the total catch of the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Over half of the rays caught by the NPF, including almost all the males, are fatally crushed within the trawl. Despite this mortality, the NPF is not believed to have negatively affected the local population because its operational area {{does not include the}} waters where this species is most abundant. The peppered maskray is also caught frequently in scallop <b>trawls</b> operated by the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. Elsewhere in its range, fishing pressure is relatively light due to external factors such as fuel prices. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, because it remains common and its range includes several Marine Protected Areas.|$|E
50|$|Bottom <b>trawling</b> can be {{contrasted with}} {{midwater}} <b>trawling</b> (also known as pelagic <b>trawling),</b> where a net is towed {{higher in the}} water column. Midwater <b>trawling</b> catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, tuna, and mackerel, whereas bottom <b>trawling</b> targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic species such as cod, squid, shrimp, and rockfish.|$|R
25|$|Midwater <b>trawling</b> is {{also known}} as pelagic <b>trawling.</b> Midwater <b>trawling</b> catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, shrimp, tuna and mackerel, whereas bottom <b>trawling</b> targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic fish such as cod, squid, halibut and rockfish.|$|R
40|$|Stratified <b>trawl</b> {{surveys have}} been carried out in the Barents Sea and the Svalbard areas since 1981. Based on the {{assumption}} of a constant area swept by the <b>trawl</b> during a standard <b>trawl</b> haul at any depth, swept area abundance indices have been presented for both areas. The results have been used in the management of the Arcto-Norwegian cod stock. In this paper results from measurements of <b>trawl</b> geometry during <b>trawling</b> operation during a standard stratified <b>trawl</b> survey in the Svalbard area in September-October 1985 are presented and the implication on the <b>trawl</b> indices of these results are discussed...|$|R
5|$|The quagga {{catshark}} is harmless {{and is not}} {{utilized by}} humans. It is caught incidentally by demersal fisheries in bottom <b>trawls</b> and potentially other gear; such fishing activity is very intense in Indian and Somalian waters, though specific data on this species is lacking. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|The {{zebra shark}} is taken by {{commercial}} fisheries across {{most of its}} range, using bottom <b>trawls,</b> gillnets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. Furthermore, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup, and the offal for fishmeal. Zebra sharks are highly susceptible to localized depletion due to their shallow habitat {{and low levels of}} dispersal between populations, and market surveys suggest that they are much less common now than in the past. They are also threatened by the degradation of their coral reef habitat by human development, and by destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting or poisoning. As a result, the World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered. Off Australia, the only threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in prawn <b>trawls,</b> and there it has been assessed as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Fishing gear is {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become {{entangled}} in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing gear is the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, <b>trawls,</b> and dredges. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.|$|E
40|$|After {{thirty years}} of prohibition, the {{midwater}} <b>trawl</b> may once again become {{an alternative to the}} bottom <b>trawl</b> in the cod, haddock and saithe fisheries. A midwater <b>trawl</b> has no impact on the seabed and requires less energy to operate than a bottom <b>trawl.</b> The Institute of Marine Research is currently testing the new midwater <b>trawl,</b> which {{has turned out to be}} an effective fishing gear...|$|R
50|$|In {{midwater}} <b>trawling,</b> a cone-shaped net can be towed {{behind a}} single boat and spread by <b>trawl</b> doors, {{or it can}} be towed behind two boats (pair <b>trawling)</b> which act as the spreading device. Midwater <b>trawling</b> catches pelagic fish such as anchovies, shrimp, tuna and mackerel, whereas bottom <b>trawling</b> targets both bottom living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic fish such as: cod, squid, halibut and rockfish.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Trawl</b> nets - {{are large}} nets, conical in shape, {{designed}} to be towed in the sea or along the sea bottom. The <b>trawl</b> is pulled through the water {{by one or more}} boats, called trawlers. The activity of pulling the <b>trawl</b> through the water is called <b>trawling.</b>|$|R
5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is {{susceptible}} to incidental capture by commercial bottom <b>trawls,</b> gillnets, or line gear. It has little commercial value since the meat is soft and poorly regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the prickly shark as Near Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1904 Scotia {{reached its}} most southerly {{latitude}} of 74°01'S. At this point, {{the ship was}} held fast in the pack ice, and the prospect loomed of becoming trapped for the winter. It was {{during this period of}} inactivity that bagpiper Gilbert Kerr was photographed serenading a penguin. On 13 March the ship broke free and began to move slowly north-eastward under steam. Throughout this part of the voyage a regular programme of depth soundings, <b>trawls,</b> and sea-bottom samples provided a comprehensive record of the oceanography and marine life of the Weddell Sea.|$|E
5|$|Only nine quagga {{catshark}} specimens {{have been}} recorded. In addition to Alcock's type specimen, four males were trawled from off the eastern Somalian coast {{by the research}} ship RV Anton Bruun in 1964. Four more individuals, two male and two female, were found amongst the contents of commercial fishing <b>trawls</b> conducted off Quilon, India in 2010. A male specimen reported from the Gulf of Aden in 1939 was later re-identified as a speckled catshark (H. boesemani).|$|E
50|$|A <b>trawl</b> {{windlass}} is {{a similar}} machine that restrains or manipulates the <b>trawl</b> on a commercial fishing vessel. The <b>trawl</b> {{is a sort of}} big fishing net that is wound on the windlass. The fishermen either let-out the <b>trawl</b> or heaves-up the <b>trawl</b> during fishing operations. A brake is provided for control and a windlass is usually powered by an electric or hydraulic motor operating via a gear train.|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of herring during pelagic <b>trawl</b> sampling {{has been studied}} by use of a high-frequency scanning sonar mounted on the headline of the <b>trawl.</b> The difficulties of obtaining high catch rates on shallow herring layers by single-vessel <b>trawling</b> are demonstrated. Propeller-noise avoidance is suggested as {{the main reason for}} the low fish density observed behind the <b>trawling</b> vessel. Minor adjustments in <b>trawling</b> technique to improve catch efficiency are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Abundance {{estimates}} of North-east Arctic {{cod and haddock}} are given annually {{on the basis of}} combined bottom <b>trawl</b> and acoustic surveys. Both survey methods use data from bottom <b>trawl</b> catches in the calculations. The surveys are conducted in the Barents Sea and the Svalbard area with the same bottom <b>trawl,</b> but with different sweep wire length. The bottom <b>trawl</b> indices are calculated for both areas assuming an effective path width of 25 m. In this paper results from parallel <b>trawling</b> experiments with the standard sampling <b>trawl</b> equipped with different sweep lengths are analyzed. These show that the total catch increases with increasing sweep length. Small fish are relatively underestimated by the <b>trawl</b> with the longer sweeps, but no species selection was observed. It is concluded that combining survey results without compensating for the effect of using different sweep length will bias the estimates. The variability in the presented results demonstrates the complexity of combining data from <b>trawl</b> surveys conducted with different sweep lengths on the bottom <b>trawl...</b>|$|R
5|$|Over 3 million {{vessels are}} {{employed}} in sea fishing. Modern fishing vessels include fishing trawlers with a small crew, stern trawlers, purse seiners, long-line factory vessels, and large factory ships which are designed to stay at sea for weeks, processing and freezing great quantities of fish. The equipment used to capture the fish may be purse seines, other seines, <b>trawls,</b> dredges, gillnets, and long-lines. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is encouraging the development of local fisheries to provide food security to coastal communities and help alleviate poverty.|$|E
5|$|The false {{catshark}} is an infrequent bycatch of longlines {{and bottom}} <b>trawls.</b> It has minimal economic value, though its meat, fins, and liver oil may be utilized. In Okinawa, its oil is traditionally used {{to seal the}} hulls of wooden fishing boats. Like other deepwater sharks, this species {{is thought to be}} highly susceptible to overfishing due to its slow reproductive rate. However, it is rarely caught and there is no information available on its population. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The harm {{inflicted by}} cookiecutter sharks on fishing nets and {{economically}} important species {{may have a}} minor negative effect on commercial fisheries. The shark itself {{is too small to}} be of value, and is only infrequently taken, as bycatch, on pelagic longlines and in midwater <b>trawls</b> and plankton nets. The lack of significant population threats, coupled with a worldwide distribution, has led the IUCN to assess the cookiecutter shark as of Least Concern.|$|E
