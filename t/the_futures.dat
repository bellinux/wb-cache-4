5|$|The Flames {{continued}} to struggle after the Olympic break; they finished {{the season in}} tenth place in the West and missed {{the playoffs for the}} first time since 2003.

5|$|The Deltas are despondent, but Bluto rallies {{them with}} an impassioned, if {{historically}} inaccurate, speech ("Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!"), and so they decide {{to take action against}} Wormer, the Omegas, and the college. They convert Flounder's damaged car into an armored vehicle and hide it inside a cake-shaped breakaway float in order to sneak into the annual homecoming parade. As they wreak havoc on the event, <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> of several of the student main characters are revealed using freeze-frame labels. Most of the Deltas become respectable professionals, while their adversaries suffer less fortunate outcomes.|$|E
5|$|The commentaries of Ramayana {{suggest that}} it would be right for Sugriva to marry the widowed Tara. Amritakataka of Kataka Madhava Yogindra says that this was right as they were animals. The Tilaka by Nahesh Bhatt(Ramavarma) justifies Sugriva's {{marriage}} to Tara since Sugriva was her dead husband's brother. It further states that Tara should remarry as she did not belong to the first three castes and was young. Tara's action of taking Sugriva as her husband after Vali's death is seen as her attempt to secure <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> of Angada and the kingdom.|$|E

He {{then went on to}} win {{consecutive}} titles at two Future ITF Circuit events in Santiago, Chile, including the 26th International Junior tournament.

He won his third title in his home country by defeating Damian Patriarca, who forfeited the match, at the ITF Circuit event in Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E
5|$|On February 3, 2014, Harris {{was named}} to <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> All-Star roster for the 2014 NBA D-League All-Star Game. At {{the time of the}} announcement, Harris was one of at five players on an NBA roster that were selected, but who had played over half of their D-League team's games through January 26. On February 4, the eve of the end of Harris' second 10-day contract, the Lakers {{appeared}} to be returning to good health, with the return of Nash, Blake and Farmar to the lineup imminent. That night, although Nash and Blake returned to the starting lineup against Minnesota, Jodie Meeks and Jordan Hill were injured in the first quarter and Harris contributed 19 points and 8 rebounds even though he had been told before the game he would not be re-signed. On February 7, 2014, he was re-acquired by the D-Fenders. On February 8, 2014, Harris again set a new D-Fenders franchise scoring record, this time with 56 points, while adding 15 rebounds against the Santa Cruz Warriors. It was two points shy of the league record set by Jackson four days earlier. He was a nominee for D-League Player of the Week, but Jackson won. Harris played 12 minutes in the February 15 D-League All-Star game. Afterwards, he missed some games due to an ankle injury. He was a finalist for player of the week on March 3 and 10. After playing a total of 22 games in the NBA D-League for the D-Fenders and averaging 31.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 3.7 assists, Harris signed with Türk Telekom B.K. of the Turkish Basketball League on March 13.|$|E

30|$|For those {{wanting to}} know <b>the</b> <b>future</b> and reduce uncertainty, pluralising {{possibilities}} can confuse and confound. Opening <b>the</b> <b>future</b> also undermines <b>the</b> efforts of those seeking to make particular futures appear inevitable, thereby securing their own positions through time. Therefore some caution is required when seeking to advocate and develop the use of strategic foresight in policy making. Given the role of strategic foresight to reassert the primacy of <b>the</b> <b>future</b> as a domain of the possible, strategic foresight does not claim to know <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> but understand and negotiate <b>futures.</b> To encompass <b>the</b> <b>future</b> as <b>the</b> unknown is a project fundamentally {{at odds with the}} empiricist epistemologies underlying orthodox approaches to planning and <b>the</b> <b>future</b> [29]. Better techniques for gathering and analysing information are a necessary but insufficient condition for policy making. Rather than claim to know what <b>the</b> <b>future</b> is, or what <b>the</b> <b>future</b> should be, strategic foresight subverts the inevitable and envisions and educes what <b>the</b> <b>future</b> could be [30]. In this regard, strategic foresight does not just offer a different set of tools, but presents a different ontology and orientation as to how to understand <b>the</b> <b>future</b> [31 – 33].|$|R
