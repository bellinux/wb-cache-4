I also feel more connected emotionally to the music I'm writing now, so it's more of a pleasure to do it." ...|$|E

This ruling should {{put to rest}} the unethical, anti-choice scare tactic of using pseudo-science to harass abortion clinics and scare women." [...] John Kindley, {{one of the lawyers}} representing Kjolsrud stated: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>most</b> citizens, whether they are pro-choice or anti-abortion, believe in an individual's right to self-determination. They believe people shouldn't be misled and should be told about [...] risks, even if there is controversy over those risks." [...] Kindley also wrote a 1998 Wisconsin Law Review article outlining the viability of medical malpractice lawsuits based upon not informing patients considering abortion about the [...] ABC hypothesis.|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} soon {{declared}} the official [...] "musical ambassadors" [...] for the year, although, according to Linnell, {{it was more}} of an informal arrangement. The band had originally planned to create short videos called [...] "Space Minutes" [...] which would have aired on an unspecified cable television station that was affiliated with ISY, but the plans never came to fruition. In support of the designation, the logo for ISY is included on the back cover of the album. The band was scheduled for concerts to endorse ISY, and mentioned in promotional material from NASA, which headed the celebration in the United States.

500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} mythology, {{there was no}} {{ceremonial}} signing of the Declaration on July 4, 1776. After Congress approved {{the wording of the}} text on July 4, the fair copy was sent to be printed. As president, Hancock may have signed the document that was sent to the printer John Dunlap, but this is uncertain because that document is lost, perhaps destroyed in the printing process. Dunlap produced the first published version of the Declaration, the widely distributed Dunlap broadside. Hancock, as President of Congress, was the only delegate whose name appeared on the broadside, although the name of Charles Thomson, secretary of the Continental Congress, but not a delegate, was also on it as [...] "Attested by" [...] implying that Hancock had signed the fair copy. This meant that until a second broadside was issued six months later with all of the signers listed, Hancock was the only delegate whose name was publicly attached to the treasonous document. Hancock sent a copy of the Dunlap broadside to George Washington, instructing him to have it read to the troops [...] "in the way you shall <b>think</b> <b>most</b> proper".|$|E

Garfunkel confirmed to Rolling Stone in 2014 {{that he believes}} they will tour in the future, although Simon had been too [...] "busy" [...] in recent years. [...] "I know that audiences {{all over the world}} like Simon and Garfunkel. I'm with them. But I don't think Paul Simon's with them," [...] he remarked. In a 2016 interview with NPR's David Greene, when asked about the possibility of reuniting, Simon stated; [...] "Well, I don't <b>think</b> <b>most</b> people do [...] The fact is, is, like, we did do two big reunions, and we're done. There's nothing really much to say. You know, the music essentially stopped in 1970. [...] And, you know, I mean, quite honestly, we don't get along. So it's not like it's fun. If it was fun, I'd say, OK, sometimes we'll go out and sing old songs in harmony. That's cool. But when it's not fun, you know, and you're {{going to be in a}} tense situation, well, then I have a lot of musical areas that I like to play in. So that'll never happen again. That's that." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the decade}} later {{featured}} {{a decline in}} output by neo soul artists, with many of them failing to make a commercial impact after previous successes or not releasing a follow-up album. Badu's commercial viability decreased as each of her releases following her debut Baduizm departed further from that album's music. Hill followed-up her 1998 debut, considered the best-selling neo soul album, with the 2002 live album MTV Unplugged No. 2.0, a combative, confessional work in which she expresses her misgivings about fame. Melena Ryzik of The New York Times wrote in a retrospect of that [...] "era of left-of-center black singer-songwriters", stating [...] "many of them struggled to keep their creative momentum, conflicted about their early mainstream success." [...] Producer and Soulquarians member Questlove elaborated on the artists' regression from the mainstream, saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>most</b> of us went through our psychosomatic, quasi-self-saboteur stage. Once we got that first taste of success, I think just the pressure of reacting got to all of us. Some of us released some of the craziest records of our career." [...] Other artists such as D'Angelo and Hill went on indefinite hiatus from the music scene. Tyler Lewis from PopMatters attributed the decline to [...] "the downside of [...] rejection of the term [...] ".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta, and {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis. [...] "Company Picnic" [...] was the 100th overall episode of The Office, and show creator Greg Daniels said he was especially proud the series made it to that landmark because he felt it meant he did not disappoint Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British version of the show. Daniels said, [...] "I remember interviewing with them seven years ago, and this (100th episode) was certainly the goal, so I'm very pleased that we got to 100 episodes in a strong fashion. I think the show {{is in a very}} good place right now." [...] Steve Carell said he was especially pleased with the landmark because when the show began, people had doubts it would live up to the original series and were skeptical about its mockumentary style: [...] "It's sort of remarkable, especially with this show because I don't think anybody felt it would go past the pilot. ... I <b>think</b> <b>most</b> everyone was kind of dubious about our chances of pulling it off." [...] Likewise, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment and an Office executive producer, said, [...] "It's a thrill that we got to 100 episodes, and probably incredibly surprising looking back at the process it took. But the reality is, we believed in it." ...|$|E
