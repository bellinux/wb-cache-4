One of tools is used for measuring temperature, humidity, and lighting intensity of a space. Therefore, the growth of plants could be controlled as well. In this case, the created tool is utilized in monitoring temperature, humidity and lighting intensity in the laboratory of Agriculture at University of Muhammadiyah Malang. This research is purposed to facilitate the user in collecting the data of temperature, humidity and lighting intensity are observed in the chamber. As a result, the data can be tabulated in the computer system automatically. In addition, this system operates the microcontroller feature during processing the data acquisition of temperature, humidity and lighting intensity which are employed by the module of SHT 11 and LDR sensor. In communicating both the microcontroller and the computer apply as serial communication. Also, Serial communication is completed by MAX 232 type of IC. Finally, the data of temperature, humidity and lighting intensity are measured by the sensor analyzed by microcontroller and sent to computer via Converter USB to Serial.

40|$|Rigid multibody {{dynamics}} {{are often}} subject to redundant constraints. In {{the context of}} contacts it is usually not clear which constraints can be removed {{in order to obtain}} a correct solution. But also in the context of jointed multibody systems the removal of redundant constraints selects a particular solution of the underdetermined problem. In case of dissipative systems this also affects the velocity solution and thus the evolution of the dynamic system. In this report this problem is demonstrated exemplarily by means of a <b>table</b> <b>sliding</b> down a ramp. An alternative approach is suggested, which keeps redundant constraints but regularizes the ill-posed problem in a physically motivated way such that a unique solution is obtained. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new {{pneumatic}} positioning device {{coupled with a}} piezoelectric self-moving mechanism to overcome the main disadvantages of the inherent poor positioning accuracy obtained by traditional pneumatic cylinder. The new driving mechanism is to mount a piezoelectric Impact Drive Mechanism (IDM) to the controlled <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> driven by the pneu-matic cylinder. Based on the configuration, {{the first step of}} positioning proc-ess is to actuate the <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> with rough position accuracy but with the benefits of high-speed and large-range due to the pneumatic cylinder. The second step is to drive the <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> with high position accuracy by utiliz-ing the impact force of IDM. The experimental results show that the con-trolled <b>sliding</b> <b>table</b> is successfully positioned in 0. 236 s with rough accuracy of 10 µm and with the stroke of 100 mm by utilizing the pneumatic cylinder, and the final positioning accuracy of 10 nm with respect to the terminated position of the first-stage control is obtained in 1. 479 s due to the actuations of IDM. It is shown that the pneumatic positioning device coupled with IDM has attractive practical applications in the field of precision industry...|$|R
