40|$|AbstractThe {{prevalence}} of five avian haemoparasite groups was examined for effects {{on health and}} associations with extrinsic factors. Overall, 786 samples were examined from six sites in two Georgia (USA) watersheds, during breeding and non-breeding periods in 2010 and 2011. Among the four most commonly infected species, Haemoproteus prevalence was significantly higher in Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) compared to Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea) and <b>Tufted</b> <b>Titmice</b> (Baeolophus bicolor) while prevalence in White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) {{was significantly higher than}} in Indigo Buntings. Higher {{prevalence of}} Plasmodium was noted in <b>Tufted</b> <b>Titmice</b> and Northern Cardinals. While Leucocytozoon prevalence was highest in White-throated Sparrows, Trypanosoma prevalence was highest in <b>Tufted</b> <b>Titmice.</b> Interesting differences in infection probabilities were noted between foraging guilds with Haemoproteus associated with low-middle level strata and birds in the middle-upper strata {{were more likely to be}} infected with Plasmodium and Trypanosoma. In contrast, ground-foraging birds were more likely to be infected with Leucocytozoon. Breeding season was correlated with higher polychromasia counts and higher prevalence of Haemoproteus, Plasmodium and Trypanosoma. In addition, prevalence of infection with certain haemoparasite genera and packed cell volume (PCV) were different among host species. Body mass index was inversely correlated with prevalence of microfilaria infection but positively related to Haemoproteus infection. However, we found no relationship between PCV or polychromasia levels with haemoparasite infection. Molecular characterization of 61 samples revealed 19 unique Haemoproteus (n= 7) and Plasmodium (n= 12) haplotypes with numerous new host records. No differences were noted in haplotype diversity among birds with different migratory behaviors or foraging heights, thus additional studies are needed that incorporate molecular analysis, host biology, and vector biology into comprehensive models on parasite ecology. Detailed morphological examination of these parasites is also necessary to determine if closely related haplotypes represent single species or morphologically distinct, but closely related, haplotypes...|$|R

40|$|Many birds utter alarm calls {{when they}} {{encounter}} predators, and previous work {{has revealed that}} variation in {{the characteristics of the}} alarm, or "chick-a-dee," calls of black-capped (Poecile atricapilla) and Carolina (P. carolinensis) chickadees conveys information about predator size and threat. Little is known, however, about possible information conveyed by the similar "chick-a-dee" alarm call of <b>tufted</b> <b>titmice</b> (Baeolophus bicolor). During the winters of 2008 and 2009, free-ranging flocks (N = 8) of <b>tufted</b> <b>titmice</b> were presented with models of several species of raptors that varied in size, and titmice responses were monitored. Smaller, higher threat predators (e. g., eastern screech-owl, Megascops asio) elicited longer mobbing bouts and alarm calls with more notes (D-notes) than larger lower threat predators (e. g., red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis). During playback experiments, titmice took longer to return to feeding after playbacks of alarm calls given in response to a small owl than to playbacks given in response to a large hawk or a robin (control). Like chickadees, titmice appear to utter alarm calls that convey information about predator size and threat. Titmice, however, appear to cue in on the total number of D-notes given per unit time instead of the number of D-notes per alarm call. The broadband alarm calls of titmice, containing D-notes uttered in an unpredictable manner that may make it difficult for predators to determine the number of titmice calling, may be particularly well suited for deterring predators.

40|$|Scatterhoarding animals play a {{key role}} in the {{dispersal}} and reproduction of commercially and ecologically important tree species throughout the world. In particular, seed caching by animals such as tree squirrels (Sciurus) and jays (Corvidae) is largely responsible for natural regeneration in eastern North American oaks (Quercus). In this dissertation, I explore the roles of seed traits, animal traits, and ecological context in determining how animals handle seeds, and how these handling decisions affect seed fate. I also develop new statistical approaches to the analysis of seed tracking data. Chapter 1 introduces the issue of context-dependent acorn dispersal from both a theoretical and applied perspective. Chapter 2 synthesizes the literature on scatterhoarding behavior under a utility-based choice modeling framework to develop a general model of hoarder decision-making. Chapters 3 and 4, respectively, use expectation-maximization (EM) techniques to derive an estimator for dispersal and survival of marked seeds with imperfect detection, and then apply this estimator to determine the effects of change in seed community composition on seed fate in northern red oak (Q. rubra), white oak (Q. alba), and American chestnut (Castanea dentata) dispersed by forest rodents. Chapter 5 uses data on radio tagged northern pin oak (Q. palustris), black oak (Q. velutina), and white oak dispersed by blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata), <b>tufted</b> <b>titmice</b> (Baeolophus bicolor) and other birds to examine the effects of habitat on seed movement and survival. Finally, Chapter 6 proposes a hidden Markov model designed to analyze spatially explicit multistate mark-recapture data on tagged seeds. ...|$|R
40|$|We used 37 {{years of}} North American Breeding Bird Surveys {{to test for}} effects of {{periodical}} cicada (Magicicada spp.) emergences on the abundance and spatial synchrony of 24 species of avian predators in hardwood forests of the eastern United States. Fifteen (63 %) of the bird species exhibited numerical changes in abundance apparently associated with emergences of the local periodical cicada brood, and intraspecific spatial synchrony of bird abundance was significantly greater between populations sharing the same cicada brood than between populations in the ranges of different broods. Species exhibited at least four partially overlapping temporal patterns. (I) Cuckoos (Coccyzus spp.) occurred in high numbers only during emergence years and subsequently declined in abundance. (2) Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus), Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata), Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), and Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) increased significantly 1 - 3 years following emergences and then declined. (3) Red-headed Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), American Crows (Corvus brachyrynchos), <b>Tufted</b> <b>Titmice</b> (Baeolophus bicolor), Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis), and Brown Thrashers (Toxostoma rufum) were found in significantly low numbers during emergence years, underwent significant numerical increases in the following year, and then stabilized. (4) Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina), Northern Mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos), Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), and House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) exhibited significantly deviant population numbers 1 - 2 years prior to emergences, below the long-term mean {{in the first two}} species and above the long-term mean in the latter two. These results suggest that the pulses of resources available at 13 - or 17 -year intervals when periodical cicadas emerge have significant demographic effects on key avian predators, mostly during or immediately after emergences, but in some cases apparently years following emergence events...|$|R

40|$|Many mammal {{and bird}} species respond to {{predator}} encounters with alarm vocalizations that generate risk-appropriate responses in listeners. Two conceptual frameworks are typically {{applied to the}} information encoded in alarm calls and to associated anti-predator behaviors. ‘Functionally referential’ alarm systems encode nominal classes or categories of risk in distinct call types that refer to distinct predation-risk situations. ‘Risk-based’ alarms encode graded or ranked threat-levels by varying the production patterns of the same call types as the urgency of predation threat changes. Recent work suggests that viewing alarm-response interactions as either referential or risk-based may oversimplify how animals use information in decision-making. Specifically, we explore whether graded alarm cues {{may be useful in}} classifying risks, supporting a referential decision-making framework. We presented predator (hawk, owl, cat, snake) and control treatments to captive adult <b>tufted</b> <b>titmice</b> Baeolophus bicolor and recorded their vocalizations, which included ‘chick-a-dee’ mobbing calls (composed of chick and D notes), ‘seet’ notes, two types of contact notes (‘chip’, ‘chink’), and song. No single call type was uniquely associated with any treatment and the majority of acoustic measures varied significantly among treatments (46 of 60). The strongest models (ANOVA and classification tree analysis) grouped hawk with cat and owl, and control with snake, and were based on the number or proportion of a) chick and D notes per chick-a-dee call, b) chip versus chink notes produced following treatment exposure, and c) the frequency metrics of other note types. We conclude that (1) the predation-threat information available in complex titmouse alarm calls was largely encoded in graded acoustic measures that were (2) numerous and variable across treatments and (3) could be used singly or in combinations for either ranking or classification of threats. We call attention to the potential use of mixed threat identification strategies, where risk-based signal information may be used in referential decision-making contexts...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} individual variation in foraging behavior {{in response to}} seasonal food shortage in populations of Carolina Chickadees (Parus carolinensis) and <b>Tufted</b> <b>Titmice</b> (Parus bicolor) at the Ross Biological Reserve, Tippecanoe County, Indiana. Each individual was banded, sexed, measured (wing, beak, and tarsus lengths), and observed to quantify foraging behavior in the field (foraging height, foraging distance from trunk, foraging substrate diameter, and foraging technique). The data provided descriptions of associations between intraspecific morphological variation and foraging behavior, individual and interindividual variation in foraging, changes in population total niche width and its components, and seasonal variation in breadth and overlap of the feeding niche between the two parid populations. I measured changes {{in the degree of}} generalization in foraging at both the individual and the population levels. The flexibility of individuals and populations in response to food reduction from early to late winter helped to test predictions made by foraging theory and competition theory. ^ Correlations between morphological characters and foraging behavior were not strong and provided only partial support for the expectation that intraspecific morphological variation is related to resource utilization and is an adaptation to avoid niche overlap among individuals in the population. Individuals of both species were generalists. Individual foraging generalization increased to a degree that approached population-level generalization in late winter when food is most scarce. ^ Population-level patterns are not always mirrored on the individual level, as is often assumed. Although most individuals showed similar changes in foraging behavior and became more generalized when food was scarce, some individuals shifted in opposite directions or generalized much more than others. Most results are consistent with the prediction based on foraging theory that food scarcity will favor behavioral generalization and broadening diet. Competition pressure for avoidance of overlap in resource use among individuals and between species seems weak in comparison to individualistic generalization. Competition between and within these populations was not strong enough to force either significant divergence among conspecifics or niche divergence of populations in spite of a declining food supply. ...|$|R
