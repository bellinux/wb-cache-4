25|$|In an {{interview}} with s Kris Aquino in early 2009, Nina stated that she would file an estafa (fraud) case against ex-boyfriend Nyoy Volante's parents Evangeline and Oliver for not paying their debts. She added that in 2007, the couple borrowed ₱1.4 million from her. The following year, Oliver issued several checks as payment for their debt. Some of the checks, however, bounced, she said. She further stated that in July 2008, she entered into a compromise agreement with the couple under which Evangeline immediately paid her ₱300,000 in cash. The couple also agreed <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> of ₱1.1 million in monthly installments—from August 20, 2008 to February 20, 2010. They later gave her nineteen postdated checks which were signed by Oliver. Nina said that although {{she was able to}} cash some of the checks, some—which totaled ₱550,000—were not honored due to insufficient funds.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a two-level supply chain coordination problem for fixed lifetime products with permissible delay in payments. Two cases are discussed; that is, the retailer is required <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> {{before the end}} of the ordering cycle (Case I) and after the ordering cycle (Case II). The coordination models are proposed and analyzed, respectively. The analytical methods as to how to determine the optimal policy are presented. In addition, it is indicated that the supplier's cost as well as that of the total system will be reduced no matter how much the parameters change, and the retailer will benefit from coordination, if the supplier is willing to share the cost saving with him/her in Case I. In Case II, the retailer's average cost will be reduced and the supplier will benefit from coordination only under certain conditions. Besides, the results show that, for fixed lifetime products, providing longer credit period than the retailer's order period is not commonly applicable...|$|E
40|$|The {{reason for}} this study is <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> between {{technology}} and preponderance in war. Each theory claims its own superiority to be decisive {{when it comes to}} achieving military victories, but this study will show what actually happens when the two theories are analyzed together in the same conflict. To prove the conclusions, a case-study on Operation Gazelle is used. The study will describe the theories, what a military victory is and which party in the conflict came out victorious after this specific operation. Both sides’ forces will be shown and compared. The most significant technological systems will be analysed and compared. When this is done, the victory and the theories’ importance can be explained. Operation Gazelle was an act performed by Israel in October 1973 during the conflict with Egypt. It was an attempt to cross the Suez Canal and in that way gain an improved political status during the peace negotiations that were to come. The main question that will be answered is:- Which of the two theories, numerical preponderance and technology, is decisive when it comes to achieving military goals? To answer this question three other questions are answered:- What were the numerical conditions during Operation Gazelle?- What were the technological conditions between the parties?- Which party was victorious...|$|E

40|$|Objective - This study {{attempts}} {{to implement the}} efficient trade matrix among five selected ASEAN countries and its settlement by the gold reserve requirements through Multi-Bilateral Payments Arrangement (MBPA). Methods – The study is a qualitative research with analytic description. The purpose of this qualitative-descriptive study is to simulate the implementation of gold in the Multi-Bilateral Payment Arrangement among ASEAN countries using the current trade data. Results – This paper argues that the Southeast Asian countries can solve the problem through their internal coordination, particularly in terms of trade. One of the efforts is to reduce even eliminate the market risk by using the efficient payment arrangement. Conclusions – The study implied that the quantity amount of gold required <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>the</b> trade <b>balance</b> will be reduced from the early gross payment. However, the ASEAN countries need to strengthen the cooperation among them through maximizing the trade relationship...|$|R

40|$|The {{penetration}} {{of a large}} amount of distributed generation technologies with intermittent output, such as photovoltaic installations and wind turbines, yields an important challenge to the electric grid. This work illustrates the case of a virtual power plant that consists of several Cogeneration devices (CHP) systems and photovoltaic (PV) installations. The virtual power plant (VPP) operator bids electricity to the day-ahead market using the forecast for solar irradiation. In real time, the imbalance due to deviations between the forecast delivered and the real output has <b>to</b> be <b>settled</b> in <b>the</b> <b>balancing</b> market. Thus, in order to compensate for these errors, the operation of the CHP is rescheduled. The results show that the reduction of the imbalance can be larger than 80 % depending on the season. Additionally, the total operational cost is estimated. It is shown that in most of the cases the increase of the fuel cost is compensated by the reduction of the imbalance cost. Finally, it is demonstrated that the heat demand largely limits the ability of the CHP to reduce imbalance particular in summerstatus: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The {{imbalance}} {{costs incurred}} by a stochastic power producer due to forecast production errors {{have a significant}} impact on its total profit and therefore, such an impact needs to be taken into account when evaluating investment decisions. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework to analyze the effect of these imbalance costs on optimal generating expansion decisions of stochastic units. The proposed model is cast as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, which allows the explicit representation of both <b>the</b> day-ahead and <b>balancing</b> market-clearing mechanisms. We use the proposed framework to investigate the effect of two paradigmatic market designs on investment decisions: a day-ahead market that is cleared following a conventional cost merit-order principle, and an ideal market-clearing procedure that determines day-ahead dispatch decisions accounting for their impact on <b>balancing</b> operation costs. <b>The</b> variability throughout the planning horizon of the expected stochastic power production and demand level in the day-ahead market is modeled via a scenario set. Likewise, the uncertainty pertaining to their corresponding forecast errors, which are <b>to</b> be <b>settled</b> in <b>the</b> <b>balancing</b> market, is also characterized through scenarios. The main features and results of the proposed models are discussed using an illustrative two-node example and a more realistic 24 -node case study...|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} {{of a large}} amount of distributed generation (DG) technologies with intermittent output, such as photovoltaic installations and wind turbines, yields an important challenge to the electric grid. It is believed that aggregating them with controllable technologies such as cogeneration devices (CHP) can help to balance fluctuations of renewable energy. This work evaluates the ability of a virtual power plant (VPP) to reduce the imbalance error of renewable generators. The study is undertaken in a VPP that consists of several cogeneration devices and photovoltaic (PV) installations. The virtual power plant operator bids electricity into the day-ahead market using the forecast for solar irradiation and for the thermal demand. During the actual day, the imbalance due to deviations between the forecasted electricity delivered and the real output has <b>to</b> be <b>settled</b> in <b>the</b> <b>balancing</b> market. Thus, in order to compensate these errors and possible economic drawbacks, the operation of the CHP is adjusted periodically in a so called reschedule. Two different rescheduling strategies are compared against a ‘reference scenario’ in which the imbalance error is <b>settled</b> in <b>the</b> market. The first one (‘forced strategy’) aims at reducing the imbalance error every time step regardless of the imbalance prices. The second (‘economic strategy’) considers the imbalance prices and takes only action if it is economically appropriate and thus intends to reduce the total operational cost. The results show that the rescheduling technique is able to reduce the imbalance error (up to 90 % depending on the season and the strategy). Additionally, the total operational cost is estimated. However, the nowadays imbalance prices only lead to a minor financial advantage that is unlikely to motivate real life operators to perform a rescheduling strategy. status: publishe...|$|R
