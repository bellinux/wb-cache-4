40|$|This study {{describes}} field investigations {{designed to}} compare the infiltration capacities of 55 permeable pavement systems installed in the Netherlands and in Australia. The ages of <b>the</b> <b>pavements</b> varied from 1 to 12 years. Using infiltrometer testing, the performance of <b>the</b> <b>pavements</b> has been compared {{in terms of their}} ability to infiltrate a three month average recurrence interval storm event in the case of <b>the</b> Australian <b>pavements</b> or <b>the</b> minimum specification for European infiltration capacities of 97. 2 [*]mm/h for <b>the</b> Dutch <b>pavements.</b> Many of <b>the</b> tested <b>pavements</b> broadly follow a hypothetical decay curve of infiltration rate with age of pavement. However, these are clustered into two distinct groups (Dutch and Australian) with <b>the</b> older Australian <b>pavements</b> appearing to maintain higher infiltration rates relative to their age. The study has shown that the performance of <b>the</b> clogged permeable <b>pavement</b> systems was still generally acceptable, even after many years in service...|$|R

5|$|For most bikes, {{depending}} on geometry and mass distribution, capsize is stable at low speeds, and becomes less stable as speed increases {{until it is}} no longer stable.

5|$|A CNN film crew, {{who were}} there on a routine check for a {{possible}} Falun Gong protest, observed a man sitting down on <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> northeast of the Monument to the People's Heroes at {{the centre of the}} square.

Shortly afterwards, another four people on the square set themselves alight. One of the four, a man, was detained and driven away in a police van.|$|E
5|$|A snow sweeper uses brushes {{to remove}} thin layers of snow from <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> surface. Snow {{sweepers}} are used after plowing {{to remove any}} remaining material missed by the larger vehicles in areas with very low snow-tolerance, such as airport runways and racing tracks, as the flexible brushes follow the terrain better than the rigid blades of snowplows and snow blowers. These brushes also allow the vehicle to be used on the tactile tiles found at traffic lights and tram stops, without damaging the delicate surface. Unlike other winter service vehicles, snow sweepers do not compress the snow, leaving a rough, high friction, surface behind them. This makes snow sweepers the most efficient method of snow removal for snow depths below 10centimetres (4in). Snow deeper than this however can clog the brushes, and most snow sweepers cannot be used to clear snow deeper than 15centimetres (6in). A more advanced version of the snow sweeper is the jet sweeper, which adds an air-blower just behind the brushes, in order to blow the swept snow clear of <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> and prevent the loosened snow from settling.|$|E

He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.|$|E
5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The idealized bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown here does not incorporate any of the torques that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> cannot prevent the capsize mode from becoming unstable at high speeds, as Wilson and Cossalter suggest happens in the real world.|$|E

5|$|From West Main Street to South Avenue, {{the bridge}} {{supports}} were largely built with concrete while the supports on the section between Brown Street and West Main Street were mostly built with steel. Unlike the concrete supports, the steel supports flexed throughout the year, creating holes and gaps in <b>the</b> <b>pavement</b> {{on the deck}} above. The city of Rochester, which owns and maintains the section of NY31 within the city, closed the outer northbound lane of West Broad Street (westbound NY31) between Brown and Main Streets in June 2008 for this reason.|$|E

Supported by the viceroy Nicolás Antonio de Arredondo, he collected $8,000 and provided 500 cattle to mine rocks from the Martín García Island for this work.
