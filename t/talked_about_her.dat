25|$|Perutz's {{justification}} for passing Franklin's {{report about the}} crystallographic unit of the B-DNA and A-DNA structures to both Crick and Watson was that the report contained information which Watson had heard before, in November 1951, when Franklin <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> unpublished results with Raymond Gosling during a meeting arranged by M.H.F.
