5|$|By the 17th century, two {{developments}} {{allowed for}} the transits of planets {{across the face of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> be predicted and observed: the telescope and the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, which assumed elliptical, rather than circular, planetary orbits.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method is}} to use the {{aberration}} of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8minutes 12seconds to travel from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> the Earth.|$|E

5|$|Hale–Bopp became {{visible to}} the naked eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, {{it takes a long}} time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>to</b> reach the surface. Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E
5|$|If a comet is {{traveling}} fast enough, it may leave the Solar System. Such comets follow the open {{path of a}} hyperbola, and as such they are called hyperbolic comets. To date, comets are only known to be ejected by interacting with another object in the Solar System, such as Jupiter. An {{example of this is}} thought to be Comet C/1980 E1, which was shifted from a predicted orbit of 7.1 million years around <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>to</b> a hyperbolic trajectory, after a 1980 close pass by the planet Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|In Theosophy, it is {{believed}} the Seven Stars of the Pleiades transmit the spiritual energy of the Seven Rays from the Galactic Logos to the Seven Stars of the Great Bear, then to Sirius.

5|$|Late in the Nineteenth Dynasty the Book of Caverns, which {{divided the}} underworld into massive caverns {{containing}} deities {{as well as}} the deceased waiting for <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>to</b> pass through and restore them to life, was placed in the upper parts of tombs. A complete version appears in the tomb of Ramesses VI. The burial of Ramesses III saw the Book of the Earth, where the underworld is divided into four sections, climaxing in the sun disc being pulled from the earth by Naunet.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>to</b> maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>to</b> cool off or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> were a {{team on the}} rise, led {{by their}} All-Star point guard Kevin Johnson. Johnson arrived via trade in 1988, and {{propelled}} <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>to</b> two consecutive trips to the conference finals {{in his first two}} full seasons.|$|R

25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> {{were able}} <b>to</b> control {{most of the}} game without the {{suspended}} players, even taking a 16-point lead on the Spurs at one point, the Spurs came back to win an incredibly close Game 5. Diaw and Stoudemire did return for <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> in Game 6, though that didn't help <b>the</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>to</b> force a Game 7 and the Spurs eliminated them {{to advance to the}} Western Conference Finals with a 114-106 win.|$|R
5|$|SIM Lite {{measurements}} of Milky Way stars were to yield data to understand four topics: fundamental galactic parameters, the Oort Limit, disk mass potential, and {{mass of the}} Galaxy to large radii. The first, fundamental galactic parameters, was aimed at answering key questions about the size, shape and the rotation rate of the Milky Way. The team hoped to more accurately determine the distance from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> the galactic center. The second topic, the Oort Limit, would have attempted to determine {{the mass of the}} galactic disk.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{differential}} rotation is observed on {{stars such as}} the Sun when the angular velocity varies with latitude. Typically the angular velocity decreases with increasing latitude. However the reverse has also been observed, such as on the star designated HD31993. The first such star, other than <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>to</b> have its {{differential rotation}} mapped in detail is AB Doradus.|$|E
5|$|There {{had also}} been {{criticism}} of the proposed definition of double planet: at present the Moon {{is defined as a}} satellite of the Earth, but over time the Earth-Moon barycenter will drift outwards (see tidal acceleration) and could eventually become situated outside of both bodies. This development would then upgrade the Moon to planetary status at that time, according to the redefinition. The time taken for this to occur, however, would be billions of years, long after many astronomers expect <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> expand into a red giant and destroy both Earth and Moon.|$|E

5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Melville Hall in the University of St. Andrews was {{the setting}} for the Dover Recovery Centre. Nearly thirty film extras, film producers, and {{location}} scouts had to wait several hours for <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>to</b> set so they could film the scenes there. The restaurant scene, which is featured in the trailer and in promotional screenshots, {{was shot in the}} Regent Restaurant and Coffee Lounge in Weston-super-Mare in April 2009. Chiswick Town Hall, a dark building in London, was also used as a shooting location. The scenes where the Hailsham assemblies were held was filmed at a school in Snaresbrook, called Forest School, in May 2009. Ham House, Richmond, was used for filming mostly exterior scenes at Hailsham School and a couple of interior scenes.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on their}} orbital characteristics, short-period comets {{are thought to}} {{originate}} from the centaurs and the Kuiper belt/scattered disc —a disk of objects in the trans-Neptunian region—whereas the source of long-period comets {{is thought to be}} the far more distant spherical Oort cloud (after the Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort who hypothesised its existence). Vast swarms of comet-like bodies are thought to orbit the Sun in these distant regions in roughly circular orbits. Occasionally the gravitational influence of the outer planets (in the case of Kuiper belt objects) or nearby stars (in the case of Oort cloud objects) may throw one of these bodies into an elliptical orbit that takes it inwards toward <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> form a visible comet. Unlike the return of periodic comets, whose orbits have been established by previous observations, the appearance of new comets by this mechanism is unpredictable.|$|E

5|$|Gamma-ray bursts {{are very}} bright as {{observed}} from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a bolometric flux comparable to a bright star {{of our galaxy}} despite a distance of billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. GRB 080319B, for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude of 5.8, {{comparable to that of}} the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the rest-mass energy of the Sun (the energy which would be released were <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>to</b> be converted entirely into radiation).|$|E
5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from <b>the</b> <b>sun,</b> <b>to</b> protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, that is important for bone development).|$|E
5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>to</b> warm the cold earth.|$|E
