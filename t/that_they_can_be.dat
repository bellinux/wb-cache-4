Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage: for example, {{how to use them}} to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.|$|E
5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and whooping crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> mistaken for a small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than they are mistaken for other species of bird.|$|E

These questions are what Carroll provokes us with in [...] "All the men <b>that</b> think <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> me." [...] In this artist's book whose title says it all, Carroll takes the issue of the normative in relation to aesthetics and identification in photography from the universal to the particular—where all meanings exist subjectively.

5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat.

Some frog calls are so loud <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> heard up to a mile away.|$|E

5|$|Cagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots {{are popular}} pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their {{colourful}} plumage, or {{their ability to}} mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> kept in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade {{in some parts of}} the world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct in the wild.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower mandible applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly larger than those of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E
5|$|English verbs are inflected for {{tense and}} aspect, and marked for {{agreement}} with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb {{to be is}} still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects. Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.|$|E

5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak.

Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice per week.|$|E

Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E

5|$|The caves {{have been}} used by humans for around 45,000 years, {{demonstrated}} by the discovery of tools from the Palaeolithic period, along with fossilised animal remains. Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain. A corn-grinding mill operated on the resurgent waters of the River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086. The waters of the river are used in a handmade paper mill, the oldest extant in Britain, which began operations circa 1610.
