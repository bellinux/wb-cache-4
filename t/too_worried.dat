25|$|The Carp cabinet had Maiorescu as Justice Minister, and {{witnessed}} the first political disagreements {{between the two}} friends. Maiorescu was becoming convinced that Carp's ambitions could prove dangerous for their party, and privately complained that his friend still prioritized familial obligations over the business of state. The King <b>too</b> <b>worried</b> that the Junimist budgetary policy was a failure, and Carp, announcing that he was retreating to a private life in the country, handed in his resignation. Although the monarch rejected it, Parliament passed a motion of no confidence. Backed by the German Ambassador Alfred von Kiderlen-Waechter, who welcomed its free trade agenda, the cabinet received much German encouragement before Carp's awkward management of the crisis shook Kiderlen's confidence.|$|E

Den of Geek's Simon Brew also gave the episode a positive review, writing [...] "if you were awaiting a simple, easy-to-explain blockbuster of a Doctor Who series finale, you simply didn't get it here. Instead, if you were looking for something really very ambitious, often quite confusing, yet ultimately far more satisfying, then 'The Big Bang' absolutely hit the mark." ...|$|E

The patients diagnosed at the time when ER-status was brought in to clinical practice can show a selection bias though.

A uniform had been optional, {{but all of the}} instructors were keen on the idea. The duo's next step is re-designing the uniform of the catering department at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend. To get a feel of what it is like working in these uniforms, Trinny and Susannah spend a few hours working at the establishment. One worker commented [...] "We were surprised. Although they are quite posh, they did have a go. They weren't <b>too</b> <b>worried</b> about slops. Although Susannah did say it was making her ill." [...] Before the renewal of the uniform, it consisted of old-fashioned mismatched items, until it was replaced by matching pink gingham outfits. Then came the task of designing a practical outfit for the Somerfield workers. When the items are made, selected members of Somerfield model the catwalk in the fruit & veg section.|$|E

[...] It is unknown whether the police or junta will arrest those it had recorded. [...] Demonstrators wore black to mourn the death of democracy, and urged people who opposed the coup to also wear black. Protester Giles Ungphakorn noted, [...] "We believe we speak for a significant number of Thais who are <b>too</b> <b>worried</b> or too afraid to speak."
