40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal taxation of <b>transactions</b> <b>services</b> in a dynamic general equilibrium setting, where households use both cash and costly <b>transactions</b> <b>services</b> provided by banks to purchase consumption goods. With {{a full set}} of all tax instruments, the optimal tax structure is indeterminate. However, all optimal tax structures distort the relative costs of payment media, by raising the relative cost of deposits to cash. In the simplest optimal tax structure, the Friedman rule holds i. e. cash should be untaxed, and the rate of tax on <b>transactions</b> <b>services</b> can be higher or lower than the consumption tax. When parameters are calibrated to US data, simulations suggest that the <b>transactions</b> <b>services</b> tax should be considerably lower. This is because a transactions tax has a "double distortion": it distorts the choice between payment media, and indirectly taxes consumption. This contrasts with the special case of the cashless economy, when the first distortion is absent: in this case, it is optimal to tax <b>transactions</b> <b>services</b> {{at the same rate as}} consumption...|$|R

50|$|Minister Kesete {{is known}} for championing and {{introducing}} innovations {{to improve the quality}} and equity of health services. The Clean and Safe Health Facility (CASH) initiative, with the objective of making health facilities safe and comfortable for patients, attendants and health workers, has been launched by him. CASH is transforming hospitals across the country. Another notable innovation Dr Kesete has championed is the guidance and scaling up of an AUDITABLE Pharmaceutical <b>Transaction</b> <b>Service</b> (APTS), which is a local innovation, started in Debre Markos Referral Hospital. APTS is a data driven package of interventions designed to transform the pharmaceutical supply chain in general and pharmacy services at health facilities. It establish accountable, transparent and responsible supply chain and pharmacy practices enabling the Audit Bureau and regulatory authority to easily audit, trace and control products from theft, pilferage and illegal diversion. It helps supply chain organizations and health facilities to optimize utilization of medicines budget, improve access to affordable medicines, and decrease wastage. APTS standardizes and continuously monitors the number, mix & performance of supply and pharmacy service workforce. It also standardizes customer service premise design and workflow. Through improving recording and documentation, it generates reliable and consistent information for decision making and control for regulatory authority. As a result, APTS improves overall quality of the supply chain and pharmacy services thereby increasing patient knowledge on correct dosage and satisfaction for customers. APTS improves quality of pharmaceutical services, brings transparency, accountability and efficiency in health facilities through effective recording and reliable information. Ultimately it contributes to better health outcomes. from 2011 to the end of 2016, more than 77 hospitals have implemented APTS with dramatic improvement in availability of medicines and reduced wastage. During the inception of APTS, Dr Kesete and Mr. Ayalew Adinew-creator of APTS, discussed on the issue while they were in Adama for workshop developing manuals of “code of Ethics” for various health professions in Ethiopia. They discussed on the content of APTS, advantages and how to implement the system and Dr Kesete advised Ayalew on how to go about it. Dr Kesete decided to implement it at Amanuel Hospital and to transfer Ayalew from ALERT hospital to Amanuel Hospital, since he was the then CEO of the Amanuel hospital. But fortunately, soon he was promoted to be the health minister of the country so that he got opportunity to implement it nationally. He was leading implementation of the new system-APTS nationally, monitoring every month with very detailed knowledge of APTS. The new system-APTS is incorporated in a level four pharmacy pre-service training curriculum in Ethiopia with significant credit hours. The principles of APTS have potential to be scaled up to and beyond Ethiopia - globally both for pharmacy services and supply chain. Generally, Dr Kesete led and contributed a lot for the innovation, development and scale up of APTS.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper tackles {{the problem}} of {{composition}} of transaction services, which are governed by various transaction standards. Among others, we can cite the Object <b>Transaction</b> <b>Service,</b> Java <b>Transaction</b> <b>Service,</b> or Web Services Atomic Transaction. However, the Web Services Atomic Transaction standard encloses legacy transaction standards to support the Web Services application platform. This encapsulation introduces an additional complexity to the system and hides the specificities of legacy transaction standards. When composing heterogeneous legacy applications, the underlying transaction services are basically not composed transparently. This paper presents an approach to build an Adapted <b>Transaction</b> <b>Service,</b> named ATS, which supports several transaction standards concurrently. The objective of ATS is to facilitate the transaction standards composition. To introduce ATS we detail how the Object <b>Transaction</b> <b>Service,</b> Web Services Atomic Transaction, and Java <b>Transaction</b> <b>Service</b> standards can be composed. Besides, an ATS implementation is introduced using the GoTM framework. We show that this fine-grained component-based approach does not introduce an additional overhead to legacy applications and supports well scalability. Moreover, this approach can be extended to other standards...|$|E

As the number {{of the participants in the}} bandwidth transaction system increases, the needs for a strong and efficient access control mechanism, protecting unauthorized resource accesses, while providing authorized cooperation, become critical. To satisfy this pressing requirement, we introduce new <b>transaction</b> <b>service</b> mechanisms for cross-network open provisioning of QoS (Quality of Service) interconnection networks using agent-based RBAC (Role-based Access Control). We identify key bandwidth <b>transaction</b> <b>service</b> mechanisms and explain how each mechanism is interacting with the others. BMPs (Bandwidth Management Points) and BMSP (Bandwidth Management Switching Points) in the <b>transaction</b> <b>service</b> architecture are considered as the users for the RBAC approach. The interconnecting networks' <b>transaction</b> <b>service</b> level agreement (SLA) components de ne the BMPs' and BMSPs' roles. The permission informs the privileges to access specific network resources and information. As a result, the BMP and BMSP agents are authorized to execute the bandwidth transactions based on the roles assigned to their owners. This application of RBAC achieves more manageable and scalable security management of the bandwidth transaction services, supporting 1 www. band-x. com, www. enron. com, and www. ratexchange. com are some example on-line open marketplaces for bandwidth commodity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{characteristics}} of advanced applications vary {{a lot and}} the transaction concept must adapt to fulfil the varying transactional requirements. However, current transaction services {{do not support the}} required flexibility in a principled way. We believe that the need for <b>transaction</b> <b>service</b> flexibility can be supported through reflection, where the system is capable of inspecting and changing its own behaviour. The first part of this paper describes a framework for such a reflective transactional system, in which different transaction services can be deployed and modified, and from where a suitable <b>transaction</b> <b>service</b> can be chosen for the execution of a transaction. As concurrent transactions may request different transaction services, the framework allows concurrently active transaction services within the same environment. To ensure correctness when heterogeneous transaction services are concurrently active, a <b>transaction</b> <b>service</b> manager within this framework, provides, among other tasks, <b>transaction</b> <b>service</b> synchronization. The second part of the paper concentrates on service synchronization, and presents algorithms that demonstrate how correctness can be guaranteed when incompatible services are requested. ...|$|E
