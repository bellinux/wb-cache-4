In 1946, <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> ceremony became a televised event, though not with widespread telecast. From 1948 to 1951, President Harry S. Truman signalled <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> of the tree by remote control from his Independence, Missouri home, but in 1952, he stayed at the White House for <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> ceremony. In 1953, the ceremony was widely telecast and President Dwight David Eisenhower's address was radio broadcast through the Voice of America in thirty-four languages.|$|E

Nine nights of Navratri are celebrated with people performing Garba, the most popular folk dance of Gujarat, at venues across the city. The festival of lights, Deepavali, is celebrated with <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> of lamps in every house, decorating the floors with rangoli, and <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> of firecrackers. The annual Rath Yatra procession on the Ashadh-sud-bij date of the Hindu calendar at the Jagannath Temple and the procession of Tajia during the Muslim holy month of Muharram are important events.|$|E

5|$|Each of Hollywood Dream's 5 trains carry 36 {{riders in}} nine coaches, each having {{a row of}} four seats. All trains have an {{on-board}} audio and lighting system, with each seat having a headrest stereo sound system capable of playing one of five songs selected by the rider with a control panel inserted into the seat's restraining lap bar. The on-board audio and lighting system animates LED lights that are built into the trains' sides and front riderless pilot coach. <b>The</b> <b>lighting</b> program varies as the train moves, with different animations for different track sections and the station. <b>The</b> <b>lighting</b> pattern used for the park entrance track section gives {{the effect of a}} Comet with a sparkling head and glittering trail of light.|$|E

50|$|Three {{years after}} {{improvements}} to the keeper's house were made in 1890, the bridge to <b>the</b> <b>light</b> was destroyed by a storm.

5|$|In {{addition}} to religious allusions, the crew used color schemes and camera movements {{to create their}} own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic. When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle, with an earth tone, while the camera movement was gentle as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> was more neutral, with greater camera movement. When there was danger, <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> became colder with more grays and blues, and the camera shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.|$|E

5|$|The Glass Spider Tour was {{the first}} Bowie tour to reach Austria, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Wales.

5|$|The magazines, {{situated}} deep {{under the}} casemates, consist of alternating pairs of shell and cartridge rooms accessed via an ammunition passage {{at the front}} and a lighting passage behind. Great care was taken to reduce {{the possibility of an}} accidental explosion. The magazine workers wore special clothes and shoes to eliminate the risk of striking sparks and the floors of the cartridge stores were covered by wooden battens. <b>The</b> <b>lighting</b> was provided from oil lamps situated behind glass windows and accessed only from <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> passage, which was physically separated {{from the rest of the}} magazine. Sets of lifting gear enabled the workers to winch the cartridges and ammunition up to the casemates, with which they could communicate via voice tubes.|$|E

5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf {{was the basis}} for {{creating}} the others. A muscle system, which gave the appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model.

They refined this look before passing it off to <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> and technical directors.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit.
