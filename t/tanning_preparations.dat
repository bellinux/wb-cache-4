50|$|Today, DHA is {{the main}} active {{ingredient}} in many sunless tanning skincare preparations. Lotion manufacturers also produce {{a wide variety of}} sunless <b>tanning</b> <b>preparations</b> that replace DHA with natural bronzing agents such as black walnut shell. DHA may be used alone or combined with other tanning components such as erythrulose. DHA is considered the most effective sun-free tanning additive.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a study on identification of the speciation forms of chromium (III) in the tanning solutions. The cation complexes of Cr(III) were isolated and purified by ion-exchange chroma-tography. The isolated speciation forms were identified by differential pulse polarography (DPP) and VIS spectrophotometry. The activity of the <b>tanning</b> <b>preparations</b> {{is determined by the}} specific speciation forms of Cr(III) present in the solutions and determines their toxicity in the natural environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this research were to evaluate characteristic of goat skin before preparation for tanning, to observe the effect of concentration of gambier tanning agent and pH of gambier solution during tanning process. This research began with characterizing of skin before the tanning process. Gambier concentrations and pH of solutions were varied. Characterization of the goat skin was done on the area of goat skin, chemical composition, and weight change at each steps of <b>tanning</b> <b>preparations.</b> Physical and chemical analysis and observation of the leather were done according to SNI- 06 - 0463 - 1989 -A. Goat skin in this research was categorized as first quality according to the wide dimension and high water content. The {{results showed that the}} characteristics of dried goat skins changed during preparation and tanning process. The optimum concentration of gambier was 9...|$|E

ABSTRAKT: The main subject of this thesis is focused on preparation of taxidermal mounts with use of mammal bones and skins {{and their use}} as teaching aids. The target group are school children both of elementary and secondary schools. The thesis describes methods of bone preservation and cleaning, skin <b>tanning</b> and <b>preparation</b> of taxidermal mounts. I deal in it also with preparation of large vertebrates' skulls and preparation of taxidermal mounts. The procedures are described in details and the following chapters include photos of dissections made by me. Preparation of 4 bird and 6 mammal species is described. For each description, search of recent literature and PowerPoint presentation is included. KEYWORDS: preparation, taxidermal mounts, skin, vertebrates' skull...|$|R
50|$|Explore coastal Algonquian {{culture and}} history in the American Indian Town. The town {{represents}} an American Indian community similar to what the English explorers investigated and surveyed during their voyages to Roanoke Island {{and the surrounding area}} in the late 16th century. Visitors follow paths that wind through the park. Homes, agricultural areas and work shelters line the paths. Two longhouses represent the historical homes of American Indians from the region. One of the longhouses stretches more than 30 feet long and interprets the home of a leader from the community. A smaller and partially completed longhouse includes an interactive component that invites visitors to help complete the structure. Both areas contain interactive exhibits that focus on the developing relationship between the American Indian and English people during the late 16th century. The ceremonial dance circle is also located here. The exhibit has a planting and harvesting area where visitors can learn the advanced nuances of American Indian farming techniques. Three work shelters include activities like cordage (rope) making, mat and basket weaving, net mending, food <b>preparation,</b> <b>tanning</b> hides, fishing, boat building and gathering.|$|R
