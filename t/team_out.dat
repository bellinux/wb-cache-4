5|$|In 1979, Forest won the European Cup with a 1–0 {{victory over}} Malmö FF at the Olympiastadion. They {{also won the}} League Cup again after beating Southampton 3–2; Taylor led the <b>team</b> <b>out</b> at Wembley as Clough felt it was Taylor's turn – they always wanted to lead their <b>team</b> <b>out</b> {{together}} but were always denied permission by Football League chairman Alan Hardaker. After this success Forest bought Asa Hartford and Frank Gray, though Harford was sold on after two months after Taylor realised his limited passing range did not fit Forest's style of play. Forest were denied a third consecutive League Cup win in 1980 after a defeat in the final by Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} the first in which Bob Paisley and Brian Clough managed Liverpool and Leeds respectively. In {{recognition}} of his services to the club, Liverpool asked their retired manager Bill Shankly to lead the <b>team</b> <b>out</b> onto the field.|$|E
5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the San Francisco Giants in 2004, Sánchez quickly {{worked his way through}} the Giants' minor league system. In 2006, he was called up to the major leagues and was used mostly in a long relief role. In 2007, he made the <b>team</b> <b>out</b> of spring {{training}} and was again used mostly in long relief, though he spent part of his season in the minors. In 2008, he made the Giants' starting rotation and remained in it for the entire year, except for a stint on the disabled list.|$|E

5|$|After {{undertaking}} {{a series}} of friendlies, Arsenal played Tottenham Hotspur in the Charity Shield and drew 0–0 to share the honour. Defeats by Everton and Aston Villa {{set the tone for}} the league season as the team were left with much to do; a poor run of form during the Christmas and New Year period effectively ruled the <b>team</b> <b>out</b> of retaining the championship. Arsenal finished the season strongly however – unbeaten in 16 matches, to end the campaign in fourth place. Wright was Arsenal's top goalscorer with 26 goals.|$|E
5|$|Before Mota {{ever played}} for the Red Sox, however, he was traded again to the Cleveland Indians. He {{struggled}} in his time with the Indians in 2006 and was designated for assignment by them in August. The New York Mets acquired him, and Mota improved mightily upon joining them. Following the season, he became a free agent, but he again signed with the Mets. After struggling in 2007, he {{was traded to the}} Milwaukee Brewers. He got off to a poor start with Milwaukee in 2008 but improved in the second half. Following the season, Mota became a free agent and signed with the Dodgers again. He had his best year since 2004 and became a free agent again after the season. For {{the first time in his}} career, in 2010 he signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. After making the <b>team</b> <b>out</b> of spring training, Mota won his first career World Series despite struggling at times during the season. Following the season, he signed another minor league contract with the Giants and made the <b>team</b> <b>out</b> of spring training again. During the 2012 season, Mota became one of three players in league history to fail a drug test twice when it was shown he tested positive for Clenbuterol, a performance-enhancing drug.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{had agreed}} {{to play for the}} Cleveland Spiders in 1895, but instead he joined a Class D {{baseball}} <b>team</b> <b>out</b> of Warren, Ohio in the Iron and Oil League. Future Baseball Hall of Fame member Honus Wagner played on the team. Years later, Wagner recalled Chamberlain as an experienced pitcher who shared his baseball knowledge with his young teammates. He reported to the Spiders in 1896. The team featured Cy Young and young pitchers such as Cy Swaim and Zeke Wilson. Chamberlain was released after appearing in two games.|$|E

5|$|During the off-season, the Moose {{franchise}} was {{relocated to}} St. John's, Newfoundland {{due to the}} Winnipeg Jets' return to the NHL, forcing the <b>team</b> <b>out</b> of the Winnipeg market. As a result, the Canucks began a new AHL affiliation, moving Schroeder to the Chicago Wolves for the 2011–12 season. He scored his first goal with the Wolves on October 14, 2011, in a 4–2 loss to the Milwaukee Admirals. He finished the 2011-12 season third on the Wolves with 21 goals and 44 points.|$|E
5|$|However, {{before the}} start of the 1947–48 NBL season, Maurice White, the {{president}} of the American Gear Company and the owner of the American Gears NBL team, pulled the <b>team</b> <b>out</b> of the league. White planned to create a 24-team league called the Professional Basketball League of America, in which he owned all the teams and arenas. However, the league folded after just a month, and the players of White's teams were equally distributed among the 11 remaining NBL franchises. As a consequence, every team had a 9.09% chance of landing Mikan, who ended up on the Minneapolis Lakers, playing for coach John Kundla.|$|E
5|$|In August, manager Harvey Wippleman began {{appearing}} with the team. On the October 10 episode of All-American Wrestling, they defeated Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Champions The Rock 'n' Roll Express by countout {{but did not}} win the championship. On October 8, 1993, Well Dunn wrestled their first match against The Bushwhackers, who became the team's longtime rivals. During a match against Men on a Mission, Timothy Well sustained an injury. This forced the <b>team</b> <b>out</b> of action in the WWF for several months, although they did return to competing in Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|Lucic played minor hockey (VMHA) in Vancouver, {{but nearly}} quit the sport after being passed {{up in the}} 2003 WHL Bantam Draft. He was invited {{to play for the}} Coquitlam Express of the Junior A British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL), but was further {{demoralized}} when he initially failed to make the <b>team</b> <b>out</b> of rookie camp. He agreed to play, instead, for the Junior B Delta Ice Hawks, but later played his way onto the Express after five games.|$|E
5|$|Minutes {{before the}} NHL trade {{deadline}} on February 27, 2012, Hodgson was dealt, along with defenceman Alexander Sulzer, to the Buffalo Sabres {{in exchange for}} fellow rookie forward Zack Kassian and defenceman Marc-André Gragnani. Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis acknowledged the trade {{as an effort to}} balance his <b>team</b> <b>out</b> by trading Hodgson's skill and finesse in return for Kassian's size and toughness. Analysts from TSN and The Vancouver Sun also echoed the sentiment, commenting that while the Canucks gained elements in Kassian that were required to succeed in the playoffs, Hodgson's skill set reflected the style of play that Vancouver's success was based upon.|$|E
5|$|Mottola {{attended}} St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, {{graduating in}} 1989. After leading all Broward County {{high school players}} in batting average (.573), home runs (14) and runs batted in (RBIs) (48) as a senior, Mottola was named to Florida's Class 3A All-State first <b>team.</b> <b>Out</b> of high school, the Baltimore Orioles selected Mottola in the tenth round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft, with the 243rd overall selection. Mottola did not sign with the Orioles, opting to pursue a college baseball career.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{start to}} their league campaign, with one defeat {{in their first}} 12 matches saw Arsenal begin November in first spot. Although the club were winless during the Christmas period, their chances of winning the title {{remained}} intact. A run of two draws and losses in February was more severe, as it moved Arsenal down to fourth spot. Draws in April prompted Wenger to rule his <b>team</b> <b>out</b> of the title race and make priority to second spot, which came with a qualifying spot for the Champions League. Defeat to Newcastle United in the penultimate {{game of the season}} all but ended Arsenal's chances of finishing second, given Newcastle's superior goal difference. A win on the final day against Derby County meant the club finished third, level on points with Newcastle and Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} Christmas Bowl, Hiruma is {{selected}} by the Ojo White Knights' Seijuro Shin {{to be one of}} Team Japan's two quarterbacks for the International Youth American Football tournament due to his knack for trick plays. Hiruma quickly settles in as the main strategist on the team. Even before this, Hiruma spies on Team USA to acquire information on the ace American players, who are considered by far the favorites to win the tournament. In typical fashion, Hiruma refuses to permit players on the <b>team</b> <b>out</b> of sympathy rather than merit, including his Devil Bats teammates, but does agree with the decision to hold a final tryout as a method of enlisting bench players. Two years later, Hiruma, now in college, is part of the college's American football team, Saikyouda, opposing some of his former teammates (students at other colleges) as they compete to play in the Rice Bowl—the game between the best college American football teams.|$|E
5|$|Mills captained the Leicester {{team that}} reached the First Division play-offs in 1992–93 with a sixth place league finish, and they beat Portsmouth 3–2 on {{aggregate}} in the semi-final. However, they {{lost in the}} final for the second successive season, being beaten 4–3 by Swindon Town at Wembley Stadium. He made 53 appearances this season, missing only three of Leicester's fixtures. Mills featured regularly in 1993–94 before missing {{the last few months}} of the season with a foot injury, having made 25 appearances by then. By finishing fourth in the table Leicester made the First Division play-offs for the third successive season, and Mills led the <b>team</b> <b>out</b> before the final despite being unable to play. Leicester beat Derby County 2–1 and thus earned promotion to the Premier League.|$|E

5|$|Revie felt he did {{not have}} to {{strengthen}} his squad for the 1965–66 campaign, and made no new signings. With Leeds in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup he showed his gamesmanship, sending his <b>team</b> <b>out</b> against Italian club Torino wearing unfamiliar numbers in an attempt to confuse the Italian club's tight man-marking system. However Collins had his leg broken by Torino's Fabrizio Poletti, meaning Revie had to partner Giles and Bremner in central midfield and sign Huddersfield Town winger Michael O'Grady for £30,000. Although Collins would be missed the partnership of Giles and Bremner would prove highly effective. Leeds again finished second in the league, trailing Liverpool by six points. They reached the semi-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, losing on aggregate to Spanish side Real Zaragoza despite Revie ordering the fire brigade to flood the pitch before the replay at Elland Road.|$|E
5|$|Shankly {{took charge}} of Liverpool {{when they were in}} the Second Division and rebuilt the team into a major force in English and European football. He led Liverpool to the Second Division Championship to gain {{promotion}} to the top-flight First Division in 1962, before going on to win three First Division Championships, two FA Cups, four Charity Shields and one UEFA Cup. Shankly announced his surprise retirement from football a few weeks after Liverpool had won the 1974 FA Cup Final, having managed the club for 15 years, and was succeeded by his long-time assistant Bob Paisley. He led the Liverpool <b>team</b> <b>out</b> for the last time at Wembley for the 1974 FA Charity Shield. He died seven years later, aged 68.|$|E
5|$|The USEE had a scare against Eighteen of Bolton in {{the three-day}} match {{starting}} on Thursday, 18 July. They won by just 21 runs having been slightly behind on first innings. Grace and Southerton bowled the Bolton <b>team</b> <b>out</b> {{but the difference}} was a second innings of 63 by Charlwood {{in a total of}} just 120. Grace scored 51 and 22 and took 20 wickets. The USEE won the final match of this tour, starting on Monday, 22 July, against Twenty-two of Birmingham by 5 wickets, having been 23 behind on first innings. The USEE had a strong Gloucestershire flavour in this match with all three Grace brothers, Midwinter, Gilbert and Cranston involved. Birmingham scored 128 and 119, Grace taking 21 wickets. USEE scored 105 and 144–5, Grace making 7 and 59. He needed the support of his brother E. M., who scored 52 not out, to secure the five wicket victory.|$|E
