2500|$|In {{understanding}} basic maps, {{the field}} of cartography {{can be divided into}} two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1inch to 1 mile) [...] "Ordnance Survey" [...] maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produce <b>thematic</b> <b>map</b> series.|$|E

40|$|The use of geobrowsers has {{increased}} considerably {{over the last}} few years. <b>Thematic</b> <b>mapping</b> has a long history in cartography, but the new geobrowsers (like Google Maps and Earth) tend not to focus on this aspect of geographical information representation. This paper examines how Keyhole Markup Language (KML) can be used for <b>thematic</b> <b>mapping.</b> KML is not targeted towards <b>thematic</b> <b>mapping,</b> but it is possible to use KML elements in ways that were probably not intended. Current possibilities for making proportional symbol maps, chart maps, choropleth maps and animated maps with KML will be presented. These experiments show that KML and geobrowsers offer great potential for <b>thematic</b> <b>mapping,</b> but that there are significant issues that need to be resolved...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{analysis}} {{packages and}} <b>thematic</b> <b>mapping</b> {{are available in}} a number of traditional desktop GIS. However, visualizing <b>thematic</b> <b>maps</b> through the Internet is still limited to fix contents and restrict changes of the input data. The users with limited GIS knowledge or people who do not own digital map data are normally having difficulties to create output <b>thematic</b> <b>maps</b> from generic data. In this study, we developed <b>thematic</b> <b>mapping</b> services that can be applied to non-spatial data format served through powerful map services solutions. Novice users who have no GIS software experience or have no digital base map can simply input a plain text file with location identifier field such as place name or gazetteer to generate <b>thematic</b> <b>maps</b> online. We implemented a prototype by using web service standards recommended by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) such as Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS) and Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) to provide a principle for communication and allow users to visualize spatial information as <b>thematic</b> <b>maps.</b> The system dedicates a great deal of effort to the initial study of geospatial analysis and visualization for novice users including those with no past experience using Geographic Information Systems...|$|R
