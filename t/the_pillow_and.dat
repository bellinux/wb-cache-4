2500|$|It is {{a common}} belief that mora enters the room through the keyhole, sits on the chest of the {{sleepers}} and tries to strangle them (hence moriti, [...] "to torture", [...] "to bother", [...] "to strangle"). To repel moras, children are advised {{to look at the}} window or to turn <b>the</b> <b>pillow</b> <b>and</b> make a sign of cross on it (prekrstiti jastuk); in the early 19th century, Vuk Karadžić mentions that people would repel moras by leaving a broom upside down behind the door, or putting their belt on top of their sheets, or saying an elaborate prayer poem before they go to sleep.|$|E
2500|$|At {{around one}} o'clock one morning I {{returned}} to the Windsor Hotel in Melbourne to the staggering sight of Ken Barrington sitting alone in the lounge drinking whisky. The Test match was critically poised and Barrington, invariably an early-to-bed man in a crisis, was a portrait of gloom. He was batting {{first thing in the}} morning and couldn't sleep. He returned to bed, tossed and turned for another hour until, in desperation, he committed the capital offence of telephoning the manager's room. The Duke, a chronic insomaniac had a supply of sleeping pills so powerful that the average recipient would remain oblivious to nuclear attack. In the name of England, Barrington was determined to get his hands on them. [...] "Damn you, Barrington" [...] roared the Duke, [...] "I had only just got to sleep myself." [...] Then, relenting, he said [...] "All right, come and get them". In the same moment that Barrington's hand replaced the receiver his head hit <b>the</b> <b>pillow</b> <b>and</b> he fell into exhausted unconsciousness. The Duke waited and waited. He was still awake when dawn exploded into dazzling sunshine and it was time to get up.|$|E
