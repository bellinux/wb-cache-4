5|$|In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and severed all {{relations}} {{with his family}} {{to hide the fact that}} he dropped out of school. His friends <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> drowned in the nearby Mur River. Tesla moved to Maribor, where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins per month. He spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets.|$|E
5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> taken on another engineer in Dover {{and had gone}} fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised {{by the arrival of}} bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E
5|$|Sulla, who had {{observed}} the violent results of radical populare reforms (in particular those under Marius and Cinna), was naturally conservative, {{and so his}} conservatism was more reactionary than it was visionary. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and thus the senate. After being appointed Roman Dictator in 82 BC, he enacted a series of constitutional reforms. He resigned the Dictatorship in 80 BC, retired in 79 BC, and died a year later. While he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> firmly established aristocratic rule, his own career had illustrated the fatal weaknesses in the constitution. Ultimately, it was the army, and not the senate, which dictated {{the fortunes of the}} state.|$|E

5|$|The {{start of}} the 2003–04 season saw Johnson sign a three-year {{extension}} to his Nottingham Forest contract, but {{less than two weeks}} after signing, he suffered a fractured tibia in a match against Sheffield United on 13 September 2003. It was originally <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> suffered a double fracture, but this was denied by the club following scans. Nevertheless, he faced a lengthy absence from the game, potentially {{to the end of the}} season and beyond. His comeback began six months after his original injury in March 2004, first with a reserve match against West Ham United on 10 March, and then a substitute appearance against Crystal Palace on 13 March.|$|E
5|$|Claudius {{also wrote}} commentaries {{on the books}} of Leviticus, the {{historical}} books of the Old Testament, the Gospel of Matthew, and all Pauline epistles, of which the commentary on the Epistle to Galatians shows some of his views prefigure those expressed by both the Waldensians and Protestants centuries later. It was once <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> in fact founded the Waldensians, however this was disproved in the 19th century. His epistles on 1 and 2 Corinthians, however, dedicated to Theodemir, abbot of Psalmody, and a possible student of his, were sent to Aachen by the dedicatee to be condemned by the assembled bishops of the realm. The Corinthian commentaries were unpublished, though it was these commentaries that sparked the controversy concerning icons and pilgrimages.|$|E
5|$|In 1706, the Elector of Bavaria was {{deprived}} of his offices and titles for siding with Louis against the Empire. The following year, George was invested as an Imperial Field Marshal with {{command of the}} imperial army stationed along the Rhine. His tenure was not altogether successful, partly because he was deceived by his ally, the Duke of Marlborough, into a diversionary attack, and partly because Emperor Joseph I appropriated the funds necessary for George's campaign for his own use. Despite this, the German princes <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> acquitted himself well. In 1708 they formally confirmed George's position as a Prince-Elector in recognition of, or because of, his service. George did not hold Marlborough's actions against him which he understood {{were part of a}} plan to lure French forces from the main attack.|$|E

5|$|Sir R.E.M.Wheeler, the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India, in the 1940s {{saw a few}} {{potsherds}} of Arikamedu site {{displayed in}} the Madras Museum, which he identified as Arrentine ware, an expensive ceramic made until 50 CE in Arizzo, Italy. Thereafter, when he visited the Pondicherry Museum and saw more of {{the findings from the}} Arikamedu site, he was impressed and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> found the links between the Classical Mediterranean and Ancient India. Soon thereafter in 1945, the penultimate year of World War II, he mounted excavations in a scientific manner. He was looking for an archaeological site in India that could establish its cultural link, a datum of the Indian antiquities to the Greco-Roman period, and this quest led him to the Arikamedu site. These excavations also involved Indian archaeologists, who were trained on the site.|$|E
5|$|In 88 BC, {{an aristocratic}} senator named Lucius Cornelius Sulla was elected Consul, and soon {{left for a}} war in the east. When a Tribune revoked Sulla's command of the war, Sulla brought his army back to Italy, marched on Rome, secured the city, and left for the east again. In 83 BC he {{returned}} to Rome, and captured the city a second time. In 82 BC, he made himself Dictator, and then used his status as Dictator to pass a series of constitutional reforms that were intended to strengthen the senate. In 80 BC he resigned his Dictatorship, and by 78 BC he was dead. While he <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> firmly established aristocratic rule, his own career had illustrated the fatal weakness in the constitution: that it was the army, and not the senate, which dictated the fortunes of the state. In 70 BC, the generals Pompey Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus were both elected Consul, and quickly dismantled Sulla's constitution. In 62 BC Pompey returned to Rome from battle in the east, and soon entered into an agreement with Julius Caesar. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, known as the First Triumvirate. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements were to be ratified, Crassus was to be promised a future Consulship, and Caesar was to be promised the Consulship in 59 BC, and then the governorship of Gaul (modern France) immediately afterwards. In 54 BC, violence began sweeping the city, and in 53 BC Crassus was killed. In January 49 BC, the senate passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the republic. In response, Caesar quickly crossed the Rubicon with his veteran army, and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the Consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece, and allowed Caesar to enter the city unopposed.|$|E

25|$|Kapp {{was arrested}} in Sweden on 16 April but not {{deported}} to Germany. He voluntarily returned to Germany in April 1922 and died the same year in prison while awaiting trial. Lüttwitz returned to Germany {{as part of an}} amnesty in 1924. Gustav Noske was forced to resign by the unions on 22 March, as a condition for ending the general strike and because some in the SPD <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been tough enough facing up to the putschists; Otto Gessler succeeded Noske as Defence Minister. General Reinhardt also resigned out of protest at Noske's dismissal. General Seeckt became his successor as Chef der Heeresleitung.|$|E
25|$|That {{same night}} Menéndez {{returned}} to St. Augustine; {{and when the}} event became known, there were some, even in that isolated garrison, living in constant dread of a descent by the French, who considered him cruel, an opinion which his brother-in-law, Merás, the very man who helped to kill Ribault, {{did not hesitate to}} record. And when the news eventually reached Spain, even there a vague rumor was afloat that there were those who condemned Menéndez for perpetrating the massacre against his given word. Others among the settlers <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> acted as a good captain, because, with their small store of provisions, they considered that there would have been an imminent danger of their perishing by hunger had their numbers been increased by the Frenchmen, even had they been Catholics.|$|E

40|$|The {{personality}} of Shitao (1642 - 1707), Chinese painter active during {{the beginning of}} Qing dynasty, deserves to be figured out by the comparison of his own particular life, his artistic work, – above all in the phase of its full utterance, – and the philosophical <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> revealed in his Dialogues on painting.

25|$|The {{leading cause}} of death still remains lead {{poisoning}} however. M. H. Stevens and his team have concluded that high levels of lead deep in the bone sampled from Beethoven's skull suggest repeated exposure {{over a long period of}} time rather than limited exposure prior to the time of death. Among other evidence, the finding of shrunken cochlear nerves at his autopsy is consistent with axonal degeneration due to heavy metals such as lead. Chronic low-level lead exposure causes a slowly progressive hearing loss with sensory and autonomic findings, rather than the classic wrist drop due to motor neuropathy from sub-acute poisoning. Beethoven's physicians <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> alcohol dependence. He particularly liked wine that happened to be tainted with lead, therefore Beethoven's chronic consumption of wine tainted with lead is a better explanation of his hearing loss than other causes.|$|E
25|$|Godley {{defended the}} bridge for two hours, until {{he ran out}} of ammunition. His final act was to {{dismantle}} the gun and throw the pieces into the canal. He attempted to crawl to safety, but advancing German soldiers caught him and took him to a prisoner of war camp. His wounds were treated, but he remained in camp until the Armistice. Originally it was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been killed, but some time later it was found that he was a prisoner of war in a camp called Delotz at Dallgow-Döberitz. It was in the camp that he was informed that he had been awarded the Victoria Cross. Godley left the camp in 1918 after the guards fled their posts. He received the actual medal from King George V, at Buckingham Palace, on 15 February 1919.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. She turned back to look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E

60|$|Then {{will that}} man crave no more for signs and wonders, with the superstitious and the unbelieving, who have eyes, and see not; ears, and cannot hear; whose hearts are waxen gross, {{so that they}} cannot {{consider}} the lilies of the field, how they grow: but all his cry will be to the Lord of Order, to make him orderly; to the Lord of Law, to make him loyal; to the Lord in whom is nothing arbitrary, to take out of him all that is unreasonable and self-willed; and make him content, like his Master Christ before him, to do the will of his Father in heaven, who has sent him into this noble world. He will no longer fancy that God is an absent God, who only comes down {{now and then to}} visit the earth in signs and wonders: but <b>he</b> will know <b>that</b> God is everywhere, and over all things, from the greatest to the least; for in God, he, and all things created, live and move and have their being. And therefore, knowing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is always in the presence of God, he will pray to be taught how to use all his powers aright, because all of them are the powers of God; pray to be taught how to see, and how to hear; pray <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> is called to account for the use of this wonderful body which God has bestowed on him, he may not be brought to shame by the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> used it merely for his own profit or his own pleasure, much less by the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> weakened and diseased it by misuse and neglect: but comforted by the <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done with it what the Lord Jesus did with his body--made it the useful servant, and not the brutal master, of his immortal soul.|$|R

25|$|Here then De Morgan {{had made}} a great advance by {{introducing}} quantification of the terms. At that time Sir William Hamilton was teaching in Edinburgh a doctrine of the quantification of the predicate, and a correspondence sprang up. However, De Morgan soon perceived that Hamilton's quantification was of a different character; that it meant for example, substituting the two forms The whole of A is the whole of B, and The whole of A {{is a part of}} B for the Aristotelian form All A's are B's. Hamilton <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> placed the keystone in the Aristotelian arch, as he phrased it. Although {{it must have been a}} curious arch which could stand 2000 years without a keystone. As a consequence he had no room for De Morgan's innovations. He accused De Morgan of plagiarism, and the controversy raged for years in the columns of the Athenæum, and in the publications of the two writers.|$|E
