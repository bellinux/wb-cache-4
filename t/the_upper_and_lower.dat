40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with stochastic differential games (SDGs) defined through fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) which are governed by Brownian motion and Poisson random measure.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> contralateral <b>lower</b> limb coordination <b>and</b> to study the effect of speed on <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> contralateral <b>lower</b> limb coordination in individuals with stroke and control groups. Thirty individuals with stroke who were able to walk independently without using any assistive devices and 30 control individuals were recruited for <b>the</b> study. <b>Upper</b> <b>and</b> contralateral <b>lower</b> limb coordination was analyzed using the shoulder and contralateral hip displacements in the sagittal plane. All data were analyzed by three-dimensional gait analysis. Results demonstrated high degrees of coordination in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> contralateral <b>lower</b> limbs of the controls <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> unaffected <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> affected <b>lower</b> limbs of individuals with stroke. Gait speed was found to be associated with <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> contralateral <b>lower</b> limb coordination in individuals with stroke but not in the controls. The findings implied that <b>the</b> affected <b>upper</b> limb plays an important role for improving gait coordination and is necessary for gait performance in individuals with stroke.

The lower teeth are narrower and more upright than the uppers, and may be smooth to finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E

The device {{is based on}} self-locking worm and worm wheel and slot-and-crank drive. Its mechanical properties and calculation formula is also given out. After the device being driven by gear motor, output torque rotates the driving and driven gears first, and then transmits the driving force to <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> worms; Then <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> worms rotate their meshing worm gears separately and the worm gears sway <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> crank-connecting rods articulated in worm gears; Lastly, three times amplification of the force is realized by the force-amplifier of <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> crank connecting rods.
