25|$|The {{boat was}} {{calibrated}} {{by measuring the}} height of the gunwales above water level at each corner with the boat unladen and then measured again when known weights had been loaded into the boat from an overhead gantry. These measurements were logged in toll-keeper's tables and copies sent to every <b>toll</b> <b>office</b> within the boat's trading range. At toll offices if a toll collector suspected an incorrect waybill (declared cargo) {{the height of the}} four corners of the boat were checked with a gauging stick and averaged to allow for uneven cargo loading. That boat's entry in the gauging table was used to determine the cargo weight. The toll fee was worked out from the weight and cargo type.|$|E
25|$|Although renovated and {{expanded}} in 1758, the toll house {{next to the}} bridge (also called the bridge master's house) was torn down in 1827 {{to be replaced by}} a new city hall, designed by the architect J.P. Orentzburg. This new building, situated on the bank of the Vecht, housed all offices of the municipal authorities — including the city council, the court, the tax and <b>toll</b> <b>office,</b> the Gentlemen's Society and the home of the burgomaster. The court moved to a new building in 1882. The burgomaster and the Gentlemen's Society moved soon afterwards. The city hall was renovated {{and expanded}} in 1925 and again in 1955.

5000|$|In a 2008 report written {{after the}} study, the Regional Council {{suggested}} that future tolling programs (and by extension, VMT programs) could better protect participants’ privacy through {{a choice of}} two different mileage recording approaches. [...] Participants could either enroll in the “thin client” or “thick client” operating approaches. The thin client would use an on-board toll meter where all raw data {{was transferred to the}} <b>tolling</b> <b>office.</b> In the office, the data would be processed and the road segments would be recognized and matched with toll rates. In the thick client approach, the tolling process would take place in the on-board unit. After the road section was recognized, the toll rate would be processed in the on-board unit according to the type of the road, time period, and vehicle class. The road information could then be sent to the <b>tolling</b> <b>office</b> in aggregate form. Under this approach, specific road details would never be stored in the <b>toll</b> system <b>office.</b> If the fee was calculated in the on-board unit, it would also be possible to integrate a card slot into the on-board unit for usage of stored value card to pay the fee. Because the prepaid card would have no identifying information (as opposed to a credit card), this method would achieve maximum privacy for the participants.|$|R
50|$|The class 3 {{office was}} the Primary Center (PC). Calls being made {{beyond the limits}} of a small {{geographical}} area where circuits are not connected directly between class 4 <b>toll</b> <b>offices</b> would be passed from the toll center to the primary center. These locations use high usage trunks to complete connection between toll centers. The primary center never served dial tone to the user. The number of primary centers in the network fluctuated from time to time, ranging between 150 and 230.|$|R

50|$|The canal {{was opened}} in 1796, and {{provided}} the town of Ulverston with a port. The channel was 15 ft deep and 66 ft wide, but ship sizes were restricted by the lock, which could accommodate vessels of 100 by 27 ft, drawing between 12.5 ft and 7.5 ft, depending {{on the state of}} the tide. In order to maintain the water level, a supply was taken from Newland Beck. Delays in construction meant that the final cost was over £9,200; and the opening coincided with a slump in the ore trade. It was not until June 1797 that William Burnthwaite was appointed as clerk, and a project to build a warehouse and <b>toll</b> <b>office</b> began, funded by a further call on the shareholders. Wharves for the transfer of slate and coal were constructed at the same time.|$|E

50|$|The {{most populous}} states {{required}} division into multiple Numbering Plan Areas, as each NPA {{was limited to}} 540 unique central office codes. For example, New York state was initially divided into five areas, {{the most of any}} state, followed by Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas with four NPAs each. These divisions attempted to avoid cutting across heavy toll traffic routes, so that most toll traffic remained within an area, and outgoing traffic in one area would not be tributary to <b>toll</b> <b>offices</b> in an adjacent area.|$|R
50|$|The new {{numbering}} plan was officially accepted in October 1947, dividing most of North America into 86 Numbering Plan Areas (NPAs). Each NPA {{was assigned a}} Numbering Plan Area code, often abbreviated as area code. These codes were first used by long-distance operators to establish long-distance calls between <b>toll</b> <b>offices.</b> The first customer-dialed direct call using area codes was made on November 10, 1951, from Englewood, New Jersey, to Alameda, California. Direct distance dialing (DDD) was subsequently introduced {{across the country and}} by the early 1960s most areas of the Bell System had been converted and it was commonplace in cities and most larger towns.|$|R
50|$|For {{twenty years}} direct {{connection}} to the Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN) was prevented by the Worcester Bar, a physical barrier at Gas Street Basin, Birmingham designed so that the BCN would not lose water to the Worcester and Birmingham. Cargoes had to be laboriously manhandled between boats on either side. In 1815 an Act allowed {{the creation of a}} stop lock and the bar was breached. The Worcester and Birmingham raised their water level by six inches to minimise water loss and today the two pairs of lock gates have been removed. There were separate <b>toll</b> <b>offices</b> either side of the bar for the two canal companies. The bar still exists, with boats moored to both sides of it.|$|R
50|$|An {{original}} lock of the Miami and Erie Canal {{is located}} on the grounds, as is a canal <b>toll</b> <b>office.</b> The transportation center vehicles include the John Quincy Adams steam locomotive (built in 1835 by the B&O Railroad and is the oldest US-built locomotive that still exists), a Barney and Smith passenger car built in Dayton, a Conestoga wagon, a 1908 Stoddard-Dayton automobile, a 1915 Xenia cyclecar, an interurban railcar, and other vehicles associated with Dayton. Among the latter, added to the collection in 1988, is a 1949-built Marmon-Herrington trolley bus, which was number 515 in the fleet of the City Transit Company and provided service on the Dayton trolley bus system from 1949 until about 1982. It arrived at the museum in August 1988 and replaced a similar Marmon-Herrington trolley bus, ex-Dayton 501, that had been on display there since April 1988 but was then donated to the Cincinnati Transit Historical Association under an agreement in which Carillon Park received No. 515 from the Miami Valley Regional Transit Authority in exchange.|$|E
50|$|While {{the region}} around today's Predlitz and the Mur was already colonised by Slavs in the 6th century, the first clearings and {{settlements}} south of Turracher Höhe {{are known to}} be from the early 14th century. Politically, the region was initially part of the duchy of Carinthia, but it was already divided among three territories in the 12th and 13th centuries, due to the splitting off of the Lungau to Salzburg and Murau to the duchy of Styria. Until tourism began to develop in the late 1920s, there had only been a few farmsteads north and south of the pass summit since the late Middle Ages, but no compact settlement. Also Turracher Höhe played no role as a traffic route for a long time. During the Middle Ages and early modern times, connections over the Katschberg in the west and over the Flattnitz in the east were the main traffic routes in the north-south direction, while routes over Turrach had only local importance, e.g. for the transport of salt from the Salzkammergut to Reichenau (first documented mention in 1332), where there was a branch of the <b>toll</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Worcester and Birmingham Canal opened between Birmingham and Selly Oak on 30 October 1795 {{but took}} until 1815 to {{complete}} to Worcester, at which time, after much lobbying by iron and coal masters and the Worcester and Birmingham Canal Company, an Act of Parliament was passed {{to open up}} the bar and the bar lock was built. There were <b>toll</b> <b>offices</b> either side of the bar lock and tolls were collected by each company from boats using the canals.

50|$|In the 1960s, {{with the}} {{domestic}} conversion still underway, plans were laid to extend Direct Dialing beyond North America and its nearby islands. With so much new equipment already working {{that could only}} handle ten digit phone numbers, a system was devised by which most <b>toll</b> <b>offices</b> {{did not have to}} store and forward the whole international phone number. Gateway offices were set up in New York, London and Paris, connected to the ordinary automatic toll network. The New York gateway was at 32 Avenue of the Americas.

Type BN was used at times by Bell Operating Companies after the 1956 Hush-a-phone Decision of the US Supreme Court, a landmark case which challenged AT&T's [...] "benign monopoly" [...] of US telephone equipment industry. Part of this settlement was for AT&T's Bell Operating Companies to buy and use small amounts of Lenkurt and Collins microwave and carrier systems.

25|$|Therefore, the Miami {{metropolitan}} area remains highly automobile dependent, with a prominent grid system {{made up of}} many wide, dangerous roads interlaced with a few highways, most of which have <b>tolls.</b> <b>Office</b> buildings and other high-rises and semi dense communities are spread randomly throughout the area, with a lowly defined central business district and no defined edge cities, leading to many long commutes in all directions. This lack of density and transit-oriented development also helped lead to {{the downfall of the}} Metrorail Orange Line North Corridor along NW 27 Avenue. Many of the buildings in downtown Miami sit atop large parking pedestals, often over 10 stories high, or have a separate, proprietary parking garage on site, such as the 14-story Southeast Financial Center parking annex. Other than the Government Center transit hub and the Miami Tower, both built in the 80s in conjunction with the system, no buildings were built with a direct connection to the Metromover until Brickell City Centre in 2015. Despite this, nearly all the condos built in the 2000s and 2010s real estate boom were in the downtown area along the Metromover lines, leading to a doubling in ridership from 2000 to 2011, with daily average ridership now at over 30,000.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} Slingerlands begins in 1850 when the Albany, Rensselaerville, and Schoharie Plank Road Company was {{established}} {{by the state to}} construct a plank road from Albany, through Slingerlands, to Gallupville in Schoharie County. In 1854, the state authorized the company to abandon or sell portions and to turn other sections (including that part in Slingerlands) into a turnpike and charge <b>tolls.</b> The post <b>office</b> was originally called Normanskill and was built in 1852 with William H. Slingerland as the first post master. In 1863, the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad was built through Slingerlands with a station established here as well. William H. Slingerland was the surveyor of the road, and since his route came in $600,000 less than a previous survey the company named the station here Slingerlands in his honor. In 1870, the post office also took the name Slingerlands. After having been in the rear of a grocery store for a hundred years it moved to the Tollgate Building in 1953, until the 1990s when a newer larger location was built near the Price Chopper Plaza. In 1989, the New Scotland post office was closed and the 400 residents it served were transferred to Slingerlands' ZIP Code.|$|R
