5|$|The top 10 selling {{states during}} the first quarter of 2012 were California, Michigan, Florida, Illinois, Texas, New York, Minnesota, Ohio, North Carolina and Maryland.

In California the leading regional markets are San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, all metropolitan areas notorious for their high congestion levels and where free access to high-occupancy lanes for solo drivers has been a strong incentive to boost Volt sales in the state.|$|E

25|$|On 28 June, {{the attackers}} {{began to use}} 105-mm guns. Some of the fires that {{broke out in the}} quarter of Cuma, one of Aydın's Turkish quarters, in the morning of 29 June started during this engagement. Other fires also broke out in <b>this</b> <b>quarter</b> at various {{isolated}} points. A large number of Turkish men, women and children who were trying to leave the burning quarter were killed for no reason by the Greek soldiers, who were guarding all the exits that led from <b>this</b> <b>quarter</b> to {{the northern part of the}} town. The report observes that there was no doubt that the Greek Command and troops ran amok. The Greeks evacuated the town in the night of 29 June and early hours of 30 June after having committed numerous attacks and other crimes. A large number of Greek civilians hoping to escape by accompanying the troops as they retreated were prevented from doing so by the Command.|$|E
25|$|The next oldest {{section of}} the city is the Medina quarter, which began to grow {{sometime}} under Medieval Arab rule, and is still intact today. <b>This</b> <b>quarter</b> stretches out from the Northern shores of the harbour, and covers an area roughly bounded by Ahmed Rafiq al-Mahdawi Street to the North-west, al-Jezayir Street to the South-east and 23 July Street to the South-west.

5|$|In 1340, {{following}} {{the extinction of}} the House of Capet, Edward III claimed the French throne.

25|$|In a few instances, Jews {{attacked}} Arabs {{and destroyed}} Arab property.

The worst instance of a Jewish attack on Arabs occurred in <b>this</b> <b>quarter,</b> where the Imam of a mosque and six other persons were killed.|$|E
25|$|On the Royalist side, the {{campaign}} of 1645 opened in the west, where Charles II, the young prince of Wales was sent with Hyde (later, Earl of Clarendon), Hopton, and others as his advisers.

On the rare occasions when he did his duty, however, he did display a certain degree of skill and leadership, and the influence of the prince's counsellors was but small.|$|E

25|$|In 285 BC {{the success}} of Qi had frightened the other states. Under the {{leadership}} of Lord Mengchang, who was exiled in Wei, Qin, Zhao, Wei and Yan formed an alliance. Yan had normally been a relatively weak ally of Qi and Qi feared little from <b>this</b> <b>quarter.</b> Yan's onslaught under general Yue Yi came as a devastating surprise. Simultaneously, the other allies attacked from the west. Chu declared itself an ally of Qi but contented itself with annexing some territory to its north. Qi's armies were destroyed while the territory of Qi was reduced to the two cities of Ju and Jimo. King Min himself was later captured and executed by his own followers.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>quarter</b> was a back-and-forth affair. A Miller field goal, {{increasing}} the Pirates' lead to 44-36, {{was followed by}} a Marshall drive ending with a Leftwich touchdown pass to Marriott, giving the Herd the chance to tie the game with a two-point conversion, which failed. Henry then ran for a second touchdown. With 1 minute 53 seconds left, Curtis Head kicked a field goal for Marshall to cut the lead to 51-45. Marshall then tried an onside kick which East Carolina recovered. The Pirates were unable to move the ball on three downs and punted. The kick went for a touchback, giving the Herd the ball on their own 20 with 50 seconds and no timeouts left.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the means}} of urban {{development}} in this particular area {{of the city was}} subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest {{in the context of a}} public-private partnership. Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at land undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share. Strict urbanization laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves. Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality thus <b>this</b> <b>quarter</b> of the city is effectively privatized. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.|$|E
25|$|In the 2nd {{quarter of}} 2015, CVG dropped {{from an average}} price of $528 to $436, putting CVG at number 20 of the 100 busiest {{airports}} in the U.S. This is mostly the result of expansion by Allegiant Air and increased competition between Delta Air Lines and American Airlines. <b>This</b> <b>quarter</b> ended a five-year streak of placing in the top 3 highest priced airports in the country. Later, in the 4th Quarter of 2015, CVG dropped to the 22nd most expensive airport, placing it at its lowest ranking since the DOT began keeping track of airfares in 1995. Average airfares have declined 20% in the last year, while local traffic has grown over 16% in the last quarter. The drop in airfares is due mostly to Allegiant and Frontier increasing flights, but average airfares from legacy carriers American, Delta, and United have also declined due to competition.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Grand Valley {{with the}} promise of the railway, the town began to boom. Regular voyages were made by steam sternwheelers to the city, each {{bringing}} more and more settlers. In the spring of 1881, General Thomas L. Rosser, Chief Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in Grand Valley. It was Rosser's job to choose the townsites for the railway. Rosser approached Dougald McVicar of Grand Valley and offered him $25,000 for the railway in Grand Valley. McVicar countered with $50,000 to which Rosser replied that “I’ll be damned if a town of any kind is ever built here". So instead Rosser crossed the Assiniboine river and built the site of the railway on the high sandy south of the River, two miles west of Grand Valley. So the site was then moved to a site just west of today's current First Street bridge in Brandon. A shanty had been built there by a man named J.D. Adamson, and it was on <b>this</b> <b>quarter</b> section Adamson claimed that Rosser chose as the townsite for the CPR Railway and named Brandon.|$|E
