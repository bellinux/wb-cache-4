5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be associative, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> inverse element.|$|E

25|$|The teleological {{argument}} asserts {{the view}} that things without intelligence are ordered towards a purpose. Aquinas argued that unintelligent objects cannot be ordered unless they are done so by an intelligent being, which means that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> intelligent being to move objects to their ends: God.|$|E
25|$|The unmoved mover {{argument}} asserts that, {{from our}} experience of motion in the universe (motion being the transition from potentiality to actuality) {{we can see that}} there must have been an initial mover. Aquinas argued that whatever is in motion must be put in motion by another thing, so <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unmoved mover.|$|E

25|$|An honest lie (or confabulation) can be {{identified}} by verbal statements or actions that inaccurately describe history, background, and present situations. There is generally no intent to misinform and the individual is unaware that their information is false. Because of this, it is not technically a lie at all since by definition, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> intent to deceive for the statement {{to be considered a}} lie.|$|E
25|$|Let A be a set, {{and apply}} the axiom of {{regularity}} to {A}, which is a set by the axiom of pairing. We see that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> element of {A} which is disjoint from {A}. Since the only element of {A} is A, it must be that A is disjoint from {A}. So, since A ∈ {A}, we cannot have A ∈ A (by the definition of disjoint).|$|E
25|$|Fred Hoyle {{may have}} invoked anthropic {{reasoning}} to predict an astrophysical phenomenon. He {{is said to}} have reasoned from the prevalence on Earth of life forms whose chemistry was based on carbon-12 atoms, that <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> undiscovered resonance in the carbon-12 nucleus facilitating its synthesis in stellar interiors via the triple-alpha process. He then calculated the energy of this undiscovered resonance to be 7.6 million electronvolts. Willie Fowler's research group soon found this resonance, and its measured energy was close to Hoyle's prediction.|$|E

25|$|Conversion, being a {{wrongful}} act, cannot {{spring from}} the exercise of a legal right. Such acts include the right of execution on a legal judgment or contesting rights under a contract. The general rule {{is that there is}} no conversion until some act is done which is a denial or violation of the plaintiff's dominion over or rights in the property. To constitute a conversion of a chattel, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unauthorized assumption of the right to possession or ownership. The act must have the essence of a tort.|$|E
25|$|UNRWA {{provides}} {{facilities in}} 59 recognized {{refugee camps in}} Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, and in other areas where large numbers of registered Palestine refugees live outside of recognized camps. For a camp to be recognized by UNRWA, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> agreement between the host government and UNRWA governing use of the camp. UNRWA does not itself run camps, has no police powers or administrative role, but simply provides services in the camp. Refugee camps, which developed from tent cities to dense urban dwellings similar to their urban surroundings, house around one third of all registered Palestine refugees.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that on the}} {{interval}} AB there is an odd number of borders colored 1-2 (simply because A is colored 1, B is colored 2; and as we move along AB, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> odd number of color changes {{in order to get}} different colors at the beginning and at the end). Therefore, the vertex of G corresponding to the outer area has an odd degree. But it is known (the handshaking lemma) that in a finite graph there is an even number of vertices with odd degree. Therefore, the remaining graph, excluding the outer area, has an odd number of vertices with odd degree corresponding to members of T.|$|E

25|$|Section 3 bars Congress from {{changing}} or modifying Federal law on treason {{by simple}} majority statute. Treason is also defined in this section. It's not enough merely {{to think a}} treasonous thought, <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> overt act of making war or materially helping those {{at war with the}} United States. Accusations must be corroborated by at least two witnesses. Congress is a political body and political disagreements routinely encountered should never be considered as treason. This allows for nonviolent resistance to the government because opposition is not a life or death proposition. However, Congress does provide for other less subversive crimes and punishments such as conspiracy.|$|E
25|$|Thirdly, {{the deputy}} chief judge is no longer {{guaranteed}} the automatic right of succession to the top job. Under the new system the deputy only becomes acting chief judge {{in the event of}} a vacancy in the highest office, and only becomes chief judge in his own right if subsequently elected. This procedure was first invoked when Volt himself died and Deputy Chief Judge Hershey became acting chief judge in 2121, winning the second election to chief judge in 2122. Even this rule only applies to a deputy chief judge who was appointed by an elected chief judge. A deputy chief judge appointed by an unelected chief judge does not become acting chief judge; instead <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> election.|$|E
25|$|For a given {{energy in}} a given volume, there is an upper limit to the density of {{information}} (the Bekenstein bound) about the whereabouts of all the particles which compose matter in that volume, suggesting that matter itself cannot be subdivided infinitely many times and <b>there</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ultimate level of fundamental particles. As the degrees of freedom of a particle {{are the product of}} all the degrees of freedom of its sub-particles, were a particle to have infinite subdivisions into lower-level particles, the degrees of freedom of the original particle would be infinite, violating the maximal limit of entropy density. The holographic principle thus implies that the subdivisions must stop at some level, and that the fundamental particle is a bit (1 or 0) of information.|$|E
