She won the Republican primary in May, but lost to Democrat Neil Goldschmidt in <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>election.</b> While campaigning for the office {{she had been a}} critic of the new MAX Light Rail that opened that year. During this period, Paulus was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to help oversee the 1986 Filipino presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|In August 1844, in {{the midst}} of the campaign, Tyler withdrew from the race. The Democratic Party was by then {{unequivocally}} committed to Texas annexation, and Tyler, assured by Polk's envoys that as President he would effect Texas annexation, urged his supporters to vote Democratic. Polk narrowly defeated Whig Henry Clay in <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>election.</b> The victorious Democrats were poised to acquire Texas under President-elect Polk's doctrine of Manifest Destiny, rather than on the pro-slavery agenda of Tyler and Calhoun.|$|E

5|$|During the U.S. Senate {{election}} in 1940, United States Attorney Maurice Milligan (Jacob Milligan's brother) and former governor Lloyd Stark both challenged Truman in the Democratic primary. Truman was politically weakened by Pendergast's imprisonment for income tax evasion the previous year; the senator had remained loyal, having claimed that Republican judges (not the Roosevelt administration) {{were responsible for}} the boss's downfall. St. Louis party leader Robert E. Hannegan's support of Truman proved crucial; he later brokered the deal that put Truman on the national ticket. In the end, Stark and Milligan split the anti-Pendergast vote in the Senate Democratic primary and Truman won by a total of 8,000 votes. In <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>election,</b> Truman defeated Republican Manvel H. Davis by 51–49 percent.|$|E
5|$|His final {{re-election}} campaign came in 1990 against businessman Harry Lonsdale. Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television attack ads that attacked Hatfield {{as out of}} touch {{on issues such as}} abortion and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington. Lonsdale's tactics moved him even with, and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls. Hatfield, who had typically stayed above the fray of negative campaigning, was forced to respond in kind with attack ads of his own. He raised $1million in a single month after trailing Lonsdale in the polls before <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>election.</b> He defeated the Democrat with 590,095 (53.7percent) votes to 507,743 (46.2percent) votes.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Reagan {{challenged}} incumbent President Gerald Ford {{in a bid}} {{to become}} the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as the American Conservative Union which became key components of his political base, while President Ford was considered a more moderate Republican. Though Reagan lost the Republican nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>election</b> from the state of Washington, which Ford had won over Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter.

5|$|Limited to {{two terms}} as governor, Hatfield {{announced}} his candidacy in the 1966 U.S. Senate election {{for the seat}} vacated by the retiring Maurine Neuberger. During the Vietnam War, and during an election year, {{he was the only}} person to vote against a resolution by a governors' conference that expressed support for the U.S. involvement in the war in 1966. At that time the war was supported by 75percent of the public, and was also supported by Hatfield's opponent in <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>election.</b> He won the primary election with 178,782 votes compared to a combined 56,760votes for three opponents. Hatfield then defeated Democratic Congressman Robert Duncan in the election. In order to finish his term as governor, which ended on January 9, 1967, he delayed taking his oath of office in the Senate until January 10 instead of the usual January 3.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2006 election, Hastert {{expressed}} his intent to seek reelection as Speaker if the Republicans maintained {{control of the}} House. Hastert was reelected for an eleventh term to his seat in the House with nearly 60 percent of the vote, but that year the Republicans lost control of both the Senate and the House to the Democrats following a wave of voter discontent with the Iraq War, the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina, {{and a series of}} scandals among congressional Republicans. The day after <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>election,</b> Hastert announced he would not seek to become minority leader when the 110th Congress convened in January 2007. Later that month, John Boehner of Ohio defeated Mike Pence of Indiana in a 168-27 vote of the House Republican Conference election to become minority leader for the 110th Congress. The House Democratic Caucus unanimously selected House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker (succeeding Hastert) for the 110th Congress.|$|E
5|$|In early October 2006, Baird's {{department}} reviewed a promised $200 {{million grant}} to the City of Ottawa's light-rail expansion {{project for the}} O-Train. Baird indicated {{that the government would}} keep the funding at least until <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>election,</b> but added that the Council elected in November would have the final say on the issue. He also leaked details of the city's contact with the German firm Siemens. As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the 2006 Ottawa mayoral election and Baird's opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome. Baird and Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project, and Liberal MP Navdeep Bains asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird's decision to release details of the private contract. Chiarelli was defeated in the election and the light-rail expansion was stopped by the new council.|$|E

5|$|President Harrison {{had proven}} unpopular; there were {{divisions}} {{even within the}} Republican party as the year 1892 began and Harrison began his re-election drive. Although no declared candidate opposed Harrison, many Republicans were ready to dump the President from the ticket if an alternative emerged. Among the possible candidates spoken of were McKinley, Reed, and the aging Blaine. Fearing that the Ohio governor would emerge as a candidate, Harrison's managers arranged for McKinley to be permanent chairman of the convention in Minneapolis, requiring him to play a public, neutral role. Hanna established an unofficial McKinley headquarters near the convention hall, though no active {{effort was made to}} convert delegates to McKinley's cause. McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him; nevertheless he finished third, behind the renominated Harrison, and behind Blaine, who had sent word {{he did not want to}} be considered. Although McKinley campaigned loyally for the Republican ticket, Harrison was defeated by former President Cleveland in <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>election.</b> In the wake of Cleveland's victory, McKinley was seen by some as the likely Republican candidate in 1896.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran {{as a successful}} entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, {{he was forced to}} take out a second mortgage on his Virginia home. Kennedy responded with a series of attack ads, which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In <b>the</b> <b>November</b> <b>election,</b> despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58percent to 41percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.|$|E
