5|$|The grocery-store chain ICA had {{sponsored}} IFK Göteborg since 1974, {{and their}} logo was {{displayed on the}} chest of the shirt 1980–2010, leading some to consider it {{an integral part of}} the shirt.

5|$|After the {{departure}} of Massasoit and his men, Squanto remained in Plymouth to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in New England, for example using dead fish to fertilize the soil. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> of colonial life, the fur trade was the dominant source of income, buying furs from Native Americans and selling to Europeans, beyond subsistence farming. Shortly after {{the departure}} of the Mayflower, Governor Carver suddenly died. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.|$|E
50|$|While the MP3 format has near-universal {{hardware}} and software support, primarily due to MP3 being the format of choice during <b>the</b> crucial <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> of widespread music file-sharing/distribution over the internet, AAC is a strong contender due to some unwavering industry support.|$|R

5|$|Henry assumed {{formal control}} of his {{government}} in January 1227, although some contemporaries argued that he was legally still a minor until his 21st birthday the following year. The King richly rewarded Hubert de Burgh for his service during his minority years, making him the Earl of Kent and giving him extensive lands across England and Wales. Despite coming of age, Henry remained heavily influenced by his advisers for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> of his rule and retained Hubert as his justiciar to run the government, granting him the position for life.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> after publication, German readers widely {{assumed that}} the real-life Baron von Münchhausen was {{responsible}} for the stories.

Münchhausen became a recluse, refusing to host parties or tell any more stories, and he attempted without success to bring legal proceedings against Bürger and the publisher of the translation.|$|E
5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> of the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered a step forward in both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would be familiar to fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E
5|$|The Macdonalds {{sought to}} {{maintain}} the park's natural beauty, planting 10,000shrubs in the first year, and thousands of trees during the 1930s.

5|$|Kepler-11f's low {{density is}} {{not shared by}} the planets Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c because the solar wind has reduced their atmospheres to a thin layer.

This brigade was formed in consequence of the Rural Fires Act 1950; an act aimed at combating bushfires.|$|E

5|$|The {{effort to}} develop a lighter, quieter camera with a reflex {{viewfinder}} led {{to the introduction of}} the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) in 1967. The camera could provide a shutter angle of up to 200 degrees. Many refinements were made to the PSR during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> after its introduction, and it soon {{became one of the most}} popular studio cameras in the world. Panavision also began manufacturing spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography, garnering a significant share of the market.|$|E

High-standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks and the railway system was expanded. Welensky credited the high rate of development to the astute management of the federal Minister of Finance, Donald Macintyre.|$|E

Thereafter she spent most of her time with Alfvén in Sweden, marrying him in 1912, three years after Krøyer had died in Skagen.|$|E
5|$|The {{interest}} cost is another major item of this company's financing. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> of operation, interest rates were well above market rates. Interest expense stood at around NT$1.3billion per month in April 2008, when THSRC first achieved break-even cash flow, with revenue and cash expenses (which exclude depreciation) both around NT$2.1billion. Interest rates {{fell in the}} first half of 2009, reducing interest expenses and contributing to a reduced net loss.|$|E

The recession of the early 1990s did not help the XM's sales fortunes either.|$|R
