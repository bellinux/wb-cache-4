25|$|Widmark {{appeared}} on Broadway in 1943 in F. Hugh Herbert's Kiss and <b>Tell.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> unable {{to join the}} military during World War II because of a perforated eardrum. He was in Chicago appearing in a stage production of Dream Girl with June Havoc when 20th Century Fox signed him to a seven-year contract.|$|E
25|$|Just as Daredevil's other senses are stronger, {{they are}} also sensitive; his main {{weakness}} is his vulnerability to powerful sounds or odors that can temporarily weaken his radar sense. This weakness {{is often used to}} immobilize Daredevil. Alternately, the lack of taste or smell of certain substances can be used against him, as in one instance of a hallucinogenic drug designed so that Daredevil could not <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> drugged. His senses are highly acute, capable of sensing the minor atmospheric disturbance created moments before a teleporting character appears.|$|E

25|$|When Mark Coleman got {{injured and}} had {{to drop out of}} his matchup against Tito Ortiz, Griffin {{accepted}} a rematch against Ortiz at UFC 106. Griffin also wore white and black fight shorts instead of his trademark tan shorts for the fight. Griffin {{went on to win the}} gory battle by split decision, showing superior striking skills and a stronger ground game than in their previous fight. After the fight Griffin said, “Tito was a great fight for me to come back, we’ll have to do a third that’s 1-1 man.” With a split decision in both of their fights, Griffin seemed more than willing to get a rubber match put together with Ortiz to settle the score once and for all. “You could <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a guy getting ready for Mark Coleman, no offense, and he’s a guy coming off back surgery. We’ll do it again, I won’t break my foot, he’ll be in better shape,” commented Griffin.|$|E
500|$|Ponsford used a heavy bat——nicknamed [...] "Big Bertha". Opposition players {{sometimes}} {{joked that}} Ponsford's bat {{was larger than}} allowed under the laws of cricket and indeed in one match in Sydney, it {{was found to be}} slightly larger than permitted—the result of the bat spreading from his powerful hitting. Throughout his innings, Ponsford would pull his cap further to the left. Robinson claimed that [...] "if you saw the peak at a rakish angle towards his left ear you could <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> heading for his second hundred". When volunteering for service with the Royal Australian Air Force, Ponsford discovered he possessed abnormal colour vision, unable to distinguish red from green. The examining doctor was astonished and asked Ponsford, [...] "What colour did [...] look to you after it was worn?" [...] Ponsford replied, [...] "I never noticed its colour, only its size." [...] A later study identified Ponsford's specific colour vision as protanopia, a form of dichromacy in which red appears dark. Ponsford did not enjoy batting on rain-affected wickets. When on tour his teammates did not ask if it had rained last night, merely [...] "Did Ponny wake during the night?"—legend had it that even the slightest trickle would wake him and have him anguishing over having to bat on the [...] "sticky" [...] in the morning.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} media critics, {{including}} Toronto Sun columnist and former radio personality Ted Woloshyn, criticized CP24 Radio 1050 {{as a poor}} substitute for a true news radio format. In his column on the format change, Woloshyn noted {{a number of instances}} where he could <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> listening to content that had been prepared for television, not radio, presentation: ...|$|E

2500|$|McKagan {{was one of}} {{the last}} people {{confirmed}} to have seen Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain before he died on April 5, 1994. He sat next to Cobain on a flight from Los Angeles to Seattle on April 1. McKagan later recalled, [...] "I didn't have any foresight that the guy was going to do what he did. I could <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bummed out, and I'd been that way before... I thought I'd ask him to come stay at my house; I turned around and he was gone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1966, Haggard {{recorded}} [...] "I'm a Lonesome Fugitive," [...] {{also written}} by Liz Anderson {{with her husband}} Casey Anderson, which became his first number-one single. When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard, they were unaware of his prison stretch. Bonnie Owens, Haggard's backup singer and then-wife, is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road: [...] "I guess I didn't realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him, 'cause he {{never talked about it}} all that much.... I could <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in a dark mood ... and I said, 'Is everything okay?' And he said, 'I'm really scared.' And I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Cause I'm afraid someday I'm gonna be out there ... and there's gonna be ... some prisoner ... in there the same time I was in, stand up—and they're gonna be about the third row down—and say, 'What do you think you're doing, 45200?'" [...] Cooper notes that the news had little effect on Haggard's career: [...] "It's unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history, for to his credit, he doesn't seem to have made some big splash announcement. In a May 1967 profile in Music City News, his prison record is never mentioned, but in July 1968, in the very same publication, it's spoken of as if it were common knowledge." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wilks {{shook his}} head. Truth to <b>tell,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> rather {{at a loss}} to know exactly what had happened.|$|E
6000|$|So {{then he got}} to {{wandering}} along, {{and pretty}} soon, sure enough, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>telling!</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> poking along through his ups and downs, and when he come to that place he went right along. He says: ...|$|R
5000|$|Great Great Grandpa: Lives in a {{small house}} {{far away from the}} city. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a fun grandpa, and a great storyteller. And, having seen and done them all, he has a lot to <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a life guru! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] she {{answered}} promptly. [...] "Why, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> years older, and though Spencer was quite the gentleman, there's something about Mr. Ruff, {{and the way}} he dresses and knows his way about--well, you can <b>tell</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> a gentleman all his life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't there? From what I saw going on, I {{thought there}} would be {{something}} to <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> talking to you the whole evening." ...|$|E

50|$|The story takes a twist {{when they}} {{discover}} that the detective is alive. Lucky for them, he has lost him memory from the fall <b>he</b> suffered. Raj <b>tells</b> him <b>he</b> <b>is</b> John Matthews and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> married. Dolly <b>tells</b> him <b>he</b> <b>is</b> John Matthews and divorced. Govardhan <b>tells</b> him <b>he</b> <b>is</b> John Matthews, still a bachelor. Mangu <b>tells</b> him <b>he</b> <b>is</b> his friend {{and that he has}} a memory problem; under this pretense, he takes his watch and necklace saying that he forgot that Mangu actually gave it to him. Diesel runs into Govardhan and is about to beat him up when <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> him that Raj is her boyfriend. When Diesel runs into Raj, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> him Govardhan <b>is</b> Dolly's boyfriend. Govardhan finds Dolly and tells her that instead of lying about love, she should be with the one who really loves her, Diesel. Dolly agrees and hugs Govardhan <b>telling</b> him <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a good guy. Unfortunately, Diesel mistakes the situation and starts to beat up Govardhan. Dolly saves Govardhan by telling Diesel that Govardhan convinced her to go back to him. Dolly leaves with Diesel.|$|R

60|$|A man {{was shown}} {{into his room}} afterwards, as he was putting on his overcoat. Almost with relief Macheson saw that he at least had no pitiful tale to <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> a small dapper man, well dressed, and spoke with a slight American accent.|$|E
60|$|Of course Guy {{could not}} <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> had <b>been</b> pledged to secrecy {{as to the}} cause.|$|R
50|$|Oswald and the {{teddy bear}} befriended each other. As the rabbit greets her goodbye {{to carry on}} in his journey, the {{beautiful}} bruin asks him where <b>he</b> <b>is</b> heading.

60|$|Then the man steps {{across the}} stage and presses a button. A bell rings. Even before it has {{finished}} ringing, nay, just before it begins to ring, a cardboard door swings aside and a valet enters. You can <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a valet because <b>he</b> <b>is</b> dressed in the usual home dress of a stage valet.|$|R
60|$|He {{lapsed into}} a pensive torpor. The {{immediate}} dangers and stresses {{of his position}} he saw {{with a sort of}} static clearness. What would they do to-morrow? He could not tell. What would Elizabeth think of his brutalisation? He could not <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> exhausted. He was aroused presently by a hand upon his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tain't none o' my {{business}}? Whose {{business is}} it den, I'd like to know? Wuz I his mother <b>tell</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> fifteen years old, or wusn't I?--you answer me dat.

[...] "I married Laban, who's been more of a father to you than what he was." ...|$|E
50|$|Bridges {{was also}} a {{consistent}} leader in strikeouts. He led the AL in strikeouts in 1935 and 1936, and was among the league leaders 12 times: 1931-40, 1942-43. Even more <b>telling,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> among the top three {{in the league in}} strikeouts per nine innings pitched on 7 occasions: 1931, 1935-36, 1939-40, 1942-43.|$|R

50|$|Tichy {{himself is}} the narrator {{in all the}} stories in which he appears. Sometimes <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the protagonist; {{sometimes}} he merely serves to introduce some other character who has a story to <b>tell.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> unmarried, usually well-meaning, accident-prone, and commendably honest about his failures, which include (thanks to another unfortunate experience with time) the entire Universe as we know it.|$|R
