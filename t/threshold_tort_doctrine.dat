40|$|Intentional {{tort law}} {{generally}} protects personal autonomy and self-determination vigorously by requiring fair disclosure before consent to physical contact is considered voluntary and valid. A glaring exception exists regarding consent to sexual relations. Although American law historically has provided remedies for fraudulent or other tortious inducement of sexual relations, current sex tort jurisprudence offers virtually no protection. The law’s contemporary “caveat emptor” approach to cases of sexual autonomy infringement is inappropriate because it departs from fundamental principles of intentional <b>tort</b> <b>doctrine.</b> In addition, the current law supports a “false” norm that sexual misappropriation is acceptable. Current law fails to protect personal privacy and fails to effectuate {{its potential to}} influence social conduct positively. Intentional sex tort law should be reformed {{so that it is}} consistent with prevailing sexual norms and principles of intentional <b>tort</b> <b>doctrine.</b> Allegations of tortious interference with sexual autonomy should be analyzed consistent with traditional battery jurisprudence bearing on the issues of intent to offend and offensive contact. Exceptions to the defense of consent should also be adopted. The fraud exception should apply, utilizing established principles of materiality and justifiable reliance.

40|$|Historically, {{courts have}} treated {{professional}} malpractice cases as unique. When disputes {{that would otherwise}} have been governed by tort rules of general application have arisen in the context of medical treatment, courts have routinely constructed special rules for the resolution of those disputes. Recent evidence suggests that this penchant for special rules may be weakening and that malpractice law may be slowly melting back into the sea of <b>tort</b> <b>doctrine.</b> The three Missouri health care law cases noted in this issue are the latest evidence that courts today are more willing to resolve medical negligence actions using tort rules of general application than they once were. These three cases also typify the halting, labored nature of common law shifts of this kind. All three of these cases involved bright-line “no duty” rules that had been specifically fashioned for medical negligence cases. One case involved the duty of “on-call” physicians. Traditionally, on-call specialists have not owed patients a duty to arrive at the hospital quickly unless a prior “physician-patient” relationship existed with the patient. The second case reexamined a similar no-duty rule that excuses pharmacists from a duty to warn their customers of drug risks such as improper dosages and incompatible drugs. The third case considered the viability of the “learned intermediary” doctrine, a no-duty rule that excuses pharmaceutical manufacturers from the duty to warn patients of the risks associated with their prescription drugs. Rules like these erect tidy, bright spheres of obligation in malpractice law that are atypical of modern <b>tort</b> <b>doctrine</b> [...] a body of law that usually defines obligations with vague, but flexible, concepts such as foreseeability and reasonability. In two of the three Missouri cases noted here, the Missouri courts backed away from these special duty rules. And in the third, the court was careful to evaluate the continued wisdom of the rule before reaffirming it. Collectively these cases are consistent with other evidence, discussed in Part V below, indicating that courts are increasingly willing to re-examine the special rules formulated for health care torts...|$|R

40|$|Prominent jurists {{and legal}} {{scholars}} {{have long been}} critical of the doctrine of the assumption of risk, arguing that it is logically flawed and has sown confusion in the courts.

It argues that the <b>tort</b> <b>doctrine</b> of the assumption of risk remains vital, and highlights the way in which powerful political and economic actors with links to the ski industry have lobbied aggressively for state laws that codify the assumption of risk. The result has been state legislation that protects ski resort owners and operators from tort liability. By pointing to politics and economics as critical factors in the persistence of the doctrine of assumed risks, and exploring the social values implicated in the assumption of risk debate, the article deepens what has been an overly technical debate among tort law scholars and offers a way forward for future tort law scholarship on the idea of assumed risks...|$|R

Specifically, I parse the jurisprudential significance of Laurin’s idea of “trawling” {{in order to}} understand Herring v.

Doing so not only demonstrates that copyright’s liability rule is more normatively defensible than previously appreciated, but also provides a unique tort perspective {{on the nature of the}} fair use doctrine. By seriously engaging with the analytic question of whether liability for copyright infringement is strict or not, we highlight how the fair use analysis blends and confuses two separate issues: on one hand, did the defendant cause the plaintiff harm, and, on the other, was that harm justifiable? The Article concludes that, while no substantive changes need to be made to copyright’s liability rule, judges ought to restructure the fair use analysis in order to keep these concepts distinct from one another...|$|R
40|$|Response to: Jennifer E. Laurin, Trawling for Herring: Lessons in Doctrinal Borrowing and Convergence, 111 Colum. L. Rev. 670 (2011). Critics of the {{curtailment}} of the {{exclusionary rule}} worked by Herring v. United States have denounced {{the decision as}} Supreme Court activism posing as derivation from settled law. Professor Jennifer Laurin agrees that Herring breaks with exclusionary rule doctrine but disputes that it lacks any grounding in Court precedent.

Laurin premises her argument on an admittedly unorthodox depiction of qualified immunity that overstates the doctrine’s protective scope. Ironically, one effect of this overstatement could be to enable a doctrinal distortion of precisely the type Laurin cautions against. For by positing a substantive equivalence between Harlow rule and the significantly more protective Herring principle, Laurin invites judges to borrow from Herring to further restrict the availability of constitutional tort remedies.

Courts that have in recent years ruled to the contrary have done so by incorrectly basing their duty-of-care analysis on foreseeability of harm alone. With an eye toward a proper duty-of-care analysis, this Note analyzes multiple factors to reach its conclusion, including the ideal relationship between colleges and their students and the burden on and capability of colleges to protect their students from a particular harm. Moreover public policy concerns weigh heavily against imposing a duty on nonclinician university administrators.

Ultimately, the specific doctrinal changes may be less important than the changes in this broader context, particularly the shift from judicial development of doctrine based on common law reasoning to legislative changes.

5000|$|Since the Court did not {{directly}} address procedural factors such as statute of limitations and exhaustion of local remedies (i.e., a principle in international law whereby the plaintiff must exhaust remedies in the nation under whose territorial jurisdiction the tort occurred before having recourse in a foreign court), the Sosa framework might well be incomplete. Footnote 21 mentions, without deciding, that exhaustion could be a relevant issue to analyze in a future case. However, the opinion in chief would seem to implicitly reject an exhaustion requirement {{on account of the}} policy underlying Congress's decision to have federal courts hear claims by foreign nationals against other foreign nationals for acts committed on foreign soil. Though the Court does not explicitly pinpoint the policy, it implicitly adopts a hostis humani generis theory and rejects a transitory tort basis for jurisdiction. One can conclude this from the Court's insistence upon the law of nations as the source of justiciable torts, and its favorable recognition of Filártiga v. Pena-Irala. [...] Under a transitory <b>tort</b> <b>doctrine,</b> the choice of law is typically the lex locus delicti, or the law of the nation on whose territory the tort was committed. In contrast, a hostis humani generis (i.e., [...] "enemy of all mankind") theory requires a universal norm such as found in the law of nations. In Filártiga, the Second Circuit adopted the hostis humani generis rationale, deeming irrelevant the fact that the plaintiff could have a remedy under Paraguayan law (lex locus delicti).|$|R

Further humanization of the civil law, its corresponding with human rights, as well as legislator’s wish to eliminate the backlog in regulations of relations on the protection of personal intangible benefits are obvious.

40|$|This {{response}} essay probes three {{themes that}} tie together three articles submitted for a tort symposium on “The Limits of Predictability and the Value of Uncertainty. ” First, I explore {{the use of}} unpredictability as a code word for an assault on <b>tort</b> <b>doctrine</b> {{in response to an}} out-of-control tort system. In his historical account of the evolution of tort, Professor Rabin focuses on the canonical “no duty” rules of the nineteenth century and the contemporary rules-based limitations on open-textured liability in the twentieth century. But largely missing from this account is the story of rules promoting tort liability, such as strict liability, vicarious liability, negligence per se, and the like. Second, I probe the link between unpredictability and insurance. I argue that Professor Sebok’s efforts to distinguish champerty from illegal gambling and to analogize it to a form of insurance will inevitably fall short of establishing social acceptance or embrace of the practice. Third, I highlight the role of the U. S. Supreme Court and its incursions into the state law domain of tort in the name of predictability. Professor Rabin is doubtful that the U. S. Supreme Court will achieve great strides in its endeavor to quell unpredictability in punitive damages. Professor Zipursky has considerable angst about the Court’s making inroads into privacy and emotional distress torts. Such incursions are in keeping with the Court’s longer-term project of procedural reform of the civil litigation system in the name of unpredictability, but are novel in their ambition to launch frontal attacks...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{presents}} an empirical analysis of how race, income inequality, the regional {{history of the}} South, and state politics affect the development of tort law. Beginning in the mid- 1960 s, most state appellate courts rejected doctrines such as contributory negligence that traditionally prevented plaintiffs’ cases from reaching the jury. We examine why some, mostly Southern states did not join this trend. To enable cross-state comparisons, we design an innovative Jury Access Denial Index (JADI) that quantifies {{the extent to which}} each state’s <b>tort</b> <b>doctrines</b> enable judges to dismiss cases before they reach the jury. We then conduct a multivariate analysis that finds strong correlations between a state’s JADI and two factors: (1) the percentage of African Americans in its largest cities, and (2) its history as a former slave-holding state. These findings suggest that some appellate courts, particularly those in the South, afraid that juries with substantial African-American representation would redistribute wealth or retaliate for grievances, struck preemptively to prevent cases from reaching them. Surprisingly, we do not find a consistent association between a state’s JADI and either income inequality or its political leanings. In other words, race and region, rather than economic class or politics, explain the failure to embrace pro-plaintiff changes that occurred elsewhere. We suggest, therefore, that states that declined to discard antiquated anti-jury substantive doctrines between the mid- 1960 s and the mid- 1980 s should acknowledge that these precedents were tainted by their predecessors’ efforts to keep tort cases from African-American jurors and refuse to accord them deference...|$|R
