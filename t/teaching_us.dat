500|$|This work's title, {{translatable}} as [...] "tutor", {{refers to}} Christ {{as the teacher}} of all mankind, and it features an extended metaphor of Christians as children. It is not simply instructional : the author intends {{to show how the}} Christian should respond to the Love of God authentically. Clement, following Plato (Republic 4:441), divides life into three elements: character, actions and passions. The first having been dealt with in the Protrepticus, he devotes the Paedagogus to reflections on Christ's role in <b>teaching</b> <b>us</b> to act morally and to control our passions. Despite its explicitly Christian nature, Clement's work draws on Stoic philosophy and pagan literature; Homer alone is cited over sixty times in the work.|$|E

What! has the immortal letter, unlike all other good advice, absolutely not been thrown away? {{or is the}} jade incorrigible? Whichever be the case, you need not be silent. There is yet enough to do, and yet enough to instruct. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> that wealth is not elegance; that profusion is not magnificence; and that splendour is not beauty. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> that taste is a talisman which can do greater wonders than the millions of the loanmonger. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> that to vie is not to rival, and to imitate not to invent. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> that pretension is a bore. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> that wit is excessively good-natured, and, like champagne, not only sparkles, but is sweet. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> the vulgarity of malignity. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> that envy spoils our complexions, and that anxiety destroys our figure. Catch the fleeting colours of that sly chameleon, Cant, and show what excessive trouble we are ever taking to make ourselves miserable and silly. <b>Teach</b> <b>us</b> all this, and Aglaia shall stop a crow in its course and present you with a pen, Thalia hold the golden fluid in a Sèvres vase, and Euphrosyne support the violet-coloured scroll.|$|R

Schwab's lyrics focused on his belief that power and corruption often [...] "run hand-in-hand when it comes to human souls." [...] "The world is <b>teaching</b> <b>us</b> that fame is to be sought after; that recognition will equal success, fortune and, ultimately, peace," [...] he said, [...] "But the search for and attainment of fame and wealth usually destroy us in the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Fiasco {{was born}} Wasalu Muhammad Jaco on February 16, 1982 in Chicago, Illinois. Fiasco is of West African descent, {{one of nine}} {{children}} of Shirley, a gourmet chef, and Gregory, an engineer. His father, {{a member of the}} Black Panther Party, was a prolific African drummer, karate teacher, operating plant engineer, and owner of karate schools and army surplus stores. Fiasco was raised Muslim on the West Side of Chicago on Madison Terrace housing project. [...] At the age of three, Fiasco began taking martial arts classes. His parents divorced when he was five, and he went on to live with his mother, but his father still remained an important part of his life. He described his father's influence over the family by saying, [...] "After school, my father would come and get us and take us out into the world—one day, we're listening to N.W.A, the next day we're listening to Ravi Shankar, the next day, he's <b>teaching</b> <b>us</b> how to shoot an AK-47, the next day, we're at karate class, the next day, we're in Chinatown...".|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} [...] in {{the development}} of hip-hop was the addition of eight-counts, a method of counting dance steps to stay in sync with the music. Toni Basil introduced this studio technique into locking in the 1970s. Basil was trained in ballet before being introduced to street dance by Don Campbell, the creator of locking and founding member of The Lockers dance crew. She is responsible for teaching the rest of The Lockers how to dance to counts. In an interview with NPR, Lockers member Adolfo [...] "Shabba-Doo" [...] Quiñones stated [...] "I would say that Toni Basil was sort of our Abe Saperstein in terms of how she was able to organize us into a professional dance troupe. I remember her <b>teaching</b> <b>us</b> how to count music. She was like, okay, we were like, count music? How do you count soul? It was crazy, you know?... all of our cues kind of went something like this, boom, pop, do boom, pada da boom, pada like that. And she was like, how do you guys get in sync like that? I said it's a feeling, you know?" [...] Traditionally hip-hop dance, or any form of street dance, is not performed to counts as these styles were created on the street rather than in a studio setting. So the introduction of counts was a pivotal move into bringing hip-hop dance from the street into the studio. Even with this addition, it would be years before commercial hip-hop developed into its current form.|$|E

2500|$|Nick Rawlinson {{agrees with}} England's assessment, {{although}} {{he feels that}} Samuel Foote {{may have been more}} of an influence than England allows for. Rawlinson reads the piece as primarily about reading itself, and the social implications of certain types of reading; [...] "inside the apparently random concoction of prose, song and slapstick [...] lies an extraordinary, almost dazzling examination of the relationship between our habits of reading and the society they produce [...] Blake consistently and consciously foregrounds how our understanding of our society, our voices and even our perceptions are governed by our habits of reading [...] An Island contains a deliberate and careful plan to challenge [...] misreadings by <b>teaching</b> <b>us</b> how to read the world comically. It is nothing less than a degree course in comic Vision." [...] Rawlinson argues that the literary references in the text are structured to mirror a 1707 Cambridge University pamphlet entitled A Method of Instructing Pupils (a guide on how to teach Philosophy). As such Rawlinson feels An Island is best described as [...] "philosoparody." ...|$|E

[...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late <b>teaching</b> <b>us</b> fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games.

2500|$|The {{film was}} highly {{acclaimed}} by {{critics in the}} Western world, with an 87% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 45 reviews with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's consensus reads, [...] "Battle Royale is a controversial and violent parable of adolescence, heightening teenage melodrama with life-or-death stakes." [...] Robert Koehler of Variety commented, [...] "Given the most basic characters to work with, the mostly teen cast attacks the material with frightening gusto, and Fujiwara dutifully invokes the voice of inner moral conflict. Production is exceedingly handsome and vigorous, offering no sign that Fukasaku is slowing down." [...] He stated that, [...] "returning to his roots as Japan's maestro of mayhem, Kinji Fukasaku has delivered" [...] one of [...] "his most outrageous and timely films", comparing it to [...] "the outrage over youth violence" [...] that Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange [...] "generated in early-'70s Britain" [...] and featuring some of [...] "the most startling scenes of mayhem since the movies of the wild and bloody '70s."

[...] BBC users gave the film five out of five stars. Almar Haflidason of BBC also gave the film five out of five stars. In a review for Empire, critic Kim Newman gave the film four stars out of five. He compared it to Lord of the Flies in how it makes audiences [...] "wonder what they would do in the same situation", but wrote that Battle Royale gives [...] "even harder choices for its school-uniformed characters."
