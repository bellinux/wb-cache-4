On July 1, 1911, the UMWA {{executive}} board voted <b>to</b> end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>strike.</b> Although most miners returned to work, about 400 were blacklisted and forced to seek employment outside Pennsylvania.|$|R

50|$|There {{is no need}} {{to think}} of {{delivering}} <b>the</b> <b>strike</b> with a 'blade edge'.

That helps enormously in keeping the arm straight throughout.|$|R
