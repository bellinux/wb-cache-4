40|$|Cultivated in <b>temporary</b> area <b>grasses</b> {{have evolved}} from common {{ancestor}} about 1. 5 {{million years ago}} and maintain many similarities especially in cytoplasm genome. Chloroplast genome of those grasses consist of some 135, 000 bp and approximately 100 functional genes. Genetic similarity of chloroplast genomes was evaluated by DNA hybridization with conservative probes and by sequencing of hot spots in intergeneric regions. Those methods are less useful for intraspecies studies, and PCR-fingerprinting was offered for this particular case. Information content of PCR markers may be increased by application of primers complementary to (a) DNA repeats abundant in genome or (b) DNA fragments participating in modification events. Distribution of small (7 - 10 bp) inverted DNA repeats located in 100 - 4000 bp {{from each other and}} thus capable to serve as PCR primers was studied in complete cereal genomes. The repeats flanking from 10 to 30 PCR-able fragments of the chloroplast DNA were chosen as AP-PCR primers and real PCR fingerprints obtained for wheat and 15 alloplasmic barley lines were compared to expected ones. Comparing to PCR analysis with random primers (RAPD), the selected primers produced bands of significantly (3 - 4 folds) higher PIC (Polymorphism Information Content), and GD (Genetic Diversity). Thus, PCR-fingerprinting with primers homologous for selected from sequence inverted repeats proved to be useful for genome variability studies...|$|R
40|$|Grassland/livestock systems {{differ in}} their wherewithal to enhance the {{magnitude}} of GHG fluxes (CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O) and their global warming potential (GWP). A simulation study was performed using the model PASIM to extrapolate potential emissions from grassland/livestock systems under alternative climate/soil/plant/management regimes at 12 French sites. Fluxes of CO 2 associated with those of N 2 O indicate that both gases may be controlled by similar or concomitant environmental factors. In particular, CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes {{were higher in the}} <b>temporary</b> grasslands, where <b>grass</b> management (mowing, N fertilization) promotes increased plant respiration and soil organic matter turnover. In these systems, high CO 2 and N 2 O emissions were accompanied by absence of CH 4 emissions. Similar responses were observed with intensive permanent grasslands, where the presence of grazing animals also determines CH 4 emissions. High CH 4, and low CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes were generally estimated with extensive permanent pastures. While there are site-to-site and climate-to-climate variations, a general conclusion is that the GWP is expected to decrease in the future as result of increased soil dryness and C stocking. Also, temporary grasslands are indicated as the most desirable land use in reducing global warming. Strategies to enhance fertilizer use efficiency, animal feed and return of animal waste could be explored as adaptation/mitigation measures...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} report, a Smart Grass Reinforcement for {{overtopping}} resistant sea defences is elaborated on a theoretical basis, {{within the framework}} of ComCoast, Work Package 3 (WP 3). The smart grass revetment concept aims at strengthening the present grass revetments at the crests and inners slopes of sea embankments. Smart denotes a significant reinforcement of the grass revetment, a high-cost effectiveness, easy installation with minimum disturbance of the existing grass revetment, hidden presence and thus invisible, and durable. In addition, the system should have no environmental adverse impacts. The Hondsbossche Sea Defence and the North Frysian Sea Defence (grass test sections for studying the effect of maintenance strategies) have been visited in order to get insight in the feasibility of the meanwhile developed ideas in true field situations. Two, potentially feasible, concepts have been identified: 1. Geogrid system, to be placed underneath the <b>temporary</b> lifted (thin-cut) <b>grass</b> layer; 2. Geocell system, to be penetrated through the existing grass revetment, without lifting it. The Geogrid system can be applied at a rather flat surface and good grass cover. The Geocell system can be applied as well at a more uneven surface and a poor grass cover. The proposed application of these systems is new, as far as we know, and some engineering (system, equipment and installation) still needs to be done. At this point, we believe that this will lead to a successful and highly cost-effective application. A cost indication shows that smart application of the Geogrid and Geocell systems will reduce the costs by a factor 10 or more, as compared to raising the crest of the dike. In addition, the risk of applying a smart reinforcement system is much smaller than of regular dike strengthening (raising and extending dikes), as the recovery time of the grass revetment is very short (months at the most) as compared to some years. We recommend the systems to be tested during the anticipated field tests in the ComCoast WP research programme Phase 3. The engineering should preferably be done {{by the end of this}} year, in order to be able to apply the smart systems at the field test section by the end of April 2006. This will allow proper field testing in the summer and/or winter of 2006. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
