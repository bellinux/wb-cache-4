5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, however {{on their first}} play from scrimmage, Bill Belton lost a fumble and Minnesota recovered and kicked a field goal after failing to achieve a first down. Penn State's punt on the subsequent drive was downed at the four-yard line, but the poor field position did not adversely affect Minnesota, who drove down the field for a 15-play, 96-yard drive, highlighted by a 24-yard pass from Philip Nelson to Maxx Williams to convert a fourth down <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Penn State four-yard line, from which point they scored two plays later via a 1-yard run by David Cobb. Penn State responded, however, with Zach Zwinak rushing the ball 5 times for 61 yards including a 38-yard run, and ultimately a 6-yard touchdown scamper. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, Minnesota led 10–7. In the second quarter, Minnesota wasted no time, embarking on a 13-play, 70-yard drive that lasted 6:54 and ended with Nelson rushing for a 6-yard touchdown. Penn State responded, driving down the field on 13 plays for 65 yards lasting 5:57, culminating with Ficken kicking a 27-yard field goal after the drive stalled in the red zone. Late in the half, Minnesota drove down the field, and Nelson completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to Williams, putting Minnesota on top 24–10 at the half. Receiving the second half kickoff, Minnesota initiated a drive that included a 39-yard run by Cobb, but ultimately ended in their first punt of the day, which they downed inside the one-yard line. Penn State achieved two first downs, but an illegal block in the back on Jesse James decimated the drive, which ended with a punt, but they caught a break a play later when Minnesota fumbled and Malcolm Willis recovered in Minnesota territory. The break did not materialize with any points, but their subsequent punt was downed inside the five yard line. Dreadful field position continued when, after driving for several yards, Minnesota's punt settled inside the five yard line, again setting Penn State up with a long field. In the waning moments of the third quarter, Penn State relied on Zwinak, who rushed several consecutive times to garner Penn State breathing room. There was no scoring in the third quarter. Penn State failed to convert a third down (they had still not converted any in the game), but Minnesota committed a roughing the kicker penalty, giving Penn State a second chance with which they converted their first third down of the game, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs. After a Minnesota punt, Penn State, for the first drive of the game, relied on their passing game to drive down the field, but, when faced with a fourth down and ten deep in Minnesota territory, failed to convert. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, however, they managed to run only 47 seconds off the clock, and went three-and-out. Hoping not to again blow an opportunity, Penn State moved promptly down the field, and got into the red zone. While there, a pass to Allen Robinson resulted in a pass interference penalty called against Minnesota, giving Penn State the ball at the two-yard line, from where they fumbled, and Minnesota recovered, and embarked on a possession from which they would not relinquish the ball, winning the game 24–10, after no scoring in the second half.|$|E

25|$|Roger Mortimer of Wigmore was a {{powerful}} Marcher lord, married to the wealthy heiress Joan de Geneville, {{and the father of}} twelve children. Mortimer had been imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 following his capture by Edward during the Despenser wars. Mortimer's uncle, Roger Mortimer de Chirk finally died in prison, but Mortimer managed to escape the Tower in August 1323, making a hole in the stone wall of his cell and then escaping onto the roof, before using rope ladders provided by an accomplice <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> River Thames, across the river and then on eventually to safety in France. Victorian writers suggested that, given later events, Isabella might have helped Mortimer escape and some historians continue to argue that their relationship had already begun at this point, although most believe that there is no hard evidence for their having had a substantial relationship before meeting in Paris.|$|E
25|$|UMass {{started with}} {{the ball in the}} second half but after a three-and-out, the Badgers scored on their first {{offensive}} play of the second half with Joel Stave connecting with wide receiver Jared Abbrederis on a 65-yard touchdown pass. Another UMass punt and then three plays later running back James White scores on a 51-yard touchdown run. UMass then put together a nice drive that got down to the Badgers 38-yard line but Wisconsin CB Sojour Shelton intercepted the UMass pass. The Badgers took over at their own 22-yard line and five plays later they were in the end zone again with a 57-yard touchdown pass to Jared Abbrederis from Joel Stave. At {{the end of the third}} quarter, Wisconsin led 38–0. The Badgers would close out the scoring less than two minutes into the fourth quarter with a 23-yard touchdown run by true freshman running back, Corey Clement, his first career touchdown. UMass then used a 12-play drive <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Badgers 33-yard line but failed on a fourth down conversion. A heavy dose of running the ball with Corey Clement help the Badgers run off the final seven and a half minutes of the game and giving Wisconsin a 45–0 victory.|$|E
500|$|United {{created the}} first {{significant}} opportunity of the game, around the midway point of the first half, when a header from Steve Bruce was inadvertently cleared by his own teammate McClair in the Arsenal goal. In the meantime, Arsenal manager George Graham spotted that the marking in midfield was poor and instructed Limpar and Rocastle to push forward, while striker Paul Merson was given a deeper role to follow Mike Phelan. Arsenal took the lead two minutes before half-time; Limpar made a run across United's penalty area to receive Paul Davis' corner from the right hand side. United [...] "clearly believed this was a dummy run", hence why Phelan {{made no attempt to}} challenge. Davis passed the ball short to Limpar, who turned and curled it goalwards into the penalty area with his left foot. Although goalkeeper Les Sealey [...] "did well <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ball", he was unable to hold it; referee Keith Hackett deemed the ball to have crossed the goal line and gave the goal. Ferguson offered no complaints about Hackett's decision afterwards: [...] "The video showed quite clearly the referee was right and the ball crossed the line." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{controversy}} {{related to}} the book came from a passage in Facts on the Ground in which Abu El Haj wrote that during a dig in Jezreel, British and Israeli archaeologists used [...] "bulldozers ... in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earlier strata, which are saturated with national significance, as quickly as possible." [...] She noted that [...] "among Palestinian officials at the Haram al-Sharif and the Awqaf {{as well as many}} other archaeologists ... the use of bulldozers has become the ultimate sign of 'bad science' and of nationalist politics guiding research agendas." [...] She wrote that the incident took place [...] "a week after [...] stopped participating in the excavations" [...] and attributed the account to [...] "several participants, both archaeologists and student volunteers," [...] whom she did not name.|$|E
2500|$|Following his conversion, Yusuf {{abandoned}} his musical career {{for nearly three}} decades. In 2007, he {{said that when he}} became a Muslim in 1977, the Imam at his mosque told him that it was fine to continue as a musician, as long as the songs were morally acceptable, but others were saying that [...] "it was all prohibited", and he decided to avoid the question by ceasing to perform. He has said that there was [...] "a combination of reasons, really", and that the continuing demands of the music business had been [...] "becoming a chore, and not an inspiration anymore". In a 2004 interview on Larry King Live, he said [...] "A lot of people would have loved me to keep singing. You come to a point where you have sung, more or less... your whole repertoire and you want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> job of living. You know, up until that point, I hadn't had a life. I'd been searching, been on the road." ...|$|E
