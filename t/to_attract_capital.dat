The popularity of company shares were such that they sparked {{a need for more}} paper bank notes, and when shares generated profits the investors were paid out in paper bank notes.

25|$|One early {{introduction}} of energy market concepts and privatization to electric power systems {{took place in}} Chile in the early 1981s, in parallel with other market-oriented reforms associated with the Chicago Boys. The Chilean model was generally perceived as successful in bringing rationality and transparency to power pricing. Argentina improved on the Chilean model by imposing strict limits on market concentration and by improving the structure of payments to units held in reserve to assure system reliability. One of the principal purposes of the {{introduction of}} market concepts in Argentina was to privatize existing generation assets (which had fallen into disrepair under the government-owned monopoly, resulting in frequent service interruptions) and <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>capital</b> needed for rehabilitation of those assets and for system expansion.

2500|$|The energy, mining, {{and related}} {{industries}} {{are expected to}} continue <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>capital</b> flows via joint ventures and consortia, privatizations, and direct acquisitions. According to ProInversión, the privatization process in the minerals sector and FDI in every sector of the Peruvian economy, particularly in the banking and energy industries are expected to continue to generate additional investments. Higher demand for copper, gold, iron ore, and silver and high metal prices are likely to encourage mining companies to invest in expanding and modernizing their operations. The liquefaction of Camisea's natural gas for export to China, MERCOSUR, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and other trading partners {{is expected to increase}} Peru’s mineral exports further. The transportation phase of Camisea's pipelines for natural gas (714km) and for natural gas liquids (560km), however, could encounter financial difficulties because of leaky NGL pipeline. This second phase would involve establishing infrastructure to pipe the gas and associated liquids from Camisea to the Lima area and to liquefy 17 million cubic meters per day of gas for exports to NAFTA and possibly to Chile.

60|$|Inferior lands, or lands at {{a greater}} {{distance}} from the market, of course yield an inferior return, and an increasing demand can not be supplied from them unless at an augmentation of cost, and therefore of price. If the additional demand could continue to be supplied from the superior lands, by applying additional labor and capital, at no greater proportional cost than that at which they yield the quantity first demanded of them, the owners or farmers of those lands could undersell all others, and engross the whole market. Lands of a lower degree of fertility or in a more remote situation might indeed be cultivated by their proprietors, {{for the sake of}} subsistence or independence; but it never could be the interest of any one to farm them for profit. That a profit can be made from them, sufficient <b>to</b> <b>attract</b> <b>capital</b> to such an investment, is a proof that cultivation on the more eligible lands has reached a point beyond which any greater application of labor and capital would yield, at the best, no greater return than can be obtained at the same expense from less fertile or less favorably situated lands.|$|E
