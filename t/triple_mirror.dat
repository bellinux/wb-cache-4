50|$|Mirroring schemes such as RAID 10 have a bounded {{recovery}} {{time as they}} require the copy of a single failed drive, compared with parity schemes such as RAID 6, which require the copy of all blocks of the drives in an array set.

50|$|The first {{generation}} of the Oracle Database Appliance (ODA V1) is a two-node cluster in a single rack-mounted chassis. Inside the chassis are two servers, configured in a cluster, with shared storage. Each server contains two six-core processors, {{for a total of}} 12 cores per server. Each server also contains 96GB memory, six 1Gbit NICs, and two 10Gbit NICs. NICs are configured in an active/passive HA (bonding) configuration. Inside the appliance holds 4 x 73GB of shared SSD storage and 20 x 600GB of shared hard disk storage. The appliance contains redundant power supplies and cooling fans. Storage is configured at deploy time for either double mirroring (giving an overall capacity of 6TB data), or <b>triple</b> <b>mirroring</b> (yielding a capacity of 4TB data).|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{successful}} testing of the GRACE follow-on <b>triple</b> <b>mirror</b> assembly (TMA) prototype. This component serves to route the laser beam in a proposed follow-on mission to the Gravity Recovery and Climate Explorer (GRACE) mission, containing an optical instrument for space-based distance measurement between satellites. As part of this, the TMA has to meet a set of stringent requirements on both the optical and mechanical properties. The purpose of the TMA prototype testing is to establish the feasibility of the design, materials choice and fabrication techniques.

40|$|The psychobiological {{basis of}} {{reactive}} aggression, a condition characterized by uncontrolled outbursts of socially violent behavior, is unclear. Nonetheless, several theoretical {{models have been}} proposed that may have complementary views about the psychobiological mechanisms involved. In this review, we attempt to unite these models and theorize further {{on the basis of}} recent data from psychological and neuroscientific research to propose a comprehensive neuro-evolutionary framework: The Triple Imbalance Hypothesis (TIH) of reactive aggression. According to this model, reactive aggression is essentially subcortically motivated by an imbalance in the levels of the steroid hormones cortisol and testosterone (Subcortical Imbalance Hypothesis). This imbalance not only sets a primal predisposition for social aggression, but also down-regulates cortical-subcortical communication (Cortical-Subcortical Imbalance Hypothesis), hence diminishing control by cortical regions that regulate socially aggressive inclinations. However, these bottom-up hormonally mediated imbalances can drive both instrumental and reactive social aggression. The TIH suggests that reactive aggression is differentiated from proactive aggression by low brain serotonergic function and that reactive aggression is associated with left-sided frontal brain asymmetry (Cortical Imbalance Hypothesis), especially observed when the individual is socially threatened or provoked. This <b>triple</b> biobehavioral imbalance <b>mirrors</b> an evolutionary relapse into violently aggressive motivational drives that are adaptive among many reptilian and mammalian species, but may have become socially maladaptive in modern humans...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In the bat-pollinated vineMucuna holtonii {{only the}} first visit to a flower is rewarded with a {{substantial}} amount of nectar, which is released when a bat lands on the flower and triggers an explosion mechanism. During later visits the bats receive only small amounts of nectar. Nevertheless, the inflorescences as a whole remain attractive, since further buds successively open during the night. Nectar-feeding bats Glossophaga commissarisi selectively visit unexploded, ‘‘virgin’ ’ flowers. They can discriminate buds, virgin and exploded flowers using echolocation. In field experiments bats exploited virgin flowers, the vexillum of which had been replaced by a same-sized <b>triple</b> <b>mirror</b> or by an artificial vexillum. Such flowers were frequently inspected, but not as often exploited as natural flowers. In two-alternative-forced-choice experiments the bats learned to discriminate be-tween replicas of the vexillum and triple mirrors. The recognition distance was between 15 and 50 cm. Echoes of the three flowering stages differ in their spectral composition, which changes in dependence of the sound incidence angle in a characteristic way. We conclude that glossophagine bats are able to recognize small motion-less structures like flowers and to accurately adjust their landing manoeuvres by using their echolocation system alone...|$|E
40|$|The GRACE Follow-On {{mission will}} monitor {{fluctuations}} in Earth’s geoid using, {{for the first}} time, a Laser Ranging Interferometer to measure intersatellite distance changes. We have investigated the coupling between spacecraft rotation and the intersatellite range measurement that is incurred due to manufacturing and assembly tolerances of the <b>Triple</b> <b>Mirror</b> Assembly (TMA), a precision retroreflector to ensure alignment between in- and outgoing laser beams. The three TMA mirror planes intersect in a virtual vertex to which satellite displacements are referenced. TMA manufacturing tolerances degrade this ideal vertex, however, a Point of Minimal Coupling (PMC) between spacecraft rotation and displacement exists. This paper presents the experimental location of the PMC under pitch and yaw rotations for a prototype TMA. Rotations are performed using a hexapod, while displacements are monitored with heterodyne laser interferometry to verify the PMC position. Additionally, the vertex of the three TMA mirror planes is measured using a Coordinate Measuring Machine and compared to the PMC position. In the pitch and yaw axes, the biggest deviation between TMA vertex and PMC was 50 ± 64 μm. Thus, within the measurement uncertainties, no difference between TMA vertex and PMC could be observed. This is a key piece of information for integration of the TMA into the spacecraft: It is sufficient to use the readily-available TMA vertex location to ensure minimal rotation-to-displacement coupling during the mission...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} has {{the purpose}} of presenting in an organic way my research on integrable systems originating from the geometry of moduli spaces of curves, with applications to Gromov-Witten theory and mirror symmetry. The text contains a short introduction to the main ideas and prerequisites of the subject from geometry and mathematical physics, followed by a synthetic review of some of my papers (listed below) starting from my PhD thesis (October 2008), and with some open questions and future developements. My results include: • the <b>triple</b> <b>mirror</b> symmetry among P 1 -orbifolds with positive Euler characteristic, the Landau-Ginzburg model with superpotential −xyz + x p + y q + z r with 1 p + 1 q + 1 r > 1 and the orbit spaces of extended ane Weyl groups of type ADE, • the mirror symmetry between local footballs (local toric P 1 -orbifolds) and certain double Hurwitz spaces together with the identication of the corresponding integrable hierarchy as a rational reduction of the 2 DToda hierarchy (with A. Brini, G. Carlet and S. Romano). • a series of papers on {{various aspects of the}} double ramication hierarchy (after A. Buryak), forming a large program investigating integrable systems arising from cohomological eld theories and the geometry of the double ram-ication cycle, their quantization, their relation with the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy, the generalizations of Witten's conjecture and relations in the co-homology of the moduli space of stable curves (with A. Buryak, B. Dubrovin and J. Guéré) ...|$|E
