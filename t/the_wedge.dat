5|$|A true {{ocean basin}} {{developed}} to the west, breaking all the earlier formations along a steep front. A wedge of clastic sediment {{then began to}} accumulate {{at the base of}} the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves. Three formations developed from sediment that accumulated on <b>the</b> <b>wedge.</b> The region's first known fossils of complex life are found in the resulting formations. Notable among these are the Ediacara fauna and trilobites, the evolution of the latter being part of the Cambrian Explosion of life.|$|E
5|$|Above the {{mounting}} platform was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected to}} a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point {{at the tip of}} <b>the</b> <b>wedge.</b> The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E

5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus) {{is a small}} crocodilian from {{northern}} and central South America in the alligator family. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Surinam and Venezuela. It lives in riverine forests, flooded forests near lakes, and near fast-flowing rivers and streams. It can traverse dry land to reach temporary pools and tolerates colder water than other species of alligator. Other common names for this species include the musky caiman, the dwarf caiman, Cuvier's caiman and the smooth-fronted caiman. It is sometimes kept in captivity as a pet and may {{be referred to as}} <b>the</b> <b>wedge</b> head caiman by the pet trade.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Stroud {{advertised in}} a {{publication}} {{that he had}} not received any royalties from the sales of Diseases of Canaries. In retaliation, the publisher complained to the warden, and, as a result, proceedings were initiated to transfer Stroud to Alcatraz, where he would not be permitted to keep his birds. In the end, however, Stroud was able to keep both his birds and canary-selling business at Leavenworth. Stroud avoided trouble for several more years, until it came to light that some of the equipment Stroud had requested for his lab was in fact being used as a home-made still to distill alcohol. Officials finally had <b>the</b> <b>wedge</b> they needed to drive Stroud out.|$|E
5|$|The {{city also}} has three {{established}} music venues: the Guildhall, The Wedgewood Rooms (which includes a smaller venue, Edge of <b>the</b> <b>Wedge),</b> and Portsmouth Pyramids Centre. Portsmouth Guildhall, another theatrical venue, {{is one of}} the largest events venue in South East England, with a seating capacity of 2500. For many years a series of symphony concerts has been presented at the Guildhall by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. In the 1970s the Portsmouth Sinfonia approached classical music from a different angle: the Sinfonia often recruited players that had no musical training or, if they were musicians, ones that chose to play an instrument that was entirely new to them. The Portsmouth Summer Show is held at King George's Fields. The 2016 event was held in the last weekend of April, and featured cover bands such as the Silver Beatles, the Bog Rolling Stones, and Fleetingwood Mac.|$|E

30|$|Vibrational {{energy is}} {{dissipated}} through friction produced between <b>the</b> <b>wedges,</b> bolster, and side frames [14, 15]. The damping force and anti-warp performance {{are directly related}} to the support force provided by the secondary suspension {{and the degree to which}} <b>the</b> <b>wedges</b> are worn. After wear, <b>the</b> <b>wedges</b> would move upwards, resulting in a decrease in the support force provided by <b>the</b> <b>wedges,</b> and worsening their surface conditions. Consequently, the damping force and anti-warp performance change significantly, which ultimately affects the reliability of the running performance of the cars [14, 15, 16, 17]. It is therefore necessary to design a new damper with more reliable performance and a simpler structure.|$|R

5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of toss-up puzzles {{at the start of}} the 18th syndicated season in 2000, the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1, with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round. In addition, if a tie for first place occurred, an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round. The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge, which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel. It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge. Free Spin was retired, and Free Play introduced, {{at the start of the}} 27th syndicated season in 2009. Between September 16, 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013, the show featured a progressive Jackpot wedge, which had been in several different rounds in its history. The jackpot started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it. To claim the jackpot, a contestant had to land on <b>the</b> <b>wedge,</b> call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle all in the same turn. In later years, it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the jackpot, regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> green <b>wedges</b> of Stockholm {{are meant}} to support {{a high level of}} {{biodiversity}} as well as cultural and recreational services but evaluating the spatial development of <b>the</b> <b>wedges</b> is difficult because their delineation has changed since they were first used in a regional development plan. This study examines a part of the Hanveden and Tyresta wedges in southern Stockholm, with the goal to use robust ecological theory to evaluate the development of <b>the</b> <b>wedges</b> from 1992 until today with focus on conserving a high level of biodiversity. Using an already existing GIS-based method of identifying connectivity weaknesses in <b>the</b> <b>wedges,</b> more weaknesses were found in 2010 than in 1992 although the total area of <b>the</b> <b>wedges</b> had only declined 3. 3 %. The shape of <b>the</b> <b>wedges</b> had also changed, with more narrow parts in 2010 than in 1992. To more effectively compare the development of factors in the landscape that are relevant for biodiversity, this study proposes a new method using the common shrew and hazel grouse as surrogate species. The total area loss for the common shrew was 2. 96 % from 1991 to 2013 and 2. 23 % for the hazel grouse. Fragmentation increased for both species. A large part of the greenspaces relevant to the surrogate species are covered by <b>the</b> green <b>wedges,</b> meaning that important cultural and recreational values identified by the county council are also present in areas relevant to the surrogate species. Using surrogate species to delineate and monitor <b>the</b> green <b>wedges</b> could enhance <b>the</b> cultural and recreational qualities of <b>the</b> <b>wedges,</b> emphasize <b>the</b> need for connectivity planning, identify ecologically important parts of the greenspaces as well as provide a tool for following up the development of the urban greenspaces of Stockholm. However, formulating goals relevant to biodiversity is important to fully evaluate development and municipal cooperation is needed...|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge road}} deck was {{constructed}} on {{land at the}} ends of the Viaduct, and rolled lengthwise from one pylon to the next, with eight temporary towers providing additional support. The movement was accomplished by a computer-controlled system of pairs of <b>wedges</b> under <b>the</b> deck; the upper and lower wedges of each pair pointing in opposite directions. These were hydraulically operated, and moved repeatedly in the following sequence: <b>the</b> lower <b>wedge</b> slides under <b>the</b> upper <b>wedge,</b> raising it to the roadway above, and then forcing <b>the</b> upper <b>wedge</b> still higher to lift <b>the</b> roadway. Both <b>wedges</b> move forward together, advancing the roadway a short distance. <b>The</b> lower <b>wedge</b> retracts from under <b>the</b> upper <b>wedge,</b> lowering <b>the</b> roadway and allowing <b>the</b> upper <b>wedge</b> to drop away from the roadway; <b>the</b> lower <b>wedge</b> then moves back all the way to its starting position. There is now a linear distance between <b>the</b> two <b>wedges</b> equal to <b>the</b> distance forward the roadway has just moved. <b>The</b> upper <b>wedge</b> moves backward, placing it further back along the roadway, adjacent to the front tip of <b>the</b> lower <b>wedge</b> and ready to repeat the cycle and advance the roadway by another increment. It worked at 600 mm per cycle which was roughly four minutes long.|$|R
