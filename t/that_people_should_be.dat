5|$|Opponents {{to suicide}} include Christian {{philosophers}} such as Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant and, arguably, John Stuart Mill â€“ Mill's {{focus on the}} importance of liberty and autonomy meant that he rejected choices which would prevent a person from making future autonomous decisions. Others view suicide as a legitimate matter of personal choice. Supporters of this position maintain that no one should be forced to suffer against their will, particularly from conditions such as incurable disease, mental illness, and old age, with no possibility of improvement. They reject the belief that suicide is always irrational, arguing instead that it can be a valid last resort for those enduring major pain or trauma. A stronger stance would argue <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to autonomously choose to die regardless of whether they are suffering. Notable supporters of this school of thought include Scottish empiricist David Hume and American bioethicist Jacob Appel.|$|E

25|$|Discussing ethical issues, Ruse {{distinguishes between}} {{involuntary}} inclination and willful behavior, arguing that while a homosexual orientation is morally blameless, {{this is not}} necessarily true of homosexual behavior. Ruse finds no justification for homosexual or heterosexual promiscuity, but nevertheless maintains on utilitarian grounds <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> free to be promiscuous. He criticizes ethical arguments that appeal to scientific claims about the naturalness or unnaturalness of homosexuality, for example the views of the Greek philosopher Plato, according to whom homosexual behavior did not occur in animals. Ruse finds this claim to be mistaken, and dismisses the idea that homosexuality is unnatural. Ruse argues that both neo-Kantian and utilitarian theories of the just state must affirm the moral worth of homosexual relationships and support equal rights for homosexuals and heterosexuals.|$|E

25|$|Symbolic racism {{represents}} {{a form of}} resistance {{to change in the}} racial status quo based on moral feelings that blacks violate such traditional American values as individualism and self-reliance, the work ethic, obedience, and discipline. Whites may feel <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> rewarded on their merits, which in turn should be based on hard work and diligent service. Hence symbolic racism should find its most vociferous expression on political issues that involve 'unfair' government assistance to blacks: welfare ('welfare cheats could find work if they tried'); 'reverse discrimination' and racial quotas ('blacks should not be given a status they have not earned'); 'forced' busing ('whites have worked hard for their neighborhoods, and for their neighborhood schools'); or 'free' abortions for the poor ('if blacks behaved morally, they would not need abortions').|$|E
25|$|Confucius {{believed}} that the welfare of a country depended on the moral cultivation of its people, beginning from the nation's leadership. He {{believed that}} individuals could begin to cultivate an all-encompassing sense of virtue through ren, and that the most basic step to cultivating ren was devotion to one's parents and older siblings. He taught that one's individual desires {{do not need to}} be suppressed, but <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> educated to reconcile their desires via rituals and forms of propriety, through which people could demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society. He taught that a ruler's sense of virtue was his primary prerequisite for leadership. His primary goal in educating his students was to produce ethically well-cultivated men who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things.|$|E
25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

500|$|Contrasting her middle-class values against Burke's aristocratic ones, Wollstonecraft contends <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{judged on}} their merits {{rather than on}} their birthrights. As Wollstonecraft scholar Janet Todd writes, [...] "the vision of society {{revealed}} [...] A Vindication of the Rights of Men was one of talents, where entrepreneurial, unprivileged children could compete on equal terms with the now wrongly privileged." [...] Wollstonecraft emphasizes the benefits of hard work, self-discipline, frugality, and morality, values she contrasts with the [...] "vices of the rich", such as [...] "insincerity" [...] and the [...] "want of natural affections". She endorses a commercial society that would help individuals discover their own potential as well as force them to realize their civic responsibilities. For her, commercialism would be the great equalizing force. However, several years later, in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), she would question the ultimate benefits of commercialism to society.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The Observer, Alison Kelly of the University of Oxford {{observed}} the novel's philosophical qualities, and opined that its [...] "thriller-style hints and foreshadowings... {{form part of}} a metaphysical investigation." [...] Kelly describes it as an exposÃ© of the worst depths of human nature, labelling it existentialist' {{to the extent that}} it confronts the minimal limits of identity". She further argues that the novel's motif of facial recognitions amounts to the message <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> read [...] "at face value", and that furthermore, past action is the greatest indicator of future behaviour, leaving no room for [...] "change, growth, [...] self-reinvention". In terms of stylistic literary changes, Ellis also displays more fondness for the Ruskinian pathetic fallacy than in previous works. For the most part, the novel is written in Ellis' trademark writing style; Lawson refers to this as [...] "sexual and narcotic depravities in an emotionless tone." [...] With regard to this style, Ellis cites precursors to himself, particular the work of filmmakers. Ellis feels that the technique itself gives the reader a unique kind of insight into the characters, and comments that [...] "numbness is a feeling too. Emotionality isn't the only feeling there is." [...] In terms of style, Ellis told Vice that he enjoyed his return to minimalism, because of the challenge of [...] "rying to achieve that kind of tension with so few words was enjoyable to do." [...] While some reviewers of popular fiction derided Ellis's style as [...] "flat", others found it unexpectedly moving.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} chosen by fans, in a Billboard poll for Madonna's best videos, as her sixth best effort of all time, in honor of her 54th birthday. At the 2013 International Dance Music Awards, the video was {{nominated}} in the categories of Best Dance Music Video and Best Pop Music Video, but failed to win either of them. Shortly after [...] "Girl Gone Wild"s release to YouTube on March 21, 2012, the video was rated by many viewers as inappropriate. This caused YouTube to set an age restriction, only allowing those of age 18 or older to view the video. According to the website, the video was labeled explicit because of the [...] "raunchy" [...] and [...] "orgy" [...] scenes, thereby blocking it from getting uploaded to the singer's Vevo account. YouTube also asked Madonna's representative to upload a more PG-rated version. Madonna later commented, [...] "What's wrong with... what grinding? I'm {{supposed to be a}} 'girl gone wild' in the videoâ€”how can I go wild and not grind? This is the question <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> asking." [...] During her interview with Jimmy Fallon on Facebook, Madonna jokingly confessed that if she were president, [...] "There would be no restrictions whatsoever on any of my videos, ever". Jane Martinson of The Guardian expressed her disappointment with the ban, since she felt there were far more provocative content in YouTube than Madonna's video. Martinson also noted that the semi-nudity in question came from the men featured in the clip, and felt that Madonna had turned Francis' concept of girls going wild, to [...] " [...] can also be the ones in control. I watched the video ready to slate her and came away thinking, after 30 years Madonna can still show Rihanna how sex and music can subvert expectations." ...|$|E
