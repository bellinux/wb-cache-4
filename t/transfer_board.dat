5000|$|Assistive {{devices such}} as wheelchairs have a {{substantial}} effect {{on the quality of}} life of the patient, and careful selection is important. [...] Teaching the patient how to transfer from different positions, such as from a wheelchair into bed, is an important part of therapy, and {{devices such as}} sliding transfer boards and grab bars can assist in these tasks. [...] Individuals who are able to transfer independently from their wheelchair to the driver's seat using a sliding <b>transfer</b> <b>board</b> may be able to return to driving in an adapted vehicle. Complete independence with driving also requires the ability to load and unload one's wheelchair from the vehicle. In addition to acquiring skills such as wheelchair transfers, individuals with a spinal cord injury can greatly benefit from exercise reconditioning. In the majority of cases, spinal cord injury leaves the lower limbs either entirely paralyzed, or with insufficient strength, endurance, or motor control to support safe and effective physical training. Therefore, most exercise training employs the use of arm crank ergometry, wheelchair ergometry, and swimming. In one study, subjects with traumatic spinal cord injury participated in a progressive exercise training program, which involved arm ergometry and resistance training. Subjects in the exercise group experienced significant increases in strength for almost all muscle groups when compared to the control group. Exercisers also reported less stress, fewer depressive symptoms, greater satisfaction with physical functioning, less pain, and better quality of life. Physical therapists are able to provide a variety of exercise interventions, including, passive range of motion exercises, upper body wheeling (arm crank ergometry), functional electrical stimulation, and electrically stimulated resistance exercises all of which can improve arterial function in those living with SCI. Physical therapists can improve {{the quality of life of}} individuals with spinal cord injury by developing exercise programs that are tailored to meet individual patient needs. Adapted physical activity equipment can also be used to allow for sport participation: for example, sit-skiis can be used by individuals with a spinal cord injury for cross-country or downhill skiing.|$|E

40|$|Introduction : Assistive {{devices are}} {{prescribed}} for {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) patients with motor deficits, but {{little is known about}} their perceived benefit. Therefore, we assessed ALS patients' satisfaction with commonly prescribed devices. Methods : A telephone survey of 63 ALS patients from a single multidisciplinary clinic was conducted to assess the frequency of use, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction with 33 assistive devices. Results : Of those assistive technologies used “often or always” by ≥ 20 % of respondents, arm rails by the toilet, elevated toilet seat, shower seat, shower bars, and slip-on shoes were ranked very highly for both usefulness and satisfaction. The ankle brace for ambulation, <b>transfer</b> <b>board,</b> speaker phone, and electronic seating controls were also ranked highly. The button hook, dressing stick, and long-handled reaching tool received low ratings for both usefulness and satisfaction. Conclusions : ALS patients reported high usefulness and satisfaction levels with all bathroom adaptive devices and certain low-technology devices. Muscle Nerve, 201...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} officers applying to and being selected by lateral transfer boards using biannual redesignation data from November 2010 through November 2012. The lateral <b>transfer</b> <b>board</b> reviews approximately 500 applicants each year. The majority of the Restricted Line designators rely on lateral transfer boards as their primary means of accessing new officers, where the average applicant is an O- 3, male, and is a surface warfare officer (1110). Although the applicants are moderately different at each board, the aggregate selection rate is 40 percent. A probit analysis suggests that officers {{who are most likely}} to be successful at redesignating are Hispanic and O- 4, as well as Limited Duty Officers. The regression results indicate that there is no gender difference in selection but senior pay grades are selected at a higher rate, where Information Professional and Foreign Area Officer communities currently have the greatest demand for officers at the lateral transfer boards. Additionally, Surface Warfare provides the greatest supply of applicants on average, but holding all else equal, an officer is less likely to be selected if he or she applies as a surface warfare officer.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Secretary of the Navy's Sailor 2025 and Talent Management initiatives aim {{to improve the}} Navy's personnel management processes {{in an effort to}} attract, train and retain high-quality personnel. This study examines job performance measures among Navy officers on their initial job assignment and among officers who completed a lateral transfer and redesignation. Using longitudinal data on several cohorts of Navy officers, and a multivariate regression analysis approach, the findings suggest that officers who lateral transfer have higher retention and promotion rates than other officers. When the analysis is conducted by community, the findings show mixed retention and promotion effects. Performance is further examined via fitness reports scores, showing lower individual trait averages for males who lateral transferred into the Unrestricted Line communities, and higher trait averages for females who lateral transferred into Restricted Line/Staff communities. These results suggest that lateral transfers might increase the quality of the job match. Further research should consider using detailed lateral <b>transfer</b> <b>board</b> data in order to differentiate between lateral transfers or redesignations, as well as to account for the characteristics of those who are approved or denied a lateral transfer.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of general {{principles}} of person transfer techniques specifically on the low back joint extension moment. These effects were examined by the following measurable quantitative parameters: 1) trunk bending angle, 2) knee flexion angle, 3) distance between the centers of gravity (COGs) of the caregiver and patient, representing the distance between the caregiver and patient, and 4) the vertical component of the ground reaction force representing the amount of the weight-bearing load on the caregiver’ s low back during transfers with and without assistive devices. Twenty students each took the role of caregiver, and one healthy adult simulated a patient. The participants performed three different transfer tasks: without any assistive device, with the patient wearing a low back belt, and with the caregiver using a <b>transfer</b> <b>board.</b> We found that the distance between the COGs and the vertical component of the ground reaction force, but not the trunk bending and knee flexion angles, were the variables that affected the low back joint extension moment. Our results suggest that the general principle of decreasing the distance between COGs is most effective for decreasing the low back joint extension moment during transfers under all conditions...|$|E

Individuals who are able to bear weight and take a few steps may utilize commode chairs, thus giving them the ability to visit the toilet independently. To complement an individualized wheelchair, an occupational therapist may also consider prescribing a hospital bed, pressure-relieving mattresses and foam wedges for proper positioning to prevent pressure skin ulcers, contractures and deformities. Specialized trays, input devices and software may also be prescribed to facilitate computer use.|$|R

It can be challenging to integrate results across multiple studies that do not share a common metric. Some conditions such as Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy have a predictable course of disease progression. Severity can be inferred from a patient’s medical history. This paper describes the development of a disease severity measure using common markers of disease progression. Rasch modeling was used to estimate severity using dichotomous events that indicate disease progression. Caregivers of 34 young men with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy completed structured interviews about their care and medical history. Interview questions included surgeries (tendon release, scoliosis, tracheostomy), respiratory equipment (assisted ventilation, cough assist devices), and the use of other medical equipment (e. g., braces, walkers, wheelchairs, <b>transfer</b> <b>boards,</b> hospital beds).
