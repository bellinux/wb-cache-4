5|$|Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) {{satellite}} observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed {{scientists to}} identify several {{different types of}} flares, and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Located {{just east}} of a strong cold front, the minimal {{hurricane}} continued to speed over progressively cooler waters. Shary gradually began <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> convective symmetry, though the small eye remained distinguishable in microwave images. Within hours, rapid interaction with the front had begun to occur, suggesting the storm was entering an extratropical transition. Data from cyclone phase space diagrams indicated Shary had become post-tropical about 530miles (885km) south-southeast of Cape Race, and the NHC discontinued advisories. Later on that day, the extratropical remnants of Hurricane Shary were completely absorbed by the same neighboring system.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, {{the storm}} began a {{weakening}} trend {{and it turned}} towards the north. The next day, the storm—having weakened to Category 1 status—skirted the southeastern tip of Newfoundland. Debbie began <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> tropical characteristics as it accelerated towards the northeast, and it weakened into a tropical storm early on August 25. As it moved over increasingly cold waters, it dissipated east of Greenland.|$|E

Many central offices subsequently moved to Buda, followed by {{a large segment of the}} nobility. The first newspapers in Hungarian and Slovak were published here: Magyar hírmondó in 1780, and Presspurske Nowiny in 1783. In the course of the 18th century, the city became a centre for the Slovak national movement.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, the Diệm regime began <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> {{tight control}} over the country as civil unrest spread {{as a result of}} the Buddhist crisis. Large scale demonstrations by the Buddhist {{majority}} erupted in response to the government shootings of nine Buddhists in Huế who were protesting against a ban on the flying of the Buddhist flag during Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power. Thảo was part of the many plots that engulfed Saigon, destabilising the regime. Aiming for a 15 July coup, Tuyến consulted with Thảo regarding his plans, but Tuyến was too closely associated with Nhu to recruit the necessary military aid and he was subsequently exiled by Nhu.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the few centuries up until the current version of 1957, the coat of arms has {{undergone}} some distinctly visible changes. While some 15th-century portrayals already show a child figure instead of the monk, the monk in representations onwards began <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> serious disposition, with curly hair and a more youthful-looking face. By the 18th century and especially the 19th century, the monk had been minimised into the Münchner Kindl, Bavarian for Munich Child, a reference to the figure first documented in 1727, although it is not clear when it appeared on the coat of arms for the first time or who coined the term. The transformation was brought about by artists such as sculptors and painters as well as copper and seal engravers, as opposed to a legal order.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> {{dominant}} position in the flour milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915–1916. The rise of steam power, and later electric power, eroded the advantage that St. Anthony Falls provided in water power. The wheat fields of the Dakotas and Minnesota's Red River Valley began suffering from soil exhaustion due to consecutive wheat crops, leading {{to an increase in}} wheat leaf rust and related crop diseases. The farmers of the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red winter wheat suitable for bread flour, and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling. Also, due to changes in rail shipping rates, millers in Buffalo, New York were able to ship their flour more competitively.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the American Kennel Club {{explored}} {{the possibility of}} recognising the Jack Russell terrier. This move was opposed by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America as {{they did not want}} the breed <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> essential working characteristics. The Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association formed and petitioned the AKC; the breed's admission was granted in 2001. Under the AKC recognised standard, the size of the breed was narrowed from the previous club's standard, {{and the name of the}} AKC recognised Jack Russell terrier was changed to Parson Russell terrier, with the Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association renamed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Manchester Ship Canal and the Manchester Docks {{led to the development}} of Trafford Park as the largest industrial estate in Europe, and brought employment to the area for the next eighty years. By the 1960s however, the UK had begun <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> position as an industrial world power. By the mid-20th century, the UK cotton industry had gone into decline because of low-cost competition from Asian manufacturers. The decline of heavy industry in the area, the increasing size of freight-carrying ships, and competition from road transport, brought about the decline of the terminal docks at Salford, which closed in 1982.|$|E

In the 1960 season, Turley had a 9–3 win-loss record, and his 3.27 ERA was the seventh best in the American League. He started Game Two of the 1960 World Series against the Pirates, earning the win. He also started the deciding Game Seven, which the Pirates won, taking the series.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Bud was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} and second named tropical cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It formed as a tropical depression on July 10, {{to the south of}} the southern tip of Baja California. Shortly after, it became a tropical storm, and soon after the storm began to develop an eye. It began to intensify rapidly and was upgraded to a hurricane on July 11. Bud reached its peak intensity on July 13, becoming a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale at its peak. After reaching cooler waters and an unfavorable environment, the hurricane rapidly weakened and dropped to a tropical depression status on July 15. The system continued <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> convection and eventually degenerated by the next day. As the storm remained away from land, no effects were reported as a tropical cyclone, though its remnant brought precipitation to Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Mid-March brought warmer air to {{the country}} which thawed the snow lying on the ground. This {{snowmelt}} rapidly ran off the frozen ground into rivers and caused widespread flooding. More than 100,000 properties were affected, and the British Army and foreign aid agencies were required to provide humanitarian aid. With the cold spell over and the ground thawing, there were no further weather problems. The winter had severe effects on British industries, causing the loss of around 10per cent of the year's industrial production, 10to 20per cent of cereal and potato crops, and a quarter of sheep stocks. The ruling Labour Party began <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> popularity, which led to them losing many seats to the Conservative Party in the 1950 election. That winter is also cited {{as a factor in}} the devaluation of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80, Britain's decline from being a superpower, and the introduction of the Marshall Plan to aid war-torn Europe. The effects on the rest of Europe were also severe, with 150 deaths from cold and famine in Berlin, civil disorder in the Netherlands and business closures in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|On September26, a {{very large}} extratropical area of low {{pressure}} developed along a quasi-stationary frontal system a few hundred miles west of the Azores. The low intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80mph (130km/h) at 12:00UTC on September27. Over the following days, the low began <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> frontal features and began to transition into a subtropical cyclone as it traveled in a general westward direction. By September29, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura. Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying. A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60mph (95km/h). The overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} also {{time and again}} shown to have {{a soft spot for}} clubs in {{financial}} disarray. Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with gratuitous friendlies, transfers at favourable rates, and direct money transfers. Also when St. Pauli threatened <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> license for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game free of any charge, giving all revenues to St. Pauli. More recently when Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress Bayern came to a charity game at the Dutch club. Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden. When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners. In 2003, Bayern provided a 2 Million Euro loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid. On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan was}} {{supported}} by Secretary-General Joseph Louis Anne Avenol, who like Bruce recognised that the League was rapidly becoming moribund and that a major change of direction was needed, although neither was successful in convincing key states in contributing to the plan. Critically, new British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain could not be convinced by Bruce to invest further into {{the development of the}} League, and the body began <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> political impetus as war loomed. He would continue to press for League reform in the lead up to the war. The Bruce committee to advise on League reform was formed in 1939 {{in the aftermath of the}} partition of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany and the apparent failure of Chamberlain's appeasement policy. This committee, which met in July and August 1939, proposed a significant expansion of Bruce's earlier ideas to the League, bringing a wide range of economic and social programs under its purview as a means of fostering international cooperation. Their work, however, would be rendered moot by the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
