They release large amount of mercury (Hg) -containing waste seawater into the adjacent seas. However, very limited impact studies have been carried out. Our research targeted the distribution of Hg in the seawater, sediment, biota, and atmosphere, and its environmental transportation. Methods Seawater samples were collected from five sites: 1, sea areas adjacent to the power plant; 2, near discharge outlets; 3, the aeration pool of the power plant; and 4 and 5, two reference sites. The <b>total</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> was determined in situ with a Tekran 2537 B. Analyses of total Hg (TM) followed the USEPA methods. Results In most {{part of the study}} area, TM concentrations were close to the reference values and Hg transfer from the seawater into the sediment and biota was not obvious. However, in the aeration pool and near the waste discharge outlets, atmospheric and surface seawater concentrations of TM were much higher, compared with those at a reference site. The concentration ranges of <b>total</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> and TM in seawater were 3. 83 - 8. 60 ng/m(3) and 79. 0 - 198 ng/L near the discharge outlets, 7. 23 - 13. 5 ng/m(3) and 186 - 616 ng/L in the aeration pool, and 2. 98 - 4. 06 ng/m(3) and 0. 47 - 1. 87 ng/L at a reference point. Conclusions This study suggested that the Hg in the flue gas desulfurization waste seawater was not only transported and diluted with sea currents, but also could possibly be transferred into the atmosphere from the aeration pool and from the discharge outlets...|$|E

We demonstrate that Hg in volcanic plume occurs predominantly as gaseous mercury, with a mean TGM/Hg(p) mass ratio of ~ 63. TGM was also measured in condensates of fumarolic gases issuing from the South crater for assessing the volcanic Hg source strength in reference to H 2 S. On average, the TGM/Stot mass ratio in the issuing gases was found to be ~ 3, 5 times lower than in the volcanic plume (6. 3 × 10 - 7 and 2. 2 × 10 - 6, respectively), suggesting that there is no fast Hg chemical processing inside fumaroles.

In addition, the model adapted detailed calculations of the air-surface exchange for Hg to properly describe Hg re-emissions and dry deposition from and to natural surfaces. The mechanism covers Hg in three categories, elemental Hg (Hg 0), reactive gaseous Hg (RGM) and particulate Hg (HgP). With interfacing to MM 5 (meteorology processor) and SMOKE (emission processor), we applied the model to a 4 -week period in June/July 1995 on a domain covering most of eastern North America. Results indicate that the model simulates reasonably well the levels of <b>total</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (TGM) and the specific Hg wet deposition measurements made by the Hg deposition network (MDN). Moreover, results from various scenario runs reveal that the Hg system behaves in a closely linear way in terms of contributions from different source categories, i. e. anthropogenic emissions, natural re-emissions and background. Analyses of the scenario results suggest that 37 % of anthropogenically emitted Hg was deposited back in the model domain with 5155 kg of anthropogenic Hg {{moving out of the}} domain during the simulation period. Overall, the domain served as a net source, which supplied ~a half ton of Hg to the global background pool over the period.

40|$|A {{modelling}} {{study was}} conducted to explore the emission, transport, transformation and deposition behaviour of atmospheric Hg. A detailed natural Hg emission model was developed to estimate the natural Hg emissions from soil, water and vegetation. U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) Hg model system was improved by incorporating the detailed treatment of natural Hg emissions, adopting boundary conditions from a global Hg model (Seigneur et al., 2004) and including the calculation of the dry deposition velocity of elemental Hg. The natural Hg emission model and the improved CMAQ-Hg model were validated with some measurements and then applied to North America for a whole year (2002). A detailed natural Hg emission model was developed in this study. This model made use of detailed soil Hg concentration measurements, meteorological data and soil conditions to estimate Hg emissions from soil, water and vegetation. The influence of snow cover and low temperature was also considered in the model. This model was then applied to simulate one-year natural Hg emissions in North America in 2002. The modelled results, compared to some reported natural Hg emission measurements, demonstrated a strong simulation ability. The spatial and temporal variations of emission fluxes were examined through numerical simulations. A pronounced diurnal cycle and a seasonal cycle were found in the emissions from most land uses. Compared with summer, natural Hg emission was significantly limited in winter. Simulation results showed that about 229 metric tons of total natural Hg emission, 1. 8 times anthropogenic Hg emission, was emitted from the simulation domain in 2002. U. S. EPA CMAQ Hg model system was improved and then applied to simulate the emission, transport, transformation and deposition of atmospheric Hg in North America for the year 2002. The simulated results were compared with measured hourly <b>Total</b> <b>Gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (TGM) for 3 sites. The good agreement between them demonstrated the good performance of this improved model in modelling the behaviour of emission, transport, transformation and deposition of atmospheric Hg. Hg budget and net evasion of Hg in North America were also investigated. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the effects of emissions, including Hg and non-Hg emissions, on the air concentration and deposition of atmospheric Hg. The results indicated that ambient concentration of TGM was much more sensitive to Hg emissions than non-Hg emissions. Natural Hg emission was more significant than anthropogenic emission to affect ambient concentration of TGM, illustrating natural Hg emission is a key factor influencing TGM ambient concentration. Unlike TGM concentration, Hg dry deposition was not only sensitive to Hg emissions but also to non-Hg emissions such as VOCs and NO x. Anthropogenic Hg emission, natural Hg emission and NO x emission had almost the same effect on total dry deposition of Hg. The results also illustrated that Hg wet deposition was only sensitive to non-Hg emissions such as NO x and VOCs, especially of VOCs emission. Because of the inverse effect of VOCs on Hg wet deposition, reducing NO x emission should be an ideal solution to mitigate Hg wet deposition. A possible pathway through which atmospheric Hg was greatly affected by emissions changes was identified: emissions of pollutants, especially VOCs and NO x, greatly affect the level of OH in the atmosphere; OH influences the concentration and deposition of Hg by significantly affecting the gas phase reaction between Hg(0) and OH. </html...|$|E

40|$|The Gulf of Trieste (NE Italy) and the {{adjacent}} Grado-Marano Lagoon {{have been affected}} by significant mercury (Hg) contamination during the last 500 years due to the existence of mining tailings in Idrija (Slovenia) and their subsequent transportation along with sediments via the Isonzo River into the north-eastern Adriatic Sea. Although most of the metal is present as cinnabar compound in the coastal sediments and soils of the area, there is great concern on the potential evasion of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> from contaminated surface materials into the atmosphere. The coastal area hosts several economic, industrial but also touristic activities, the last one representing the most important resource for local inhabitants during summer season. Sandy beaches show Hg concentrations well above national regulations and they are then thought as potential source of the metal in the gaseous form in the air. Beach sediments are supposed to be a potential risk for humans during the warmest period of the year considering the possible emission, and consequently inhalation, of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> from these sands. This communication reports <b>total</b> <b>gaseous</b> mercury (TGM) concentrations measured in this area during surveys carried out during years 2013 and 2104 in the area of Trieste-Grado: one survey was carried out during 2013 in the Grado lagoon, using a boat as vehicle; during 2014 surveys were performed from fixed locations in Grado town, in Trieste town, and in a farm located between these two localities, in the immediate proximity to the mouth of Isonzo River.

40|$|Coal-fired {{power plants}} {{are a major}} source of {{emissions}} for a number of air pollutants including SO 2, NOx, particulate matter (PM), HCl, HF, and Hg amongst. In this work, intensive sampling campaigns were carried out at two power plants in Spain in 2007 and 2008 to study the fate of trace elements. Input and output flows were sampled in the coal combustion unit (boiler and Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP)) and in the Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system. Analyses of solid, water, gaseous, and PM samples, mass balance calculations and studies on partitioning for trace elements were conducted for the Pulverised Coal Combustion, FGD systems, and for the whole installation (PCC+FGD). Desulphurisation efficiency and emission abatement capacity for inorganic trace pollutants at both power plants was also assessed {{on the basis of these}} results. Results revealed (1) an unusual speciation of Hg in the outgoing gaseous stream of the flue gas desulphurisation (OUT-FGD) system at the two power plants: Hg 0 was the dominant Hg OUT-FGD species at PP 1, and Hg 2 + at PP 2; (2) a different retention of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> between the two sampling campaigns at the coal-fired power plant under co-combustion conditions: a higher retention of Hg 2 + in 2007 (73 %) than in 2008 (24 %) at PP 2; (3) a high concentration of trace pollutants and a distinctive behaviour of some elements in the waters of re-circulation to the scrubber at both power plants: Al, F, and SO 42 presented a higher concentration in the 2007 gypsum slurry than at PP 2 in 2008 and that at PP 1; and (4) a characteristic leaching behaviour of some elements from FGD-gypsum: insignificant leaching of heavy metals from FGD-gypsums was found at PP 2. The behaviour of Se proved to be the inverse. Laboratory experiments were conducted to reproduce the differences in speciation of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> OUT-FGD with respect to that detected at industrial scale. Thermodynamic modelling tools were employed to study the causes of the different retention and speciation of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> OUT-FGD and causes and effects of the high concentration of elements in the waters of re-circulation. Potentiometric titration experiments for FGD-gypsum samples were conducted to study the leaching behaviour of some elements from FGD-gypsum. Laboratory experiments confirmed Hg 0 as the dominant species in the OUT-FGD gas at PP 1, and Hg 2 + at PP 2. The <b>gaseous</b> speciation of <b>Hg</b> 2 + OUT-FGD at PP 2 in 2007 and in 2008 was caused by the high concentration of HCl and Hg in the IN-FGD gaseous stream. The unusual speciation of Hg 2 + OUT-FGD at PP 2 was probably due to the evaporation of HgCl 2 particles from the gypsum slurry in the OUT-FGD gas. The Al-additive used at PP 2 was responsible for the higher retention of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> in 2007 than in 2008. The enrichment of inorganic trace pollutants in the re-circulated water streams at PP 1 and PP 2 resulted from the continuous re-circulation of filtered water to the scrubber. The emission of the enriched elements by entraining particles and droplets of gypsum slurry OUT-FGD was the most significant consequence of such a fact. Thermodynamic modelling revealed that the Al-additive i) increased the concentration of F- in filtered waters at PP 2 in 2007, ii) gave rise to the differential behaviour and enrichment of Al, F, SO 42 -, Mg, and U in gypsum slurries and filtered waters, iii) led to the formation of SO 42 - complexes with metals increasing their concentrations in the gypsum slurry from PP 1 to PP 2 - 2008 and 2007, iv) caused the acidification of gypsum slurry from PP 2 via aluminium hydrolysis, and v) induced the protonation of the PP 2 FGD-gypsum surfaces. The relatively high leaching values of Se and the absence of significant leaching of heavy metals from the PP 2 FGD-gypsums resulted from the protonation of the surface of the FGD-gypsum and the formation of SO 4 -complexes...|$|R

40|$|Mercury-bearing {{material}} {{has been placed}} in municipal landfills from {{a wide array of}} sources including fluorescent lights, batteries, electrical switches, thermometers, and general waste. Despite its known volatility, persistence, and toxicity in the environment, the fate of mercury in landfills has not been widely studied. The nature of landfills designed to reduce waste through generation of methane by anaerobic bacteria suggests the possibility that these systems might also serve as bioreactors for the production of methylated mercury compounds. The toxicity of such species mandates the need to determine if they are emitted in municipal landfill gas (LFG). In a previous study, we had measured levels of <b>total</b> <b>gaseous</b> mercury (TGM) in LFG in the mg/m 3 range in two Florida landfills, and elevated levels of monomethyl mercury (MMM) were identified in LFG condensate, suggesting the possible existence of <b>gaseous</b> organic <b>Hg</b> compounds in LFG. In the current study, we measured TGM, Hg 0, and methylated mercury compounds directly in LFG from another Florida landfill. Again, TGM was in the mg/m 3 range, MMM was found in condensate, and this time we positively identified dimethyl mercury (DMM) in the LGF in the ng/m 3 range. These results identify landfills as a possible anthropogenic source of DMM emissions to air, and may help explain the reports of MMM in continental rainfall.

The Hg-polluted Elbe floodplain soils {{turn out to}} be a source of <b>gaseous</b> mercury via <b>Hg</b> volatilization from soil into the atmosphere. A modified field sampling method was used to measure <b>total</b> <b>gaseous</b> mercury (TGM) volatilization from three different sites at the Elbe Rivet: The modified setup had a reduced chamber size and contained an internal gas circulation system.

Sampled TGM amounts ranged between 0. 02 and 0. 63 ng (absolute), whereas the calculated Hg fluxes varied from 2. 0 to 63. 3 ng m(- 2) h(- 1).

The understanding {{of the way in which}} mercury released to the atmosphere is eventually incorporated into biota is of crucial importance not only for the polar regions but also for the marine environment in general. The world's oceans and seas are in fact both sources and sinks of Hg and although it appears that the atmosphere is the major transport/distribution medium for Hg, because most Hg emissions are to the atmosphere, oceans and seas also play an important role. Currently, however, a coordinated observational network for Hg does not exist. There are a number of state and national programs that are collecting atmospheric Hg data but the parameters monitored, the locations of the monitoring sites and the methods employed may prohibit their utility in assessing Hg long-trend variations. The large increase in mercury emissions in fast developing countries (i. e., China, India) over the last decade due primarily to a sharp increase in energy production from the combustion of coal are not currently reflected in the long-term measurements of <b>total</b> <b>gaseous</b> mercury in ambient air and in precipitation data at several continuous monitoring sites in North Europe and North America. The discrepancy between observed gaseous mercury concentrations (steady or decreasing) and global mercury emission inventories (increasing) is not yet clear however, could be at least in part accounted by the increasing in the potential oxidation of the atmosphere recently documented. Therefore, measurements of other key atmospheric constituents at the global monitoring sites are necessary for us to develop a better understanding of the global redistribution of Hg and to further refine model parameterizations of the key processes. The sharing of data from this network, allowing, in fact, access to comparable and long-term data from a wide array of locations for understanding temporal and spatial patterns of Hg transport, deposition and re-emission process producing thus data that will support the validation of regional and global atmospheric Hg models. This paper presents a detailed overview of atmospheric mercury measurements conducted in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres at several terrestrial sites (industrial, rural and remote) during the last decade as well as measurements performed over the world's ocean and seas and in Polar Regions with reference to the monitoring techniques and location of monitoring sites in most of the continents...|$|R
