50|$|Strange Famous Records {{started out}} in 1996 {{as a way for}} Sage Francis to release music. Originally this {{involved}} <b>tape</b> <b>dubbing</b> and photocopying covers. In 1999, while working at the radio station WRIU (90.3 FM), he was allowed access to the station's computers and CD-Rs replaced the tapes. The albums were sold locally, raising money to press CDs at a manufacturing plant.|$|R

25|$|As {{they became}} aimed at more casual users, fewer decks had {{microphone}} inputs. Dual decks became popular and incorporated into home entertainment systems {{of all sizes}} for <b>tape</b> <b>dubbing.</b> Although the quality would suffer each time a source was copied, there are no mechanical restrictions on copying from a record, radio, or another cassette source. Even as CD recorders are becoming more popular, some incorporate cassette decks for professional applications.|$|R

The Paley Center has acquired many lost episodes of classic television shows and has produced documentary features about the history and impact of television and radio. In recent years, the Center has sponsored advance viewing of the pilot episodes of each network's new programs.|$|R

50|$|Pressings {{were created}} {{in the same way}} as {{ordinary}} records. A master recording was cut into a blank wax or acetate disc. This was electroplated to produce a metal stamper from which a number of identical discs were pressed in shellac or vinyl in a record press. Although the earliest transcription discs were pressed in shellac, in the mid-1930s quieter vinyl compounds were substituted. These discs were used to distribute syndicated programming to individual radio stations. Their use for this purpose persisted long after the advent of magnetic tape recording because it was cheaper to cut and plate a master disc and press 100 identical high-quality discs than to make 100 equally high-quality <b>tape</b> <b>dubs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s, Todd Russell began {{hosting a}} late evening program called Reminiscing {{featuring}} modern recordings of popular {{songs from the}} 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. In 1973, Compeau decided to add some spice to the program by sprinkling in a few original period recordings. Since very few had been reissued on LP at this time, a call went out to collectors who loaned their original 78-rpm records to the radio station. The records were cleaned, repaired and brushed with distilled water before being transcribed to <b>tape.</b> <b>Dubbed</b> the [...] "new library of old 78's", these antique rarities were showcased each weeknight. (In 1974, host Todd Russell died {{and was replaced by}} Sandy Hoyt.) CHFI soon amassed a collection of over 3,500 period recordings and the reminiscing program became one of the station's biggest successes. As time went on, the modern recordings were phased out and the program featured mainly the period recordings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1988 and {{were one of the}} first {{official}} punk bands in the country. Their first recordings, [...] "Tryabva vsichko da priemam" [...] and [...] "Nai-vazhnoto", were for the 1988 film [...] "Pred praga" [...] (At the Doorstep). Later that year, they released a demo <b>tape</b> called Stariyat <b>dub.</b> The <b>tape</b> contained 8 songs.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, an English dubbed version, {{produced}} by Magnum Video <b>Tape</b> and <b>Dubbing</b> for international Japan Airlines flights {{at the request}} of Tokuma Shoten, was briefly screened in the United States by Streamline Pictures. Carl Macek, the head of Streamline, was disappointed with this dub, deeming it [...] "adequate, but clumsy". Following this, Tokuma allowed Streamline to dub their future acquisitions My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service. The Streamline dub of Castle in the Sky was released only on the first Japanese DVD release along with the Streamline dub of My Neighbor Totoro and The Castle of Cagliostro. The initial Japanese DVD release is now out of print and the subsequent rerelease contains the Disney dub instead.|$|R
25|$|In 2001 Pieter Bourke {{established}} a dub reggae duo, Secret Masters, {{in collaboration with}} club DJ, Brian Westbrook (a.k.a. Donnie Dub). Back in 1993 Bourke had met Westbrook, who provided cello on Eden's Healingbow. In 2004 Secret Masters' debut album, The Lost <b>Dub</b> <b>Tapes,</b> was released on their self-funded label, Master Tunes. For the 2009 follow up album, Words, Power, Sound, Westbrook travelled to Jamaica to record with local vocalists. The album includes two tracks featuring British reggae singer and DJ Tippa Irie.|$|R
40|$|The Nation's Forum Collection at the Library of Congress {{consists}} of 59 acoustic recordings of speeches, delivered without a public audience {{solely for the}} purposes of preserving the speakers' voices. With two exceptions, the reverse side of the original records consisted of patriotic music. The recordings can be placed into two distinct series, 1918 and 1919 - 1920. Devoted mainly to World War I topics, the 1918 series was not sold commercially but distributed only to political organizations and other groups on ten-inch discs. The notable exception was the commercially-distributed recording of "From the battlefield of France" by General John J. Pershing, backed by U. S. Ambassador James Gerard's "Loyalty. " Other speakers in the 1918 series were labor leader Samuel Gompers, Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, Senators Warren G. Harding and James Hamilton Lewis, Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, Speaker of the House Champ Clark, financier Frank A. Vanderlip, Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Treasury William McAdoo, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, and writer Richard A. Purdy. Of the fifteen 1918 recordings at the Library, the Pershing/Gerard record is an original shellac disc, 11 records are modern vinyl test pressings struck from original masters, and two recordings are audio <b>tape</b> <b>dubs.</b> CONT. : The 1919 - 1920 series was devoted primarily to the 1920 presidential election and postwar issues. Recordings in this series were released at a rate of two per month, one Republican and one Democrat, on twelve-inch discs for two dollars each. The 1919 - 1920 series includes Democratic speakers Franklin D. Roosevelt, William G. McAdoo, Mitchell Palmer, Stephen S. Wise, Bainbridge Colby, James W. Gerard, Champ Clark, Homer S. Cummings, Robert L. Owen, James M. Cox, George White, Newton D. Baker, and Gilbert M. Hitchcock; and Republican speakers Calvin Coolidge, Warren G. Harding, Henry Cabot Lodge, Leonard Wood, Nicholas Murray Butler, Will H. Hays, and Corinne Roosevelt Robinson. Indicating that the Nation's Forum project may also have planned to record foreign statesmen, the collection includes recordings of three speeches by Eamonn De Valera, who led the fight to establish the Republic of Ireland. The label of one De Valera recording states that with the sale of each record, a royalty of twenty-five cents would be paid to Dale Eireann, the revolutionary Irish Parliament. Of the Library's 44 recordings from the 1919 - 1920 series, 24 are original shellac discs, 17 are modern vinyl pressings from original masters, and three are audio <b>tape</b> <b>dubs.</b> Of the 53 sound discs, 25 are original shellac discs and 28 are modern vinyl test pressings struck from original masters, all of which are interfiled among Library of Congress disc collections. Includes two tape copies (RWC 5703; RXA 9459) made from discs not in Library of Congress collections. Summary from D.

The Nation's Forum was a historical society founded by St. Louis attorney Guy Golterman (1879 - 1967) to preserve the voices of prominent politicians and statesmen on recorded sound discs. With the endorsement of the State Department's Committee on Public Information and the Democratic and Republican National Committees, the Forum sought out speakers. The records were then pressed and distributed by a New York office of the Columbia Graphophone Company under the Nation's Forum label. Gift and purchase; various sources, including A. F. R. Lawrence, New York Public Library, and David Goldenberg. Finding aid (electronic) : Each recording is described in an automated finding aid that includes speaker, date, matrix number, subject indexing, and location number.

5000|$|As the {{government}} of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau continued reforming immigration policies, instituting social reforms, and promoting multiculturalism in Canada, a larger influx of Jamaicans immigrated into the Greater Toronto Area. One of Snow's neighbouring Jamaican families, the Browns, first introduced the teenager to reggae and began calling him [...] "Snow" [...] and [...] "Snow White". With {{the help of his}} neighbours, Snow began borrowing and ordering reggae <b>dub</b> <b>tapes</b> to perform over. After befriending Marvin Prince, Prince began referring to Snow with a phrased backronym meaning [...] "Superb Notorious Outrageous Whiteboy". Snow never claimed the title himself and simply continued to perform with the stage name of Snow.|$|R
5000|$|Dan and Dave became {{mesmerized by}} a VHS {{instructional}} tape made by American magician Brian Tudor known as Show Off. The three-volume tape introduced new card flourishes {{such as the}} [...] "Revolution Cut", {{a variation of the}} common [...] "Charlier Cut". Inspired, the twins released their own Show Off-like <b>tape</b> in 2001. <b>Dubbed</b> Pasteboard Animations, it was filmed as a low-fi home video with a tripod-held camcorder, edited on a dual VHS tape deck. Pasteboard Animations was printed by a local production company and sold for $25 per unit. With several hundred copies sold throughout the brothers time in high school, it was purchasable at magic conventions, hotel lobbies or online. The VHS tape is no longer in production, but was featured as bonus material on Dan and Dave's System DVD from 2004.|$|R
50|$|Originally, these {{monitors}} {{were used}} for commercial studios. Composite video first saw home use for <b>dubbing</b> <b>tapes</b> on VCRs. Early computers, both commercial and amateur, mostly used teleprinters for output; simple home models might simply display an array of lights to be interpreted as binary information. Later {{the concept of the}} TV Typewriter was born, effectively the video monitor used for digital information; this was implemented as dedicated monitors and as interfaces to the television receivers present in many homes. Many computers incorporated a display. From the late 1970s stand-alone composite monitors came into use, including by the Apple II, Commodore VIC 20/64/128, Atari, the IBM PC with CGA card, some computers compatible with it, and other home and business computers of the 1980s. These computers had composite video outputs, and sometimes composite monitors bundled with the systems. Some computer companies separately sold their own composite monitors for use with their computers.|$|R
