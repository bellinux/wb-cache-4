5|$|HD 154672 {{is located}} 65.8 parsecs (214.6 light years) away from Earth. It has an {{apparent}} magnitude (V) of 8.22, making the star too dim <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> Earth {{with the naked}} eye. The star is slightly dimmer than planet Neptune as perceived with the naked eye, which has an apparent magnitude of 7.78 at its brightest. The star's actual brightness is measured with an absolute magnitude of 4.12, {{similar to that of}} the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E

50|$|Fiberglass solar screens provide over 75% of UV protection, {{by using}} thicker strands and a closer mesh than regular 18x14 {{fiberglass}} window screening. There is some reduction in visibility, but {{this can be}} advantageous, since Solar Screens are difficult <b>to</b> <b>see</b> through <b>from</b> the outside, while easier <b>to</b> <b>see</b> through <b>from</b> the inside.|$|R

50|$|For an {{illusion}} artwork {{to be effective}} {{it has to be}} able <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> a variety of angles. Generally, illusions that are designed to be viewed from the side are best. If the illusion hangs on the wall you can move around it and see the image appear and disappear. The illusion can be viewed equally well from the right and wrong sides. An illusion designed <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> the bottom would have to hang very high on the wall as you would probably never be able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it <b>from</b> facing it directly. This type of illusion is best used on a flat surface.|$|R

50|$|Nuns {{transferred}} from Almenêches in 1736 but dispersed during the French Revolution. They reassembled at Vimoutiers in 1822 and finally returned to Argentan in 1830.

25|$|A {{study on}} the little green {{bee-eater}} suggests that these birds may be able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> {{the point of view}} of a predator. The brown-necked raven has been observed hunting lizards in complex cooperation with other ravens, demonstrating an apparent understanding of prey behavior. The California scrub jay hides caches of food and will later re-hide food if it was watched by another bird the first time, but only if the bird hiding the food has itself stolen food before from a cache. Such an ability <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> {{the point of view of}} another individual had previously been attributed only to the great apes and sometimes elephants. Such abilities form the basis for empathy.|$|E

25|$|Because of this distant, {{inclined}} orbit, Iapetus is {{the only}} large moon from which the rings of Saturn would be clearly visible; from the other inner moons, the rings would be edge-on and difficult <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>From</b> Iapetus, Saturn {{would appear to be}} 1°56' in diameter (four {{times the size of the}} Moon viewed from Earth).|$|E
25|$|Public {{transport}} ceased, {{apart from}} the London Underground, and the ambulance service stopped functioning, forcing users to transport themselves to hospital. The smog was so dense that it even seeped indoors, resulting in the cancellation or abandonment of concerts and film screenings as visibility decreased in large enclosed spaces, and stages and screens became harder <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> the seats. Outdoor sports events were also cancelled.|$|E
25|$|While Polish {{commentators}} saw Putin's {{participation in}} the ceremony held on April 7 as a symbolic gesture, they were touched when Putin and Tusk paid tribute and laid flowers {{at the site of}} the crash. Tusk knelt and briefly hid his face in his hands, then stood up as Putin patted him on the shoulder. The two hugged, then gave a joint press conference on the investigation into the crash. Polish commentators noted this was a human gesture, and a display of emotion that Poles had longed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> their eastern neighbours.|$|E
50|$|Maddur's {{marvelous}} Varadaraja temple is {{an early}} Chola or pre-Chola structure. Its 12 ft high Alialanatha deity is elaborately carved both in front and on the back with unusual features {{which has led to}} the Kannada saying 'Ella devara munde nodu Allalanathana hinde nodu' - 'All other idols are <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> the front but Allalanatha is <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> the back'.|$|R

25|$|There {{is always}} a judge sitting at C, {{although}} for upper-level competition, there can be up to seven judges at different places around the arena— at C, E, B, K, F, M, and H— which allows the horse {{to be seen in}} each movement from all angles. This helps prevent certain faults from going unnoticed, which may be difficult for a judge <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> only one area of the arena. For example, the horse's straightness going across the diagonal may be assessed by judges at M and H.|$|E

25|$|Ottoman {{casualties}} of World War I covers the {{civilian and military}} {{casualties of}} the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman Empire's casualties were enormous regardless of the method used in the calculations. The military casualties {{were published in the}} book , but the post-war partitioning of the Ottoman Empire made the estimation of the total civilian casualties harder. Also, it was not a novelty in world history <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> time to time people forced to move from one region to another, be it in the form of refugees, of population transfer, or of search for political asylum, but World War I and its aftermath caused migrations at unprecedented large scales, including the Ottoman Empire citizens.|$|E

500|$|Cott, like Thayer, {{argued that}} countershading would make animals hard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> the side, {{as they would}} [...] "fade into a ghostly elusiveness". Rowland notes that Cott is here {{reviewing}} Thayer's theory and [...] "reinforcing the view that a gradation in shading would act to eliminate the effects of ventral shadowing." [...] Kiltie measured {{the effect of the}} countershading of the grey squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis, showing that when the squirrel is horizontal the self-shadowing of the belly is partly concealed, but that when the squirrel is vertical (as when climbing a tree trunk) this effect did not occur.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to Earth and maximum apparent brightness in nearly 60,000 years, , magnitude −2.88, on August 27, 2003 at 9:51:13 UT. This occurred when Mars was one day from opposition and {{about three days}} from its perihelion, making it particularly easy <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>from</b> Earth. The last time it came so close is estimated to have been on September 12, 57,617 BC, the next time being in 2287. This record approach was only slightly closer than other recent close approaches.
