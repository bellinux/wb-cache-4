The model simulates a system that {{consists}} of a 13 -protofilament microtubule with “five-start” helical structure and a motor protein-coated bead that moves along one of the protofilaments of the microtubule, as in in vitro experiments. The microtubule is simulated using the lateral cap model, with substantial generalizations. For the new <b>terminal</b> <b>configurations</b> {{in the presence of}} the bead, rate constants for association and dissociation events of tubulin molecules are calculated by exploring the geometric similarities between different patterns of <b>terminal</b> <b>configurations</b> and by decomposing complex patterns into simpler patterns whose corresponding rate constants are known. In comparison with a previous model, in which simplifications are made about the structure of the microtubule and in which the microtubule can only depolymerize, the detailed structure of the microtubule is taken into account in the present model. Furthermore, the microtubule can be either polymerizing or depolymerizing. Force-velocity curves are obtained for both zero and non-zero tubulin guanosine 5 ′-triphosphate (GTP) concentrations. By analyzing the trajectory of the bead under different parameters, the condition for “run and pause” is analyzed, and the time scale of “run” and “pause” is found to be different for different motor proteins.

40|$|Passenger walking {{distance}} {{is a major}} consideration in determining the configuration of an airport terminal. Given {{the size of a}} terminal {{in terms of the number}} of aircraft gates, the mean passenger {{walking distance}} is derived based on: the fraction of arriving, departing and transferring (hub and non-hub) passengers; gate spacing; spacing requirement for aircraft maneuvering; and the terminal block dimensions. Pier, satellite, and pier-satellite terminal configurations are considered. It is assumed that all aircraft parking positions are capable of handling any type of aircraft and passengers are equally distributed among all the gate positions over the life of the facility. Two groups of hub transfers are defined to accommodate different levels of hub and spoke operations. The optimum terminal geometry in terms of the number of piers or satellites and their sizes, is obtained by minimizing the mean walking distance for all the passengers. The probability distribution of the walking distance of a passenger is generated by simulation. Given an acceptable walking distance, several statistical parameters that are suitable to compare the optimum geometries for different configurations are reported. It is shown that in most cases the lower and the upper bounds of the optimum number of piers or satellites are proportional to the square root of the total number of gates in the terminal. For a wide range of passenger mixes and numbers of gates, a semi-centralized pier configuration appears to be the best <b>terminal</b> <b>configuration</b> with respect to passenger walking. Guidelines for the selection of the best <b>terminal</b> <b>configuration</b> for non-hub, moderate-hub and all-hub (wayport) terminals are presented.

Current average age of transformers in Australia is around 25 years and there is a strong economical tendency to use them up to 50 years or more. As the transformers operate, they get degraded due to different loading and environmental operating stressed conditions. In today‘s competitive energy market with the penetration of distributed energy sources, the transformers are stressed more with minimum required maintenance. The modern asset management program tries to increase the usage life time of power transformers with prognostic techniques using condition indicators. In the case of oil filled transformers, condition monitoring methods based on dissolved gas analysis, polarization studies, partial discharge studies, frequency response analysis studies to check the mechanical integrity, IR heat monitoring and other vibration monitoring techniques are in use. In the current research program, studies have been initiated to identify the degradation of insulating materials by the electrical relaxation technique known as dielectrometry. Aging leads to main degradation products like moisture and other oxidized products due to fluctuating thermal and electrical loading. By applying repetitive low frequency high voltage sine wave perturbations in the range of 100 to 200 V peak across available terminals of power transformer, the conductive and polarization parameters of insulation aging are identified. An in-house novel digital instrument is developed to record the low leakage response of repetitive polarization currents in three <b>terminals</b> <b>configuration.</b> The technique is tested with known three transformers of rating 5 kVA or more.
