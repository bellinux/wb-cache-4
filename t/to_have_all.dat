5|$|During 2002, the Comanche program {{underwent}} heavy restructuring; consequently, {{the number}} of Comanches that were intended to be purchased was dropped down to 650 rotorcraft. At the time, the projected total cost for the full production of the Comanche in such numbers stood at $26.9 billion. Originally, he EMD phase had been planned to last for six years, as well as having involved {{a total of five}} Comanches being constructed to participate in the testing regime. During 2003, production on the third RAH-66, which was intended to be the first EMD-conformant helicopter, was started. Subsequently, eight RAH-66s were to be constructed for operational testing purposes. As planned, the initial production RAH-66s were to be completed to a Block I configuration, which would have included the majority of the rotorcraft's planned weapons and sensors. From the 16th Comanche onwards, deliveries would have been made to the Block II standard, which was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> of the planned capabilities included.|$|E

The 49ers' Million Dollar Backfield is the only full-house backfield <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> four of its members enshrined in the Hall. Perry's jersey number 34 was retired by the 49ers in 1971, and he was a charter member of the San Francisco 49ers Hall of Fame in 2009. Following his death in 2011, the team honored Perry that season by wearing helmet decals with his number 34 on them.|$|E
5|$|In April 1945, the 77th Division {{was ordered}} to seize the island of Ie Shima in the Ryukyu islands so that the U.S. Army could use the island's airfields to support assaults on Okinawa and other islands in Japan. During the six-day battle to secure the island, 4,706 Japanese {{soldiers}} and civilians were killed, while 172 Americans were killed, 902 were wounded, and 46 were missing. During the battle, famed war correspondent Ernie Pyle was killed by machine gun fire. Major General Bruce and his men buried Pyle on the island, later erecting a monument to him. Despite {{the fact that the}} Japanese had tried to destroy the airfields, army engineers were able <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> taxiways and runways fully operational by mid-May.|$|E

She was president of the Scottish Home Industries Association, a charity which encouraged Scottish women to work profitably from home making plaid or other items of needlework and the like. In this way women, especially widowed mothers, remained in their homes able to care for their often large families while still earning an income.|$|E

In 1979 the amusement park was leased to the main concessionaire, Alf Wadbrooke, although by then it was only open at weekends during the summer season. The long-promised restoration of the Scenic Railway had not happened and the Water Chute had closed. In August 1980, Wadbrooke was given notice to close down the park by 26October 1980 and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> his equipment removed by February 1981.|$|E

In addition to Svalbard, tracking and telemetry stations were built on the Falkland Islands, in Fairbanks, Alaska and in Redu, Belgium. France actively opposed the Svalbard location, as Norway was {{not a member of}} ESRO.

5|$|Since June 2009, {{when two}} Red Line trains {{collided}} and killed nine people {{due in part}} to malfunctions in the ATC system, all Metro trains have been manually operated. The current state of manual operation has led to heavily degraded service, with new manual requirements such as absolute blocks, speed restrictions, and end-of-platform stopping leading to increased headways between trains, increased dwell time, and worse on-time performance. Metro originally planned <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> trains be automated again by 2017, but those plans were shelved in early 2017 in order to focus on more pressing safety and infrastructure issues.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart {{also has}} three {{multiplayer}} modes; Mario Kart GP, Match Race and Battle Mode. The multiplayer modes support two {{players and the}} second player uses {{the bottom half of}} the screen which is used as a map in the single player modes. Mario Kart GP is the same as in single player, the only difference being that there are now two human controlled and six computer-controlled drivers. Match Race involves the two players going head to head on a track of their choice without any opponents. In Battle Mode, the two players again go head to head, but this time in one of four dedicated Battle Mode courses. Each player starts with three balloons around their kart which can be popped by power-ups fired by the other player. The first player <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> three of their balloons popped loses.|$|E
5|$|The 49ers' Million Dollar Backfield is {{regarded}} as one of the best backfields in NFL history, and is the only full-house backfield <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> four of its members enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. By virtue of their memberships in the pro hall of fame, all four were automatically inducted as charter members of the San Francisco 49ers Hall of Fame in 2009. Longtime 49ers coach Bill Walsh co-authored a book about the backfield in 2000 entitled The Million Dollar Backfield: The San Francisco 49ers in the 1950s.

5|$|The only {{significant}} Celestial Master text that survives from the Hanzhong period is the Xiang'er commentary to the Dao De Jing. This text gives {{insight into the}} Celestial Masters’ physiological beliefs, meditation practices and rituals. In addition, the commentary reinterprets the Dao De Jing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> of humanity as its intended audience, instead of only a sage. The Taiping Jing, a text attributed to the Yellow Turbans, was not a Celestial Master text, but reflects {{at least in part}} some Celestial Master thought and practice. A later text written in 255 CE, known as the Commands and Admonitions for the Families of the Great Dao was composed to a divided Celestial Master community after the dispersal of the Hanzhong population. While written in the persona of Zhang Lu, it is probable that this text was not written by him, as he had probably died by 255 CE.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, the Ecuadoran flag still shares some {{similarity}} {{with the}} flags of Colombia and Venezuela. All three flags use the yellow, {{blue and red}} tricolor, but {{that is where the}} similarities end. In a decree passed in Colombia in 1934, the ratio of the stripes were set at 2:1:1 and the flag ratio was set at 2:3, similar to the present Ecuador flag. However, the coat of arms is only changed {{in the middle of the}} flag when it is used by government officials or by military forces. For Venezuela, the basic design was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> three strips even vertically, unlike those of Colombia and Ecuador. Since 1863, Venezuela decided to change their flag with white stars instead of a coat of arms. A coat of arms was not added to the national flag 1954, then changed again in 2006 to add another star and alter the coat of arms. The position of the coat of arms on the Venezuelan flag also differs from Ecuador and Colombia by placing the arms at the very top hoist (left) side of the flag instead of in the center.|$|E

On March 28, 2014, Guerrero, Euforia and Niebla Roja {{defeated}} Los Estetas del Aire (Máscara Dorada, Místico and Valiente) for the CMLL World Trios Championship. On August 29, Guerrero defeated La Sombra {{in the finals}} to win the 2014 Universal Championship, becoming the first two-time winner of the tournament. On September 19, Guerrero lost to Atlantis in the main event of the CMLL 81st Anniversary Show and thus was forced to unmask {{for the first time}} in his career and reveal his birth name; José Gutiérrez Hernández. In January 2015, Guerrero returned to Japan to take part in the Fantastica Mania 2015 tour, during which he defeated Atlantis in a rematch. On February 13, Los Guerreros Laguneros lost the CMLL World Trios Championship to Sky Team (Místico, Valiente and Volador Jr.).

Margi goes to see Scott alone but an angry Terri arrives. The two argue {{with each other and}} end up accidentally killing Scott. Margi goes to Mulder, telling him that Terri is responsible for the murders, while Terri goes to see Scully and tells her the opposite. The agents call each other and bring both girls to the police station, where the place starts shaking and all the guns go off on their own. Mulder locks the girls in a room together and their power goes away once the clock ticks midnight. When the town mob and Detective White finally see Terri and Margi as the culprits, Spitz claims it was the work of Satan, oblivious to the cosmic alignment's energy. Mulder and Scully drive home, arguing again over directions; when Scully defiantly runs a stop sign, Mulder notifies her but she tells him to shut up, which he does.|$|E

The team worked together without too many problems {{in the first round}} as they defeated the team of El Hijo de Fantasma and El Felino, but stumbled in the second round as they lost to eventual tournament winners La Sombra and Volador, Jr. On April 26, 2013, at the Arena Mexico 57th Anniversary Show Averno defeated Místico La Nueva Era to win the vacant Mexican National Welterweight Championship. On September 13 at CMLL's 80th Anniversary Show, Averno defeated Blue Panther in a submission only Lucha de Apuestas match, which forced Blue Panther <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> his hair shaved off as a result.
