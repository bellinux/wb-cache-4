5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot <b>that</b> <b>definitely</b> belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.|$|E

It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and <b>that</b> <b>definitely</b> plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that out of her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|E
25|$|The first {{surviving}} document <b>that</b> <b>definitely</b> uses these dots is {{also the}} first surviving Arabic papyrus (PERF 558), dated April, 643. The dots did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts like the Qur'an were frequently memorized; this practice, which survives even today, probably arose partly to avoid the great ambiguity of the script, and {{partly due to the}} scarcity of books in times when printing was unheard-of in the area and every copy of every book had to be written by hand.|$|E

25|$|In the {{mathematical}} discipline of set theory, {{there are many}} ways of describing specific countable ordinals. The smallest ones can be usefully and non-circularly expressed in terms of their Cantor normal forms. Beyond that, many ordinals of relevance to proof theory still have computable ordinal notations. However, {{it is not possible to}} decide effectively whether a given putative ordinal notation is a notation or not (for reasons somewhat analogous to the unsolvability of the halting problem); various more-concrete ways of defining ordinals <b>that</b> <b>definitely</b> have notations are available.|$|E
25|$|Papebroch, the Bollandist {{editor of}} the Acta Sanctorum, was {{answered}} by the Carmelite Sebastian of St. Paul, who made such serious charges against the orthodoxy of his opponent's writings that {{the very existence of}} the Bollandists was threatened. The peril was averted, however. In 1696 a decree of Juan Tomás de Rocaberti, archbishop of Valencia and inquisitor-general of the Holy Office, forbade all further controversies between the Carmelites and Jesuits. Two years later, on November 20, 1698, Pope Innocent XII issued a brief <b>that</b> <b>definitely</b> ended the controversy on pain of excommunication, and placed all writings in violation of the brief on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.|$|E
25|$|Whereas DNA {{methylation}} is {{not necessary}} per se for transcriptional silencing, it is thought nonetheless to represent a “locked” state <b>that</b> <b>definitely</b> inactivates transcription. In particular, DNA methylation appears critical {{for the maintenance of}} mono-allelic silencing in the context of genomic imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. In these cases, expressed and silent alleles differ by their methylation status, and loss of DNA methylation results in loss of imprinting and re-expression of Xist in somatic cells. During embryonic development, few genes change their methylation status, at the important exception of many genes specifically expressed in the germline. DNA methylation appears absolutely required in differentiated cells, as knockout of any of the three competent DNA methyltransferase results in embryonic or post-partum lethality. By contrast, DNA methylation is dispensable in undifferentiated cell types, such as the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, primordial germ cells or embryonic stem cells. Since DNA methylation appears to directly regulate {{only a limited number of}} genes, how precisely DNA methylation absence causes the death of differentiated cells remain an open question.|$|E
5000|$|On release, Famitsu {{magazine}} {{scored the}} Super Famicom {{version of the}} game a 23 out of 40. GamePros Bro' Buzz called it [...] "an interesting war simulation <b>that's</b> <b>definitely</b> for mature gamers with a yen for history, a mind for numbers, and {{plenty of time to}} kill."

[...] When asked about the sound of the album, Matisyn commented “I think it’s similar, that moody kinda style, <b>that’s</b> <b>definitely</b> what we are going for with this new record. I wanted to do a darker record musically, but a little more positive lyrically.” ...|$|R
25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so <b>that</b> <b>definitely</b> keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

[...] If the dating is accurate (480–470BC) the Archaic style continued in Lycia for some time after it had become unfashionable in Greece. [...] The sculptures may have been carved by Ionian Greek craftsmen, if not they are heavily influenced by them.

500|$|The {{earliest}} known match <b>that</b> <b>definitely</b> involved county teams, or teams {{using the}} names of counties, was Kent v Surrey at Dartford Brent on Wednesday, 29 June 1709. This was advertised in the Post Man the previous Saturday and played for a stake of £50. From this time, in the 112th season since the sport's earliest definite reference in 1597, there are references to counties in use as team names although it is generally believed that the earliest [...] "inter-county matches" [...] were really inter-parish matches involving two villages {{on either side of}} a county boundary. Dartford was an important club {{in the first half of}} the 18th century and its team at this time featured William Bedle. The match is the earliest known mention of Dartford Brent as a venue.|$|E

[...] The single [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] was argued to have transformed [...] "the once tomboy into a sexy grown woman".

500|$|The year 2004 saw {{the release}} of four films {{featuring}} Jolie. She first starred in the thriller Taking Lives as an FBI profiler summoned to help Montreal law enforcement hunt down a serial killer. The film received mixed reviews; The Hollywood Reporter critic Kirk Honeycutt concluded, [...] "Jolie plays a role <b>that</b> <b>definitely</b> feels like something she has already done, but she does add an unmistakable dash of excitement and glamour." [...] Jolie made a brief appearance as a fighter pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, a science fiction adventure shot entirely with actors {{in front of a}} bluescreen, and voiced her first family film, the DreamWorks animation Shark Tale. Her supporting role as Queen Olympias in Oliver Stone's Alexander, about the life of Alexander the Great, was met with mixed reception, particularly concerning her Slavic accent. Commercially, the film failed in North America, which Stone attributed to disapproval of the depiction of Alexander's bisexuality, but it succeeded internationally, for a total revenue of $167.3 million.|$|E
500|$|Hartley was reprimanded by the {{stewards}} {{because he}} was deemed responsible for causing the crash between himself and Wainwright.

Hartley revealed {{that he did not}} feel pressure because of his large advantage upfront but did not apportion blame for the accident, calling it [...] "a shocking moment and it is a true shame." [...] Wainwright apportioned blame on Hartley for causing the incident, saying he was not aware the driver was near him until the crash occurred. He felt Hartley was attempting to pass him and move across the track to rejoin onto the racing line for the next turn. His co-driver Carroll observed the incident and stated Hartley had not left enough space which had been displayed on television. He said it was [...] "a very unfortunate accident and one <b>that</b> <b>definitely</b> could have been avoided. Definitely not our fault."

[...] He added, [...] "There isn't a ton of depth, but the show doesn't pretend to be anything but a fun, sci-fi romp around the galaxy."
