40|$|One of {{the logical}} {{effects of the}} {{principle}} of asymmetric dualism of the linguistic sign is that languages are incomparable, at least, what regards separate grammatical forms, even if these forms are of one and the same type. A certain correlation between languages can only be found at the universal level, {{in the form of a}} potential of formal means and grammatical integrals, which unite elementary meanings (atomic senses). In some sense, one can find, in any language of the world, and in the shape of underformed, non-grammatized, potential oppositions, atomic (elementary) meanings, which appear as grammatized in some other language. The majority of oppositions between forms get defragmentated in language contrasts. More universal units for comparing languages are found either at a lower (atomic senses), or at a higher (grammatical-contextual complex) level. If 'full grammar' is considered, it is likely to suppose that all elementary senses of a universal grammatical integral find their representation in any language, within the grammatical-contextual complex. Thus, various languages complement each other within the framework of the universal human language. Separate grammatical forms of particular languages also complement each other within the framework of universal grammatical concepts. Grammatical integrals taken as wholes, as well as types of grammatical-contextual complexes are not just chaotic sets of occasional senses. In interlingual contrasts, if one of the languages is 'perfect-devoid' ('article-devoid', etc.), the relevant functional <b>types</b> <b>retreat</b> to the potential, covert domain.

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop rating scales that would measure the affordances of the home, neighbourhood, school and town centre for adolescents. The affordances measured related to two developmental needs in adolescence, the need for places of social interaction and for places of retreat. Five hundred and thirty-nine adolescents aged between 11 and 16 years rated the number of places available for 34 different affordances in each of the environments. The neighbourhood, school and town centre all supported both social interaction and retreat behaviours. The home environment did not support social interaction behaviours; it instead provided affordances for two different <b>types</b> of <b>retreat,</b> retreat involving close friends and retreat involving seeking out security. Gender and age differences in scale scores and how often the environments are used were also explored. In conclusion, utilising Gibson's theory of affordances enabled a systematic comparison of the affordances of adolescents' key environments to be carried out.

40|$|Headward and {{downward}} erosion near glacier sources, {{at rates}} exceeding fluvial erosion, {{is important in}} recent discussions of orogen development and the limits to relief. This relates to {{a long history of}} debate on how the form of glacial cirques develops, which can be advanced by relating shape to size in large data sets. For 260 cirques in Wales, this confirms different rates of enlargement in the three dimensions: faster in length than in width, and slower in vertical dimension whether expressed as overall height range, axial height range or wall height. Maximum gradient, plan closure and number of cols increase with overall size. This allometric development applies over different cirque types, regions and rock <b>types.</b> Headwall <b>retreat,</b> often by collapse following glacial erosion at the base, is faster than downward erosion. Welsh cirques form a scale-specific population and, as in other regions, size variables follow Gaussian distributions on a logarithmic scale. As in England, width commonly exceeds length. Vertical dimensions correlate with length more than with width. Cirque form varies with geology, but also with relief as both vary between mountain groups. The main contrast is between larger, better-developed cirques and higher relief on volcanic rocks in the north-west, and smaller, less-developed cirques and lower relief on sedimentary rocks in the south...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecosystems}} in the Arctic {{region are}} known to be very sensitive to climate changes. The accelerated warming for the past several decades has profoundly influenced the lives of the native populations and ecosystems in the Arc­tic. Given that the Köppen-Trewartha (K-T) climate classifi­cation is based on reliable variations of land-surface types (especially vegetation), this study used the K-T scheme to evaluate climate changes and their impact on vegetation for the Arctic (north of 50 °N) by analyzing observations as well as model simulations for the period 1900 – 2099. The models include 16 fully coupled global climate mod­els from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment. By the end of this century, the annual-mean surface temperature averaged over Arctic land re­gions is projected to increase by 3. 1, 4. 6 and 5. 3 °C under the Special Report on Emissions Scenario (SRES) B 1, A 1 b, and A 2 emission scenarios, respectively. Increasing tem­perature favors a northward expansion of temperate cli­mate (i. e., Dc and Do in the K-T classification) and boreal oceanic climate (i. e., Eo) types into areas previously cov­ered by boreal continental climate (i. e., Ec) and tundra; and tundra into areas occupied by permanent ice. The tundra region is projected to shrink by − 1. 86 × 106 km 2 (− 33. 0 %) in B 1, − 2. 4 × 106 km 2 (− 42. 6 %) in A 1 b, and − 2. 5 × 106 km 2 (− 44. 2 %) in A 2 scenarios {{by the end of this}} century. The Ec climate <b>type</b> <b>retreats</b> at least 5 ° poleward of its present lo­cation, resulting in − 18. 9, − 30. 2, and − 37. 1 % declines in ar­eal coverage under the B 1, A 1 b and A 2 scenarios, respec­tively. The temperate climate types (Dc and Do) advance and take over the area previously covered by Ec. The area covered by Dc climate expands by 4. 61 × 106 km 2 (84. 6 %) in B 1, 6. 88 × 106 km 2 (126. 4 %) in A 1 b, and 8. 16 × 106 km 2 (149. 6 %) in A 2 scenarios. The projected redistributions of K-T climate types also differ regionally. In northern Europe and Alaska, the warming may cause more rapid expansion of temperate climate types. Overall, the climate types in 25, 39. 1, and 45 % of the entire Arctic region are projected to change by the end of this century under the B 1, A 1 b, and A 2 scenarios, respectively. Because the K-T climate classi­fication was constructed on the basis of vegetation types, and each K-T climate type is closely associated with certain prevalent vegetation species, the projected large shift in cli­mate types suggests extensive broad-scale redistribution of prevalent ecoregions in the Arctic...|$|R

Time-series presentations for the period 1978 to 2008 of remotely sensed data and soil survey data were used to assess the extent of the changes. The study revealed soil degradation under all land cover types and in all soil <b>types,</b> grassland <b>retreat</b> (− 15 per cent), swampland retreat (− 45 per cent) and increases in the area of farmland (+ 19 per cent), sand land (+ 1450 per cent) and alkaline land (+ 52 per cent). Depletion of the SOC pool occurred in swampland (− 64 per cent) both because of the decrease in the area of swampland and because of a decrease in SOC density (− 34 per cent). An increase in the SOC pool occurred in alkaline land because of the increase in the area and also because of an increase in SOC density (+ 297 per cent), but there was little change in the SOC pool in farmland because the increase in area was largely offset by a decrease in SOC density (− 14 per cent). The decrease in the STN pool was substantial (− 44 per cent), with the largest contributor being the decrease in swamplands (− 74 per cent), partly because of the decrease in the area of swampland and partly because of a decrease in STN density (− 52 per cent). Large decreases in the STN pool also occurred in farmland (− 22 per cent) and grassland (− 41 per cent). The direct impacts of construction associated with the expansion of the oil industry were overshadowed by indirect impacts such as interference with water flows and water levels resulting in salinisation of soil. The study also revealed that land cover changes are much more dynamic than a simple analysis would reveal, and because of lag times in the loss of SOC, soil degradation will continue even if land cover changes cease.

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that Svalbard glaciers have retreated and thinned since the Little Ice Age. The analysis of glacial landforms and sediment deposits in the terrestrial and marine environments permits {{the reconstruction of the}} temporal and spatial variability of recent deglaciations. This study is founded on the analysis and interpretation of a geomorphological map (1 : 10000) of the foreland of Nordenskiöldbreen (inner Billefjorden, Svalbard). The map covers an area of ca. 43 km 2 and is constructed from a combination of field observations and remotely sensed imagery from both the terrestrial and marine environments. Landforms are classified into six genetic categories: (1) subglacial, (2) ice-marginal, (3) supraglacial, (4) proglacial, (5) periglacial and (6) coastal. Glacier front positions from 1896 to present are reconstructed using historical data, oblique and vertical aerial imagery and LANDSAT and ASTER imagery. The preservation of the landform record differs between the terrestrial and marine archive. Previous studies of this region have focused on either marine or terrestrial archives and have failed to capture the complexities of the Nordenskiöldbreen forefield. As a result, pre-existing landsystem models are not applicable to Nordenskiöldbreen. The results of this investigation suggest Nordenskiöldbreen has been a dynamic glacier with components of all Svalbard <b>type</b> glaciers. The <b>retreat</b> pattern reconstructed in this thesis indicates that water depth and bedrock pinning points (sills) {{played an important role in}} the antecedent stability of Nordenskiöldbreen. Additionally, existing landsystem models fail to capture the complexity of glaciers with a combined terrestrial and marine terminus such as Nordenskiöldbreen. The application of these models should therefore be carefully considered when investigating glaciers with a mixed terminus. This study contributes to an improved understanding of Svalbard glaciers and their response to recent climate fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Westville, 2008. The {{aesthetic}} {{appeal of}} beaches has made coastal properties prime sites for development. However, this {{development has been}} mismanaged and is within the littoral active zone. Beaches retreat landwards as sea levels rise, but with current development trends, beaches are trapped in a coastal squeeze. Climate-change predictions include an increase in frequency and heightened intensity of storms, which can cause significant erosion. This study aimed to determine the ecological implications of sea-level rise and storms for beaches in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), using geographic information systems (GIS) and beach sampling methods. The beaches were mapped in terms of physical and biological attributes. Spatial trends in these attributes showed that the coastline can be split into three – the northern, central and southern regions. Although 25 % of the coastline is protected by marine reserves, these {{are located in the}} Delagoa bioregion: 28 macrofauna species in the Natal bioregion are not protected. Storm impacts for beaches can be heterogeneous, depending on local coastal features, e. g., nearshore reef and sand dunes, and represented a temporary disturbance to macrofauna communities. A GIS-based coastal recession model was derived from Bruun’s rule, and applied for different scenarios of sea-level rise and coastal development. Coastal squeeze is concern, particularly in the southern region. Further, the 10 -m elevation contour was not completely effective as a setback line, even for a low sea-level rise scenario. The coastal recession model was validated using data from a real event in KZN, where sea level rose temporarily by ~ 1. 0 m. The model performed well, although the calibration possibly did not span a wide enough range of beach morphodynamic <b>types,</b> and under-predicted <b>retreat</b> for dissipative beaches. It was concluded that the Natal bioregion needs marine reserves, and that higher resolution spatial data are required for accurate beach modeling and the south coast railway line should be relocated proactively. Guidelines for sandy beach systematic conservation planning were outlined, and seated in a conceptual framework of managing beaches for resilience. Application of the proposed recommendations and frameworks could aid in determining a way forward in integrated coastal zone management for KZN, {{in the face of the}} uncertainties associated with climate change...|$|R
40|$|The {{narrative}} research {{journey and}} pilgrimage into and epistemological {{reflection on the}} relevance of the Benedictine, Franciscan and Taizé monastic-mystic traditions (associative spirituality) for retreat within the Dutch Reformed tradition (disassociate spirituality) began because of a passion for, an interest in retreat and because of lack of research done on the subject. The research developed in story form as a participative active process of story development, interpretation, and reflection in which the researcher and the research subject as valued co-researchers (co-pilgrims) constructed a shared reality and new story together. Consequently, the observations and experiences reflected on may tell just as much about the researcher as about the action of retreat and the research participants. The action of retreat was not approached in a neutral, objective stance but with self-awareness, particular presuppositions, and a postmodern philosophical mindset with ideological-critical, deconstructive and inclusive thought processes. The research problem was viewed as a narrative situation of action, explained by means of empirical research, and interpreted via epistemological reflection and theological theories. The focus has not been on new or adapted theory formulation, hypotheses, or “conclusions” as such but on the empiric interaction between the experiences of Mystery (noumenon), the Jesus narrative, stories of the co-pilgrims, monastic traditions, Dutch Reformed tradition, the researchers’ own story, and those who might read the thesis. A potential amplifying or expanding of the repertoire of existing options and meanings were viewed as a possibility in the creative development of a new reality or research story. The aim was to listen to, understand, and interpret qualitatively the subjective dimension and experience of the reality (story/ies) of retreat as a situation where pilgrims (from different traditions and spiritualities) were in relation with God, self and others. The research journey took me into the life world of the monastic-mystic traditions and my own internal dialectics and story within a Dutch Reformed context. From here arose questions, engagement, and re-engagement with the monastic traditions and a new story. The concern was the beliefs and practices of the retreatants (co pilgrims) under study as beings in real-life human experiential reality, taking seriously their concerns, expressions of belief, practice, perceptions, and stories. The data from the empirical encounter was subsequently investigated, mapped with the major themes and interests highlighted and reflected on in the process. The main themes and focal points that were identified and researched were: [...] The lives and stories of St. Benedict, St. Francis, and Br. Roger, their respective communities’ monastic-mystic spirituality, the way these traditions approach retreat and the way they live or express their respective monastic rules or orders in comparison with the Dutch Reformed traditions’ retreat narrative. [...] The main elements of Monastic retreat namely silence, solitude, lectio divina in facilitating an awareness of God and the mystery of God as part of the journey to the inner mountain, ever deeper into his presence. [...] Different <b>types</b> of <b>retreat</b> and especially the experience of monastic retreat, the experience of holy places (desert spirituality) as places saturated by prayer, Eucharist and the community of pilgrims, and retreat as pilgrimage experience. [...] Retreat as ritual following a rite of passage structure of separation, marginality and reincorporation focusing on structure and anti-structure (power of liminality) as helpful tool of analysis and framework for planning of retreat.

40|$|Thermo-erosion causes 74 % of the {{continental}} coastline in the Laptev Sea region that consist of unconsolidated permafrost deposits of Ice Complex <b>type</b> to continuously <b>retreat</b> during the short time window of the subarctic summer. Insights into past and future landscape dynamics depend on understanding the spatially and temporally variable intensities of coastal erosion and its interaction with endogenous and exogenous forcing factors. Coastal thermo-erosion includes two related processes that work temporally and quantitatively differently together. Cliff top erosion (thermo-denudation) and cliff bottom erosion (thermo-abrasion) are coupled, since the entire coastal cliff profile is super-saturated with respect to ice, largely due to thick syngenetic ice wedges. These erosion types result in annual land loss of up to 0. 5 hectares per kilometer of coastline and mobilize deep permafrost organic carbon, in response to seasonal environmental changes in the Arctic. Thermo-abrasion and denudation vary in intensity according to the seasonal cycle. Thermo-abrasion is only active during the open water season, while thermo-denudation can proceed throughout the summer. In order to systematically analyze these seasonal thermo-erosion dynamics, we use a set of contemporary very high resolution satellite imagery, repeated geodetic surveys {{in the field and}} historical aerial photographs. Particular emphasis in our change detection study was put on stereophotogrammetric digital terrain modelling and subsequent ortho-rectification in order to enable accurate coastline position change measurements over multidecadal to seasonal time scales and to provide current and historical quantifications of planimetric land loss and volumetric coastal erosion. Across a variety of study sites well distributed along more than 200 km of the Laptev Sea mainland coast, observed recent erosion rates for the last 1 to 4 years were almost twice as rapid as the long-term mean of around 2 m per year. Based on normalization of diverse seasonal and interannual erosion rates, our findings at Muostakh Island demonstrate that the currently higher intensities of coastal erosion are controlled at least in part by the increasing open water season and summer air temperatures. We found that under current hydrometeorological conditions, as seasons lengthen and permafrost warms, thermo-abrasion and thermo-denudation are increasingly coupled, increasing the effective mass flux resulting from erosion. Our results also suggest that higher rates were accompanied by a higher frequency of the thermo-erosion cycle that causes coastal cliffs to pass various stages of morphological evolution, which in turn have different impacts on eroded volumes and subsequent mass displacement in the coastal zone...|$|R

I investigated occurrences of bear/human incidents over a five year period in Lake Tahoe to examine the geographic distribution of incidents, define hotspots and assess whether specific spatial features influenced the likelihood of a bear incident. Restaurants, schools, and trash transfer sites were used as a proxy for attractants, streams were used as a potential travel corridor, wetlands were considered preferred habitat and 3 classes of forest (coniferous, hardwood and mixed) were considered good cover <b>types</b> to aid <b>retreat</b> after attempting to leave a developed area. Locations for incidents from 2007 - 2011 were gathered from five different law enforcement and NGOs. All incidents were cleaned and geocoded (ArcGISlO). A total of 2807 incidents were used for analysis. Euclidean distance to each incident was taken to each geospatial feature. Over 17, 000 bear/human conflicts were reported over the 5 year period, with several agencies not reporting for the full five years. Workload is not distributed equally across agencies, and the NGO operating in the area appears to deal with the bulk of the bear/human conflict. The hotspot analysis showed that especially the north shore had several areas where conflict appears to be most intense. Proximity to the potential attractants did not increase the probability of incidents. Most noteworthy is that proximity to wetlands and streams increased the probability of bear/human conflict. Wetlands demonstrated the strongest association in generating bear conflict. proximity to streams or wetlands increased the likelihood of a bear conflict. Abstract Chapter 2 : Assessment of Spatial Usage of Urban Black Bears (Ursus americanus) in Lake Tahoe (CA) Wildlife moving into urban areas is a phenomenon observed globally. Generally, urban wildlife is considered to have a lesser ecological value than their wild counterparts. This is particularly the case when animals are thought to be reliant on garbage and other human provided food sources. Urban bears are perceived as having reduced ecosystems services when assumed that they spend the majority of their time in urban areas pursuing anthropogenic food sources. American black bears (Ursus american us) were outfitted with GPS radio telemetry in the California Lake Tahoe area to examine their use of urban and wild areas. Several urban definitions were assessed to better understand what definition is most appropriate. GPS telemetry data was used to understand home range size and habitat use. Regardless of definition, so-called urban bears spent less than 50...|$|R
40|$|Streambank retreat is {{a natural}} fluvial process altered {{by a variety of}} direct and {{indirect}} human activities that is controlled by interactions between a range of hydrological, geomorphological and vegetative factors. These may include climate, discharge, bed slope, bank material and stratigraphy, bank height, bank angle, curvature and the various attributes of bank vegetation. There has been considerable progress in our understanding of these processes and their interactions in temperate regions, but our knowledge of bank retreat in tropical streams is relatively poor. Few quantitative studies of bank retreat or erosion are published for the tropics. In particular, there is a paucity of data on vegetation characteristics, their interaction with retreat-causing variables and their contribution to bank retreat or erosion. This thesis addresses these issues by investigating the response of 34 sites in three north-eastern Queensland streams (2 wet tropics, 1 wet-dry tropics) to the 2003 / 2004 wet season, observing rates and <b>types</b> of bank <b>retreat</b> and the suite of driving forces that were responsible for this retreat. Variations exist in streambank retreat rate between climatological regions. Banks of streams tropical environments tend to retreat at greater rates because they experience greater specific stream power, more frequent bankfull events and higher annual flows than streams in other regions. Global trends also exist between bank retreat and stream width and drainage area. However, no global trends appear to exist between bank retreat relative to channel size and stream width. Modelling retreat of the study banks against climatological regime showed that they retreated at equivalent rates to streams of similar size elsewhere but at lower rates than streams from similar climatological regimes. These comparisons are only valid as far as datasets of differing quality and quantity allow. Analysis of 2003 / 2004 wet season hydrology suggested that these low rates could be partly attributed to the high recurrence possibility of the wet season. Variations in streambank retreat rate also exist within climatological regimes. The largely heterogeneous nature of streams and associated variability of dominant erosion driving forces is responsible for this variation. This study did not identify any direct relationship between streambank retreat and any measured variable. However, thresholds existed with regard to specific stream power (> 130 W m- 2), curvature (3. 2 m) and bank angle (> 45 º), which explained the variability of bank retreat rates. Bank retreat was low until these thresholds were passed. When these thresholds were exceeded, retreat rates were more variable, with the steep banks retreating faster than more gradually sloped banks. There was no direct relationship between root area ratio (RAR) at any point on the bank and bank retreat. However, an exponential decay relationship existed between RAR at depths of 3 m and maximum bank angle: banks occupied by dense basal root networks were less steep, indicating an indirect relationship between bank retreat and basal RAR. Variations in erosion at different depths down a bank can ultimately control overall bank retreat. Thus, variations in local factors and their control of erosion are as important to measure as retreat itself. Specifically, the variations in RARs and their interactions with other local factors, such as depth or sediment characteristics are a major control of scour rates. Erosion rate variability in the study streams decreased logarithmically with both increasing RAR and gravel content of the bank. Thus, those banks with denser root networks and greater coarse fragment content were less likely to erode. The absence of erosion of gravel-dominated strata in this study is anomalous, but may be partly attributed to the low magnitude and short duration of the flows of the 2003 / 2004 wet season. Riparian influence on bank erosion and retreat is largely attributed to its effect on bank sediment strength and cohesion, but its influence on flow redirection away from the bank is also important. Root densities play a major part in these processes – greater densities provide increased cohesion, improved armouring of the bank from primary and secondary flows and sediment aggregation due to the input of organic matter. Root densities generally vary according to above-ground vegetation characteristics, sediment characteristics (moisture, texture, gravel content) and depth. There were linear relationships between root density (using RAR as the measure) and tree density that declined in strength with increasing depth at the 34 study banks. RARs at shallow depths were shown to be highly variable where trees were tall. RAR also varied greatly with depth. Wet tropics banks showed marked drops in RAR at depths of 2. 5 - 3. 0 m. A similarly significant decline was evident in wet-dry tropics banks at 2. 0 m. No significant relationship existed between sediment and RAR. This thesis has highlighted the multi-faceted and complex nature of bank erosion and retreat in tropical Queensland streams, as reported in the literature for many temperate systems and the few tropical systems that have been studied. It suggests that specific stream power, curvature, bank geometry, RAR and gravel content and the interaction between these variables are all important in understanding bank erosion and retreat. But despite the extremes of the climate in the study region, erosion responses to a flood of moderate magnitude were within the range expected from other studies, suggesting, albeit with a small dataset, an adaptation of these systems to regular flooding. A larger dataset, including data on their reaction to events of larger magnitude may alter this relationship. It is clear that knowledge of these fluvial processes and characteristics in association with an appreciation of other local and catchment-based processes is essential for the development of appropriate catchment-wide and reach-based management plan...|$|R
