5|$|The Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane is on {{the former}} site of Gloucester House, the home of Robert Grosvenor, 2nd Earl Grosvenor (later Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster). It was further {{expanded}} by Alfred Octavius in 1928 and now supports over 450 bedrooms with 150 luxury flats on the south wing.

5|$|The first {{poultry breed}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> {{specialist}} club for enthusiasts, Sebrights were admitted to poultry exhibition standards {{not long after}} their establishment. Today, {{they are among the}} most popular of bantam breeds. Despite their popularity, Sebrights are often difficult to breed, and the inheritance of certain unique characteristics the breed carries has been studied scientifically. As a largely ornamental chicken, they lay tiny, white eggs and are not kept for meat production.|$|E

5|$|An {{affiliate}} of the MTV Network until then, Comedy Central decided, {{in part due}} to the success of South Park, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> independent sales department. By the end of 1998, Comedy Central had sold more than $150 million worth of merchandise for the show, including T-shirts and dolls. Over the next few years, Comedy Central's viewership spiked largely due to South Park, adding 3 million new subscribers {{in the first half of}} 1998 alone and allowed the network to sign international deals with networks in several countries.|$|E
5|$|Created in 1894 as {{a result}} of {{legislation}} requiring each parish <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> council, the council presently consists of 13 members and is responsible for a variety aspects of parish life: the general upkeep and maintenance of two recreation grounds, the village green, War Memorial, Community Centre, parish allotments, and (in part) the churchyard. The council also funds floodlights to illuminate the church. A magazine, the Ditton Gazette, is published on a quarterly basis and is circulated among the households of the parish. In February 2006, the council was awarded Quality Parish Council status.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, on 4 June 1988, then-Governor General Jeanne Sauvé {{authorised}} {{the creation}} of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, made possible by letters patent signed by Queen Elizabeth II, on the advice of her Canadian Privy Council, and presented by her son, Prince Edward. As a result, Canada became the first Commonwealth realm outside the United Kingdom <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> heraldic authority. Canada also provides full equality to women in terms of inheriting and transmitting arms. Additionally, all armigers within Canada may file for trademark protection of their grant of arms under the Trade-Marks Act.|$|E

5|$|Gaskins City – Includes a {{small village}} annexed in 1905, named for the Gaskins family of Harrisburg, {{prominent}} business owners and coal entrepreneurs of the Egyptian Coal Company, later sold to O'Gara. Gaskins City {{is a series of}} several blocks that exists to the east of the Harrisburg Levee and Route 45. Sloan Street crosses Route 45, runs straight into the center of Gaskins City and terminates at the Harrisburg Medical Center. It contains Gaskins City Baptist Church, Shawnee Hills Country Club, and is an upper-class neighborhood. It used <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> school at one time. A large part of Gaskins City was obliterated by the 2012 EF4 Tornado. Part of Harrisburg Medical Center was also heavily damaged.|$|E
5|$|One of the town's largest {{employers}} is T & S Stores, {{a subsidiary}} of Tesco plc, whose depot in the town employs approximately 1,000 people. Brownhills was also formerly home to the wirings manufacturer Electrium's last UK-based factory, but this has closed, with manufacturing shifted overseas and commercial staff {{moved to a new}} site in Cannock. In 2006, the site was converted into a mixed-use facility dubbed Toll Point, with Walsall Council among those moving to the site. Many people are also employed at the town's large branch of Tesco which is open 24 hours a day on weekdays and is large enough <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> petrol station. Before being taken over by Tesco, the store was a branch of Hillards, and an earlier Tesco store in the town had been forced to close as it could not compete with Hillards.|$|E
5|$|The current city {{structure}} can {{be traced}} back to the Tanzimat period of reform in the 19th century, before which Islamic judges and imams led the city under the auspices of the Grand Vizier. Following the model of French cities, this religious system was replaced by a mayor and a citywide council composed of representatives of the confessional groups (millet) across Istanbul. Beyoğlu was the first area of the city <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> director and council, with members instead being longtime residents of the neighborhood. Laws enacted after the Ottoman constitution of 1876 aimed to expand this structure across the city, imitating the twenty arrondissements of Paris, but they were not fully implemented until 1908, when Istanbul was declared a province with nine constituent districts. This system continued beyond the founding of the Turkish Republic, with the province renamed a belediye (municipality), but the municipality was disbanded in 1957.|$|E
50|$|An {{advisory}} {{referendum on}} joining the European Union {{was held in}} Finland on 16 October 1994. 56.9% of voters approved of the proposal, with a voter turnout of 70.8%.

5|$|The {{number of}} {{stars on the}} flag is fixed at 12, and {{is not related to}} the number of member states of the EU (although the EU did have 12 member states at the time of Maastricht Treaty). This is because it {{originally}} was the flag of the Council of Europe. In 1953, the Council of Europe had 15 members; it was proposed that the future flag should have one star for each member, and would not change based on future members. West Germany objected to this as one of the members was the disputed area of Saarland, and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> star would imply sovereignty for the region. Twelve was eventually adopted as a number with no political connotations and as a symbol of unity. While 12 is the correct number of stars, sometimes flags or emblems can be found that incorrectly show 15 (as of the rejected proposal) or 25 (as suggested by some after the expansion of the EU to 25 member states in 2004). However, the flag also remains that of the Council of Europe, which now has 47 member states.|$|E
5|$|The first {{offensive}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> deception {{operation was}} in Zhukov's {{part of the}} attack on the Rzhev-Vyazma salient to the west of Moscow in July and August, 1942. The offensive was conducted by Ivan Konev's Kalinin Front on the north, and Zhukov's Western Front with 31st Army and 20th Army on the south. Zhukov decided to simulate a concentration of forces some 200km to the south near Yukhnov, in the sector of his 43rd, 49th and 50th Armies. He created two deception operation staffs in that sector, and allocated 4 deception (maskirovka) companies, 3 rifle companies, 122 vehicles, 9 tanks and other equipment including radios for the deception. These forces built 833 dummy tanks, guns, vehicles, field kitchens and fuel tanks, and used their real and dummy equipment to simulate the unloading of armies from a railhead at Myatlevo, and the concentration of armour and motorized infantry as if preparing to attack Yukhnov. The radios communicated false traffic between the simulated armies and Front headquarters. The real tanks and other vehicles made tracks like those of troop columns. When the Luftwaffe attacked, the deception units returned fire and lit bottles of fuel to simulate fires. The deception had the immediate effect of increasing Luftwaffe air strikes against the railhead and false concentration area, while the two railheads actually in use were not attacked, and the Wehrmacht moved three Panzer divisions and one motorized infantry division of XL Panzer Corps to the Yukhnov area. Meanwhile, the real troop concentration to the north was conducted at night and in thick forests. Zhukov's attack began on 4 August, and the 20th and 31st Armies advanced 40km in two days. The Russians claimed that surprise had been achieved; this is confirmed by the fact that German intelligence failed to notice Zhukov's concentration of 20th and 31st Armies on Rzhev. Other small offensives on the same front had poorly planned and executed deception measures, but these were largely unsuccessful. The successful deception for the attack on Rzhev showed that military deception could be effective, but that only certain Red Army commanders applied it correctly.|$|E
