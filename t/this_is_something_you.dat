5000|$|Bonet is {{believed}} to have had a tense relationship with both Cosby and the shows producers throughout most of her time on the series; their dispute first became public in 1987. According to Kara Kovalchik of Mental Floss, Bonets alleged unprofessionalism consistently aggravated Cosby, reportedly being constantly argumentative on set, late for tapings and sometimes neglecting to attend tapings altogether. Bonet first expressed interest in pursuing a career as a dramatic film actress midway through the shows first season, originally intending to leave the series after only two years. Aged 19 at the time, she decided to make her film debut as Epiphany Proudfoot in the controversial horror film Angel Heart (1987), a role that required Bonet to film a sex scene with actor Mickey Rorke. By this time, Denise had already become the shows most popular character, while Bonets fame increased exponentially when the film was initially assigned an X rating for its graphic content. Although her role shocked several of Bonets fans and Cosby himself, Cosby claims that he did not mind the actress decision to appear in the film, explaining to her [...] "Listen, if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>you</b> want to do, fine. You have my blessings", and maintaining that he and Bonet have a good relationship in which he would have voiced his disapproval if he had felt otherwise. Bonet confirmed that she sought Cosbys advice when she was first offered the role because [...] "hes a generous enough man to see beyond The Cosby Show and to see my career as what it is and what it could be". Despite granting her his approval, Cosby refused to see the film. The shows producers and NBC executives declined to comment on Bonets decision, citing [...] "what Bonet did off the Cosby set was her business."Tensions increased between Bonet and Cosby when the actress posed nude for Interview and Rolling Stone magazines to promote Angel Heart. Bonet insisted [...] "I was not concerned with how Denise was going to feel ... Nor was I looking to destroy her reputation. Instead, I felt obligated to my career and my (freedom of) artistic choice." [...] After hearing that the photograph was generating a lot of negative feedback and press, Cosby purchased a copy of Interview himself and claims that, upon seeing Bonets photographs for the first time, he felt [...] "Theres nothing wrong with it ... Lisa has matured due to the immediacy of her responsibilities ... I think that she is doing magnificently well for someone her age doing and making decisions on her own, and she is deeply loved in my heart". The media continued to circulate Bonets photographs heavily, which {{is believed}} to have instigated a highly publicized dispute between the actress and Cosby {{towards the end of the}} 1980s. Cosby expressed concern over how the photographs would affect The Cosby Shows younger audience and Bonets younger cast mates. After Bonet threatened to sue The Cosby Show, a compromise was reached when Cosby decided to provide Bonet with her own television series, a spin-off of The Cosby Show entitled A Different World. The network agreed that Bonet was ready to star in her own series, a revelation by which she was surprised.|$|E
