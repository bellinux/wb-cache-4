25|$|As {{previously}} stated function {{refers to}} the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, a child may scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from his mother. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information about the conditions <b>that</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> it. However, identifying the conditions <b>that</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to intervention strategies {{that are likely to}} be effective.|$|E

In Study 1, children {{were presented with}} data consistent with two causal regularities. Explainers outperformed controls in generalizing the regularity <b>that</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> more observations.

Explainers were less likely than controls to generalize the regularity <b>that</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> more observations.

25|$|Religious persons acquire {{religious}} {{ideas and}} practices through social exposure.

25|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} {{translated}} by {{the genetic code}} vary greatly by the {{physical and chemical properties}} of their side chains. However, these amino acids can be categorised into groups with similar physicochemical properties. Substituting an amino acid with another from the same category is {{more likely to have a}} smaller impact on the structure and function of a protein than replacement with an amino acid from a different category. Consequently, acceptance of point mutations depends heavily on the amino acid being replaced in the mutation, and the replacement amino acid.

25|$|Factors <b>that</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> {{the high}} uptake of social {{housing in the}} {{community}} include generally lower household incomes that {{make it difficult to}} buy property; a preference for living in London, where property prices are higher and there are proportionately more social tenants from all communities; and a high proportion of new arrivals in the Somali community, with newcomers least likely to have gathered the savings that are required to buy property. Another contributing factor is the proportionately larger family sizes for which to find affordable and appropriate accommodation; about 10.8 per cent of Somalia-born households have five or more children as compared to 0.3 per cent of the UK-born population. Foreign-born populations in general tend to have larger families than the UK-born average.|$|E
25|$|Three {{improvements}} to card security {{have been introduced}} to the more common credit card networks, but none has proven to help reduce credit card fraud so far. First, the cards themselves are being replaced with similar-looking tamper-resistant smart cards which are intended to make forgery more difficult. The majority of smart card (IC card) based credit cards comply with the EMV (Europay MasterCard Visa) standard. Second, an additional 3 or 4 digit card security code (CSC) is now present {{on the back of}} most cards, for use in card not present transactions. Stakeholders at all levels in electronic payment have recognized the need to develop consistent global standards for security <b>that</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> and integrate both current and emerging security technologies.

500|$|The large base of {{knowledge}} about the anatomical structure and behavioral functions of the cerebellum have made it a fertile ground for theorizing—there are perhaps more theories of the function of the cerebellum than of any other part of the brain.

Several theories of both types have been formulated as mathematical models and simulated using computers.|$|E

500|$|In {{budding yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Holliday {{junctions}} {{can be resolved}} by four different pathways <b>that</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> essentially all Holliday junction resolution in vivo.

[...] The MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer binds preferentially to Holliday junctions. [...] It is an endonuclease that makes single-strand breaks in supercoiled double-stranded DNA. [...] The MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer promotes the formation of crossover recombinants. [...] While the other three pathways, involving proteins MUS81-MMS4, SLX1 and YEN1, respectively, can promote Holliday junction resolution in vivo, absence of all three nucleases has only a modest impact on formation of crossover products.|$|E
