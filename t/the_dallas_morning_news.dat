5|$|Lewisville {{is served}} mainly by media from the Dallas area, {{but a number}} of niche {{publications}} focus on local news. The Lewisville Enterprise merged with The Lewisville Leader in 1962.

Clements sold the paper to Harte-Hanks Community Newspapers in 1971. Star Newspapers, which owned the Leader, was purchased by 1013 Communications in 2012. The newspaper is based in Plano, Texas. In 2011, the Lewisville City Council designated the Lewisville portion of Neighborsgo, a weekly section of <b>The</b> <b>Dallas</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>News,</b> as the city's official newspaper of record.|$|E

50|$|In his own words:"I {{was born}} in Groesbeck, Texas. My father died when I was four and my mother began to teach school. Before I was five I had learned {{to read and write}} and {{discovered}} a talent for drawing which developed over the years until my ambition was to first become a cartoonist, then an illustrator. I delivered <b>the</b> <b>Dallas</b> Journal every <b>morning,</b> taking as pay watercolor lessons, and during the great hurricane of 1915 when I was ten, I was considered quite a hero for having delivered the paper, even though flying tin roofs sailed about me. My education was cut short after a year of college when I went to work to help support my mother and young sister. I was a soda-fountain boy, a sign painter, a door-to-door magazine salesman; I worked in the oil fields and aboard cargo vessels plying the Mexican Gulf and Caribbean Sea, where I met many odd but wonderful characters who appear in my works of sea fiction.|$|R
5|$|The film {{is based}} on the real life of Ron Woodroof, a patient of HIV and AIDS, who {{was the subject of a}} lengthy 1992 article in <b>The</b> <b>Dallas</b> <b>Morning</b> <b>News</b> written by {{journalist}} and author Bill Minutaglio. A month before Woodroof died in September 1992, screenwriter Craig Borten was told about the story by his friend, so he went and interviewed him to create the screenplay; Borten recorded many hours of interviews with Woodroof and had access to his personal journals. Borten wrote a script for what he believed would make a great movie and attempted to attract interest in making the film in mid 1996, with Dennis Hopper attached to direct. Columbia Pictures was set to buy the script but the film was unable to secure financial backing.|$|E
