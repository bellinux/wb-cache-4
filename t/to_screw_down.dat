60|$|One of {{the first}} topics on which I heard {{conversation}} turning in America {{was that of a}} very interesting book called Main Street, which involves many of these questions of the modern industrial and the eternal feminine. It is simply the story, or perhaps rather the study than the story, of a young married woman in one of the multitudinous little towns on the great central plains of America; and of a sort of struggle between her own more restless culture and the provincial prosperity of her neighbours. There are a number of true and telling suggestions in the book, but the one touch which I found tingling in the memory of many readers was the last sentence, in which the master of the house, with unshaken simplicity, merely asks for the whereabouts of some domestic implement; I think it was a screw-driver. It seems to me a harmless request, but from the way people talked about it one might suppose he had asked for a screw-driver <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> <b>down</b> the wife in her coffin. And a great many advanced persons would tell us that wooden house in which she lived really was like a wooden coffin. But this appears to me to be taking a somewhat funereal view of the life of humanity.|$|E
50|$|The play {{is about}} a group of house-painters in Mugsborough in 1906: skilled painters, labourers, an {{apprentice}} boy (Bert); and their bosses, site foreman (Crass), works foreman (Hunter), and the owner of the firm (Rushton). Skilled men earn seven pence per hour, labourers five pence and the first year apprentice earns nothing; as works foreman, Hunter gets two per cent of the firm’s profits, so he is always looking <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> <b>down</b> costs. Rushton's firm is redecorating a house, The Cave, owned by Mayor Sweater.|$|E

50|$|Pipe vises are a plumber's tool, {{often used}} to hold pipes in place for {{threading}} and cutting. There are two main styles: chain and yoke. The yoke type vise uses a <b>screw</b> <b>to</b> clamp <b>down</b> the pipe, and the chain style uses a chain for securing the pipe.|$|R
60|$|Rip's {{story was}} soon told, {{for the whole}} twenty years had been to him but as one night. The neighbors stared when they heard it; some were seen to wink at each other, and put their tongues in their cheeks; and the self-important man in the cocked hat, who, when the alarm was over, had {{returned}} <b>to</b> the field, <b>screwed</b> <b>down</b> {{the corners of his}} mouth, and shook his head--upon which there was a general shaking of the head throughout the assemblage.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the {{sarcophagus}} started on May 20, 1986, 24 days after the disaster. Subsequent construction lasted for 206 days, from June to late November of the same year. The first task before construction started was to build a cooling slab under the reactor to prevent the hot nuclear fuel from burning {{a hole in the}} base. Coal miners were called up to dig the necessary tunnel below the reactor and by June 24, 1986 four hundred coal miners had dug the 168 m long tunnel. When the building became overly radioactive, it became impossible <b>to</b> directly <b>screw</b> <b>down</b> the nuts and bolts or apply any direct welding to the sarcophagus, so this work was done by robots. The seams of the sarcophagus, however, were not properly sealed.|$|R
50|$|The typical {{passenger}} service {{consisted of}} two trains per day each way between Midland Junction (Lorneville) and Toronto; one of these trains extended to Coboconk; {{there was only one}} return trip each day from Sutton to Stouffville. The small narrow-gauge engines were able to cope with normal winter weather, but there was no money for snow clearing after severe storms and Gooderham and Worts sometimes paid for this work in order to maintain their distillery fuel supplies. Sometimes it took a month to clear the line with manual labour. There were few public accidents, but a severe toll of industrial fatalities to the operating staff. The most dangerous job was Brakesman, with many young men being crippled or killed when walking along the tops of vehicles <b>to</b> manually <b>screw</b> <b>down</b> brakes, and when manually coupling cars using the highly dangerous link and pin couplers. The worst accident occurred when the boiler of the Fairlie engine Shedden (see illustration above) exploded at Stouffville on January 31, 1874 due to the safety valves being tied down to increase haulage power, killing three enginemen.|$|R
50|$|Over time, the {{performance}} of a piano action tends to decline, due to the compression of felt, warping of wood, and other types of wear. A skilled technician can restore it to optimal precision, in a process called regulation, which involves adjustments ranging from turning a small <b>screw</b> <b>to</b> sanding <b>down</b> a wood surface. Many new pianos are not perfectly regulated when released from the factory, or quickly lose their regulation when moved to their new home, and benefit from regulation in the store or in the home.|$|R
25|$|The typical {{passenger}} service {{consisted of}} two trains per day each way between Owen Sound and Toronto; {{there was only one}} return trip each day from Teeswater to Orangeville. Orangeville had three trains a day to and from Toronto. Freight traffic over the Caledon Hills and the heights near Dundalk required powerful 4-6-0 and 2-8-0 locomotives, which seem to have handled the traffic comfortably, although trains often had to be divided between Mono Road and Charleston (Caledon). The small narrow-gauge engines were able to cope with normal winter weather, but there were major blockages of the line in the 'snowbelt' country above Orangeville, which sometimes closed the line for several weeks. The TG was sometimes unable, for many months, to pay the overtime wages for manually clearing these drifts. There were few public accidents, but a severe toll of industrial fatalities to the operating staff. The most dangerous job was Brakesman, with many young men being crippled or killed when walking along the tops of vehicles <b>to</b> manually <b>screw</b> <b>down</b> brakes, and when manually coupling cars using the highly dangerous link-and-pin couplers. The worst incident on the TG occurred at Arthur when a passenger was killed, by shots fired at a train crew, by drunken members of the Orange Order on July 12 1872.|$|R
25|$|Yoke valves (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high pressure inlet opening of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an O-ring in a groove in the contact face of the cylinder valve. The user screws the clamp in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the o-ring between the radial faces of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the O-ring against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must take care not <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> the yoke <b>down</b> too tightly, or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to O-ring extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|R
60|$|Shut {{the door}} of the dark room quietly. I should not stay even to sympathize with him if I were you. The men will be coming <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> the coffin <b>down</b> soon. I think he would like to be alone with it till then. Let us leave him. He will come back to the club later on in the season. For a while we may have to give him another ten points or so, but he will soon get back his old form. Now and again, when he meets the other fellows' boys {{shouting}} on the towing-path; when Brown rushes up the drive, paper in hand, to tell him how that young scapegrace Jim has won his Cross; when he is congratulating Jones's eldest on having passed with honours, the old wound may give him a nasty twinge. But the pain will pass away. He will laugh at our stories and tell us his own; eat his dinner, play his rubber. It is only a wound.|$|R

60|$|I {{have already}} told {{the reader that}} there were two strong staples fixed upon that side of my box which had no window, and into which the servant, who used to carry me on horseback, would put a leathern belt, and buckle it about his waist. Being in this disconsolate state, I heard, or at least thought I heard, some kind of grating noise on that side of my box where the staples were fixed; and soon after I began to fancy that the box was pulled or towed along the sea; for I now and then felt a sort of tugging, which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows, leaving me almost in the dark. This gave me some faint hopes of relief, {{although}} I was not able to imagine how it could be brought about. I ventured to unscrew one of my chairs, which were always fastened to the floor; and having made a hard shift <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> it <b>down</b> again, directly under the slipping-board that I had lately opened, I mounted on the chair, and putting my mouth as near as I could to the hole, I called for help in a loud voice, and in all the languages I understood. I then fastened my handkerchief to a stick I usually carried, and thrusting it up the hole, waved it several times in the air, that if any boat or ship were near, the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in the box.|$|R
6000|$|Both {{the skipper}} and the mate laughed heartily at the observation. [...] "That wouldn't do, Sandy, would it?" [...] said Miggs, shaking his head. [...] "We couldn't afford <b>to</b> have our <b>screw</b> cut <b>down</b> like that." ...|$|R

[...] . I looked into all the rooms, bronzes, drawings, and gem-room; a volume might easily be written upon either subject. The {{contents}} of the gem-room especially require to be looked at separately in order to convince one's self of their minute magnificences; for, among so many, the eye slips from one to another with only a vague outward sense that here are whole shelves full of little miracles, both of nature's material and man's workmanship. Greater [larger] things can be reasonably well appreciated with a less scrupulous though broader attention; but in order to estimate the brilliancy of the diamond eyes of a little agate bust, for instance, you have <b>to</b> <b>screw</b> your mind <b>down</b> <b>to</b> them and nothing else. You must sharpen your faculties of observation to a point, and touch the object exactly on the right spot, or you do not appreciate it at all. It is a troublesome process when there are a thousand such objects to be seen.|$|R

50|$|The snare drum {{seems to}} have descended from a medieval drum called the tabor, which was a drum with a single-gut snare strung across the bottom. It is a little bigger than a medium tom and was first used in war, often played with a fife (pipe); the player would play both the fife and drum (see also Pipe and tabor). Tabors were not always double-headed and not all may have had snares. By the 15th century, {{the size of the}} snare drum had {{increased}} and had a cylindrical shape. This simple drum with a simple snare became popular with the Swiss mercenary troops who used the fife and drum from the 15th to 16th centuries. The drum was made deeper and carried {{along the side of the}} body. Further developments appeared in the 17th century, with the use of <b>screws</b> <b>to</b> hold <b>down</b> the snares, giving a brighter sound than the rattle of a loose snare. During the 18th century, the snare drum underwent changes which improved its characteristic sound. Metal snares appeared in the 20th century. Today the snare drum is used in jazz, pop music and modern orchestral music.|$|R
