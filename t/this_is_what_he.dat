25|$|Kierkegaard {{decided to}} step up to the Tree of the {{knowledge}} of good and evil for himself, replacing Adam, and make his choice in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had Abraham do in Fear and Trembling. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about guilt and innocence. His book, The Concept of Anxiety, makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{was one of}} the instigators of the New Zealand Farmers Union, which {{eventually}} developed into Federated Farmers. On three occasions, he was the president of the North Canterbury branch. He belonged to the Wheat Board and, after World War I, the Repatriation Board. He was the chairman of the parliamentary committee that recommended the establishment of the New Zealand Meat Producers Board, and when it was established in 1922, he was appointed as its first chairman. He remained in that role until 1931 and outside his parliamentary activities, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was best known for. He resigned from the position when he was appointed to cabinet. Soon afterwards, he failed to get re-elected in the , so he resumed his role as chairman of the Meat Producers Board and held it until 1935. He represented the Meat Producers Board at the 1932 British Empire Economic Conference in Ottawa, Canada. His 1935 resignation came about because he was appointed as member of the Commission of Agriculture.|$|E
500|$|The quiet {{period in}} Massachusetts was over. Adams was easily re-elected to the Massachusetts House in May 1773, {{and was also}} elected as {{moderator}} of the Boston Town Meeting. In June 1773, Adams introduced a set of private letters to the Massachusetts House, written by Hutchinson several years earlier. In one letter, Hutchinson recommended to London {{that there should be}} [...] "an abridgement of what are called English liberties" [...] in Massachusetts. Hutchinson denied that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant, but his career in Massachusetts was effectively over. The House sent a petition to the king asking for his recall.|$|E

5000|$|Contrasted with <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> calls [...] "laws of the mind": Boole asserts {{these are}} known {{in their first}} instance, without need of repetition: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Yeomanry Ball--Yeomanry Ball?' he murmured, as if, of all {{requests}} in the world, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had least expected. 'Where <b>is</b> <b>what</b> {{you call}} the Yeomanry Ball?' ...|$|R
500|$|Whitney {{initially}} left {{management of}} the newspaper to Walter Thayer, a longtime advisor. Thayer {{did not believe the}} Tribune was a financial investment -- [...] "it was a matter of 'let's set it up so that (Whitney) can do it if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants"—but moved to build a [...] "hen house" [...] of media properties to protect Whitney's investment and provide money for the Tribune. Over the next two years, Whitney's firm acquired Parade, five television stations and four radio stations. The properties, merged into a new company called Whitney Communications Corporation, proved profitable, but executives chafed at subsidizing the Tribune.|$|E
500|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{is upset}} that Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{will be leaving}} Dunder-Mifflin to join Athlead, Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) startup. He tries to browbeat Darryl into staying with Dunder-Mifflin by {{tallying}} up his perceived job failures since taking the Athlead job and holding a meeting on customer loyalty with a customer he describes as [...] "enraged", but who demurs at the characterization. When this is ineffective, Dwight joins Darryl's delivery run to make the job more [...] "fun", including ordering a milkshake at a fast food drive-through and throwing it at the server, shouting [...] "Fire in the hole!" [...] Morally outraged, Darryl forces Dwight to stay behind and clean up the mess, whereupon another customer pulls the same prank on Dwight himself. Darryl later laughs at footage of the event that has been uploaded onto the internet, saying that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> will miss when he moves to Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|In August 2014, it was {{confirmed}} that producers had planned a romance storyline for Mark and his housemate Paige Smith (Olympia Valance). After growing closer, they realised {{that they had}} a deeper connection than friendship. They later agreed to go out for dinner, but neither of them called it a date. Mark struggled with the idea of moving on from Kate, and even though he knew it was a date, he had not admitted it out loud. Mark ignored Paige afterwards, causing her to confront him as a storm hit Erinsborough. Brennan and Paige then consummated their relationship. Their first official date ended abruptly when Paige turned up wearing an old dress of Kate's she found in a charity shop. Brennan reacted angrily and shouted at Paige to leave the bar. He later realised that he had been too harsh, but just as he decided to give their relationship another go, he saw her kissing another man. McGregor commented [...] "He thinks he's blown his chances with her – but he's also wondering if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> really wants." ...|$|E
25|$|This {{fulfilment}} {{of function}} depends on {{all parts of}} an organism cohering and co-operating. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called the 'Law of Help,' one of Ruskin's fundamental beliefs, extending from nature and art to society.|$|R
6000|$|Cuthbert Marshall {{sat down}} on the old red {{sandstone}} step of the door and bowed his head in his hands. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had come back to--this ghost and wreck of his past! Oh, bitterness! ...|$|R
60|$|Kit grinned {{to himself}} and went on. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> must expect to encounter, for he, too, in his new role of gentleman's man, was to start from the beach in a similar boat that very day.|$|R
2500|$|Thérèse {{emphasised}} God's mercy in {{both the}} birth and the passion narratives in the Gospel. She wrote, [...] "He sees it disfigured, covered with blood!... unrecognizable!... And yet the divine Child does not tremble; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>He</b> chooses to show His love." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{translator}} may render only {{parts of}} the original text, provided he indicates that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing. [...] But a translator should not {{assume the role of}} censor and surreptitiously delete or bowdlerize passages merely to please a political or moral interest.|$|E
2500|$|The {{couple was}} {{occasionally}} compared to Tad and Dixie. Before her [...] "death" [...] in 2002, Dixie {{is said to}} have given JR a necklace Tad gave her. Once committed to Babe, JR gives Babe the necklace, saying Dixie believed it was filled with more love than he could ever imagine and that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants for he and Babe and their family. Several months later, when JR is recovering from his jump out of a window, enraged at Babe for her one-night stand with Josh Madden, Tad tells JR that JR loves Babe the same way that he himself loves Dixie.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Renshaw rose. And <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>been</b> {{waiting to}} hear! [...] "Perhaps," [...] he said grimly, [...] "you {{would also like}} news of the {{photographer}} and Captain Bower, or did your father agree with them better?" ...|$|R
25|$|Amir's {{brother said}} that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted to do. After that spot fixing scandal at same city, {{he wanted to}} make up for his wrong doings and the spell in the final was {{something}} that brought his family to relife.|$|R
50|$|An {{office worker}} (Crompton) is giving a serious {{presentation}} about an outlandish idea, apparently {{under the impression}} that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> asked to do. His co-workers eventually put him straight, but not before he's admitted to having already put his plan into action.|$|R
2500|$|After the election, Casini relaunched {{his plan}} for a new [...] "centrist" [...] party, as an {{alternative}} to both the PdL and the PD. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called the [...] "party of the nation", open to [...] "centrists", [...] "Christian democrats", [...] "liberals" [...] and [...] "reformers", even though he presented it as a party based on Christian values, as opposed both to the PD and the PdL, which, despite being a centre-right party, also included social-liberal factions. Casini long criticised the PdL for not being [...] "Catholic" [...] enough, particularly criticizing Silvio Berlusconi, who once spoke of [...] "anarchy of values" [...] in describing the catch-all nature of the PdL, and Gianfranco Fini, who was known for his social-liberal stance on stem-cell research, abortion and right-to-die issues, and explicitly wooed the [...] "Christian democrats of the PD" [...] to join him.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1996 Skunkhour {{embarked}} on a 10-week tour of Europe. However, by March they had written only one new song for their third album, which bothered Aya: [...] "I was saying to Del that we've really got to get going on this new stuff. We might lose momentum if we don't keep creating. So I [...] 'What have you got, man?' And he said, 'Mate, I've got nothing'. He'd been saying {{for a couple of}} years that he wasn't sure <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was meant to do. He didn't feel like a rapper any more. He didn't feel like a lyricist any more. He wanted to go back to his artwork, which is his first love. I said, 'I understand. You should leave the band'". Del completed the tour, then quit to become an in-house artist at Walt Disney Animation Studios in Australia. Aya told Dino Scatena of The Daily Telegraph that [...] "What was best for him was best for us because his malaise might permeate the band and I would much rather he leave and we be strong and revitalised rather than try to perpetuate an old chemistry that wasn't working".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{days later}} Vosill {{receives}} {{a note from}} Adlain, asking her to meet him and two other Dukes elsewhere in the castle. [...] She leaves alone, but Oelph opts to follow her in secret; after catching a glimpse of someone fleeing, he arrives in time to be arrested by the guard, who proceed to discover Vosill standing over {{the body of a}} murdered Duke, stabbed with one of her scalpels. [...] Vosill and Oelph are almost immediately delivered to Ralinge, who binds the two separately and then strips, intending to rape, Vosill. The woman issues what sounds to Oelph like commands, albeit in a language he does not recognize even partially. [...] Oelph's eyes are closed at this point, and in his narrative he is unable to adequately describe what he hears next, other than an impression of wind and metal. [...] When he opens his eyes he finds Ralinge and his assistants dead, dispatched bloodily, and Vosill free and in the process of removing her bindings, no indication of how she was freed. [...] Later, she claims that Oelph fell unconscious and the three men fought over who would rape her first, though she indicates to him that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> [...] "should" [...] remember.|$|E
50|$|He learnt to {{play the}} {{synthesizer}} from his father {{at the age of}} seven. Sandeep’s professional career as a musician started when he played at his first recording session at the age of 12. He soon realized that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to do in life; make music.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later, a sharp-eyed lad {{ran into the}} Monte Rosa Hotel, at Zermatt, {{saying that he had}} seen an {{avalanche}} fall from the summit of the Matterhorn onto the Matterhorn glacier. The boy was reproved for telling idle stories; he was right, nevertheless, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw.|$|R
60|$|So <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{had thought}} <b>was</b> God! Tarzan's lip curled in an angry snarl as he {{leaped into the}} hut after the terror-stricken witch-doctor.

60|$|Fifty miles had Ransom Truesdell driven that day. And yet <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did.|$|E
6000|$|And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{said at last}} (his {{feelings}} matter not):-- [...] "I think we've {{tapped a}} private line. Hi! Threes about there! Trot!" ...|$|E
60|$|While he thus sat, {{wondering}} where {{he should go}} to get something to eat, he fell asleep, and had a dream. And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> dreamed.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{perceived}} {{as though it}} <b>was</b> altogether self-evident <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had to do. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> the note he had to strike. Among other things because it would repudiate the accursed worship of pinching self-restraint {{that was one of}} the incessant stresses between them. They would come to her with a pure unexpectedness, they would flame upon her.|$|R
60|$|So Adrian went forth, {{not sorry}} {{to escape the}} {{presence}} of these tormented women. Here and there he wandered to one haunt of Dirk's after another, but without success, till at length a noise of tumult drew him, and he ran towards the sound. Presently he was round the corner, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw.|$|R
60|$|At length the portentous {{silence was}} broken {{and a voice}} spoke, the voice of Nam the priest. In the silence all that he uttered could be heard plainly, but his words came from far away, {{and the sound of}} them was still and small. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said, as Juanna told it to them after the ceremony.|$|R
6000|$|Underneath came an {{explanation}} of what the red letters referred to, occupying no less than three paragraphs of stumpy small print, every word of which Valentine eagerly devoured. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> read:-- ...|$|E

50|$|Celestine passes {{away from}} his self-inflicted {{injuries}} and Jonni takes over {{as the head of}} Celestine's fashion house, as Celestine specified that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted. Jonni and Doll are shown to have started a relationship of sorts along with their working relationship. However the series ends with Jonni discovering Celestine's mirror and seeing how it distorted his appearance just as much as it did Celestine's.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> {{not taking}} <b>this</b> very well," [...] {{observed}} Mr. Jones. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said, {{but as a}} matter of fact he thought that the business was shaping quite satisfactorily.
