5|$|He {{began in}} 1962 by writing a Fortran {{compiler}} for the PDP-4, before {{contributing to the}} development of the PDP-5 instruction set. Under Harlan Anderson (vice president of engineering), principal architect Gordon Bell led a team, including Kotok as an assistant logic designer, which developed the first commercial <b>time-sharing</b> computer, the PDP-6, designed and delivered in 1963–1964. Aiming at a scientific market, Digital machines had a 36-bit word length to accommodate artificial intelligence work in Lisp and to compete with IBM mainframe computers. In 1965, in what may have been the first around-the-world networking connection, a PDP-6 at the University of Western Australia in Perth was operated from Boston in the United States via a telex link.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 <b>time-sharing</b> computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} the <b>time-shared</b> TMC for pattern-recognition applications. By sharing two memristor arrays at different time, {{the number of}} memristor arrays can be reduced by half, saving the crossbar’s area by about half. To implement the <b>time-shared</b> TMC, we designed and verified the CMOS <b>time-shared</b> subtractor by the circuit simulation. The operation of the <b>time-shared</b> TMC was experimentally verified using the fabricated 3 [*]×[*] 3 memristor array which was made of aluminum film and carbon fiber. Here, we programmed the array to store three different patterns. By applying three different input vectors to the <b>time-shared</b> TMC, we could verify that the input vectors were recognized well by the proposed circuits. Moreover, the proposed <b>time-shared</b> TMC was tested for the recognition of more complicated gray-scale images. Here, 10 gray-scale images with 32 [*]×[*] 32  pixels were tested and verified to be recognized well by the proposed <b>time-shared</b> TMC, even though the noise level was varied from − 10 to + 10  dB.|$|R

5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is closely}} related to concurrent computing—they are frequently used together, and often conflated, though the two are distinct: it is possible to have parallelism without concurrency (such as bit-level parallelism), and concurrency without parallelism (such as multitasking by <b>time-sharing</b> on a single-core CPU). In parallel computing, a computational task is typically broken down in several, often many, very similar subtasks that can be processed independently and whose results are combined afterwards, upon completion. In contrast, in concurrent computing, the various processes often do not address related tasks; when they do, as is typical in distributed computing, the separate tasks may have a varied nature and often require some inter-process communication during execution.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Stanford University student Bill Pitts, {{who had a}} hobby of {{exploring}} the steam tunnels and buildings of the campus, broke into a building he found {{out to be the}} location of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project, which held a DEC PDP-6 <b>time-sharing</b> computer system with 20 Teletype consoles connected to it. Fascinated by the computer and having taken several introductory computer classes, Pitts convinced the head of the project, Lester Earnest, to let him use the computer after hours. Soon, Pitts had ceased going to classes, instead spending his nights in the computer lab interacting with the graduate and postgraduate students and playing Spacewar on the PDP-6. Pitts often played against Hugh Tuck, a student at California Polytechnic State University who was a friend from high school. During one Spacewar session that took place, depending on the source, between 1966 and 1969, Tuck remarked that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was still unfeasible due to the cost of computers, and the pair did not pursue the project. In 1971, however, Pitts, who by then had graduated and was working at Lockheed as a PDP-10 programmer, learned of the 1970 DEC PDP-11, which was sold for around US$14,000. While this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most electronic games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, Tuck and Pitts felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of <b>time-sharing</b> systems {{led to a}} number of problems. One was that users, particularly at universities where the systems were being developed, seemed to want to hack the system to get more CPU time. For this reason, security and access control became a major focus of the Multics project in 1965. Another ongoing issue was properly handling computing resources: users spent most of their time staring at the terminal and thinking about what to input instead of actually using the resources of the computer, and a <b>time-sharing</b> system should give the CPU time to an active user during these periods. Finally, the systems typically offered a memory hierarchy several layers deep, and partitioning this expensive resource led to major developments in virtual memory systems.|$|E

25|$|WFAA (AM), {{which would}} {{eventually}} {{serve as the}} sister radio station to WFAA television, first signed on the air on June 26, 1922. The station had long participated in a <b>time-sharing</b> arrangement with Fort Worth radio station WBAP, which was maintained as the latter operated at various frequencies; it originally began in 1922, when WBAP (which first {{went on the air}} on May 2 of that year, nine weeks before WFAA began operations) transmitted at 630kHz and continued until 1927, before resuming when that station moved to 800kHz in 1929 and settling when WBAP moved its current frequency at 820kHz in 1941. In 1947, WFAA and WBAP began <b>time-sharing</b> on a second frequency, 570kHz, which was formerly occupied by KGKO. Until WFAA (AM) began to transmit full-time on 570kHz in 1970, WBAP and WFAA were engaged in the somewhat bizarre situation of having to switch {{back and forth between the}} 570 and 820 frequencies at various times of the day: WBAP broadcast on 820 AM from midnight to 6:00a.m., with WFAA taking over the frequency space until noon; WBAP returned to the 820 signal for a few hours, before WFAA once again took over the frequency. WFAA had control over 820 during prime evening hours, when the 50,000-watt clear channel signal could often be heard as far west as California and as far east as New York (at the time, there were significantly fewer radio stations that were operating at night, reducing the likelihood of interference).|$|E
