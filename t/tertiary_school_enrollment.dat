This study {{was performed to}} examine the main determinants of under- 5 mortality rate (U 5 MR) in OECD countries in two cross-sections, 2010 and 2013, {{and the results of}} them was compared. Material and Methods: This was a cross- sectional study. The data on U 5 MR,health expenditure, Gross National Income per capita (GNI), Physician and nurses’ density, Ratio of female to male primary, secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>school</b> <b>enrollment</b> was gathered from world health organization (WHO) and World bank datasets. Pearson correlation and regression models was used for analyzing the data for years 2010 and 2013. Stata 11 was used for analyzing the data. Results: Pearson correlation was negative for all variable in 2010 and all variables, expect  Ratio of female to male secondary enrollment,  had negative correlation with U 5 MR. Regression analysis showed that, all variable, except Ratio of female to male primary enrollment had negative effect on U 5 MR in 2010. Also, GNI had negative effect on U 5 MR in 2010 and its coefficient was significant. The β-coefficient of healthcare expenditures was - 0. 964 and - 0. 746 in 2010 and 2013, respectively  and  was statistically significant just in 2010. Two of three variables in which included for women literacy had negative effect on U 5 MR in 2010 and all of them had negative effect in 2013. Conclusion: The study results showed that all variables, including health expenditures, gross national income per capita, and density of physicians and nurses and female literacy, had invers effect on under-five mortality rate in OECD countries...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{determine}} the contribution of each level of education on growth in economic sectors of Togo, and to test the causality between each level of education and the growth in economic sectors, using Solow augmented model with human capital resources, developed by Mankiw and al. (1992). The data cover the period 1984 - 2014. The methodological approach is based on the cointegration, the causality tests and the fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) suggested by Philips and Hansen (1990). Estimates show that, the different levels of education generally, have a positive and significant impact on Togo's economic sectors which (impact) becomes lower as the level of education increases, and show also that the efforts undertaken by the country in terms of extension and accessibility have not been neutral in terms of economic performances. The results of the causality tests indicate a circular causality between economic growth and the primary <b>schooling</b> <b>enrollment,</b> a causality from the gross real added values of agriculture to the primary <b>schooling</b> <b>enrollment</b> and, from industry to the <b>tertiary</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>enrollment</b> on the one hand, from primary <b>schooling</b> <b>enrollment</b> to the gross added values of industry and services on the other hand, according to Toda and Yamamoto(1995) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} two essays on Chinese mainland {{immigrants and their}} offspring in Hong Kong, using a series of censuses and by-censuses data from 1991 to 2006 and Social Inequality and Social Mobility Survey data from 2006. The first essay examines the assimilation of mainland immigrants {{in the labor market}} in Hong Kong, focusing on employment, occupational and earnings attainment in comparison to natives. Particular attention is paid to the assimilation of the immigrants over time, and the effects of changes to the cohort quality, resulting primarily from the shift in immigration policy after Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997. Results of my estimations show that newly arrived Chinese immigrants had a lower employment rate, and were trapped in elementary occupations even if they had jobs, and earned much less than the natives. As immigrants stayed longer, the gap tended to decrease. However, most immigrants were not able to reach parity to the natives in terms of earnings throughout their working lives. The above pattern differs by gender. No evidence suggests significant changes in the quality of immigrant cohorts after Hong Kong’s reunification with China in 1997. Although Chinese immigrants are in disadvantaged positions in Hong Kong, the second essay shows that children of Chinese immigrants surpass children of natives in educational, occupational, and earnings attainment. Also, the gap between mainland immigrants’ offspring and natives’ children in <b>tertiary</b> <b>school</b> <b>enrollment</b> decreases as their parental education or parental occupation increases. These results not only confirm the optimism hypothesis of a second immigrant generation, but also provide an alternative explanation for the success of the children of immigrants. Given a lack of cultural and ethnic differentials, it {{is not a matter of}} the cultural valuation of education or success-oriented cultural values, but the motivation of upward mobility resulting from parental immigrant status, especially from low socioeconomic status that leads to the success of the children of mainland immigrants in Hong Kong...|$|E
40|$|Atlanta Conference on Science and Innovation Policy 2009 This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Policy Actors and RelationshipsSince innovation is playing {{an important role in the}} age of knowledge, using innovative resources more efficiently gradually becomes a hot issue at national level. National innovative capacity is the ability of a country to produce and commercialize a flow of innovative technology over the long term (Furman, Porter, Stern, 2002). However, most previous studies equate number of patent or paper published with the level of innovative output instead of reflecting the real market value of innovation. This research applies Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate the efficiency among countries in the production and commercialization of new-to-the-world technologies. To do so, a framework based on the concept of national innovative capacity would be introduced and innovation process is divided into two periods: innovation production and innovation commercialization. The purpose of this study was to know the distributions of efficiencies in national innovation activities and the influences of environmental factors on innovation efficiency. Therefore, a framework based on the concept of national innovative capacity would be introduced and innovation process was divided into two periods: innovation production and innovation commercialization. That is, two-stage production process would be used to provide new insight regarding the location of inefficiency in national innovation production process. This topic could be identified as being of important to policy makers in providing them with necessary background to design proper promotion mechanism on innovation activity. Methodology This paper sets up an inter-country innovation production framework. Each country is regarded as a DMU (Decision making unit) and innovation production process is modeled as two stages in series. In the stage 1, DMU consumes inputs to produce intermediate products. The intermediate products are the inputs in stage 2 and used to produce outputs. The first stage, which is called "innovation production" stage, employs R&D personnel and R&D expenditure as input and produces patents and academic papers as outputs. The second stage is defined as innovation commercialization stage with patents and papers as inputs, and technology balance of payments: receipts and high technology export as outputs. Tobit estimation is applied to identify the external environmental factors that influence the production and commercialization efficiency. These environmental factors that determine the national innovative capability could divide into three categories: the common innovation infrastructure, the particular innovation environment in the nation's industrial clusters, and the linkages between them. The results show that less than one-half of the countries are fully efficient in innovation activities. Efficiencies of selected countries in innovation commercialization are more diverse than those in innovation production. 16 of the countries are at the stage of decreasing returns of scale in innovation production, while the number of countries in innovation commercialization is 14. It implies that in these countries the percentage for increment in outputs is less than that in inputs. The Tobit regressions reveal that environmental factors which belong to infrastructure such as GDP, public expense on education, <b>tertiary</b> <b>school</b> <b>enrollment</b> ratio, are significant in explaining innovation production efficiency. In innovation commercialization, in addition to mentioned factors, trade ratio, which is one of the cluster specific factors, is also positive coefficient with innovation commercialization. This research decomposes the process of innovation activity and provides insight regarding the locations of inefficiency in the innovation process at national level. This topic would be identified as being of important to policy makers in providing them necessary background to design proper promotion mechanism on innovation activity. References Furman, J.
