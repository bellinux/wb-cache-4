5|$|Today <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> {{owned by}} the National Trust and {{operated}} by Bath and North East Somerset Council. The main rooms are still available for hire for private functions. They are also used for concerts, including ones {{that are part of}} the Bath International Music Festival.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{the site}} hosted eleven {{different}} residential halls and pavilions; in 2012 only three are left, {{although they have}} been completely reconstructed: The Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall, the Moon Satharn Borom Ard Hall and the Sommuthi Thevaraj Uppabat Hall. Behind these structures lie the grand Borom Ratchasathit Mahoran Hall, which has been recently rebuilt. None of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> open to the public, as state functions are still carried out within. The changing of the guards occurs at the front courtyard every two hours.|$|E
5|$|Group G {{lies just}} south of the Mendez Causeway. The complex dates to the Late Classic and {{consists}} of palace-type structures {{and is one of the}} largest groups of its type at Tikal. It has two stories but most of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> on the lower floor, a total of 29 vaulted chambers. The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey. One of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Social <b>Room</b> <b>was</b> {{restored}} to its early 20th century appearance in a $500,000 project funded by Kenneth and Janet Keene, for whom <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> renamed. <b>The</b> restored <b>room</b> <b>was</b> dedicated on November 12, 1998. http://www.clas.ufl.edu/alumni/alumninotes/99spring/atc.htmlhttp://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-18843800.html ...|$|R
50|$|The {{walls are}} lined with {{cushions}} for seating and the centrepiece of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> a sprawling candle holder with many candles. These candles <b>are</b> lit whenever <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> used for reflections.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Stove <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} <b>the</b> south {{part of the}} west wing. From spring to fall, <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{contains}} many butterflies and the exhibit {{is known as the}} Butterfly Forest. The plants in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> representative of <b>the</b> deep tropics, and <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> maintained at a temperature of 80 F during the day and 70 F during the night.|$|R
5|$|In many bathhouses the {{customer}} has {{a choice between}} renting a room or a locker, often for fixed periods of up to 12 hours. A room typically consists of a locker and a single bed (though doubles are sometimes available) with a thin vinyl mat supported on a simple wooden box or frame, an arrangement that facilitates easy cleaning between patrons. In many bathhouses (particularly those outside the United States), {{some or all of}} <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> freely available to all patrons.|$|E
5|$|On {{display in}} most of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> {{surviving}} works from Louis René deRohan's vast collection of Japanese vases and Chinese pottery and lacquerware from the Ming and Qing dynasties, originally destined for the new castle in Saverne. A curio cabinet in the Garde-robe du prince-évêque displays dessert tableware from the Manufacture de Sèvres, made in 1772–1774 for Louis-René deRohan's special embassy in Vienna. These items now belong to the Musée des arts décoratifs.|$|E
5|$|The house's room {{arrangement}} was planned for convenience and comfort, {{as compared to}} typical English mansions, which often were built with kitchens far from the dining room. Woodlea has 140 rooms, which were designed not to be drafty, and with important rooms not too remote. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> all over-scaled {{in terms of the}} height of the ceilings and size of the doors, with large fireplaces, and the length and breadth of the stairway to the house's second floor. The staircases have recesses with intricate decorative panels.|$|E
50|$|The large {{courtyard}} <b>is</b> {{surrounded by}} <b>rooms</b> behind arched stoa. <b>The</b> corner <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> reached by a diagonal passage. There <b>are</b> 28 <b>rooms</b> on ground floor, {{which have a}} window next to their door under the stoa facing the courtyard. Entrance to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> over a step. The fireplace in <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> situated in <b>the</b> wall separating <b>the</b> <b>rooms,</b> <b>is</b> flanked by two small closets.|$|R
50|$|The doors between <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> made crooked {{on purpose}} {{so that they}} would close by {{themselves}} and not let the heat out. Most of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> not heated and foot warmers were used in the winter.|$|R
5000|$|Texture Displacement: The {{illusion}} of distortion of physical objects in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> created by <b>the</b> projector. The radial wobble effect creates {{the illusion that}} objects in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> being affected by a rippling force field emanating from the television.|$|R
5|$|Directly {{underneath}} the State Apartments is {{a suite of}} slightly less grand rooms known as the semi-state apartments. Opening from the Marble Hall, these rooms are used for less formal entertaining, such as luncheon parties and private audiences. Some of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> named and decorated for particular visitors, such as the 1844 Room, decorated in that year for the State visit of Tsar NicholasI of Russia, and, {{on the other side}} of the Bow Room, the 1855 Room, in honour of the visit of Emperor NapoleonIII of France. At the centre of this suite is the Bow Room, through which thousands of guests pass annually to the Queen's Garden Parties in the Gardens. The Queen and Prince Philip use a smaller suite of rooms in the north wing.|$|E
5|$|Night Trap is an {{interactive}} movie video game that uses full motion video (FMV) {{to present the}} story and gameplay. The player is instructed by the in-game police squad to watch live surveillance footage of the Martin household and trigger traps to capture anyone that is seen endangering the house guests. Cameras are situated in eight locations {{in and around the}} house: the entry way, living room, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, driveway, and two hallways. A map is available as well so the player can see how <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> connected. The player can freely switch between viewing the different cameras to keep up on house activities and pick up clues from conversations. Kelli, an undercover agent, will also provide clues to the player. The player must avoid trapping her, any other agent, or the house guests.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' last {{concert was}} at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, on 29 August 1966, but Evans {{continued}} {{to work for them}} in the studio, and to run errands. After recording Revolver in 1966, McCartney went by himself on holiday to France, but asked to meet Evans in Bordeaux, at the Grosse Horloge church (on the corner of cours Victor Hugo and rue St. James). At exactly the pre-arranged time of one o'clock, Evans was standing under the church clock when McCartney arrived. They then drove to Madrid together, but after feeling bored, McCartney phoned Epstein's office in London and asked to be booked on a safari holiday in Kenya. When they arrived they visited the Amboseli Reserve at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro, and also stayed at the exclusive Treetops Hotel, where <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> built on the branches of trees.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>room</b> {{immediately}} behind <b>the</b> Music <b>Room</b> <b>was</b> {{set up by}} Imelda Marcos as her office. It {{later became}} President Fidel Ramos' private office. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> beyond <b>was</b> originally a small sitting <b>room</b> and <b>was</b> converted by President Joseph Estrada into his own office. President Arroyo decided to use <b>the</b> <b>room</b> as her office at first. Today, <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> used by <b>the</b> President to receive visitors.|$|R
50|$|P1. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> clean.|$|R
25|$|A second hall {{is located}} downstairs; {{it is much}} smaller than the main prayer hall. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} opened for Friday prayers and Salat al Eid. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> mainly used for storage but opens every year for the Islam Festival Edinburgh.|$|R
5|$|The Royal Palace, {{also known}} as Dar el-Makhzen, is located next to the Badi Palace. The Almohads built the palace in the 12th century {{on the site of}} their kasba, and it was partly remodeled by the Saadians in the 16th century and the Alaouites in the 17th century. Historically {{it was one of the}} palaces owned by the Moroccan king, who {{employed}} some of the most talented craftsmen in the city for its construction. The palace is not open to the public, and is now privately owned by French businessman Dominique du Beldi. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> large, with unusually high ceilings for Marrakesh, with zellij (elaborate geometric terracotta tile work covered with enamel) and cedar painted ceilings.|$|E
5|$|Tower C is {{different}} from Towers A and B in several ways, but primarily {{in the fact that}} its rooms are single occupancy. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> 2/3 the size of rooms in Towers A and B, and like Tower A and Tower B, every third floor has a lounge containing a television, couches, and tables for extra study. In addition, each floor has 30 rooms, except floors containing a lounge, which have 27. No official specialized student communities are housed in Tower C, but designated male and female floors are 24-hour Quiet Living Communities. Up until 2010-11, Tower C was open to students of any year, however it now houses primarily first-year students.|$|E
25|$|Inside, <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> stately, {{with high}} ceilings, {{handsome}} Doric columns and exquisite plaster mouldings and cornices. Elegantly proportioned, {{the building is}} laid out symmetrically along a central axis.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> West Sitting <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> a parlour {{that has}} been the setting for many {{interviews}} with heads of state and Members of Parliament. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> laid with original timber flooring from the 1930s. Displayed on the walls of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> priceless replicas of Arab tapestry presented by the Sultan of Oman to President Ong Teng Cheong in the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|After FDR left Harvard, <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> {{occupied}} by a succession of students until 1961. In June 1961, during Eleanor Roosevelt's visit to the College, {{the former first lady}} dedicated a plaque commemorating FDR's time there, and <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> converted into a study, officially named the [...] "The FDR Suite". After a brief return to student housing in the early 2000s, <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> finally set aside in perpetuity with the intention of creating Harvard's first memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.|$|R
500|$|<b>Room</b> 2 <b>is</b> one of {{the best}} {{preserved}} of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> atop Structure 4. It measured [...] north-south by [...] east-west. The doorway to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> [...] wide. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> has <b>been</b> dated to the Terminal Classic.|$|R
25|$|Inside, the {{transitions}} between levels {{are equipped with}} wide ramps and three lifts to travel between floors. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> designed to rest the eye: uniform wooden floors, white walls, etc.|$|E
25|$|The Society {{moved in}} in 2005 {{when the work}} was done. The {{basement}} became a children's center and the first story the main exhibit hall. Upstairs <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> used for office space, storage and work.|$|E
25|$|Many {{hospitals}} {{around the}} world use large ozone generators to decontaminate operating rooms between surgeries. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> cleaned and then sealed airtight before being filled with ozone which effectively kills or neutralizes all remaining bacteria.|$|E
5000|$|In {{mathematics}} and logic, a vacuous truth {{is a statement}} that asserts that {{all members of the}} empty set have a certain property. For example, the statement [...] "all cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned off" [...] will be true whenever there are no cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> In this case, the statement [...] "all cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned on" [...] would also be vacuously true, as would the conjunction of the two: [...] "all cell phones in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>are</b> turned on and turned off".|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{extension}} {{takes the}} form of a long narrow <b>room</b> running <b>the</b> length of the building. A sliding timber door opens into the main hall. One end of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> partitioned to form a commercial kitchen. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> ceiled with sheeting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Room</b> 2 <b>is</b> one of {{the best}} {{preserved}} of <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> atop Structure 4. It measured 2.9 m north-south by 0.5 m east-west. The doorway to <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> 1.8 m wide. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> has <b>been</b> dated to the Terminal Classic.|$|R
25|$|The Royal Reception Rooms at Christiansborg Palace {{are located}} {{on the ground floor}} and first floor in the {{northern}} half of the palace. <b>The</b> <b>Rooms</b> <b>are</b> used for official functions of the monarch such as banquets, state dinners, the New Year's levée, diplomatic accreditations, audiences and meetings of the council of state.|$|E
25|$|Stories tell of a ghost, speculated {{to be that}} of Mary Schenley, that is said to {{roam the}} Ballroom and Nationality Rooms. The doors to <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> locked every night, but {{furniture}} is sometimes said to be found rearranged by daylight staff. The swinging of the chandelier has been said to indicate her presence.|$|E
25|$|The Alton Towers Hotel {{opened on}} 10 April 1996 and is themed to the {{eccentric}} fictional character Sir Algenon Alton and his travels. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>are</b> decorated in a quirky English style {{with pictures of}} Sir Algenon's inventions. The hotel is four star and has 180 rooms. The hotel was the first phase in a plan to turn the theme park into a multi-day resort.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> dining <b>room,</b> on <b>the</b> other hand, saw {{extensive}} remodeling in 1895. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> size <b>was</b> {{increased by}} {{the construction of}} a bay window, parquet floor <b>was</b> installed, and <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> decorated in cherry woodwork, with a gilt and crystal chandelier and sconces. The only original item remaining left in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fireplace mantel. <b>The</b> Pink <b>Room,</b> named for <b>the</b> pink damask which covered the walls in 1895, the library, the Best Chamber (Daisy Grubb's bedroom), was also extensively remodeled.|$|R
50|$|In 1936-1937, {{the school}} {{district}} took advantage of federal Public Works Administration funds to add two classrooms, hallways, and restrooms. Heat for <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>was</b> provided by a boiler system, which replaced the wood-burning stoves used in the original classrooms. <b>The</b> intact boiler <b>room</b> <b>is</b> located in a small subfloor area underneath the boys’ restroom. <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> eventually equipped with oil heaters, and eventually gas heaters hung from the ceilings.|$|R
