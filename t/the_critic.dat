5|$|Jean and Reiss left The Simpsons {{after its}} fourth season {{in order to}} create <b>The</b> <b>Critic,</b> an {{animated}} show about film critic Jay Sherman (voiced by Jon Lovitz); the show was executive produced by Brooks. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 and was well received by critics, but did not catch on with viewers and was put on hiatus after six weeks. It returned in June 1994 and completed airing its initial production run. <b>The</b> <b>Critic</b> was moved to the Fox network for its second season. Since The Simpsons also aired on that network, Brooks was able to create a crossover between it and <b>The</b> <b>Critic.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Massenet's later years, and in {{the decade}} after his death, many of his songs and opera {{extracts}} were recorded. Some of the performers were the original creators of the roles, such as Ernest van Dyck (Werther), Emma Calvé (Sapho), Hector Dufranne (Grisélidis), and Vanni Marcoux (Panurge). Complete French recordings of Manon and Werther, conducted by Élie Cohen, were issued in 1932 and 1933 and have been republished on CD. <b>The</b> <b>critic</b> Alan Blyth comments that they embody the original, intimate Opéra-Comique style of performing Massenet.|$|E

5|$|Over {{this period}} Vaughan Williams {{composed}} steadily, producing songs, choral music, chamber works and orchestral pieces, gradually finding {{the beginnings of}} his mature style. His compositions included the tone poem In the Fen Country (1904) and the Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1 (1906). He remained unsatisfied with his technique as a composer. After unsuccessfully seeking lessons from Sir Edward Elgar, he contemplated studying with Vincent d'Indy in Paris. Instead, he was introduced by <b>the</b> <b>critic</b> and musicologist M.D.Calvocoressi to Maurice Ravel, a more modernist, less dogmatic musician than d'Indy.|$|E

GameTrailers's reviewer disliked that several famous X-Men and Brotherhood characters were not playable, but appeared only as side characters. They also cited issues with voice acting and a convoluted story. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>critic</b> from GameTrailers, G4's reviewer praised the overall story, and further praised the selection of characters for the cast. Greg Mueller of GameSpot also praised the game's vast cast of characters.|$|E
5|$|Shaw's next {{attempt at}} drama was a one-act playlet in French, Un Petit Drame, written in 1884 but not {{published}} in his lifetime. In {{the same year}} <b>the</b> <b>critic</b> William Archer suggested a collaboration, with a plot by Archer and dialogue by Shaw. The project foundered, but Shaw returned to the draft {{as the basis of}} Widowers' Houses in 1892, and the connection with Archer proved of immense value to Shaw's career.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Critic</b> was short-lived, {{broadcasting}} ten episodes on Fox {{before its}} cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 {{with a series}} of ten internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD. His early 1990s shows Sibs and Phenom, both produced as part of a multi-show deal with ABC, and the 2001 show What About Joan for the same network, were all similarly short-lived.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesian film {{historian}} Misbach Yusa Biran records Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman as {{a commercial}} success. Critical reviews, however, were mixed. An anonymous reviewer in the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad praised {{the quality of the}} film, particularly its cinematography, acting, and story. In the Malayan magazine Film Melayu, a reviewer considered the film of similar quality to Hollywood productions and praised its casting of a South East Asian as the titular detective. <b>The</b> <b>critic</b> and filmwriter Saeroen expressed concern that the film's success was not because of its quality, and opined that it was only popular because of Wijnhamer's fame.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>critic</b> and screenwriter Saeroen, {{writing for}} Pemandangan, praised Kedok Ketawa, {{especially}} its cinematography {{and the beauty}} of its scenery; he compared the film to imported Hollywood films. An anonymous review in Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad found that the film was a mix of native and European sensibilities and lauded its cinematography. According to the review, the film surpassed expectations, but it was evident that this was a first production. Another review, in Soerabaijasch Handelsblad, considered the film among the best local productions, emphasising the quality of its cinematography and acting.|$|E

50|$|The view {{of images}} in the {{critical}} perspective is when the viewers criticise the images, but <b>the</b> <b>critics</b> {{have been made in}} interests of the society, although an individual makes <b>the</b> <b>critics.</b> This way this perspective differs from the personal perspective.|$|R
5|$|The episode {{received}} ratings {{near the}} season average, and garnered generally positive reviews from critics. Brown's performance was praised, {{as well as}} the twist in his character's storyline. Also applauded were both Sam's confrontation with Dean over his recent reckless behavior and the resulting reconciliation at the episode's end. Many critics found the presence of character Bela Talbot (Lauren Cohan) in the episode to be pointless, while <b>the</b> <b>critic</b> for TV Guide enjoyed McNab's cameo and wished it had been longer.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} {{swimming}} through flames {{is connected to}} the depiction of Guido Guinizelli, a poet who influenced Dante, seeking such a state in Purgatorio XXVI. However, the depiction of swimming was transformed into an image of dancing, an act that appears throughout Yeats's poetry, within purgatorial flames. <b>The</b> <b>critic</b> Dominic Manganiello suggests that, in combining the image of dancing with purgation, Eliot merges Dante's and Yeats's poetic themes.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams wrote four concertos: for violin (1925), piano (1926), oboe (1944) and tuba (1954); another concertante {{piece is}} his Romance for harmonica, strings and piano (1951). None {{of these works}} has rivalled the {{popularity}} of the symphonies or the short orchestral works mentioned above. Bartók was among the admirers of the Piano Concerto, written for and championed by Harriet Cohen, but it has remained, in the words of <b>the</b> <b>critic</b> Andrew Achenbach, a neglected masterpiece.|$|E
