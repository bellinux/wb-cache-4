5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> who decides whether or not to take off.|$|E

5|$|It {{was first}} {{screened}} at PaleyFest in November 2008. On February 3, 2009, the episode was broadcast in the United States on Fox {{to an estimated}} 12.78 million viewers. The episode earned a 5/6.5 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, finishing in eighth place for the week. It received generally positive reviews. Commentators have noted allusions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> and a fourth season episode, {{in addition to the}} television series Lost and H.G. Wells' novel The Island of Doctor Moreau.|$|E
5|$|Coker {{was awarded}} the Navy Commendation Medal for his actions {{as part of a}} coordinated 23-aircraft attack on {{petroleum}} storage tanks in Hai Phong on August 2, 1966, consisting of four waves of A-6 Intruders and A-4 Skyhawks, firing a combination of 750 and 1,000 pound bombs and rockets. The attack was the third in a series of attacks on North Vietnamese oil storage depots dating back to June. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, Coker provided accurate guidance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> on airspeed, altitude and dive angle, while operating both the attack navigation radar system and electronic countermeasures. Despite adverse weather conditions, Coker's actions contributed to an attack that destroyed {{all but one of the}} facility's storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|Engineers Stimers and Newton {{soon began}} {{repairing}} the damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> house and reconfigured the sides from an upright position to a slope of thirty degrees to deflect shot. During this time, Mrs. Worden personally brought news of her husband's progress and recovery and was optimistic, informing the crew his eyesight would soon return {{but he would}} be laid up for some time. She also informed them President Lincoln had personally paid Worden a visit extending his gratitude. However Worden was later taken to his summer home in New York and remained unconscious for three months. He returned to Naval service in 1862 as Commander of , another ironclad.|$|E

5|$|Leonard {{arrived at}} Irish Helicopters on 31 October and was {{introduced}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> of the helicopter, Captain Thompson Boyes. Boyes {{was instructed to}} fly to a field in Stradbally, in order to pick up Leonard's photographic equipment. After landing Boyes saw two armed, masked men approaching the helicopter from nearby trees. Boyes was held at gunpoint and told {{he would not be}} harmed if he followed instructions. Leonard left with one gunman, while the other gunman climbed aboard the helicopter armed with a pistol and an Armalite rifle. Boyes was instructed to fly towards Dublin following the path of railway lines and the Royal Canal, and was ordered not to register his flight path with Air Traffic Control. As the helicopter approached Dublin, Boyes was informed of the escape plan and instructed to land in the exercise yard at Mountjoy Prison.|$|E
5|$|She {{pulled out}} of the LA Women's Tennis Championships, citing a foot injury. Her next event was the Cincinnati Open, where she fell to Clijsters in the third round. She then played in the Rogers Cup and lost to Samantha Stosur in the second round. She {{received}} a wild card entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pilot</b> Pen Tennis tournament in New Haven, but lost in the quarterfinals to Mauresmo. This became her last tournament as 1st seeded. At the US Open she won in straight set wins over Görges, Sevastova, and Peer, but lost against Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round. At the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, seeded fifth, she lost to Andrea Petkovic.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the An-124, the An-70 design makes {{extensive}} use of titanium and composites to keep weight to a minimum and increase damage resistance. Approximately 25 percent of the airframe is made of carbon-fibre composites, which are primarily used on control surfaces and the tail assembly, while aluminium and steel alloys are used {{for the rest of}} the structure. The An-70 has a designed life of 45,000hours over 15,000flights. The prototypes had a fly-by-wire flight-control system that comprised three digital channels and six analog channels; it was expected that production aircraft would have a four-channel digital fly-by-wire system. Aircraft and system information are mainly relayed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> and co-pilot via six large multi-function CRT displays, with secondary electro-mechanical instruments and head-up displays; a flight engineer position is also present on the prototypes.|$|E

5|$|The first {{aviation}} {{incident to}} result in more than 50 fatalities did not involve an airplane. On 21 December 1923, the Dixmude, a rigid airship of the French Navy, was reportedly struck by lightning and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, off Sicily, Italy. All 52 crew and passengers were killed. Nearly 10 years later, the , also a rigid airship, encountered severe weather and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, off Barnegat Light, New Jersey, killing 73 of those on board. It was another 5 years before a fixed-wing aircraft incident claimed more than 50 fatalities. On 24 July 1938, A Curtiss Hawk II crashed into spectator stands in the Santa Ana air show disaster. 52 spectators were killed {{on the ground in}} addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> of the airplane. One month later on 24 August 1938, the Japan mid-air collision in Tokyo claimed 53 lives on the ground in addition to the 5 crew members aboard both planes.|$|E
5|$|The post-flight {{analysis}} {{reported no}} major malfunctions—the only troublesome anomaly being the suit temperature controls— {{and all the}} engineering objectives of the mission were deemed successfully completed. The fuel-conservation measures {{were found to have}} worked particularly well, with even less fuel than anticipated being consumed; despite the technical changes, the official report gave full credit for this <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot.</b> The medical analysis found no significant physiological effects from nine hours of weightlessness, and noted that Schirra had received no significant radiation exposure. Analysis of the radiation-sensitive plates confirmed {{that there had been a}} very low radioactive flux inside the spacecraft, and the six ablative materials tested were all deemed broadly satisfactory despite some difficulty comparing them to each other.|$|E
5|$|USS Kelvin, {{the ship}} Kirk's father serves on, {{is named after}} J.J. Abrams' grandfather, {{as well as the}} {{physicist}} and engineer Lord Kelvin (William Thomson). Kelvins captain, Richard Robau (Faran Tahir), is named after Orci's Cuban uncle: Orci theorized the fictional character was born in Cuba and grew up in the Middle East. Another reference to Abrams' previous works is Slusho, which Uhura orders at the bar where she meets Kirk. Abrams created the fictitious drink for Alias and it reappeared in viral marketing for Cloverfield. Its owner, Tagruato, is also from Cloverfield and appears on a building in San Francisco. The red matter in the film is {{in the shape of a}} red ball, an Abrams motif dating back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> of Alias.|$|E

50|$|Acoustic sensing designs use {{ultrasonic}} sensors <b>to</b> monitor <b>the</b> <b>pilot's</b> {{head position}} while being updated by computer software in multiple axes. Typical operating frequencies are in <b>the</b> 50 <b>to</b> 100 kHz range {{and can be}} made to carry audio sound information directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot's</b> ears via subcarrier modulation of the sensong ultrasonic sensing signals.|$|R

5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the sight head was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot,</b> eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{obtained}} {{permission from}} the Military Policy Committee to renew contact with the navy, and on 31 May 1944 he appointed a review committee consisting of Murphee, Lewis, and his scientific advisor, Richard Tolman, to investigate. The review committee visited the Philadelphia pilot plant the following day. They reported that while Oppenheimer was fundamentally correct, his estimates were optimistic. Adding an additional two racks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> plant would take two months, but would not produce enough feed {{to meet the requirements}} of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant at the Clinton Engineer Works. They therefore recommended that a full-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant be built. Groves therefore asked Murphree on 12 June for a costing of a production plant capable of producing 50kg of uranium enriched to between 0.9 and 3.0 percent uranium-235 per day. Murphee, Tolman, Cohen and Tolman estimated that a plant with 1,600 columns would cost $3.5 million. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944, and informed the Military Policy Committee that it would be operational by 1 January 1945.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1927, new {{regulations}} came into effect {{which meant that}} aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers would have to carry a radio operator in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot.</b> In February {{it was reported that}} a Notice to Airmen had been issued stating that aircraft coming from the Continent in conditions of poor visibility in which the radio was not functioning correctly should land at Lympne, where repair facilities were available. In April it was reported that a new wireless station was being built at Lympne and in May it was notified that the night light was again in operation at Lympne. In July, a new system was introduced for civil aircraft flying in bad visibility between Lympne and Croydon. They were not to follow the normal Lympne–Edenbridge–Caterham–Croydon route, but instead follow one of three notified alternate routes. Aircraft were to be notified by radio whenever such conditions were declared to be put into effect, or whenever the weather had improved. This was aimed at preventing mid-air collisions between civil aircraft and those operated by the Royal Air Force. From 7 to 21 August, 600 (City of London) Squadron AuxAF and 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF were both at Lympne on their annual camp. The squadrons were flying Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. In October, a Notice to Airmen announced that the ground signals at Lympne would be displayed in a different arrangement than previously, standardisation of ground signals worldwide required the change which came into effect on 1 October. In December, a Notice to Airmen informed that in foggy weather the position of Lympne would be indicated by flares fired from the ground, to be seen by aircraft flying in the vicinity. Colour was to be at the discretion of the Civil Air Traffic Officer. The Notice to Airmen was quickly amended to state that the firing of red flares would be reserved to indicate that an aircraft was being instructed not to land at the airfield in question. In 1927 a Fokker F.VII of SABENA flew newspapers to Lympne.|$|E
