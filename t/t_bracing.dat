40|$|Reinforcing tubular joints using doubler plates {{has been}} a common {{industrial}} practice as a last minute solution to resolve punching shear problems due to axial compression. However, such reinforcements may have negative effects when the joints are subject to different loading conditions. A parametric stress analysis of T reinforced welded round-to-round tubular joints subjected to axial tension has been performed using the finite element technique. Sixteen sets of geometric parameters {{were used for the}} parametric study by varying three parameters, namely, doubler plate to chord thickness ratio, tp <b>T,</b> <b>brace</b> diameter to doubler plate length (width) ratio, d lp, and brace to doubler plate thickness ratio, t tp. The said study shows that tp T and t tp have significant effects on stress concentration factors but not d lp. The present results for T reinforced tubular joints are compared with those for the corresponding unreinforced joints obtained by the authors and other researchers. In general, the reinforced joints are as good as the corresponding unreinforced joints in withstanding axial tensioning, provided that certain criteria for the selection of doubler plates are adopted. © 1995. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the impact of {{participating}} in the school breakfast program on performance in mathematics by children of low socioeconomic status. Stanford Achievement <b>Test</b> (Harcourt <b>Brace</b> Jovanovich, 1989) scores in mathematics were collected for children who qualified for and joined the school based, publicly funded, breakfast program, in a small rural Western New York district, both before and after this program became available. There were a total of 24 children who met this requirement and joined the program during second, third, or fourth grade. A control group was comprised of children in the same school district who attended grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 prior to the implementation of the school breakfast program. These children joined the program as soon as it became available when they were in middle school. These children also qualified for the publicly funded breakfast. There were 1 1 children from this district who met this criteria. Their Stanford Achievement Test scores were gathered for first, second, third and fourth grades. While the results of this study were not significant, the trend in the data was for participation in the breakfast program to improve performance in mathematics...|$|R
40|$|We give in {{this paper}} some {{asymptotic}} Von Neumann inequalities for power bounded operators in the class C subrho intersection C sub 1. and some spacial von Neumann inequalities associated with non zero elements of the point spectrum, when it is non void, of generalized Toeplitz operators. Introducing perturbed kernel, we consider classes C sub R which extend the classical classes C subrho. We give results about absolute continuity {{with respect to the}} Haar measure for operators in class C sub R intersection C sub 1. This allows us to give new results on cyclic vectors for such operators and provides invariant subspaces for their powers. Relationships between cyclic vectors for T and T* involving generalized Toeplitz operators are given and the commutativity of left <b>brace</b> <b>T</b> right brace', the commutant of T is discussed...|$|R
40|$|To {{validate}} {{choice of}} the Cheneau brace according to scoliotic deformity type. Materials and methods Study group included 1700 patients with AIS treated by Cheneau brace [1]. Major deformity Cobb angle ranged 20 °- 40 °, spinal rotation ranged 15 °- 35 °. Age of the patients was ranged 11 - 15 years old. Radilogic mesurements and clinical presentation of the spinal deformity during the investigation were assesed [2]. Mean followup was 5 years. In this study Rigo’s clinical and radiological criteria [3] and SRS terminology were used. Results According to obtained data four scoliotic deformity patterns were defined: primary thoracic and secondary lumbar/thoracolambar curve (pattern 1); primary thoracolumbar and secondary lumbar curve (pattern 2); primary lumbar curve with/without secondary thoracic curve (pattern 3); triple curve deformity (pattern 4). This classification allowed to deifine following 6 brace types: for 1 pattern- <b>braces</b> of Tl, <b>T</b> 2, T 3 types. For 2 pattern- <b>brace</b> <b>T</b> 3 type; for 3 pattern- braces of L 1, L 2, Tl and T 2 types. For 4 type pattern- brace of CTL type. Conclusions Scoliosis deformity classification provides differentiated Cheneua brace selection according to the deformity pattern. Author detail...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Directly-connected {{internal}} {{steel bracing}} of RC frames has received some attention in recent years, {{both as a}} retrofitting measure to increase the shear capacity of the existing RC buildings and as a shear resisting element in the seismic design of new buildings. Although its successful use to upgrade the lateral load capacity of existing Reinforced Concrete (RC) frames {{has been the subject}} of a number of studies, guidelines for its use in newly constructed RC frames need to be further developed. An important consideration in the design of steel-braced RC frames is the level of interaction between the strength capacities of the RC frame and the bracing system. In this paper, results of experimental investigations aimed at evaluating the seismic response of brace-frame system and the level of interaction between the bracing system and the RC frame are discussed. For these investigations, cyclic loading tests are conducted on scaled moment resisting frames with and without <b>bracing.</b> <b>Test</b> results confirm the ability of the bracing system to enhance the strength capacity of the RC frame while maintaining adequate ductility. They also provide an insight into the causes and the levels of interaction between the strength capacities of the bracing system and the RC frame...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem that}} faced in {{physical}} education {{at the present time}} is the happening of change of culture’s values. It was indicated by changing of physically active into less bodily movement life style. This physical fondling is triggered by multifarious amenity of the usage of communication technology and transportation that caused the children as the human being (homo luden) tend to decrease and even eliminate physical activity in all daily life. This could be happened by low of their physical fitness, and motor educability of the child. An experiment method was applied, with the design of pre-test and post-test design. Data that gathered by Indonesian Fitness Test Standard and IOWA <b>Brace</b> <b>Test</b> were analyzed by using statistical technique of MANOVA. The result such as follows: First, there is a significant influence of enrichment model basic motion pass approach between physical fitness and motor educability of the children who play game activities and its children who were taught by model direct instruction. Second, there is a significant influence of social environment context, culture and geographical within the students of village and city school. Third, there is a significant interaction between enrichment of basic motion pass approach that was taught game activities and its model direct instruction with geographical environment context (within physical fitness and motor educability of the village and city school students). Conclusion: The Model of enrichment of basic motion pass approach which were applied by game activity and model direct instruction are jointly related to environment context within the physical fitness and motor educability of the village and city school. Key word: Enrichment Basic motion Approach, Direct Instruction Approach, Environment Context (countryside and city), Physical fitness, and Motor Educability...|$|R
