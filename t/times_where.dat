5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, FIG toured Europe several <b>times,</b> <b>where</b> they played at festivals at various venues, {{including}} Paris, Berlin, Rome, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Reykjavík. When Cooper and Born were performing with Henry Cow in Zürich in early 1978, Cooper invited Swiss pianist Irène Schweizer to join FIG. English filmmaker Sally Potter, who played saxophone and sang, {{joined the group}} in April 1978. Dutch trombonist Annemarie Roelofs, English singer Frankie Armstrong, Dutch woodwind player Angèle Veltmeijer, and French saxophonist and guitarist Françoise Dupety also played intermittently with the group. Some of FIG's performances consisted of up to eight women.|$|E

After a disagreement with the proprietor of the paper over attempted censorship of his column in 1970, Levin moved to The <b>Times</b> <b>where,</b> with one break of just over a year in 1981–82, he remained as resident columnist until his retirement, covering a wide range of topics, both serious and comic.|$|E
5|$|Much later, during World War I in 1916, a {{standardized}} and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution containing hypochlorite (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer, {{was developed by}} Henry Drysdale Dakin (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior work in this area). Called Dakin's solution, the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment {{of a wide variety}} of open wounds, long before the modern antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution continues to be employed in wound irrigation in modern <b>times,</b> <b>where</b> it remains effective against bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics (see Century Pharmaceuticals).|$|E

5|$|The Algodones Dunes, which border old Cahuilla shorelines, {{were formed}} by sand blown from Lake Cahuilla. This theory was first {{formulated}} in 1923. The process occurred either {{immediately after the}} lake reached modern highstands, or during earlier higher stands. Most likely, sand was transported to the dune field during <b>times</b> <b>where</b> the lake receded and its bed was exposed to wind. Various stages of Lake Cahuilla may correspond to waves of migrating dunes.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egypt venerated the lioness (the fierce hunter) {{as their}} war deities and {{among those in}} the Egyptian pantheon are, Bast, Mafdet, Menhit, Pakhet, Sekhmet, Tefnut, and the Sphinx; The lion was a {{prominent}} symbol in ancient Mesopotamia (from Sumer up to Assyrian and Babylonian <b>times),</b> <b>where</b> it was strongly associated with kingship. The classic Babylonian lion motif, found as a statue, carved or painted on walls, {{is often referred to}} as the striding lion of Babylon. The Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal is a famous sequence of Assyrian palace reliefs from c. 640 BC, now in the British Museum. The Nemean lion was symbolic in Ancient Greece and Rome, represented as the constellation and zodiac sign Leo, and described in mythology, where its skin was borne by the hero Heracles.|$|E

5|$|The {{summer after}} graduation, Baker toured Europe as a celebrity {{correspondent}} for The New York <b>Times,</b> <b>where</b> {{he wrote about}} events like the Henley Royal Regatta. Through his Princeton classmates, {{he was hired by}} Wall Street insurance firm Johnson & Higgins upon his return to the United States. Soon after, another Princeton graduate offered him a job at J.P. Morgan Bank. Hired onto a two-year trainee program, Baker earned about $20 per week. Baker befriended a rich New York socialite, Percy R. Pyne II, who had also attended St. Paul's and Princeton. Though ten years older than Baker, they quickly became friends and Pyne allowed Baker to stay at his house at 263 Madison Avenue. Pyne later introduced Baker to Jeanne Marie Scott, a socialite known as Mimi, to whom Baker was briefly engaged late in 1918. A quiet individual, Baker was embarrassed when bank executives brought important clients by his office to see him. He quickly tired of working in an office job, and looked for ways to alleviate his boredom.|$|E
5|$|Will and Cal {{attempt to}} rescue Chester {{before he is}} sent to the deeps on the 'Miner's Train', but the Styx arrive and they are forced to leave Chester behind. During the botched escape attempt, it is {{revealed}} that Rebecca, Will's adoptive sister, is actually a Styx implanted in his family to monitor him. The boys head through a series of tunnels to the Eternal City, and old stone city, estimated by Will to be from Roman <b>times,</b> <b>where</b> the air is filled with deadly bio-toxins.

There, they rest and mourn for Uncle Tam; and are told by Imago that Chester's train to the deeps will pass directly under their hiding spot shortly. They jump down into the train through a hole in the floor of the hiding spot, and find Chester. Together they ride down to the Deeps.
