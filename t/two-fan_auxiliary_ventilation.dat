40|$|This paper briefly reviews {{prediction}} {{techniques for}} determination of leakage and friction along <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> ducting systems. In order to compare various prediction techniques {{that have been}} developed over the past, a macroscopic investigation of air leakage and friction resistance of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> ducting systems has been undertaken. Measurements were conducted on 450 and 915 mm diameter fabric ducting over 100 m duct length to determine frictional resistances and the extent of leakage. Due to the high degree of accuracy required and the large volume of data that needed to be collected, electronic pressure transducers were used with computer for data recording. Conceptual models that describe the leakage characteristics of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> ducting systems were developed based on this information. It was found that these models provided good correlation with most of the existing prediction techniques. The experimental methodology relying on computer data acquisition has allowed the accuracy of measured values to be treated {{with a high degree of}} confidence. The reliability of the developed models allows prediction of leakage, frictional impedance and airflow with enhanced confidence...|$|R

There are two goals needs to meet, one is air quantity requirement and energy conservation during normal ventilation, the other is safety and quickly during gas outburst. Firstly, gas migration character and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> system placements are described in detail. Since two control goals need to reach, a dual-mode fuzzy control strategy for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> is established.

50|$|Flow-through {{ventilation}} is {{the main}} ventilation circuit for the mine. Air enters the mine from surface via a shaft, ventilation raise or adit. The air is distributed through the mine via internal ventilation raises and ramps, and flows are controlled by regulators and permanently mounted <b>ventilation</b> fans. An <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> system takes air from the flow-through system and distributes it to the mine workings via temporarily mounted ventilation fans, venturies and disposable fabric or steel ducting. Auxiliary fan and duct systems may be either forcing systems, where fresh air is pushed into mine headings, or exhausting systems that draw out contaminated air.|$|R
40|$|The current {{trend towards}} the {{adoption}} of retreat longwall mining methods and the associated rapid development of the access drivages has exacerbated the environmental conditions experienced within these workings. The combined use of roof bolt and continuous miner systems has improved the face advance rate within rapid development drivages. In order to maintain adequate dust and gas control {{it is essential that}} the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> and monitoring systems are correctly installed and maintained. The causes of many potential environmental hazards experienced within auxiliary ventilated rapid development drivages, are often attributed to a failure by the workforce and supervisory officials to maintain the correct installation, maintenance and operational standards of the ventilation and mining systems. The potential ventilation hazards encountered may include: the failure to deliver the required fresh air quantity and velocity to rapidly dilute and disperse methane gas liberated {{in the vicinity of the}} cutting face, or the failure to maintain sufficient exhaust air quantity in the vicinity of the cut to adequately capture dust produced on cutting and loading of the extracted mineral. Results of recent research studies have demonstrated that validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation models can adequately replicate examples of good and bad ventilation. CFD models may be constructed and solved to examine the relative ventilation benefits produced by alternative mining and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> configurations. These models enable the practitioner to predict and visualise the velocity, pressure and contaminant fields within an auxiliary ventilated drivage. This research project has developed a prototype educational aid, which animates and visualises these airflow and pollutant dispersion patterns within a Virtual Reality (VR) model. By introducing a pollutant such as methane into the CFD models, the VR simulation highlights regions of potential methane concentration build-up to the trainee. The application also allows the user to select/investigate the environmental consequences of enacting a number of remedial actions...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> system (AVS) and optimal equpment {{selection}} {{can be a}} problem, especially in case of very long drivages and high rock temperature. Algorithms for calculation of AVS parameters are basically developed by use of essential relationship from fluid mechanics. In a leaky duct, {{in addition to the}} variation of pressure, the flow rae varies along the duct and calculations are not straightforward. In the paper some of most successful models have been generalized and algorithms for calculations presented. Two basic models of leaking ducts are discussed: 1 st model for a duct with leakage through the flange joints: 2 nd model for a duct with an equivalent longitudinal aperture.

40|$|<b>Auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{refers to}} the systems {{that are used to}} supply fresh air to the working faces in dead end {{including}} the use of a push-pull arrangement. There are many advantages of using such a system when compared to other methods. It has been shown that for headings longer than 30 m, auxiliary fans are the only practicable means of delivering the required air quantities. Besides air quantities, air quality is another critical issue for evaluating the ventilation efficiency in underground mines. Forcing and exhausting ducts used in the push-pull system are closely associated with the ventilation efficiency. This paper focuses on the efficiency evaluation for a push-pull ventilation system by using two methods, the dead zone and the mean age of air. By using the CFD technology, the air velocity and air quality are calculated and compared in four different cases. The results of evaluation will be identical by using these two methods. It is concluded that in the push-pull ventilation system, the position of the forcing duct plays a major role on the ventilation efficiency. Also, when the forcing duct position is determined, there must be a particular position of the exhausting duct to provide best ventilation efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{optimisation}} of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{network of}} underground mines entails {{the right choice}} of fans and duct characteristics. Once the decision-making team has selected the appropriate set of ventilation hardware, the duct line is installed across a main drivage and ends up to the most productive working areas. However, when there are many possible duct line routes from the auxiliary fan to the duct line open end, {{as is the case}} in the room and pillar mining method, the choice of a cost effective duct line route, in terms of the total length and bending of the ducts involved, is important for the minimisation of the operating cost of ventilation. In this paper, the problem of finding a cost effective duct line route, among a definite number of possibilities, is tackled with a modified discrete Hopfield network. It is shown that the network provides the optimum result for a trivial case. The implementation of the network on a realistic case is shown to be superior to results from the A* algorithm. However, the feasibility of the proposed solution is highly dependent on mining issues and on the right choice of number and distribution of control points that realise all possible routes from the fan to the headings. © 2012 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the drivage advance rates {{achieved}} within the UK coal industry have increased. In the 1980 's average drivage rates were 35 m per week compared to the 100 / 150 m per week possible today. These extended rates of advance have resulted {{in an increase in}} the potential methane, dust and heat generation within the vicinity of the drivage face. In order to effectively disperse this additional pollutant load a controlled increase in air quantity is required. Although advance rates have changed, current <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ventilation</b> practice has not. UK mining law requires that the fresh air must be delivered to within 5 m of the face. This has lead to the wide spread adoption of the use of overlap auxiliary systems within mechanised drivages, since a pure forcing system set at this distance from the face would lead to excessive airborne dust. UK mining law does not at present consider on-board mounted exhaust scrubber fans to constitute an effective overlap fan within mechanised drivages. Consequently an additional overlap exhaust fan is required to be installed within such drivages. In an attempt to determine whether working conditions could be safely and economically improved within mechanised rapid development drivages utilising an on-board mounted exhaust fan, a series of preliminary full scale gallery trials were conducted. A summary of the principal findings of these trials is presented together with an outline of a series of representative CFD simulations. This thesis examines the accuracy of CFD simulations for auxiliary ventilated headings. This is achieved by utilising Laser Doppler Anenometry (LDA) in a scale model representative of an underground heading and a detailed underground measurement programme conducted in production headings. These measured airflow values are then compared with representative CFD simulations and conclusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{changing}} and stricter regulatory environment {{has caused the}} mining industries in South Africa to re-look at their individual mine health and safety departments. In 1997, after {{the report of the}} Leon Commission of Inquiry (1995), the South African Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) sent out a directive to reduce the dust concentration level to below 5 mg/m 3 at the operator’s position for the sampling period. The reasons for the high levels of dust concentrations of dust are: long headings up to 35 m, inherently high dust generation rates of coal, and the increased use of highly mechanized equipment. To aid in developing systems to reduce high dust levels, a project was formulated under SIMRAC auspices with the title of “Underground Mechanical Miner Environmental Control” to address the dust problem. The project was executed in two phases. The first phase involved laboratory tests on a continuous miner model for different ventilation and spray systems at ventilation simulation tunnel at the Kloppersbos Research Center. In {{the second phase of the}} project, tests were carried out underground, based on the findings and recommendations from the simulated tests. This paper focuses on the results and findings of the hood systems, viz., retrofitted hood system and integrated hood system. The average dust concentration for the sampling period at the operator’s position for the retrofitted hood, integrated hood system-smaller scrubber and integrated hood system-larger scrubbers were 2. 33 mg/m 3, 6. 08 mg/m 3 and 5. 98 mg/m 3 respectively. On the other hand, the equivalent average dust concentration (TWA-CONC) for an 8 - h period for the retrofitted hood, integrated hood systemsmaller scrubber and integrated hood system-larger scrubbers were 1. 53 mg/m 3, 5. 51 mg/m 3 and 4. 83 mg/m 3 respectively.

Material and Method: The risk assessment procedure includes: (1) estimating the number of healthcare visits of the TB patients at the trauma ward of emergency department in 2004; (2) determining the TB incidence rate among the healthcare workers (HCWs) of the trauma ward during 2004 - 2005; and (3) surveying the indoor environment (particularly concerning the ventilation condition) of the targeting ward. Appropriate risk management procedures were then recommended based on the guidelines provided by The World Health Organization (WHO) and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States. Results: The estimated number of healthcare visits of the TB patient at the trauma ward in 2004 was 20.
