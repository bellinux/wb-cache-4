Trace widths of 5 microns and a trace pitch of 10 microns are achievable on flexible substrates as large as 1800 x 1500 mm. Back planes for displays and keyboards can also utilize thin film transistors, TFTs, as developed for LCDs and enhanced for flexible assemblies (200 ºC processing). A flexible circuit is built on a glass carrier with an intermediate release layer. The carrier is discarded after all processing is complete, including interconnection circuits, IC chip assembly, test and rework. The assembly method uses gold stud bumps on IC chips, and corresponding wells filled with solder on the motherboard. 100 -micron pad pitch is achievable for IC chips, module cables, and <b>test</b> <b>connections.</b> Avoidance of epoxy under layers contributes to a robust capability for reworking defective IC chips.

The {{objective of this}} research was to examine the validity of this interaction equation. In doing so, it was necessary to determine the slip coefficient of A 36 steel with mill scale and to devise an accurate method to monitor the induced bolt tension, or preload. Four tension and six compression joints were tested {{in order to determine the}} slip coefficient. Two methods were used to monitor the bolt preload. First an approximate method was used. These results were used to determine the average bolt preload. This value was used in determining the slip coefficient for the tension joints. The second method used a preload cell that allowed the actual bolt preload to be measured during testing. The preload cell was used in testing the compression specimens to determine the slip coefficient. Once the slip coefficient was known and a method of monitoring the bolt preload was established, a connection simulating testing device was used to <b>test</b> <b>connections</b> subjected to various combinations of shear and tension.

The system level fault isolation expert system compares the equipment input and output status for a data stream and performs loopback tests (if necessary) to isolate the faulty equipment.

The <b>test</b> <b>connections</b> were constructed with relatively thick endplate so as to isolate the CFT column and the blind bolt as the relatively weak elements in the connection system. This study focuses on the behaviour of the connections with principal failure modes attributed by the blind bolt and the CFT column. The experiments were conducted to obtain insights into the hysteretic moment-rotation relationship, available ductility & energy dissipation capacity, observe typical failure modes, and develop relevant understandings of the Extended Hollobolt-endplate connection subjected to cyclic loading. The selected connection details were chosen to examine the influential parameters of the joint hysteretic moment-rotation behaviour. From the experimental results, two representative failure modes, bolt fracture and column face bending failure, were observed and categorized in relation to the connection configuration. The connection behaviour are described and compared with respect to the influences of bolt grade, cyclic loading procedure, tube wall thickness and concrete grade. Based on the experimental hysteretic moment-rotation relationships, an evaluation of the cyclic characteristics and an analysis' of the cumulative damage were carried out for the two representative connection categories. The joint hysteretic moment-rotation response was assessed in term of degradations of strength, stiffness, ductility, and energy dissipation. The use of damage levels and stages in the interpretation of damage evolutions for the connection behaviour is also described in this thesis. The findings of cumulative damage analysis suggest that the energy based cumulative damage index outweighs the other indices in characterizing the progressive damage process of the connections in this study. This is especially the case for those related to hysteresis loops at repeated cycles of each loading amplitude. Following the experimental study, 3 D nonlinear finite element models of the connections were developed to analyse the mechanical response of the connection. The comparison of the numerical and experimental moment-rotation envelope curve is discussed with respect to related geometric and material parameters. The connection failure modes and displacement distributions were further examined as a supplement to the experimental findings that were necessarily limited by instrumentations. This work also presents mathematical models for the hysteretic moment-rotation relationships simulating the loading, unloading and reloading segments of the hysteresis loops. Characterizing parameters were introduced to, allow for the softening slope, linear segment slope, and degradations of strength and energy dissipation. This study concluded that the proposed finite element model simulates well the behaviour of the connection with good prediction of the moment-rotation envelope curves and of the failure mode. It is also concluded that the proposed mathematical models define well the non-linear loading and unloading paths with reasonable accuracy. It is finally claimed that the Extended-Hollobolt endplate connection provides a stable improvement in strength and stiffness under cyclic loading compared with other similar connections...|$|E
