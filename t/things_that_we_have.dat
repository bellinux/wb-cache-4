500|$|The 278 Beti chiefs under Atangana's control {{began to}} oppose his primacy by the mid-1920s. His control fell {{especially}} among the Bane. In 1924, the Bane filed a complaint against Atangana in court, claiming, [...] "We work always and it is Atangana who receives the money. For all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> sent to the Europeans, such as chickens and eggs, through Atangana, we have received nothing." [...] They plotted to raise their own paramount chief and to drum up sentiment against Atangana among the common people. The French arrested the plotters for refusing to pay their taxes and provide labourers. This left Atangana still head of the Bane, but his influence had been severely curtailed.|$|E
500|$|Wenger managed Nagoya for {{the final}} time on 28 August 1996 and {{delivered}} a farewell speech, thanking the fans in Japanese. Assessing his time in Japan, biographer Jasper Rees felt Wenger had left a mixed legacy at the club, as the immediate success was followed by fluctuating league finishes; {{it was not until}} 2010 that Nagoya (under Stojković) won their first title. Wenger continues to speak fondly of his career in Japan and once likened the country to his ancestral home: [...] "It has beautiful <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> lost in Europe, beautiful things that make life good." [...] He also credited the culture for improving his temperament and rediscovering his passion for the game. Wenger returned to Japan as a television pundit for the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, and a decade later, took Arsenal to face Nagoya in a pre-season friendly.|$|E

There must really have been some depression when a man can only see the sad side of flowers or the sad side of holidays or the sad side of wine.

60|$|Since {{history is}} the story not of {{individual}} lives but of communities, {{it is inevitable that}} the inventions that figure most in the historical record are inventions affecting communications. In the sixteenth century the chief new <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to note are the appearance of printed paper and the sea-worthy, ocean-going sailing ship using the new device of the mariner's compass. The former {321} cheapened, spread, and revolutionized teaching, public information and discussion, and the fundamental operations of political activity. The latter made the round world one. But almost equally important was the increased utilization and improvement of guns and gunpowder which the Mongols had first brought westward in the thirteenth century. This destroyed the practical immunity of barons in their castles and of walled cities. Guns swept away feudalism. Constantinople fell to guns. Mexico and Peru fell before the terror of the Spanish guns.|$|E

Upon this second reason I now am, and am shewing how it comes to pass that they that are under {{the power of the}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> afore discoursed, should {{notwithstanding}} that, return to their vomit again.
