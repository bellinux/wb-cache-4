5|$|Bulgarians {{and ethnic}} Macedonians seek {{to deny the}} {{self-identification}} of the Slavic speaking minority in northern Greece, which mostly self-identifies as Greek. Extremists on all sides have been known <b>to</b> <b>fabricate</b> and reproduce falsified information, along with denying genuine information and propagating unscientific and pseudoscientific theories.|$|E
5|$|The City {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics, and proved less successful than The Hills.

5|$|Though {{the album}} cites Tony Bongiovi and Tommy Ramone {{as the head}} producers, much of the album's {{production}} was done by Stasium; Johnny {{so far as to}} insist that Bongiovi was omnipresent during the band's recording sessions. Rocket to Russias final mastering was mainly done in Bongiovi's Power Station studio. Infamous record producer Phil Spector offered <b>to</b> <b>fabricate</b> Rocket to Russia, but the band declined, feeling as though the album would not be the same without Tommy and Bongiovi.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{presents}} evidence that Deng {{was convicted of}} prostitution two years ago. Deng denies the charge and says she had been gang-raped by the soldiers who killed her husband. Deng's credibility weakens further when the defense presents a surprise witness, Daniel Achok, who testifies that he had advised her <b>to</b> <b>fabricate</b> the gang rape on her application for political asylum. The jury reached verdicts {{on two of the}} three charges, finding DiStasio guilty of unlawful imprisonment and not guilty of assault but deadlocks on the rape charge, and Benson says that he will likely serve a year in prison.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{has long}} been used in {{high-temperature}} applications. In particular, it was identified {{as one of the}} few monolithic ceramic materials capable of surviving the severe thermal shock and thermal gradients generated in hydrogen/oxygen rocket engines. To demonstrate this capability in a complex configuration, NASA scientists used advanced rapid prototyping technology <b>to</b> <b>fabricate</b> a one-inch-diameter, single-piece combustion chamber/nozzle (thruster) component. The thruster was hot-fire tested with hydrogen/oxygen propellant and survived five cycles including a 5-minute cycle to a 1320°C material temperature.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond {{is already}} used as {{radiation}} detection device. It is radiation hard {{and has a}} wide bandgap of 5.5 eV (at room temperature). Diamond is also distinguished from most other semiconductors {{by the lack of}} a stable native oxide. This makes it difficult <b>to</b> <b>fabricate</b> surface MOS devices, but it does create the potential for UV radiation {{to gain access to the}} active semiconductor without absorption in a surface layer. Because of these properties, it is employed in applications such as the BaBar detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator and BOLD (Blind to the Optical Light Detectors for VUV solar observations). A diamond VUV detector recently was used in the European LYRA program.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert Foliot (c.1110– 18 February 1187) was {{a medieval}} English monk and prelate, {{successively}} Abbot of Gloucester, Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London. Born to an ecclesiastical family, {{he became a}} monk at Cluny Abbey in France at {{about the age of}} twenty. After holding two posts as prior in the Cluniac order he was appointed Abbot of Gloucester Abbey in 1139, a promotion influenced by his kinsman Miles of Gloucester. During his tenure as abbot he acquired additional land for the abbey, and may have helped <b>to</b> <b>fabricate</b> some charters—legal deeds attesting property ownership—to gain advantage in a dispute with the Archbishops of York. Although Foliot recognised Stephen as the King of England, he may have also sympathised with the Empress Matilda's claim to the throne. He joined Matilda's supporters after her forces captured Stephen, and continued to write letters in support of Matilda even after Stephen's release.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool steels, but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and clamping cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} <b>to</b> <b>fabricate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes that are hard <b>to</b> <b>fabricate</b> and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and {{they were designed to}} exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E

40|$|Optical fibre surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) sensors offer {{a potential}} solution for monitoring low chemical concentrations in remote or in situ sensing scenarios. The SERS effect {{relies on the}} interaction of analyte molecules with nanostructured metal surfaces. We demonstrate a nanoscale biotemplating approach <b>to</b> <b>fabricating</b> these sensors, using nanoimprint lithography to replicate cicada wing antireflective nanostructures onto the end faces of standard silica optical fibres. These SERS-compatible nanoarrays are coated with silver to make them SERS active, and thiophenol and rhodamine 6 G are used as test analytes, from which strong SERS spectra are collected using both direct endface illumination and through-fibre interrogation. This combination of biological templates with nanoscale replication and optical fibres demonstrates a high-resolution, low-cost approach <b>to</b> <b>fabricating</b> high-performance optical fibre SERS sensors...|$|R
5|$|Queen conch shells {{were used}} by Native Americans and Caribbean Indians {{in a wide variety}} of ways. South Florida bands (such as the Tequesta), the Carib, the Arawak and Taíno used conch shells <b>to</b> <b>fabricate</b> tools (such as knives, axe heads and chisels), jewelry, {{cookware}} and used them as blowing horns. In Mesoamerican history, Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double-headed serpent. The Aztecs also believed that the sound of trumpets made from queen conch shells represented divine manifestations, and used them in religious ceremonies. In central Mexico, during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc, the Maya used conch shells as hand protectors (in a manner similar to boxing gloves) during combat. Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre-Columbian Lucayan Indians in the Bahamas used the queen conch as a food source.|$|E
5|$|The British {{engineering}} firm Atelier One and freelance engineer Chris Hornzee-Jones (who later {{went on to}} form the {{engineering firm}} Aerotrope in 2005) provided the sculpture's structural design, and Performance Structures, Inc. (PSI) was chosen <b>to</b> <b>fabricate</b> it because {{of their ability to}} produce nearly invisible welds. The project began with PSI attempting to recreate the design in miniature. A high-density polyurethane foam model was selected by Kapoor, which was then used to design the final structure, including the interior structural components. Initially, PSI planned to build and assemble the sculpture in Oakland, California, and ship it to Chicago through the Panama Canal and St. Lawrence Seaway. However, this plan was discarded after park officials deemed it too risky, so {{the decision was made to}} transport the individual panels by truck and to assemble the structure on-site, a task undertaken by MTH Industries.|$|E
