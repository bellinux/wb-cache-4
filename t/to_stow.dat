5|$|Hines told a {{journalist}} in June 1939 {{that he was}} seeking to join the Militia and hoped to fight in another war. He attempted to enlist in the military during World War II, despite being in his 60s, but was rejected. An article published in The Nepean Times during 1943 claimed that Hines had attempted <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> away on a troop ship in 1940, but was found and sent ashore before the vessel sailed.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} day in {{preparations}} for Friday's landing. After working through their post-sleep activities, Altman, Johnson and McArthur performed a check-out of the flight control surfaces, performed a reaction control system hot-fire, and went through communications checks with managers on the ground. The {{rest of the crew}} worked <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> away items that were used during the mission. The crew held a deorbit preparations briefing with the ground teams, and Altman and Johnson worked with the simulator on board to run through a series of landing simulations.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E
5|$|Silver forces Jim {{to use the}} map, {{directing}} them to {{a portal}} that opens on any location in the universe, which Jim realizes is how Flint conducted his raids. They open the portal {{to the center of}} Treasure Planet, discovering that the planet is really a space station built eons ago that Flint commandeered <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> his treasure. As the pirates prepare to collect the loot, Jim finds the skeletal remains of Flint, holding the missing component to B.E.N.'s cognitive computer. He reinserts it, and B.E.N. immediately recalls that Flint rigged the planet to explode upon the treasure's discovery. As the planet begins to fall apart, Silver, trying to hold onto a boat-load of gold, opts to let it go to save Jim. The survivors escape to the Legacy, which is damaged and unable to leave the planet in time. Jim rigs a makeshift rocket-powered sailboard, and rides ahead of the Legacy towards the portal. At the last moment, Jim sets the portal to Montressor Spaceport, and both he and the Legacy safely clear the destruction.|$|E
5|$|Back in Detroit, Sarif {{admits to}} Adam that the Illuminati {{are behind the}} attacks. Adam infiltrates a Humanity Front rally and discovers Sandoval's location. Sandoval admits his {{involvement}} in the kidnapping and gives Adam the lead to find the researchers. Back in Sarif HQ, Adam meets Hugh Darrow, who is currently working to stave off global warming with the newly constructed Panchaea Facility in the Arctic. Adam, along with other augmented people, also start experiencing painful glitches, with authorities urging them to have a biochip replacement. Pritchard locates the tracking beacon of one of the scientists, taking Adam back to Hengsha, where he and Malik are ambushed by Belltower. The beacon leads Adam to Tong Si Hung, who has just been implanted with the now-deceased scientist's arm. Under Tong's direction, Adam manages <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> away in a stasis pod {{in the wake of a}} staged explosion, waking up a few days later in a secret Singapore base. He finds the kidnapped scientists, and learns that the biochip malfunctions were staged to distribute the result of their research: a new biochip to control augmented humans. Adam and the scientists stage a distraction, allowing him to infiltrate the facility's secret bunker. Here he faces Namir one last time, then finds Megan. Confronted, Megan tells him that she was kidnapped for her research; the genetic key to make all humans compatible with augmentations, which she found in Adam's DNA — and to help Darrow foil the Illuminati's plans.|$|E

25|$|When transiting a surf line, or {{in other}} rough sea conditions, the {{movement}} of the boat can cause poorly secured equipment to move, which can directly injure the occupants, and adversely affect trim and stability, and thereby the safety of the vessel and its occupants. Dedicated dive boats usually provide cylinder racks <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> the scuba sets, and may also provide bins or racks <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> other heavy equipment. Larger vessels, particularly live-aboards, may also provide a camera table and fresh water rinsing facilities for washing gear after the dive.|$|E

25|$|The Bombardier CSeries {{aircraft}} {{contains a}} high proportion of composite materials and features larger windows. The CSeries cabin features large, rotating overhead storage bins, allowing each passenger <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> a sizeable carry-on bag overhead. Bombardier claims that compared to the cabins of current in-service narrowbody aircraft, the CSeries provides airlines with the highest overhead bin volume per passenger and a wider aisle that allows for faster boarding and disembarkation of passengers.|$|E
25|$|Racks {{under the}} seats {{were used for}} {{ammunition}} and rations; additional racks behind the seat backs held the squad's rifles and other stowage. A small rack for mines was added {{on the outside of}} the hull just above the tracks. In combat, most units found it necessary <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> additional food, rucksacks and other crew stowage {{on the outside of the}} vehicle. Luggage racks were often added in the field, and very late vehicles had rear-mounted racks for this crew stowage.|$|E

25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} are {{a type of}} {{outrigger trawler}} (above), with the superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a beam trawl, with the warps going through blocks {{at the end of}} the boom. This arrangement makes it easier <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and then out to the towing blocks on the booms.|$|E

25|$|Blackborrow was {{originally}} refused a post aboard the vessel {{due to his}} young age and inexperience and decided <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> away, helped to sneak aboard by William Bakewell, a friend of his, and Walter How.

His name is also the matter of some debate—it is sometimes spelled Percy, or Blackboro, or in other ways.|$|E

It is not clear to what extent either castle was rebuilt after 1213, or indeed whether the sites were amalgamated in some way. The tower was certainly in ruins by 1278, according to a deed drawn up between the Bishop of London, the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's and the Dominicans about the proposed locations of the new friary church.|$|E
25|$|Savannah {{conducted}} a successful trial of approximately two hours duration in New York Harbor to test her engine on Monday 22 March 1819. On Sunday, March 28 at 10 a.m., Savannah commenced her maiden voyage, under sail power, from New York to her operating port of Savannah, Georgia. The following morning the ship got steam {{up for the}} first time at 11 a.m., but the engine was in use only half an hour before rough weather persuaded the captain <b>to</b> <b>stow</b> the paddlewheels and revert to sail power once again. The ship reached her destination April 6, having employed the engines for a total of 41½ hours during the 207-hour voyage. In spite of arriving at 4 a.m., a large crowd was on hand to welcome the vessel into port.|$|E
