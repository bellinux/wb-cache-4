500|$|Peterson's {{most famous}} {{commercials}} were his [...] "Wake up! Wake up!" [...] spots, which began airing in the mid-1970s. Peterson borrowed the idea from another retailer in Corpus Christi, Texas. Said Peterson, [...] "Somebody <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and I followed it up. Ours {{was much more}} successful than theirs. They didn't have the store owner or a strong personality doing theirs." [...] Peterson kept his stores open from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. to accommodate customers inspired by the ad to visit his store late at night. The commercial ran less frequently in the 1980s, and last aired in 1988.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{considered}} a box office bomb in the US but generally achieved greater success both critically and commercially in Europe. Many observers found similarities with Independence Day, which also came out in 1996. [...] "It was just a coincidence. Nobody <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I was surprised how close it was," [...] director Tim Burton continued, [...] "but then it's a pretty basic genre I guess. Independence Day was different in tone – it was different in everything. It almost seemed like we had done kind of a Mad magazine version of Independence Day." [...] During the film's theatrical run in January 1997, TBS purchased the broadcasting rights of the film.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's {{performances}} in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised {{him for not}} making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list. Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed. In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: [...] "As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for {{the names of the}} songs that I would be playing. There's no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, nobody ever <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and we played all the songs that we intended to play." ...|$|E

500|$|... "No One" [...] saw the {{reintroduction}} of Richard Dormer and Paul Kaye, who portrayed Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, respectively, in {{the third}} season, last appearing in the episode [...] "The Bear and the Maiden Fair", before returning for the sixth season. Dormer was previously asked about returning to Game of Thrones {{in an interview in}} February 2015, saying {{at the time that he}} was doubtful about coming back to the series, stating [...] "they haven't <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> so I don't think so." [...] He also noted about his portrayal of the character, [...] "Beric was a noble character, a leader of men. Kind of like Robin Hood. So I thought, that's how I'll play the guy." [...] Paul Kaye's participation in the series was confirmed in mid-April 2016, with his agency posting about the casting shortly before the premiere of the sixth season.|$|E
2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, {{who does}} not appear on the {{recording}}, noted that the recording foreshadowed his departure from the band, stating: [...] "They did that while I {{was on the road}} touring for my solo record. [...] I knew that that was the ending because nobody <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me. That {{was one of the last}} straws for me, because nobody had said anything to me, and they recorded a song by one of my favorite bands. It was pretty clear I'm a big Rolling Stones fan, and they recorded the song without me. So I knew that was it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gilby Clarke's {{contract}} was not renewed {{and he was}} gone from the band by 1995. Slash stated in his book that Rose fired Clarke without consulting anyone, claiming he was only a [...] "hired hand". Clarke was not involved in the recording of 'Sympathy for the Devil', stating [...] "I knew that that was the ending [...] because nobody <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me". Clarke also mentioned that before the final show of the Use Your Illusion Tour, Rose came up to him and told him [...] "Hey, enjoy your last show". Clarke later sued the band over the use of his likeness in Guns N' Roses Pinball.|$|E

2500|$|This embittered letter {{remained}} a closely guarded secret, although a former high {{official of the}} CIA <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Chris Nelson also reported it on April 16 in his widely respected, nonpartisan foreign policy newsletter: [...] "A certain Ms. Riza was even then Wolfowitz's true love. The problem for the CIA wasn't just {{that she was a}} foreign national, although that was and is today an issue for anyone interested in CIA employment. The problem was that Wolfowitz was married to someone else, and that someone was really angry about it, and she found a way to bring her complaint directly to the President. So when we, with our characteristic innocence, put Wolfowitz on our short-list for CIA, we were instantly told, by a very, very, very senior Republican foreign policy operative, 'I don't think so.' [...] " [...] The Daily Mail of London also reported on his wife's letter when Wolfowitz was appointed president of the World Bank in 2005.|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{was fine}} of him," [...] said Miss Tyrell, eagerly. [...] "He never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and I think that’s rather fine too. I like brave men. Have {{you ever been}} overboard after anybody?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Wal, it reelly {{affected}} me more to have Miry give up so than most gals, 'cause she'd allers held her head up, and hed sich a sight o' grit and resolution; but she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She said stubbornly: [...] "She {{came and}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The boy is dead, as you know. Yes, terrible, isn't it?" [...] And {{she looked at}} him. His face was almost comic, so {{wrinkled}} up with incredulity.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, my dear Jane, Adeline <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it</b> yesterday. I am {{very sorry}} {{for you to have}} had such a charge, but what could you expect of girls cast about as they have been, always with a marching regiment?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's so," [...] said Mr. Redbrook; [...] "Zeb <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and {{she used}} to come to Mercer to see him after he got out. She ain't much like the old man, I callate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she answered. [...] "Besides, you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> did you not, {{yesterday}} afternoon? I {{know one}} of his sisters quite well, and I {{was looking forward to}} seeing something of him down here." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Morris <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The idea {{of turning}} the tables on him, in Europe; of {{watching}} him, when he was agreeably impressed by some celebrated sight--he pretends to be so artistic, you know--and then just pleading with him and bringing him round." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I {{found him}} useful here, {{especially}} when I wanted the place cleared; {{but it would}} not do, he broke one fellow's shoulder throwing him out, and it was getting me a bad name.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, Grace <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He was {{a splendid}} gardener, but {{every once in}} a while he would drink too much, and then get into a quarrel with the other help, so they had to let him go." ...|$|E
