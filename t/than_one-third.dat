The {{scattered}} historical {{remains in the}} village, indicate that Keorkeuna has been inhabited since ancient times. The Armenian chapel of Surp Stepanos, stood on the southeastern hill of the village {{until the beginning of}} the 19th century. On 23 April 1909, the Turks attacked and destroyed the village of Keorkeuna. In 1915, more <b>than</b> <b>one-thirds</b> of the villagers were killed during the Genocide. In 1947, 63 individuals from Keorkeuna migrated to Soviet Armenia, particularly from the Chelebian family. 114 individuals remained in the village after the migration process. Nowadays, the number of the residents of Keorkeuna significantly grows during the summer, when native Armenians of Keorkeuna who live in different cities of Syria or Lebanon, return to their houses for holiday. Many Armenian families from Aleppo have built private villas in the village. Keorkeuna is considered a calm summer resort for the Armenians of Aleppo and Latakia. Currently, the villages has around 25 families, with the two-thirds of them are Armenians and the rest are Arab Alawites. The only active church in Keorkeuna belongs to the Evangelical Armenians.|$|R

His division was sent without him to support Longstreet in the Knoxville Campaign, while the remainder of Bragg's army was defeated in the Chattanooga Campaign. Buckner served on the court martial of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws after that subordinate of Longstreet's was charged with poor performance at Knoxville. Buckner was briefly given command of Maj. Gen.

50|$|Whereas phase-controlled SCR {{switching}} devices {{can be used}} throughout the range of CCVs, low cost, low-power TRIAC-based CCVs are inherently reserved for resistive load applications. The amplitude and frequency of converters' output voltage are both variable. The output to input frequency ratio of a three-phase CCV must be less <b>than</b> about <b>one-third</b> for circulating current mode CCVs or one-half for blocking mode CCVs. Output waveform quality improves as the pulse number of switching-device bridges in phase-shifted configuration increases in CCV's input. In general, CCVs can be with 1-phase/1-phase, 3-phase/1-phase and 3-phase/3-phase input/output configurations, most applications however being 3-phase/3-phase.|$|R

As the war progressed, the cities of Dubrovnik, Gospić, Šibenik, Zadar, Karlovac, Sisak, Slavonski Brod, Osijek, Vinkovci, and Vukovar all came under attack by Yugoslav forces. The United Nations (UN) imposed a weapons embargo; this did not affect JNA-backed Serb forces significantly, as they had the JNA arsenal at their disposal, but it caused serious trouble for the newly formed Croatian army. The Croatian government started smuggling weapons over its borders.|$|E

5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year.
