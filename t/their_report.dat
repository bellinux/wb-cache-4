Missing documents included the 7th Cavalry's journal, or communications log, for July 1950, the record that would have carried No Gun Ri orders.

5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization that Grace {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In <b>their</b> <b>report,</b> they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E
5|$|An {{amendment}} to the Articles had been proposed by Thomas Burke, in February 1781, to give Congress the power to collect a 5% impost, or duty on all imports, but this required ratification by all states; securing its passage as law proved impossible after it was rejected by Rhode Island in November 1782. Madison joined Hamilton in persuading Congress to send a delegation to persuade Rhode Island to change its mind. <b>Their</b> <b>report</b> recommending the delegation argued the federal government needed not just some level of financial autonomy, but also {{the ability to make}} laws that superseded those of the individual states. Hamilton transmitted a letter arguing that Congress already had the power to tax, since it had the power to fix the sums due from the several states; but Virginia's rescission of its own ratification ended the Rhode Island negotiations.|$|E

5|$|At the time, the River Slea was not navigable beyond Kyme, as {{the channel}} was inadequate, {{and there were}} fish weirs and water mills on its course. Three {{attempts}} were made to obtain an Act of Parliament to authorise improvements, but all were defeated. In 1791, William Jessop and John Hudson were commissioned to prepare a new survey and plans. Jessop was a canal engineer of some repute, with experience of several navigations, including the River Trent at Newark, while Hudson was less well known, but had experience of canal building in eastern England and Yorkshire. <b>Their</b> <b>report</b> was published on 25 November 1791, and estimated that the improvements would cost £9,979.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{investigations}} by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) were launched, {{and they}} interviewed witnesses, checked documentation, and conducted on-scene {{examination of the}} plant.

Other brief investigations were conducted by state firefighters and police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, but these were ended quickly after confirming {{there was no evidence}} of the explosion and fire having been deliberately started. In a press conference held on February 17, 2008, one of the six members of the CSB team said that the explosion showed the ongoing risk from dust explosions despite <b>their</b> <b>report</b> highlighting the matter in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{questioned}} the competence of the senior Allied officers. Muirhead-Gould had been hosting a dinner party {{on the night of}} the attack, and one of the main guests was the senior United States Navy officer in Sydney Harbour, Captain Howard Bode of USS Chicago. Both officers were sceptical that any attack was taking place. Muirhead-Gould arrived aboard HMAS Lolita at approximately midnight, an action he described as attempting to learn about the situation. But members of Lolitas crew later recounted that when Muirhead-Gould came aboard he immediately chastised the patrol boat's skipper and crew, and quickly dismissed <b>their</b> <b>report.</b> Junior officers on Chicago provided similar descriptions of Bode's return on board, and members of both crews later claimed that Muirhead-Gould and Bode were intoxicated. It was only after the destruction of HMAS Kuttabul that both officers began to take the attack seriously.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, some Georgia Tech {{faculty members}} {{belonging}} to Sigma Xi started a Research Club at Tech that met once a month. One {{of the monthly}} subjects, proposed by W.

This group investigated the forty existing engineering experiment stations at universities around the country, and a report was compiled by Harold Bunger, Montgomery Knight, and Vaughan in December 1929. <b>Their</b> <b>report</b> noted that several similar organizations had been opened across the country at other engineering schools and were successful in local economic development.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{third major}} {{competitor}} joined {{the race for}} superheavy elements—the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (English: Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. They claimed to have synthesized the element 107; <b>their</b> <b>report</b> came out {{five years after the}} first report from Dubna did but provided a greater level of precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named after him, and hoping to ease the tension on the element 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to first determine the discoverers of the element.|$|E
5|$|Just as they {{finished}} <b>their</b> <b>report,</b> the detachment was fired on by Ustaše Militia.

About 20:00, Kovačević-Lala, {{one of the most}} experienced members of the detachment, was killed after being hit by a mortar round, which had a significant effect on the morale of the remaining fighters.

This caused the police to use two years to gain court permission to access the evidence. The report found no technical problems with the aircraft.
