5|$|Other natural {{patterns}} {{occur in}} foams; these are packed according to Plateau's laws, which require minimal surfaces. Such foams present {{a problem in}} how to pack cells as <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> possible: in 1887, Lord Kelvin proposed a packing using only one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces. In 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure, which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than Kelvin's foam.|$|E
5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> if in prayer, and {{positioned}} so {{low in the}} painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. The sleeve of her dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E
25|$|Plant-based paste {{tends to}} dry {{more quickly than}} silk-based pastes because the plant extract does not hold onto the oil as <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> silk. Depending on the paper used, plant pastes can dry in 10 to 15 minutes. The more {{absorbent}} the paper is, the faster it dries as the paper absorbs most of the oil.

There is, however, little research on whether female condoms are as effective as male condoms at preventing STIs, and they are slightly less effective than male condoms at preventing pregnancy, which {{may be due to the}} female condom not fitting as <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> the male condom or because it can slip into the vagina and spill semen.|$|E

25|$|Unlike show hunter classes, which reward calmness and style, jumper classes require boldness, scope, power, accuracy, and control; speed {{also is a}} factor, {{especially}} in jump-off courses and speed classes (when time counts even in the first round). A jumper must jump big, bravely, and fast but also must be careful and accurate to avoid knockdowns and must be balanced and rideable in order to rate and turn accurately. The rider must choose the best line to each fence, saving ground with well-planned turns, and lines and must adjust the horse's stride for each fence and distance.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch writer Gail Pennington praised Williams' [...] "controlled performance" [...] as well as several [...] "terrific scenes".

De Long still hoped for a change in the weather that would release them from the ice, writing in his journal: [...] "I am told that in the later part of September and early part of October there is experienced in these latitudes quite an Indian Summer". The following weeks brought no increase in temperature, and De Long reluctantly accepted that Jeannette was trapped for the winter.|$|E

They were deliberately built small, which reduced the loss when one was sunk, but limited the cargo capacity to [...] Critically, their draft was [...] when fully laden. They had five small holds, {{each with its own}} hatch. Their curved sides made them wider at the top than the bottom, and wider amidships than fore and aft. Containerisation of shipping did not begin until a decade after war, so most wartime military shipments were break bulk cargo, with goods in bags, boxes, crates, barrels and drums. This was very efficient in terms of shipping space, but loading and unloading was consequently slow and manpower intensive. It also meant that ships could be unloaded with their own tackle, without special port facilities. Loading a ship was something of an art form. The ideal was to make best use of irregular spaces. Goods had to be stowed so as to wedge everything together <b>tightly,</b> <b>as</b> items that shifted at sea could break open and cause damage to their contents and other items. A load that shifted could even cause the ship to capsize.|$|E
500|$|... "Kill Switch" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Francis Dass of New Straits Times was positive toward the episode, calling it [...] "excellent". John Keegan of Critical Myth gave the episode an 8 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode puts Gibson’s genre credibility {{to good use}} by taking standard concepts of cyberpunk and applying them to the series." [...] He did note that there are [...] "a few minor characterization issues", and that [...] "not all of the concepts are pulled together as <b>tightly</b> <b>as</b> they could be", but other than those points, he concluded that it was [...] "solid and [...] enjoyable". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. [...] The two wrote that its themes were [...] "fresh and new" [...] and that the plot had [...] "real heart to it"." [...] Shearman and Pearson wrote positively of Mulder's virtual experiencing, praising [...] "kickboxing Scully" [...] and calling her [...] "supercool". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and wrote that, while [...] "William Gibson’s cyberpunk milieu wouldn’t necessarily {{seem to be the}} best fit for The X-Files", the episode [...] "weirdly benefits from the lack of staff oversight." [...] He noted that it featured many elements to its plot, but was [...] "a rare example of an X-Files episode that works, even though it tries to do too much." [...] VanDerWerff was complimentary towards the story and called it [...] "propulsive"; he was particularly praise-worthy of the fact that Scully was featured heavily in the episode. He cited the scene wherein a virtual Scully roundhouse kicks a group of nurses {{as one of the best}} shots in the episode, and called it a [...] "hysterical moment". Brett Love of TV Squad stated that it is his favorite episode of The X-Files, considering it a [...] "great story" [...] and describing it as a [...] "tough one to beat". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's directing and noted that the entry was [...] "a great improvement over The X-Files earlier A.I. episode, first season's [...] "Ghost in the Machine".
