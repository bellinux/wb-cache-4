At the same time, THSRC also started to train local drivers and controllers. Since May 2008, all controllers working in the OCC have been Taiwanese, and since October 2008, all <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> have been Taiwanese.|$|E
5|$|From 2010, the Norwegian Rail School {{operates}} a simulator center for training motormen. It consists of six mock-ups of the Class 71 driver's cab, {{and is used}} both by the school and to train existing Airport Express <b>Train</b> <b>drivers</b> in exceptional circumstances. The simulators were built by Sydac and cost NOK35 million.|$|E
5|$|NSB Gjøvikbanen has a {{staff of}} five in administration, 36 {{engineers}} and 32 conductors. Their offices are located at Jaren Station and OsloS. This results in the Gjøvik Line being served by the same pool of <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> and conductors, unlike the other commuter train services around Oslo, who use stock and staff interchangeably. In 2007, the company had a revenue of , and a net profit of NOK 7 million.|$|E

5|$|Heavier {{suburban}} {{traffic on the}} Melbourne network saw a greater strain on the block working then used, which required {{a large number of}} manned signal boxes to enable trains to run close together. As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the Automatic Block System (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals with two arms able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to <b>train</b> <b>drivers.</b> These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.|$|E

In each station they give the permission to move on by giving a ready signal to the <b>train</b> <b>driver.</b> During the day they use a disc (which is white and has a green border) to give the ready signal to the <b>train</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|R

25|$|Where trains have {{difficulty}} stopping during low adhesion conditions {{the greatest risk}} is of passing a signal at danger or 'over running' a station. At these times <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> adopt 'defensive driving', which involves braking earlier and more gently than usual. Also less power is applied when starting trains.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s the German {{railways}} {{wanted to}} increase the speeds {{of some of their}} railway lines. One issue in doing so is signalling. German signals are placed too close to allow high-speed trains to stop between them, and signals may be difficult for <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> to see at high speeds.|$|E
40|$|Given {{that the}} {{beneficial}} effects of <b>driver</b> <b>training</b> on accident risk {{may not be}} an appropriate criterion measure, this study investigates whether professionally <b>trained</b> and experienced <b>drivers</b> exhibit safer driving behaviour in a simulated driving task compared with drivers without professional <b>driver</b> <b>training.</b> A sample of 54 police <b>trained</b> <b>drivers</b> and a sample of 56 non-police <b>trained</b> <b>drivers</b> were required to complete two tasks. Firstly to overtake a slow-moving bus on a hazardous stretch of single-lane road with bends and hills and secondly to follow a lead vehicle travelling at 55 mph in a built-up section with a speed limit of 30 mph. Results showed that in comparison with non-police <b>trained</b> <b>drivers,</b> police drivers were significantly less likely to cross the central division of the road at unsafe locations during the overtaking task and reduced their speed on approach to pedestrians at the roadside in the following task to a greater extent. Police drivers also adopted a more central lane position compared with non-police <b>trained</b> <b>drivers</b> on urban roads and at traffic lights during the following task. Driver group differences in simulated driving performance are discussed with reference to the implications for <b>driver</b> <b>training</b> assessment and skill development...|$|R
40|$|Even though train {{protection}} systems {{are used to}} avoid critical situations, the <b>train</b> <b>driver</b> remains responsible for the continuous monitoring of signal aspects and derivation of suitable actions. This requirement persists, although the position of signals shifts more and more from external signals to in-cab displays, especially with advanced levels of {{train protection}} and automatic train control. Errors in the detection and interpretation of signal- or display information and driver distraction may lead to severe accidents. Aim of our research at the Institute of Transportation Systems (ITS) is to develop innovative concepts of the <b>train</b> <b>driver’s</b> workplace {{in order to secure}} a safe and efficient railway system that keeps the driver ‘in the loop’. Therefore, we follow a user centred approach. The <b>train</b> <b>driver</b> participates directly in the development and evaluation process of new systems supporting the work in the driver’s cabin. Using our driver’s cabin simulator recently built at the ITS as a flexible vehicle platform in a simulation environment, we are able to investigate the driving behaviour and the <b>train</b> <b>driver’s</b> information processing during his or her task. From the results, we derive concepts in order to optimize the presentation of necessary information and give recommendations how to assist the <b>train</b> <b>driver.</b> In the present paper, first concepts for supporting the <b>train</b> <b>driver</b> in keeping attention and also our simulation environment and the methodology used are described...|$|R

25|$|The Kennett Government also {{initiated}} {{a number of}} reforms to {{the operation of the}} railway system, with guards being abolished from suburban trains and <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> taking over the task of door operation. Stations were de-manned, and the Metcard ticketing system was introduced to cut the need for staff even further.|$|E
25|$|The Metro's {{control centre}} {{is based at}} South Gosforth, in a {{building}} alongside South Gosforth Metro station.

The original equipment at the centre was replaced in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Oyster card, the number of customers paying cash fares on buses has dropped dramatically. In addition, usage of station ticket offices has dropped, to the extent that in June 2007, TfL announced that a number of their ticket offices would close, with some others reducing their opening hours. TfL suggested that the staff would be 're-deployed' elsewhere on the network, including as <b>train</b> <b>drivers.</b>|$|E

The workshops was erected to the south along Batman Avenues, with the storage sidings located between the running lines.

25|$|Failure by <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> to {{decrease}} speed along dangerous sections of track occasionally cause derailments; the 2005 Phú Lộc derailment {{is one such}} example, which led to 13 casualties and hundreds of injuries when a train derailed along the Hải Vân Pass between Da Nang and Huế.

Of 1,003 people surveyed, 47 percent said Deutsche Bahn was to blame for the strike, while only 25 percent fingered GDL. Nevertheless, the ARD poll found that public support for the union had slipped by five percentage points since mid-October. A second poll for the public opinion company Forsa for the newspaper Bild showed only 45 percent of the public supported GDL.|$|E
25|$|Already in {{existence}} {{prior to the}} planning for the line was a level crossing {{at the intersection of}} Fitzgerald and Roe streets in central Perth. The crossing allowed buses coming from Wellington Street Bus Station to connect with Fitzgerald Street and then run to the northern and north-eastern suburbs. Due to the need to construct a rail tunnel under Roe Street, it was considered unsafe and impractical to retain the existing level crossing, because it would be situated very near the tunnel entrance, and so make impossible for <b>train</b> <b>drivers</b> to see any vehicles on the crossing and take evasive action. That led to the construction of the Fitzgerald Street Bus Bridge.|$|E
