5|$|To {{reduce the}} optical effects workload, Ferren {{rejected}} bluescreen compositing, opting instead for rear projection. This cheaper process, he reasoned, would save time, {{and would make}} sense for elements such as the Enterprises bridge viewer, where compositing would lack <b>the</b> <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> a real transmitted image. Designer Lynda Weinman used a Mac II to create the animatics cut into the film during production, which were eventually replaced by the film's finished effects.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> copper partly {{explains}} {{its high}} electrical conductivity (59.6×106S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to silver) among pure metals at room temperature. This {{is because the}} resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice, which are relatively weak in a soft metal. The maximum permissible current density of copper in open air is approximately 3.1×106A/m2 of cross-sectional area, above which it begins to heat excessively.|$|E
5|$|The two-story Joseph F. Glidden House is {{constructed}} from locally fired brick, which is relatively soft. <b>The</b> <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> the brick has {{caused it to}} weather in a non-uniform fashion. The brick {{is said to have}} been fired at a small brickyard which once existed on the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb, near the present-day Lincoln Highway bridge. The home stands on a stone foundation and was designed by local carpenter and eventual barbed wire competitor to Glidden, Jacob Haish. Construction was completed in 1861 and the home is a prominent example of Illinois French Colonial architecture.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of <b>the</b> <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> iron, it is much easier to work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E

500|$|While {{this may}} have {{seemed like a good}} plan, Jourdan's choice of ground created {{problems}} for him later. The plain below Pfullendorf was riddled with such streams and brooks as the Ostrach, a Danube tributary, which drained out of the marshes and swamps of Pfrungenried; in the spring of most years, this was not the best choice of ground. Although from Pfullendorf and the more moderate heights {{to the north of the}} village of Ostrach, Jourdan could establish reasonable artillery positions, <b>the</b> <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> the marshland itself would diminish the impact of a cannonade on the Austrian line. The marsh was also prone to fogginess, which would hinder visual planning and tactics. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> the ground would make the use of cavalry difficult, and cavalry maneuvers would be made more difficult by the likelihood of fog. Finally, the major part of Charles' army had wintered immediately east of the Lech, which Jourdan knew, because he had sent agents into Germany with instructions to identify the location and strength of his enemy. [...] This was less than [...] distant; any passage over the Lech was facilitated by available bridges, both of permanent construction and temporary pontoons and a traverse through friendly territory.|$|E

[...] Like most critics, Q referred to the excesses of Steinman's style, citing {{the length of the}} songs (Q says that [...] "Objects..." [...] running for 10 minutes and 12 seconds is [...] "not necessary"). Unlike the original, where the epic loud songs were [...] "offset by <b>the</b> <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> stuff like 'Two Out of Three Ain't Bad'…even the ballads are Roman orgies of sound and fury." [...] This, they say, means [...] "the album's probable theme—the crushing effect growing up has on teenage dreams—seems to get lost among the thud and blunder." [...] However, overall, Q is positive, concluding with the sentiment that [...] "Ultimately, Back Into Hell may not trash its predecessor, but as a mad, crunching, stadium rock album, it's probably the best thing of its kind you'll hear this year." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1960 {{the hall}} needed repair and decoration, and dry rot {{was found in}} the roof. [...] In 1963 Robert Grosvenor, 5th Duke of Westminster, decided to {{demolish}} {{the main part of the}} Waterhouse building and the private wing, retaining the chapel, clock tower and stables. [...] A new building was commissioned by the Duke who appointed John Dennys, his wife's brother-in-law, as architect. Dennys had earlier worked on Saighton Grange on the Eaton estate. The intention was to build a modern, manageable home. [...] The result was a rectangular, flat-roofed building, faced with white Travertine, its [...] "whiteness [...] a stark contrast to <b>the</b> <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> the Cheshire landscape". Its construction began in 1971, it took less than years to build, and cost £459,000 (...) [...] The exterior had a central porte-cochère on the entrance front. The house followed an asymmetrical plan, with two storeys plus a basement containing a swimming pool. A central two-storey hall gave access to the principal rooms, with the main reception rooms being on the first floor. The decor included wall coverings in silk and woodblock floors.|$|E

Too corny for Vanessa Carlton, too sophomoric for Jewel, too whispy for Enya." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote that in the song Lee sounds [...] "like a very average Middle American girl who yearns to be 'Good Enough' but who suffers from an above-average attraction to magnetic and destructive dudes." [...] A writer for Sputnikmusic praised <b>the</b> <b>softness</b> <b>of</b> the song giving it a grade of 4.5. Although Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian praised the song, he added that it couldn't match [...] "the haunting beauty" [...] of [...] "My Immortal".
