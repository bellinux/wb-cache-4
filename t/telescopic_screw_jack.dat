50|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>jacks</b> {{have now}} largely been {{replaced}} by hydraulic jacks. This was encouraged in 1858 when jacks by the Tangye company to Bramah's hydraulic press concept were applied to the successful launching of Brunel's , after two failed attempts by other means. The maximum mechanical advantage possible for a hydraulic jack is not limited by the limitations on <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> and can be far greater. After World War II, improvements to the grinding of hydraulic rams {{and the use of}} O ring seals reduced the price of low-cost hydraulic jacks and they became widespread for use with domestic cars. <b>Screw</b> <b>jacks</b> still remain for minimal cost applications, such as the little-used tyre-changing jacks supplied with cars.|$|R
50|$|The <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> {{consists}} of two simple machines in series; the long operating handle serves as a lever whose output force turns the screw. So the mechanical advantage is increased by a longer handle {{as well as a}} finer screw thread. However, most <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> have large amounts of friction which increase the input force necessary, so the actual mechanical advantage is often only 30% to 50% of this figure.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} ram BOPs of the 1920s {{were simple}} and rugged manual devices with minimal parts. The BOP housing (body) had a vertical well bore and horizontal ram cavity (ram guide chamber). Opposing rams (plungers) in the ram cavity translated horizontally, actuated by threaded ram shafts (piston rods) {{in the manner}} of a <b>screw</b> <b>jack.</b> Torque from turning the ram shafts by wrench or hand wheel was converted to linear motion and the rams, coupled to the inner ends of the ram shafts, opened and closed the well bore. Such <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> type operation provided enough mechanical advantage for rams to overcome downhole pressures and seal the wellbore annulus.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{data have}} shown that due to the {{technical}} ease, low-morbidity, and lower complication rates, the in situ single-implant fixation is the current standard for stabilization of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) fixation. Multiple-implant fixation {{is thought to be}} combined with a higher incidence of serious complications. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate single- vs. multiple-implant fixation regarding strength and stiffness. Furthermore, different <b>screw</b> designs, including <b>telescopic</b> <b>screw,</b> were evaluated regarding the stiffness, strength, and especially fixation failure. Forty porcine proximal femurs were sectioned through the physeal line using a gigli saw and stabilized with a 7. 3 -mm stainless steel AO <b>screw,</b> a dynamic <b>telescopic</b> <b>screw,</b> three 1. 6 -mm Kirschner wires (K-wires), and three 2. 0 -mm K-wires. The femurs were biomechanically tested to determine failure load (N) and stiffness (N/mm). No significant differences were found regarding failure load and stiffness between the two screw groups. The 2. 0 -mm K-wire construct was significantly the strongest and stiffest fixation. The 1. 6 -mm K-wire fixation had the lowest values, but not statistically significant. Regarding the fixation failure, no femoral shaft fracture occurred. SCFE stabilization with three 2. 0 -mm K-wires leads to increased stability over single-screw fixation and 1. 6 -mm K-wire fixation. However, none of the two screws seemed to be superior in fixation stability and fixation failure...|$|R

50|$|A {{jockey wheel}} is a {{retractable}} adjustable-height wheel {{used on the}} front of trailers with either a single axle (two running wheels) or more close-coupled axles at or near the centre of gravity whereby without additional support, the trailer would not remain 'level'. The jockey wheel is situated close to the towing hitch and has a built-in <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> to enable the trailer nose to be lifted over the tow ball of a car or other powered vehicle. The <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> can then be used to gently lower the trailer nose onto the tow ball. Once securely attached to the towing vehicle, the jockey wheel's jacking action is fully retracted for stowage. The jockey wheel is also unclamped and lifted as far as possible to give the greatest ground clearance before reclamping prior to a journey being made.|$|R

40|$|Students at Karlstad University {{has carried}} out a degree project within the Study Programme in Mechanical Engineering. The {{projects}} main purpose is to apply {{the knowledge of the}} Programme and shall be carried out together with a company. The project shall be driven out independently and lead to both an oral and a written presentation. Â  This report describes a work of improvement for Metso Paper in Karlstad, referring to the motor and drive train mechanism of two <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> that is used to tightening the wind or felt in the paper machine. This project has lead to a complete proposition, a description of manufacturing and is founded upon an asynchronous motor with a thoroughgoing drive shaft with two planetary gear boxes on both side of the motor. This solution is a result of an evaluation of different concept (chapter 2), regarding common motors and gears on the market. The reason that we used this motor and gears is mainly due to the minor space requirements that such solution can accomplish, with an inline drive train. The solution shall be able to fit different configurations of <b>screw</b> <b>jacks,</b> regarding the size of motor, ratio of gears and the length between the jacks. This is mainly done with adjustments of the holder, to fit the motor {{and the rest of the}} drive train. But this is basically the same solution. Subsequently the motor, gears and other components is selected accordingly to this report and we have chosen to show our solution fully on the <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> A 50 that is placed in configuration that is about 6 m apart. Further, due to the conditions in the paper machine, a cover has been designed to prevent the paper pulp to come in direct contact with motor and drive train. Â  The requirements that Metso Paper has set up is that the solution should be able to come as a module, meaning in our case that the motor, drive train and holder can be delivered as one unit together with a parallel shaft that connects the two <b>screw</b> <b>jacks.</b> ...|$|R
