5|$|On February 6, 2007, Ariel and Thorn joined Elijah Burke, Matt Striker, and Marcus Cor Von {{in forming}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> stable. Ariel began {{accompanying}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> {{to the ring}} during their matches, and appeared at WrestleMania 23, managing <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> during their match against the ECW Originals. Shortly afterward, Burke announced a match between Thorn and CM Punk, after Punk had betrayed <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed,</b> but Thorn lost. After the match, Thorn quit <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed,</b> as {{none of the other}} members interfered during the match to help him. A few weeks later, on May 18, Martinez was released from her WWE contract. In a 2013 interview, Martinez blamed her release on a confrontation with Dave Batista.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} WrestleMania, both <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> and the ECW Originals began {{attempting}} to recruit CM Punk into their stables. On the April 3 episode of ECW, Cor Von eventually told Punk {{to choose a}} side, stating that Punk was either with <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> or against them. The following week, Punk made his decision and joined <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed,</b> shaking hands with Burke in the ring. The next week, his presence immediately created tension within the group, as he berated Cor Von and Thorn for losing and undermined Burke's position {{as the leader of}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed.</b> Later that episode, Burke faced Van Dam in a singles match. Punk attempted to interfere, sliding a steel chair into the ring, but Van Dam got to it first and hit Burke with it. Afterward, Punk apologized to Burke. The following week, Punk apologized again, but was forced by Burke to miss an eight-man elimination tag team match between the Originals and <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed.</b> In retaliation, Punk attacked Burke, causing him to lose the match, and left <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed.</b>|$|E
5|$|On April 10, Punk briefly {{became a}} villain by joining <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> alliance, after several weeks {{in which both}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> and the ECW Originals had {{attempted}} to recruit him. Two weeks later, however, Punk betrayed <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> during a four-on-four elimination match between <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> and ECW Originals by kicking New Breed leader Elijah Burke {{in the back of}} the head and costing them the match. After the match, Punk proceeded to deliver his finisher, the Go To Sleep, on Burke and sarcastically apologized before leaving the ring alone, becoming a fan favorite again. At Judgment Day, Punk defeated Burke in his first singles match on a pay-per-view. Punk then went on to One Night Stand and teamed up with Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman in a tables match to defeat <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed.</b>|$|E

5|$|In early March, Dreamer {{challenged}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> to a {{match at}} WrestleMania 23 {{on behalf of}} the Originals. The following week, Dreamer won a battle royal featuring members of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> and the Originals. In the final weeks leading up to WrestleMania, the stables continued to clash, with Van Dam defeating Burke on the March 27 episode of ECW. This provoked an attack on Van Dam by the other New Breed members, until the Originals made the save. At WrestleMania, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> members lost to the ECW Originals in an eight-man tag team match, but on the following episode of ECW on Sci Fi, they defeated the ECW Originals in an extreme rules rematch.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> {{instantly}} began feuding {{with the}} ECW Originals. They faced off in several matches throughout the year, including at WrestleMania 23. After this, both groups began recruiting CM Punk, who elected to join <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed.</b> Two weeks later however, {{he turned on}} Burke during a match. Thorn and Ariel left the stable shortly afterward as well. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> continued to feud with the Originals and Punk, and also with The Major Brothers, a new tag team who had defeated Striker and Cor Von in their debut match. By June 2007, the stable had dissolved, with the three remaining members quietly separating.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, Striker aligned {{himself with}} Mr. McMahon's New Breed stable, along with Elijah Burke, Kevin Thorn, and Marcus Cor Von. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> {{immediately}} engaged {{themselves in a}} feud with the ECW Originals (Rob Van Dam, Tommy Dreamer, Sabu and The Sandman). At WrestleMania 23, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed</b> was defeated by the ECW Originals in an 8-man tag team match, but won a rematch on the following episode of ECW. In {{the midst of the}} feud, tension began to appear between the leader Elijah Burke and Striker, after Striker and Cor Von were defeated by the debuting Major Brothers. As a result, Striker began trying to avenge the loss to the Major Brothers and defeated Brett Major on the May 22 episode of ECW. The feud with the Originals lost momentum, however, as Sabu was released from his WWE contract in mid-May, and the feud ended at the One Night Stand pay-per-view, when Striker, Cor Von, and Burke lost to Dreamer, Sandman, and CM Punk in a tables match.|$|E

Throughout the remainder of 2007 and most of 2008, he was rarely used in a prominent role and was released in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Selle Français (SF) is a {{breed of}} sport horse from France. It is renowned {{primarily}} for its success in show jumping, but many {{have also been}} successful in dressage and eventing. An athletic horse with good gaits, it is usually bay or chestnut in color. The Selle Français was created in 1958 when several French riding horse breeds were merged into one stud book. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>breed</b> was meant {{to serve as a}} unified sport horse during a period when horses were being replaced by mechanization and were transforming into an animal used mainly for sport and leisure.|$|E

50|$|As one of <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> <b>breeds,</b> <b>the</b> {{standards}} for this animal {{have changed in}} recent generations.

Historically, breeding schemes emphasized structure idealized for stereotyped, smooth and even paced gait. <b>The</b> <b>newer</b> examples of this breed display refinement in the torso, the nasal bones and around the mouth. These morphological changes confer increased degrees of freedom in joint movement and by extension, increased versatility generally in range and types of motion.|$|R
5|$|The AKC {{accepted}} {{registration of}} <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>breed</b> in 1926, {{two years after}} Miniature Schnauzers {{were introduced to the}} United States. They were originally known as Wirehaired Pinschers. International Kennel Club classifications vary; in the United Kingdom and Australia they fall within the Utility Group, while in Canada they are in the Working Group. In the AKC the Miniature Schnauzer is classed with the terriers. It was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1948 and also classed as a terrier. The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer is generally considered to begin with Ch. Dorem Display, the first Miniature Schnauzer to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He was born 5 April 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. Almost every living Miniature Schnauzer in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Roberts {{stunned the}} racing world {{when he left}} Yamaha after more than 25 years {{to start his own}} {{motorcycle}} company. Roberts had grown weary of battling over the direction he felt the Yamaha team needed to pursue. Basing his new company in England {{to take advantage of the}} Formula 1 industry, Roberts built a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine with the engineering assistance of Tom Walkinshaw Racing. He decided to take advantage of rules allowing lighter weights for three-cylinder motorcycles after observing the agility and handling advantage of Spencer's Honda NS500 during the 1983 season. Unfortunately, by the time the motorcycle had been developed, tire technology had improved to the point where any advantage over four-cylinder bikes had been negated. The motorcycle did manage to win a pole position with rider Jeremy McWilliams taking the top qualifying position at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix against <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>breed</b> of 990cc four-stroke MotoGP motorcycles.|$|E

Believing Eris dead, Nowe and Manah pursue Gismore, but are met by Seere, who unsuccessfully tries to stop them. When they confront Gismor, he reveals {{himself to be a}} vindictive survivor of the Empire from eighteen years before. Defeated, Gismor destroys the final seal himself, releasing Angelus from her imprisonment. After Seere reveals the true consequences of Manah's actions, Nowe and Legna pursue Angelus. When they find her, they find that Angelus has been driven mad by the pain of being the final seal. Caim asks them to kill her, and as she dies, he and Angelus share a final moment together before fading away. With the seals destroyed, the world begins to fall into chaos and Manah is driven mad by the memories of her actions eighteen years before. Legna then takes Nowe to the fortress of the holy dragons, where they hear a prophecy concerning Nowe: according to the prophecy, Nowe is a New Breed created to aid the dragons in their war against the Watchers. Nowe then reunites with Eris, who had been healed by Seere, and frees Manah from her madness. Legna then takes the three to the Promised Land, a dragon stronghold that holds the Bone Casket, an object given to the dragons by and imbued with the power of the Watchers that can speed up Nowe's evolution into <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Breed.</b> It is also where Seere has gone to initiate a new Goddess of the Seal. The game has three endings, each achieved on a separate playthrough.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the criteria used by farmers in their decisions to adopt or reject <b>new</b> sheep <b>breeds.</b> <b>The</b> method used Ethnographic Decision Tree Modelling to elicit decision criteria {{used by the}} decision makers when making real-world decisions. The objectives of the research were to identify the main decision criteria or reasons for adopting <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>breeds,</b> and to identify the main decision criteria or reasons for rejecting <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>breeds.</b> Rather than using diffusion or economic models to study farmers' decision making, this research has presented an alternative approach to understand farmer's decisions {{from their point of}} view. The approach was called Ethnographic Decision Tree Modelling. Forty farmers consisting of 26 adopters and 14 non-adopters from different parts of the Canterbury Region were involved. Ethnographic interviews and participant observation were used to elicit decision criteria in order to build a decision tree. The decision tree model was also tested against an independent sample of 20 adopters and non-adopters in order to test the model's predictability. It is concluded that ethnographic decision tree modelling can be used to elicit the main criteria used by farmers in their decisions whether to adopt or reject agricultural innovations such as <b>new</b> sheep <b>breeds.</b> These decision criteria were either specific aspects or constraints which the farmers used in the decision processes from their own perspectives. These criteria were presented in a decision tree. The results showed that those farmers who believed that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>breeds</b> of sheep could improve the genetic merits of their stock and expect to produce financial returns and did not have the constraints of time, ram availability and its cost would adopt the breeds. Those who did not believe that the breeds could improve the genetic merits would not adopt the breeds. Other factors associated with disbelief in genetic improvement were export restrictions and health risk. Furthermore, although few farmers had indicated their belief in genetic improvement they did not adopt because of the constraints of time, ram availability and its cost. The decision model was tested and gave a predictability of 95 per cent...|$|R
