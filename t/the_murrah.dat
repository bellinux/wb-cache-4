5|$|The attack led to {{engineering}} improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces, improvements which {{were incorporated into}} the design of Oklahoma City's new federal building. The National Geographic Channel documentary series Seconds From Disaster suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Murrah</b> Federal Building would probably have survived the blast had it been built according to California's earthquake design codes.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the bombing, the U.S. Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which {{tightened}} the standards for habeas corpus in the United States, as well as legislation designed to increase the protection around federal buildings to deter future terrorist attacks. On April 19, 2000, the Oklahoma City National Memorial was dedicated on the site of <b>the</b> <b>Murrah</b> Federal Building, commemorating the victims of the bombing. Annual remembrance services are held at the same time of day as the explosion occurred.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh entered Oklahoma City at 8:50a.m. At 8:57a.m., the Regency Towers Apartments' lobby {{security}} camera that had recorded Nichols' pickup truck three days earlier recorded the Ryder truck heading towards <b>the</b> <b>Murrah</b> Federal Building. At the same moment, McVeigh lit the five-minute fuse. Three minutes later, still a block away, he lit the two-minute fuse. He parked the Ryder truck in a drop-off zone situated under the building's day-care center, exited {{and locked the}} truck, and as he headed to his getaway vehicle, dropped {{the keys to the}} truck a few blocks away.|$|E
5000|$|Seven clans make up <b>the</b> Al <b>Murrah,</b> {{according}} to Donald Cole, an anthropologist that has studied <b>the</b> Al <b>Murrah.</b> [...] Travelling {{as much as}} 3000 km each year, the tribe comprises approximately 15,000 individuals. One of the most noted names among Al <b>Murrah</b> is <b>the</b> leader (shaikh) Sulaiman Bin Ghanim, who lived somewhere between 950-1100 AD.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> Āl <b>Murrah,</b> a Bedouin {{tribe in}} Saudi Arabia, {{practice}} nomadic pastoralism to this day. They continue {{to resist the}} pressures to settle exerted by government sponsored settlement programs, {{as well as the}} rise of a modern capitalist economy, whose growth increases the cost of living. <b>The</b> Āl <b>Murrah’s</b> motives for resisting sedentarization are based on a collectivist value system that defines a high quality of life based on accessing the desert and camels’ milk, having the freedom to decide when and where to herd their camels, and gaining the respect of their family and community. These factors are contingent upon the preservation of <b>the</b> Āl <b>Murrah’s</b> segmented tribal structure. Conflict arises when modern sedentary societies institute policies that emphasize increasing the standard of living without taking into account the policies’ effects on Bedouin quality of life. Understanding <b>the</b> Āl <b>Murrah’s</b> motives for maintaining their nomadic lifestyle can help government and non-profit agencies develop programs that interact with the Bedouin in more culturally sensitive ways...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the 1834 peasants revolt, Ein Siniya {{belonged to}} <b>the</b> Bani <b>Murrah</b> tribe. After <b>the</b> revolt, the sheikhs were {{appointed}} by Ibrahim Pasha. In 1838, Biblical scholar Edward Robinson found {{the village to}} be surrounded with vineyards and fruit-trees. There were also gardens of vegetables, watered from a well. [...] It was further noted as Muslim village, located in <b>the</b> Beni <b>Murrah</b> region, north of Jerusalem.|$|R
5|$|The EMS {{command post}} {{was set up}} almost {{immediately}} following the attack and oversaw triage, treatment, transportation, and decontamination. A simple plan/objective was established: treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible, supplies and personnel to handle {{a large number of}} patients was needed immediately, the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner's office, and measures for a long-term medical operation needed to be established. The triage center was set up near <b>the</b> <b>Murrah</b> Building and all the wounded were directed there. Two hundred and ten patients were transported from the primary triage center to nearby hospitals within the first couple hours following the bombing.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Murrah</b> Federal Building {{had been}} {{considered}} so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities, also known as The Marshals Report, the findings of {{which resulted in a}} thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from Level 1 (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.|$|E
5|$|The nine-story building, {{built in}} 1977, {{was named for}} a federal judge and housed fourteenfederal agencies, {{including}} the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps. <b>The</b> <b>Murrah</b> building was chosen for its glass front—which was expected to shatter under {{the impact of the}} blast—and its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street, which might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect the occupants of nearby non-federal buildings. In addition, McVeigh believed that the open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposes. The attack was planned to take place on April 19, 1995, to coincide with the anniversary of the Waco siege and the 220th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.|$|E

Historically, Al Murrah was a tribe of camel-herding nomads, who controlled and travelled through a vast area of the Arabian Peninsula.|$|R
5|$|Within {{the first}} hour, 50people were rescued from <b>the</b> <b>Murrah</b> Federal Building. Victims {{were sent to}} every {{hospital}} in the area. The day of the bombing, 153 people were treated at St. Anthony Hospital, eight blocks from the blast, over 70 people were treated at Presbyterian Hospital, 41 people were treated at University Hospital, and 18 people were treated at Children's Hospital. Temporary silences were observed at the blast site so that sensitive listening devices capable of detecting human heartbeats {{could be used to}} locate survivors. In some cases, limbs had to be amputated without anesthetics (avoided because of the potential to induce coma) in order to free those trapped under rubble. The scene had to be periodically evacuated as the police received tips claiming that other bombs had been planted in the building.|$|E
5|$|For twoyears {{after the}} bombing the only {{memorials}} to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding {{the site of the}} building. Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996, when <b>the</b> <b>Murrah</b> Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing. On July 1, 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624submissions. The memorial was designed at a cost of $29million, which was raised by public and private funds. The memorial is part of the National Park Service and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg. It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 19, 2000, exactly five years {{after the bombing}}. Within the first year, it had 700,000visitors.|$|E
5|$|Federal agents {{obtained}} a warrant {{to search the}} house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned {{that he was being}} hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which <b>the</b> <b>Murrah</b> Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.|$|E

The chairs are also grouped according to the blast pattern, with the most chairs nearest the most heavily damaged portion of the building. The westernmost column of five chairs represents the five people who died but were not in <b>the</b> <b>Murrah</b> Building (two in the Water Resources Board building, one in the Athenian Building, one outside near the building, and one rescuer). The 19 smaller chairs represent the children killed in the bombing. Three unborn children died along with their mothers, and they are listed on their mothers' chairs beneath their mothers' names.|$|E

500|$|Once the {{explosion}} {{took place at}} the Alfred P. Murrah building, chaotic response filled the surrounding streets. Those who were able to flee <b>the</b> <b>Murrah</b> building did so, while others, stuck in the rubble, awaited the assistance of rescue workers and volunteers. As reported on CNN, other federal buildings in the downtown area were not fully evacuated, but those who were able to leave the city were encouraged to do so. This traffic, along with the people leaving places around <b>the</b> <b>Murrah</b> Building clogged streets, delaying the arrival of rescue crews and relief agencies.|$|E
500|$|A {{resident}} of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He stated in his authorized biography {{that he wanted}} to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in Little Rock, Arkansas, {{because of the presence of}} a florist's shop on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. <b>The</b> <b>Murrah</b> building had been previously targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell. The group had plotted to park [...] "a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer." [...] After Snell's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied, he was executed the same day as <b>the</b> <b>Murrah</b> bombing.|$|E
500|$|No major federal {{financial}} assistance was {{made available to}} the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing, but <b>the</b> <b>Murrah</b> Fund set up {{in the wake of the}} bombing attracted over $300,000 in federal grants. Over $40million was donated to the city to aid disaster relief and to compensate the victims. Funds were initially distributed to families who needed it to get back on their feet, and the rest was held in trust for longer-term medical and psychological needs. By 2005, $18million of the donations remained, some of which was earmarked to provide a college education for each of the 219children who lost one or both parents in the bombing.
