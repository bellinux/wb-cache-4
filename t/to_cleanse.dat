In Brood War, Raszagal directs Zeratul and Artanis <b>to</b> <b>cleanse</b> the Zerg from Shakuras and welcomes Sarah Kerrigan as an ally in their mission.

It quickly becomes apparent that Kerrigan has mentally subverted Raszagal and has been using her to manipulate events from the beginning. Zeratul captures Raszagal, but is unable to hold off the Zerg forces long enough to escape. Realizing that the matriarch is beyond redemption from Kerrigan's influence, Zeratul kills Raszagal. Raszagal's mind is freed by the lethal blow, and she dies thanking Zeratul for releasing her, naming him as her successor as leader of the dark templar.|$|E
