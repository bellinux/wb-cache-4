25|$|Now {{differences}} between the contemporary squid and octopus samples became very clear. In the octopus, broad bands of fibers passed across {{the plane of the}} tissue and were separated by equally broad bands arranged in a perpendicular direction. In the squid there were narrower but also relatively broad bundles arranged in the plane of the section, separated by thin partitions of perpendicular fibers. It seemed I had found a means to identify the mystery sample after all. I could distinguish between octopus and squid, and between them and mammals, which display a lacy network of connective tissue fibers. After 75 years, the moment of truth was at hand. Viewing section after section of the St. Augustine samples, we decided at once, and beyond any doubt, that the sample was not whale blubber. Further, the connective tissue pattern was that of broad bands in the plane of the section with equally broad bands arranged perpendicularly, a structure similar to, if not identical with, that in my octopus sample. The evidence appears unmistakable that the St. Augustine sea monster was in fact an octopus, but <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> fantastic. Even though the sea presents us from time to time with strange and astonishing phenomena, the idea of a gigantic octopus, with arms 75 to 100 feet in length and about 18 inches in diameter at the base—a total spread of some 200 feet—is difficult to comprehend.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the release}} of The Joshua Tree, critics praised [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". Steve Morse of The Boston Globe noted the [...] "bell-like tones from the Edge fram a search for heaven" [...] and along with the {{subsequent}} track on the album, [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For", these songs showed how the group were [...] "pilgrims still on a quest; not preachers who claim to have found answers". The Bergen Record echoed these sentiments, saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest. Rolling Stone called it [...] "assertive rock" [...] in their review of The Joshua Tree. The San Diego Union-Tribune said of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", [...] "the music charges, like someone fleeing for life". The Washington Post said the track is [...] "a bit oblique lyrically, but <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> clear in Bono's resolute delivery, Dave (the Edge) Evan's quavering guitar, Adam Clayton's cathedral bass and Larry Mullen's rolling thunder drums".|$|E
500|$|An analogy has {{frequently}} been drawn between the European Crusades of the Middle Ages {{and the modern}} day Zionist movement. This view, which has been espoused by Arab media and political leaders, has also been discussed in Israeli academia. Prawer was often asked to comment on this analogy, and claimed that a major difference was that the Jews settled the land and worked it, whereas the Crusaders lorded over a conquered land worked by the natives. [...] Ronnie Ellenblum, a lecturer at Hebrew University, identifies a subliminal objective in Prawer's work to draw {{a distinction between the}} two: [...] "He's always writing about the Crusaders' manpower shortage and about their not settling the land...He claims that their presence here was principally urban, consisting of nobility and merchants. This is why they lost in the end. <b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> obvious: If we bring enough immigrants, and if we settle the land, we are bound to succeed." [...] (Ellenblum himself has shown that Crusader settlement in the Holy Land was much more widespread than previously thought and has found evidence of hundreds of Crusader farms.) But he also notes that [...] "if Joshua Prawer were alive today he would no doubt deny any linkage between his Zionist political beliefs and the model of segregation that he developed." ...|$|E

500|$|Twitterbots {{are capable}} of {{influencing}} public opinion about culture, products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication. The New York Times states, [...] "They have sleep-wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing, making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs." [...] The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing, all of which depends on {{the intention of the}} person purchasing or creating the bot. The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal. Looking at the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the journal notes, [...] "people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media, treating {{them as if they were}} real people or real places." [...] The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere. While the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human-Computer Interaction, <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm. Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular, push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation, spam and/or slander.|$|E

2500|$|The first genetic {{work was}} {{conducted}} {{from the early}} 1960s when, {{in connection with the}} development of blood typing techniques for cattle parentage testing, Dr. J. G. Hall of the Animal Breeding Research Organisation (Edinburgh) studied the blood groups of the Chillingham herd. The herd was found to be remarkably homozygous, and this is what would be expected from their long history of inbreeding. These findings were confirmed in a later microsatellite DNA study. Mitochondrial DNA [...] is of the same T3 sub-haplogroup as most European cattle though Chillingham cattle do possess certain rare variants; it is not yet clear what <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> for understanding the history and continuing survival of the breed.

2500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted that Jill Murphy's The Worst Witch series (first {{published}} in 1974 by Allison & Busby), {{is set in a}} school for girls, [...] "Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches", reminiscent of Hogwarts. The story concerns an awkward pupil at a boarding-school for witches, who faces a scheming rival student. Her professors include a kindly and elderly headmistress and a bullying, raven-haired potions teacher. Murphy has commented on her frustration at constant comparisons between her work and Harry Potter: [...] "It's irritating … everyone asks the same question and I even get children writing to ask me whether I mind about the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and pointing out similarities. Even worse are reviewers who come across my books, or see the TV series, and, without taking the trouble to find out that it's now over quarter of a century since I wrote my first book, make pointed remarks about 'clever timing' – or say things like 'the Worst Witch stories are not a million miles from J K Rowling's books'. <b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> really quite insulting!" ...|$|E
2500|$|His view of {{the gods}} is {{traditional}} but more self-consistent than Homer's and more reverent. He never depicts gods in a demeaning role. He seems indifferent to the intellectual reforms that were shaping {{the theology of the}} times. Thus an eclipse is not a mere physical effect, as contemplated by early thinkers such as Thales, Anaximander and Heraclitus, nor was it even a subject for bold wonder, as it was for an earlier poet, Archilochus; instead Pindar treated an eclipse as a portent of evil. Gods are the embodiment of power, uncompromisingly proud of their nature and violent in defense of their privileges. There is some rationalization of religious belief, but it is within a tradition at least as old as Hesiod, where abstractions are personified, such as [...] "Truth the daughter of Zeus". Sometimes the wording suggests a belief in 'God' rather than 'a god' (e.g. [...] "What is God? Everything"), but <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>are</b> not given full expression and the poems are not examples of monotheism. Nor do they vocalize a belief in Fate as the background to the gods, unlike the plays of Aeschylus for example. Pindar subjects both fortune and fate to divine will (e.g. [...] "child of Zeus...Fortune").|$|E
