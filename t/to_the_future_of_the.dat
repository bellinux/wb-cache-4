Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if she has to do it all. Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had already taken place.|$|E

40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{the most important}} and unsolved issues that will determine <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> radio frequency identification (RFID). A review of the RFID business-oriented literature identified twelve issues related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> RFID. In <b>the</b> first round of the Delphi Method, a panel of RFID experts narrowed this list <b>to</b> <b>the</b> seven issues considered to be most critical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> RFID. In round two, the panel ranked the seven issues in terms of importance and likelihood of being solved within the next two years. A third round, with feedback from round two, was conducted to insure there was a consensus within the panel. Results indicate that standardization is the most important issue and standardization is also the issue most likely to be solved within the next two years. System costs, business process reengineering, and integration also ranked high in importance. Privacy, lack of RFID-skilled professionals, and data warehousing were viewed as <b>of</b> less importance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> RFID...|$|R
5|$|Oliphant envisaged Canberra one day {{becoming}} a university town like Oxford or Cambridge. A threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University {{arose in the}} wake of the 1949 election, when the Liberal Party of Australia led by Robert Menzies won. Many Liberals were opposed to the University, which they saw as an extravagance. Menzies defended it, but in 1954 he announced that it had entered a period of consolidation, with a funding ceiling, ending the possibility of successful competition with universities in Europe and North America. A further blow came in 1959, when the Menzies government amalgamated it with the Canberra University College. Henceforth, it would no longer be a research university, but a regular one, with responsibility for teaching undergraduates. Nonetheless, parts of the university stayed committed to the old mission, and the ANU remained a university where research is central to its activities. Despite the setbacks, by 2014 the vision of Canberra as a university town would be well on its way to {{becoming a}} reality.|$|E
5|$|The Green was not {{maintained}} at first; after being cleared, it was unkempt and ragged, sloping sharply towards a swamp {{in the southwest}} corner. As early as 1807, the College was debating as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot, considering using it {{for a variety of}} purposes. In 1828, the Board of Trustees finally voted to plow, seed, level, and fence the area. Lack of funding would delay this plan from being carried out immediately; the Green was leveled in 1831 and finally fenced in 1836. The main road from Hanover to the northward Lyme, New Hampshire had previously led diagonally across the Green, and due to the new fences, had to be diverted around it.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E

5|$|With a {{majority}} of seats in the Labour-Protectionist government, Labour caucus by early 1908 had become restive as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Deakin minority government. With the Deakin ministry in trouble, Deakin spoke to Fisher and Watson about a possible coalition, and following a report agreed to it providing Labour had {{a majority}} in cabinet, that there was immediate legislation for old-age pensions, that New Protection was carried and that at the following election the government would promise a progressive land tax. No coalition was formed, however the pressure from Labour brought about productive change by Deakin: he agreed to a royal commission into the post office, old-age pensions were to be provided from the surplus revenue fund and £250,000 set aside for ships for an Australian Navy. New Protection was declared invalid by the High Court in June, Fisher found the tariff proposals of Deakin unsatisfactory, while caucus was also dissatisfied with the old-age pension proposals. Without Labour support the Deakin government collapsed in November 1908.|$|E

25|$|What {{turned out}} to be the final awards {{ceremony}} took place in Dublin on 11 November 1993. Presenting the awards on that occasion was Michael D.

No formal announcement was made by the sponsor subsequently as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jacob's Awards so the reason why they were terminated remains a mystery.

Francia built his power base on his organizational abilities and his forceful personality.
