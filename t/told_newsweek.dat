25|$|In {{an article}} written by {{freelance}} journalist Michael Hastings, ("The Runaway General", appearing in Rolling Stone magazine, July 8–22, 2010 issue), McChrystal {{and his staff}} mocked civilian government officials, including Joe Biden, National Security Advisor James L. Jones, US Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl W. Eikenberry, and Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke. McChrystal was not quoted as being directly critical of {{the president or the}} president's policies, but several comments from his aides in the article reflected their perception of McChrystal's disappointment with Obama on their first two occasions of meeting. According to Rolling Stone, McChrystal's staff was contacted prior to release of the article and did not deny the validity of the article, although senior members of his staff dispute this, and have accused Hastings in Army Times of exaggerating the seniority of aides quoted and breaking the off the record trust of private conversations between him and the aides. Hastings <b>told</b> <b>Newsweek</b> that he was quite clearly a reporter gathering material, and actually bemused at the degree to which soldiers freely spoke to him.|$|E
25|$|Lichtman {{was interviewed}} about his book after President Trump fired FBI {{director}} James Comey. He <b>told</b> <b>Newsweek</b> this {{added to the}} evidence that Trump may have engaged in obstruction of justice, and compared it to the Watergate scandal. He reminded The National that support for impeachment grew after Nixon fired his special prosecutor. Lichtman remarked to Salon that Comey's firing and circumstantial evidence of 2016 election coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia were reasons for impeachment. He explained public opinion in 1974 changed the viewpoints of Nixon's Republican comrades towards impeachment. Lichtman elaborated that impeachment was possible even with a Republican-controlled Congress. He pointed out impeachment grew likely if Republicans felt Trump hurt their election chances. Lichtman emphasized to AM Joy, the first adage of politicians was to safeguard their careers. He commented to Mic and Newsweek the chance of impeachment grew after Comey's Senate Intelligence Committee testimony about his memos, and said the evidence was stronger than that in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Writing in The Hill Lichtman said that Paul Ryan's assertions {{that some of the}} president's actions could be excused because of ignorance or naivety were indefensible, and would not stand.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, he <b>told</b> <b>Newsweek</b> {{that the}} LDS Church doesn't have a {{monopoly}} on his spiritual life. In an interview with Time magazine, he stated that he is more spiritual than religious and that his membership in the LDS Church is [...] "tough to define".

5000|$|Rundell {{was born}} in Kent, England in 1987 and spent ten years in Harare, Zimbabwe, where {{her father was a}} diplomat. When she was 14 years old, her family moved to Brussels; Rundell later <b>told</b> <b>Newsweeks</b> Tim de Lisle that it was a culture shock, saying: [...] "In Zimbabwe, school ended every day at 1 o’clock. I didn’t wear shoes, and there was none of the teenage culture that exists in Europe. My friends and I were still {{climbing}} trees and having swimming competitions". [...] De Lisle notes, [...] "She gives Belgium some credit for broadening her mind … But she resented it too, to the point where all her books, and her play, contain a joke at Belgium’s expense".|$|R
5000|$|Some {{anonymous}} NSA officials <b>told</b> Hosenball of <b>Newsweek</b> {{that the}} ThinThread program, like Trailblazer, was a [...] "wasteful failure".|$|R
5000|$|His {{feelings}} were shared by May, {{who was also}} taken aback by their success, especially having some real income after living in near-poverty.

500|$|In {{response}} to the Church of Scientology's claims of inaccuracies in the article, a lawyer for Time responded [...] "We've reviewed all of their allegations, and find {{nothing wrong with the}} Time story." [...] In June 1991, Newsweek reported that staffers for Time said they had received calls from a man claiming to be a paralegal for Time, who asked them if they had signed a confidentiality form about the article. Time editors sent staffers a computer memo, warning them about calls related to the article, and staffers <b>told</b> <b>Newsweek</b> that [...] "sources named in the story say detectives have asked about their talks with Time". A Church of Scientology spokesman called the claims [...] "scurrilous".|$|E
500|$|Einstein did {{not work}} on the Manhattan Project. The Army denied him the work {{clearance}} needed in July 1940, saying his pacifist leanings made him a security risk, although {{he was allowed to}} work as a consultant to the United States Navy's Bureau of Ordnance. He had no knowledge of the atomic bomb's development, and no influence on the decision for the bomb to be dropped. [...] According to Linus Pauling, Einstein later regretted signing the letter because it led to the development and use of the atomic bomb in combat, adding that Einstein had justified his decision because of the greater danger that Nazi Germany would develop the bomb first. [...] In 1947 Einstein <b>told</b> <b>Newsweek</b> magazine that [...] "had I known that the Germans would not succeed in developing an atomic bomb, I would have done nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{woman who}} stated {{she was a}} member of Anonymous told KNTV that the group has shifted {{strategy}} to activities which fight Scientology but are not deemed illegal by the United States government, including an attempt to get the Internal Revenue Service to investigate the Church of Scientology's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. Another woman from Anonymous <b>told</b> <b>Newsweek</b> that the group plans to accomplish this through a lobbying campaign. United States tax authorities removed the Church of Scientology's tax-exemption status in 1967, stating that the organization's auditing techniques served as a for-profit operation for L. Ron Hubbard. In 1984, the United States Tax Court ruled that the Church of Scientology was guilty of [...] "manufacturing and falsifying records to present to the IRS, burglarizing IRS offices and stealing government documents, and subverting government processes for unlawful purposes." [...] The Church of Scientology's tax-exempt status in the United States was reinstated in 1993.|$|E
50|$|Rhonda Byrne <b>told</b> a <b>Newsweek</b> {{interviewer}} {{that her}} inspiration {{for creating the}} 2006 hit film The Secret, and the subsequent book by the same name, was her exposure to Wattles's The Science of Getting Rich. Byrne's daughter, Hayley, had given her mother {{a copy of the}} Wattles book to help her recover from her breakdown. The film itself also references, by re-popularizing the term The Law of Attraction, a 1908 book by another New Thought author, William Walker Atkinson, titled Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World.|$|R
5000|$|Janine Di Giovanni, the Middle East {{editor of}} <b>Newsweek,</b> <b>told</b> CNN, [...] "He was {{concerned}} {{that he had been}} on some kind of a list, and this had been around the time that ISIS had been showing up and taking over checkpoints that had been manned before by the rebels. And he thought he had angered some of the rebels, he didn’t know which ones, by taking footage of a hospital in Aleppo that had been bombed, and he had been very concerned about this." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a June 2006 {{interview}} with Malcolm Beith of Newsweek, al-Duleimi announced {{his intention to}} write a book about his client, in which he would [...] "tell the truth." [...] "My memoirs will contain all the facts, and I will reveal many details that will serve justice and the truth," [...] he <b>told</b> the <b>Newsweek</b> reporter. In February 2007, al-Duleimi officially re-iterated those plans {{to write a book}} about the [...] "many secrets" [...] his client Saddam Hussein revealed to him during their 140 interviews. The secrets are purportedly about the fall of Baghdad and Saddam's imprisonment. Al-Duleimi also promised to reprint as many as three hundred personal letters, poems and other miscellaneous works written by Saddam. The book, according to al-Duleimi, could be out in as little as one year. At the time of his announcement, al-Duleimi had not yet found a publisher.|$|R
500|$|Mark Bunker, an Emmy Award-winning {{journalist}} and Scientology critic {{who runs the}} website XenuTV.com, posted a video to YouTube and asked Anonymous to tone down their campaign against the Church of Scientology. According to NPR's Morning Edition, Bunker has [...] "become a revered voice to many members of Anonymous", and they refer to him as [...] "Wise Beard Man". Bunker <b>told</b> <b>Newsweek</b> that he {{was pleased to see}} a large group of young individuals acting against Scientology, but stated he was also concerned for their safety: [...] "I know the way Scientology works: they're going to get these people in trouble ... I'm very concerned about their safety, and I'm concerned about the Scientologists' safety, too." [...] Bunker stated that he has received 6,000 emails from individuals who say they are part of Anonymous. Bunker attended the February 10, 2008 protest against Scientology in Los Angeles.|$|E

5000|$|Dylan {{has said}} {{that he did not have}} a clear notion of what the song was about. He told Cameron Crowe in 1985 that after {{recording}} the John Wesley Harding album, he [...] "didn't know what to make of it. ... So I figured the best thing to do would be to put out the album as quickly as possible, call it John Wesley Harding because that was the one song that I had no idea what it was about, why it was even on the album. So I figured I'd call the album that, call attention to it, make it something special..." [...] It was the only title that he considered for the album. He <b>told</b> a <b>Newsweek</b> interviewer in 1969 that the songs on his country Nashville Skyline album: [...] "These are the type of songs that I always felt like writing. The songs reflect more of the inner me than the songs of the past. They're more to my base than, say, 'John Wesley Harding'. There I felt like everyone expected me to be a poet so that's what I tried to be." ...|$|R
40|$|There’s {{a virtual}} {{version of the}} game tag, in which bloggers who get a cyber-tap on the {{shoulder}} have to reveal five things people don’t know about them on their blog, and then can call on five people to do the same. We enjoy it when bloggers we enjoy reading, such as Rebecca MacKinnon, get tagged and we get to learn things like, in her case, which Disney cartoon she was “obsessed” with as a child. Despite {{the title of this}} post, though, you won’t get those sorts of personal revelations here. So, I’m afraid you’ll end up frustrated if you are wondering which person who has contributed to China Beat once recorded an album called “Here Comes the Elephants” and which of us has done concerts as part of the band the Black Spoons (hint: they are different China Beatniks, just both have musical backgrounds), as we won’t be naming names. And {{when it comes to the}} various Irvine-based bloggers involved with this site, we won’t tell you which spends the most time at the lovely beaches that lie a 15 minute drive or so from campus in one direction, nor which has an annual pass to the world’s most famous theme park that’s located about a 20 minute drive (up to 40 + in rush hour) from campus in the other direction. What we’ll be focusing on instead are the things we do, outside of writing for this blog, that relate to its mission of trying to make sense of and share ideas about China’s past and present. For example, when not blogging for China Beat, many contributors write for online and print periodicals. For instance, the special issue of National Geographicdiscussed in an earlier posting had articles by Peter Hessler and Leslie T. Chang, while Angilee Shah recently had a piece in Asian Geographic. Several of us who have reviewed books for China Beat have recently done the same for magazines. Kate Merkel-Hess recently had a review of a Zhou Enlai biography appear in theTimes Literary Supplement (or TLS, for short), while Jeff Wasserstrom just <b>told</b> readers of <b>Newsweek</b> International what he liked about Michael Meyer’s account of Beijing hutong life, and Nicole Barnes has been contributing assessments ofvarious China books to Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries, which ran her take on a new book about the Rape of Nanjing in May. And several China Beatniks, including Pierre Fuller, have written pieces for newspapers, probably none more frequently than recent guest post contributor Graham Earnshaw, whose 1980 s Daily Telegraph reports are getting a second lease on life just now in a great Danwei series...|$|R
