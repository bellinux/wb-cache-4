40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{the virtual}} {{material}} characterization of three dimen-sional (3 D) orthogonal woven composite materials is investigated by large-scale finite element analyses {{to predict the}} elastic properties. To numerically model the complex geometry of 3 D orthogonal woven composites, a unit structure including <b>the</b> <b>stuffer</b> yarns, filler yarns, weaver yarns, and the resin region is generated based on direct numerical simulation (DNS) and the unit structures with the same pattern are assembled into an orthogonal woven composite structure composed of several millions of degrees of freedom. The influence of the geometrical irregularities, such as the inconsistent tow spacing and the waviness of the filler yarn, on the mechanical properties are also discussed by separately generating the yarns and the resin. From the numerical examples, it is shown that the pattern of tow distribution affects the shear modulus, and the direct modeling of the wavy yarns can produce more accurate stiffness knockdown. It is also emphasized that large-scale numerical analyses {{can be one of}} the methodologies sufficient for the material characterization of the orthogonal woven composites and can be more applicable in the realistic structure subject to complex loading compared to the unit cell approach.

For analysis of neural crest cell lineage, an efficient method has been devised for manipulating the mouse genome through the Cre–loxP system. We generated transgenic mice harboring a Cre gene driven by a promoter of protein 0 (P 0). To detect the Cre-mediated DNA recombination, we crossed P 0 -Cre transgenic mice with CAG-CAT-Z indicator transgenic mice. The CAG-CAT-Z Tg line carries a lacZ gene downstream of a chicken β-actin promoter and a “stuffer” fragment flanked by two loxP sequences, so that lacZ is expressed only when <b>the</b> <b>stuffer</b> is removed by the action of Cre recombinase.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{promoter}} {{capable of}} driving high-level transgene expression in oviduct cells {{is important for}} developing transgenic chickens capable of producing therapeutic proteins, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), in the whites of laid eggs. Ovalbumin promoters {{can be used as}} oviduct-specific regulatory sequences in transgenic chickens, but their promoter activities are not high, according to previous reports. Results In this study, while using a previously characterized ovalbumin promoter, we attempted to improve the expression level of mAbs using a Cre/ lox P-mediated conditional excision system. We constructed a therapeutic mAb expression vector, pBS-DS-hIgG, driven by the CMV and CAG promoters, in which the expression of the heavy and light chains of humanized immunoglobulin G (hIgG) is preceded by two floxed stuffer reporter genes. In the presence of Cre, <b>the</b> <b>stuffer</b> genes were precisely excised and hIgG expression was induced in pBS-DS-hIgG-transfected 293 T cells. In chicken oviduct primary culture cells, hIgG was expressed after transfection of pBS-DS-hIgG together with the ovalbumin promoter-driven Cre expression vector. The expression level of hIgG in these cells was increased 40 -fold over that induced directly by the ovalbumin promoter. On the other hand, hIgG was not induced by the ovalbumin promoter-driven Cre in chicken embryonic fibroblast cells. Conclusions The Cre/ lox P-based system could significantly increase ovalbumin promoter-driven production of proteins of interest, specifically in oviduct cells. This expression system could be useful for producing therapeutic mAbs at high level using transgenic chickens as bioreactors. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is an {{established}} and effective tool for stable knock down of gene expression. Lentiviral vectors {{can be used}} to deliver shRNAs, thereby providing the ability to infect most mammalian cell types with high efficiency, regardless of proliferation state. Furthermore, the use of inducible promoters to drive shRNA expression allows for more thorough investigations into the specific timing of gene function in a variety of cellular processes. Moreover, inducible knockdown allows the investigation of genes that would be lethal or otherwise poorly tolerated if constitutively knocked down. Lentiviral inducible shRNA vectors are readily available, but unfortunately the process of cloning, screening, and testing shRNAs can be time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, we sought to refine a popular vector (Tet-pLKO-Puro) and streamline the cloning process with efficient protocols so that researchers can more efficiently utilize this powerful tool. Methods: First, we modified the Tet-pLKO-Puro vector to make it easy("EZ") for molecular cloning (EZ-Tet-pLKO-Puro). Our primary modification was to shrink <b>the</b> <b>stuffer</b> region, which allows vector purification via polyethylene glycol precipitation thereby avoiding the need to purify DNA through agarose. In addition, we generated EZ-Tet-pLKO vectors with hygromycin or blasticidin resistance to provide greater flexibility in cell line engineering. Furthermore, we provide a detailed guide for utilizing these vectors, including shRNA design strategy and simplified screening methods. Results: Notably, we emphasize the importance of loop sequence design and demonstrate that the addition of a single mismatch in the loop stem can greatly improve shRNA efficiency. Lastly, we display the robustness of the system with a doxycycline titration and recovery time course and provide a cost/benefit analysis comparing our system with purchasing pre-designed shRNA vectors. Conclusions: Our aim was twofold: first, to take a very useful shRNA vector and make it more amenable for molecular cloning and, secondly, to provide a streamlined protocol and rationale for cost-effective design, cloning, and screening of shRNAs. With this knowledge, anyone can take advantage of this powerful tool to inducibly knockdown any gene of their choosing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Mariner- like {{elements}} (MLEs) are widespread DNA transposons {{in animal}} genomes. Although in vitro transposition reactions require only the transposase, various factors {{depending on the}} host, the physico-chemical environment and the transposon sequence can interfere with the MLEs transposition in vivo. Results The transposition of Mos 1, first isolated from drosophila mauritiana, depends of both the nucleic acid sequence of <b>the</b> DNA <b>stuffer</b> (in terms of GC content), and its length. We provide the first in vitro experimental demonstration that MITEs of MLE origin, as small as 80 to 120 -bp, are able to transpose. Excessive temperature down-regulates Mos 1 transposition, yielding excision products unable to re-integrate. Finally, the super-helicity of the DNA transposon donor has a dramatic impact on the transposition efficiency. Conclusion The study highlights how experimental conditions can bias interpretation of mariner excision frequency and quality. In vitro, the auto-integration pathway markedly limits transposition efficiency to new target sites, and this phenomenon may also limit events in the natural host. We propose a model for small transposons transposition that bypasses DNA bending constraints. </p...|$|R
40|$|Helper-dependent {{adenovirus}} (hdAd) vectors {{have shown}} great promise as therapeutic {{gene delivery vehicles}} in gene therapy applications. However, the level and duration of gene expression from hdAd can differ considerably depending {{on the nature of}} <b>the</b> noncoding <b>stuffer</b> DNA contained within the vector. For example, an hdAd containing 22 kb of prokaryotic DNA (hdAd-prok) expresses its transgene 60 -fold less efficiently than a similar vector containing eukaryotic DNA (hdAd-euk). Here we have determined the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon. Although neither vector was subjected to CpG methylation and both genomes associated with cellular histones to similar degrees, hdAd-prok chromatin was actively deacetylated. Insertion of an insulator element between the transgene and the bacterial DNA derepressed hdAd-prok, suggesting that foreign DNA nucleates repressive chromatin structures that spread to the transgene. We found that Sp 100 B/Sp 100 HMG and Daxx play a role in repressing transgene expression from hdAd and act independently of PML bodies. Thus, we have identified nuclear factors involved in recognizing foreign DNA and have determined the mechanism by which associated genes are repressed...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic value and image quality of CT with filtered back projection (FBP) compared with adaptive statistical iterative reconstructed images (ASIR) in body stuffers with ingested cocaine-filled packets. Methods and Materials: Twenty-nine body stuffers (mean age 31. 9 years, 3 women) suspected for ingestion of cocaine-filled packets underwent routine-dose 64 -row multidetector CT with FBP (120 kV, pitch 1. 375, 100 - 300 mA and automatic tube current modulation (auto mA), rotation time 0. 7 sec, collimation 2. 5 mm), secondarily reconstructed with 30 % and 60 % ASIR.

Three radiologists independently and blindly evaluated anonymous CT examinations (29 FBP-CT and 68 ASIR-CT) for the presence and number of cocaine-filled packets indicating observers' confidence, and graded them for diagnostic quality, image noise, and sharpness. Sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating curve (ROC) Az and interobserver agreement between the 3 radiologists for FBP-CT and ASIR-CT were calculated. Results: The increase {{of the percentage of}} ASIR significantly diminished the objective image noise (p< 0. 001).

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} transgene (lacZ) expression from a first-generation adenovirus (Ad) vector {{in comparison}} to helper-dependent (hd) Ads deleted for various portions of the viral coding sequences and generated by using the Cre/loxP helper-dependent system (R. J. Parks et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 : 13565 – 13570, 1996). An hd vector deleted for approximately 70 % of the Ad genome (AdRP 1001) provided levels and durations of transgene expression {{similar to those of}} a control first generation Ad vector containing an identical expression cassette. Deletion of all Ad sequences from the hdAd and replacement with a ∼ 22 -kb fragment of lambda DNA resulted in a decrease in the level and duration of lacZ expression which could not be reversed by the inclusion of a matrix attachment region. However, substitution of <b>the</b> lambda <b>stuffer</b> in <b>the</b> fully deleted hdAd with sequences from the human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene resulted in significantly improved transgene expression. In vitro assays for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) directed against putative peptides encoded by the vector backbone showed that, although CTL were generated against the vector containing the lambda DNA, no such CTL were generated against the vector containing the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) sequences. Surprisingly, the rate of loss of the HPRT- and lambda-containing vectors from mouse liver was similar, despite the differences in expression kinetics, indicating that the lambda stuffer-directed CTL were inefficient at eliminating the transduced cells. Thus, the nature of the DNA backbone of hdAds can have important effects on the functioning of the vector. Since most fully deleted vectors require “stuffer” DNA as part of the vector backbone to maintain optimum vector size, these observations {{must be taken into account}} in the design of hdAd vectors...|$|R

At the age of thirteen her mother passes away and Hurston was sent away to leave her home in Jacksonville to attend a boarding school. At this point, Hurston is referred to as just another “colored girl.” She then elaborates how Eatonville was a safe zone for her since it was considered a “colored town”(358). As time progressed, she realized the difference between herself and others surrounding her: her skin. She begins to feel a sense of isolation and loneliness. Although, Hurston claims that she does not consider herself “tragically colored” but a regular human being, “At times I have no race, I am me”(359). She mentions her experience at a jazz club with a white friend, where through the music she expresses the racial difference and distance between their lives. She concludes her essay acknowledging the difference but refuses the idea of separation. “I have no separate feeling about being an American citizen and colored” (360). She explains that if the racial roles were reversed, and blacks discriminated against whites, the outcome is the same for a white person’s experience amongst black people.

40|$|PURPOSE: Emergency {{departments}} nowadays have to {{deal with}} an increasing number of health problems of high medicolegal and social importance, such as drug abuse. Cocaine dealers caught by the police by surprise often swallow wrapped packets of drugs in order to escape, which can be life-threatening in case of leakage. We evaluate the diagnostic value of native multideteCTor CT (MDCT) for the deteCTion of cocaine-filled packets ingested by body stuffers. METHOD AND MATERIALS: We performed a phantom study (16 -row MDCT, slice thickeness/reconstruCTion 2. 5 mm/ 2 mm, pitch 1. 3) simulating normal bowel contents in which a varying number of true and false cocaine-filled packets were randomly mixed. Both only differ in their radiological density. During 18 different reading sessions four radiologists independently evaluated presence and number of true and false cocaine-filled packets. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) prediCTive value and interobserver agreement were calculated. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement for deteCTion of any packets and for visualization of true cocaine-filled packets was good (k = 0. 63 respeCTively k = 0. 74), it was moderate concerning the false packets (k = 0. 58). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for deteCTion of any packets was 96 %, 100 %, 100 % respeCTively 63 %, for visualization of true cocaine-filled packets 87 %, 100 %, 100 % respeCTively 78 %, and for the false packets 98 %, 65 %, 89 % respeCTively 88 %.

Chromosome XII was splitted by using a chromosome-splitting vector (pDW 49) that carried a cloned DNA fragment of rDNA locus. An E. coli strain DH 5 α was used as a host for pDW 49 amplification. The pDW 49 plasmid was digested with BamHI to eliminate the HIS 3 DNA <b>stuffer.</b> <b>The</b> larger BamHI fragment was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The BamHI fragment was subsequently self-ligated, resulting in the Tr ends being joined head-to-head. The recircularized DNA molecule was linearized by cleavage at the homologous sequence (at the right region of rDNA locus) using BglII. The linearized DNA molecule was introduced into S. cerevisiae strain W 303 - 1 A by lithium acetate method. Confirmation of chromosome XII splitting was analyzed by PFGE (Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis) for 24 h with switching interval of 45 sec followed by 6 h run with switching interval of 15 sec. The result of PFGE showed an additional chromosomal band (611 kbp), suggesting that the chromosome XII has been splitted...|$|R
40|$|Helper-dependent minimal {{adenovirus}} vectors {{are promising}} tools for gene transfer and therapy {{because of their}} high capacity {{and the absence of}} immunostimulatory or cytotoxic viral genes. In order to characterize this new vector system with respect to its integrative properties, the integration pattern of a minimal adenovirus vector with a neor gene inserted centrally into a noncoding 27. 4 -kb genomic stuffer element derived from the human X chromosome after infection of a sex chromosome aneuploid (X 0) human glioblastoma cell line was studied. Our results indicate that even extensive homologies and abundant chromosomal repeat elements present in the vector did not lead to integration of the vector via homologous or homology-mediated mechanisms. Instead, integration occurred primarily by insertion of a monomer with no or little loss of sequences at the vector ends, apparently at random sites, which is very similar to E 1 deletion adenovirus vectors. It is therefore unlikely that <b>the</b> incorporation of <b>stuffer</b> elements derived from human genomic DNA, which were shown to allow long-term transgene expression in vivo in a number of studies, leads to an enhanced risk of insertional mutagenesis. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the potential of minimal adenovirus vectors as tools for targeted insertion and gene targeting is limited despite the possibility of incorporating long stretches of homologous sequences. However, we found an enhanced efficiency of stable neor transduction of the minimal adenovirus vector compared to an E 1 deletion adenovirus vector, possibly caused by the absence of potential growth-inhibitory viral genes. Complete integration of the vector and tolerance of the integrated vector sequences by the cell might indicate a potential use of these vectors as tools for stable transfer of (large) genes...|$|R
6000|$|A {{short time}} after my {{interview}} with the aged vicar, at an inn a very {{few miles from the}} village, I met a person who interested me in an exceedingly unpleasant way. He was a big repulsive-looking man in a black greasy coat--a human animal to be avoided; but I overheard him say something about rare birds which caused me to put on a friendly air and join in the talk. He was a Kentish man who {{spent most of his time}} in driving about from village to village, and from farm to farm, in the southern counties, in search of bargains, and was prepared to buy for cash down anything he could find cheap, from an old teapot, or a print, or copper scuttle, to a horse, or cart, or pig, or a houseful of furniture. He also bought rare birds in the flesh, or stuffed, and was no doubt in league with a good many honest gamekeepers in those counties. I had heard of [...] "travellers" [...] sent out by <b>the</b> great bird <b>stuffers</b> to go <b>the</b> rounds of all the big estates in some parts of England, but this scoundrel appeared to be a traveller in the business on his own account. I asked him if he had done anything lately in Dartford warblers. He at once became confidential, and said he had done nothing but hoped shortly to do something very good indeed. The bird, he said, was supposed to be extinct in Kent, and on that account specimens obtained in that county would command a high price. Now he had but recently discovered that a few--two or three pairs--existed at one spot, and he was anxious to finish the business he had on hand so as to go there and secure them. In answer to further questions, he said that the birds were in a place where they could not very well be shot, but that made no difference; he had a simple, effective way of getting them without a gun, and he was sure that not one would escape him.|$|R
