40|$|Subject of this PhD-thesis are the {{analysis}} and behaviour of aromatic sulfonamides as organic micropollutants in the aquatic environment. On the grounds of their widespread application, bacteriostatics as well as benzene- and <b>toluenesulfonamides</b> (BTS) are investigated. Analysis of the sulfonamides consists of solid-phase extraction (LiChrolut EN) and HPLC-MS/MS. Limits of detection vary from 0. 1 - 20 ng/L. The MS/MS detection is carried out in SRM mode. Matrix effects of the investigated secondary municipal effluent and surface water result in ionisation enhancement for most sulfonamides. The quantitation is carried out by internal calibration (stable isotopically-tagged internal standard). For identification purposes, product ion scans and SRM are utilised, false positive results are thus excluded as far as possible. As physicochemical methods {{for the removal of}} sulfonamides, nanofiltration and adsorption on powdered activated carbon (PAC) are investigated in laboratory systems. Nanofiltration with a membrane of a molecular weight cut off of 1000 g/mol leads to rejection rates of 50 - 75 % at pH 5. 4 and of 75 - 90 % at pH 8 for the bacteriostatics. Rejection rates of BTS amount to 10 - 45 % at both pH values. In single component solution, sulfmethoxazole and N-n-butylbenzenesulfonamide are well adsorbable on PAC. In spiked microfiltered secondary effluent, their adsorbability drops markedly. Filtration of this effluent with a tight ultrafiltration membrane leads to a better adsorbability of the sulfonamides in the permeates as compared to the feed water. Biological degradation is tested in aerobic batch tests (Zahn-Wellens) as well as in aerobic and anaerobic/anoxic soil columns. In the batch tests, all bacteriostatics are degradable. Two metabolites are identified. From their structure, the structure of the degradation products of the other bacteriostatics can be deduced. Three BTS are easily degradable and another three BTS are non-degradable in this test. In the soil columns, the degradability before a background-DOC is investigated. At continuous spiking with small amounts under aerobic conditions, the twelve tested bacteriostatics are degradable. The degradation rate depends on the heteroaromatic moiety. Six examined BTS are non-degradable under these conditions. At peak spiking with high concentrations, none of the sulfonamides is degraded aerobically whereas under anaerobic/anoxic conditions, two out of nine investigated bacteriostatics and four out of eight BTS are partially eliminated. Secondary effluents, receiving waters, surface waters, bank filtrates and raw waters are analysed for sulfonamides. In the investigated Berlin area, the bacteriostatics sulfmethoxazole, sulfadiazine, and sulfamerazine and the BTS N-n-butylbenzenesulfonamide, N-ethyltoluenesulfonamide, N-(phenylsulfonyl) sarcosine, and N-methylbenzenesulfonamide are detected. Effluent concentrations of municipal waste water treatment plants amount to 1 - 2000 ng/L, depending on the sulfonamide. It is shown that sulfonamides in the other water compartments originate from these treatment plants. Concentrations here range from 0 - 250 ng/L, depending on dilution and biological degradation. Waters from other regions exhibit different sulfonamide compositions and concentrations. In bank filtration, the concentrations depend on the water carrying path of the sulfonamides through the underground with the redox milieu as the most influential parameter...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} has been to {{evaluate}} the rate of contact sensitization to some rubber allergens and to bisphenol A (BPA) amongst students of dental medicine and dental patients. Material and Methods: A total of 50 participants were included in the study: 40 students of dental medicine exposed to the studied rubber allergens and BPA-based dental materials during the course of their education; 10 dental patients without occupational exposure to the latter substances served as a control group. All of them were patch-tested with the studied rubber allergens and bisphenol A. Results: Highest was the sensitizing action of carba mix, followed by benzoyl peroxide and mercapto mix. The sensitization rate for carba mix was significantly higher for dental students {{as well as for the}} whole studied population, if compared to the one for thiuram mix (Chi 2 = 12. 9, p < 0. 001; Chi 2 = 13. 9, p < 0. 001), bisphenol A (Chi 2 = 8. 9, p < 0. 001; Chi 2 = 11. 9, p < 0. 001), <b>toluenesulfonamide</b> formaldehyde resin (Chi 2 = 10. 7, p < 0. 001; Chi 2 = 13. 9, p < 0. 001) and benzoyl peroxide (Chi 2 = 4. 7, p = 0. 03; Chi 2 = 5. 8, p = 0. 016), and for dental patients, if compared to the one for mercapto mix (Chi 2 = 7. 07, p = 0. 008). Concomitant positive skin patch-test reactions to carba mix and to benzoyl peroxide, and to all the studied allergens were established. Conclusions: Carba mix could be outlined as a sensitizer of paramount importance for dental students as well as for dental patients. Benzoyl peroxide was the second ranked sensitizer for dental students. Positive skin patch-test reactions to bisphenol A and <b>toluenesulfonamide</b> formaldehyde resin were established only among the group of dental students.

40|$|Chloramine-T and [N-(p-tolylsulfonyl) imino]phenyliodinane (PhI=NTs) are contrasted as nitrene donors for the aziridination of styrene using copper(II) triflate, and copper-exchanged zeolite Y (CuHY) as catalysts. For both catalysts, PhI=NTs {{is found}} to give {{significantly}} higher yields of the aziridine both in the presence and absence of a chiral bis(oxazoline) modifier. In addition, chloramine-T {{is found to}} induce leaching {{of most of the}} Cu from CuHY, and with this nitrene donor CuHY does not function as a heterogeneous catalyst. In contrast, PhI=NTs causes negligible leaching of Cu from CuHY and, consequently, for the heterogeneous CuHY catalyst, PhI=NTs is the preferred nitrene donor. With chloramine-T, the beneficial effects observed on addition of copper powder are shown to be due to the copper powder acting as a reservoir for Cu 2 + in solution, since Cu 2 + in solution is rapidly deactivated by <b>toluenesulfonamide,</b> a degradation product of the nitrene donor.

40|$|A {{value for}} the free energy of activation, or G for the {{inversion}} of groups on the imino nitrogen of the title compounds was calculated from data obtained from variable temperature NMR. The coalescence temperature, Tc, is obtained as the temperature at which the non-equivalent methyl resonances of the title compounds collapse to a singlet. G is calculated from G = 2. 3 RTc(10. 32 + logTc/k) Eq. 3 derived from the Eyring Equation. p-Methoxyphenylimino- 2, 2, 4, 4 -tetramethyl 3 -cyclobutanone (4) is found to possess an energy of activation {{equal to that of}} 18. 55 kcal/mole with its temperature of coalescence at 118 C. p-Nitrophenylimino- 2, 2, 4, 4 -tetramethyl 3 -cyclobutanone (5) is found to have an energy of activation for inversion to be 14. 25 kcal/mole. The coalescence temperature found for the nitro derivative was found to be subsequently lower than that of the methoxy, 35 C. The G value of N-(2, 2, 4, 4 -tetramethyl- 3 -cyclobutanone) -p-toluenesulfonamide (16) was found to have a value no greater than 16. 42 kcal/mole with a corresponding Tc value of 76 C. Whereas, the N-(3, 3 -Dichloro- 2, 2, 4, 4 -tetramethyl- 3 -cyclobutanone) - <b>toluenesulfonamide</b> (17) yielded a value of 15. 32 kcal/mole for the inversion energy. The Tc was found to be 56 C.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} thiazine dyes is methylene blue (MB), which is extensively used in the dyeing industry. It also facilitates a number of biological applications. Methylene blue dye is not significantly hazardous, but it can lead to various harmful effects. Among the physicochemical processes developed to remove this dye from wastewater textile and dyestuff manufacturing industries, the oxidative decolorizeation method alone seems to ensure the advantage of a low cost, simple, and efficient process. So we investigated a detailed oxidative decolorization kinetic study of MB by sodium-N-chloro-p- <b>toluenesulfonamide</b> (chloramine-T or CAT) in alkaline medium catalyzed by Os(VIII) spectrophotometrically at 664 nm (Î»max of the dye). The reaction rate showed a first-order dependence each on CATo and MBo, a fractional-order dependence on Os(VIII), and an inverse-fractional-order dependence on NaOH. A decrease of the dielectric constant of the medium by the addition of methanol decreased the rate. The solvent isotope effect kâ�² (H 2 O) /kâ�² (D 2 O) was equal to 1. 37. Activation parameters were computed. The kinetics of oxidation of MB by CAT was also studied with other platinum metal ions. The relative reactivity of these catalysts are in the order Os(VIII) > Ru(III) > Ir(III) g Rh(III) g Pt(IV) > Pd(II). This trend may be attributed to the different d-electronic configurations of the metal ions. It was found that the catalyzed reactions are about 3 -fold to 10 -fold faster than the uncatalyzed reactions. The mechanism proposed and the derived rate law are consistent with the observed kinetics. This simple and economic redox system can also be adopted for removing the MB dye present in industrial wastewater. Â© 2010 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of ruthenium(III) chloride (Ru(III)) -catalyzed oxidation of aromatic primary diamines viz., 4, 4 ′-diaminodiphenyl methane (DDM), 4, 4 ′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS) and 4, 4 ′-diaminodiphenyl ether (DDE), by sodium N-chloro-p-toluenesulfonamide or chloramine-T (CAT) in HCl medium {{have been}} investigated at 298 K. Under comparable experimental conditions, the three oxidation reactions follow identical kinetics with first-order dependence both on [oxidant] 0 and [Ru(III) ], and less than unity order dependence on [Amine] 0 and on [H+]. The stoichiometry for each reaction was found and the oxidation products were identified through GC–MS analysis. The reactions were subjected to changes in (a) ionic strength, (b) p- <b>toluenesulfonamide,</b> (c) dielectric permittivity, (d) halide ions, (e) solvent isotope and (f) temperature effect. The reaction mixture fails to initiate the polymerization of acrylonitrile. The activation parameters for the overall reaction were deduced from Arrhenius plots. Under comparable experimental conditions, the relative reactivity of these amines towards CAT is in the order: DDS > DDE > DDM. This reactivity trend {{may be attributed to}} electronic factors. The isokinetic temperature (β) of 350 K calculated from enthalpy–entropy relationships and the Exner criterion was much higher than the experimental temperature of 298 K employed in the present study, indicating that the reaction is under enthalpy control. Under the identical set of experimental conditions, the kinetics of Ru(III) - catalyzed oxidation of amines by CAT has been compared with those of uncatalyzed reactions; the catalyzed reactions are found to be about 5 -fold faster. The catalytic constant (KC) has been calculated for each amine at different temperatures. The values of activation parameters with respect to Ru(III) -catalyst have been evaluated from the plots of log KC versus 1 /T. The protonated species CH 3 C 6 H 4 SO 2 N+H 2 Cl has been postulated as the reactive oxidizing species of CAT. The observed results have been explained by a plausible mechanism and the related rate law has been deduced.
