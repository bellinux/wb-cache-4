5|$|Deployed in India, Nolan was {{eventually}} made the regimental riding master and an aide-de-camp to General George Berkeley, commander-in-chief in Madras, accompanying him on horse trials <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and {{was made a}} Captain in 1850. Returning to Great Britain in 1851, he toured continental Europe and wrote two books on horsemanship and cavalry theory, the second of which, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, was universally acclaimed {{and led to the}} adoption of a Nolan-designed saddle by the British Army. A trusted voice on cavalry matters, Nolan was dispatched to the Middle East {{in the early days of}} the Crimean War to hunt for appropriate mounts. After returning he was attached to the staff of General Richard Airey, and in this role delivered the order that led to the Charge of the Light Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Nolan {{then became}} a staff officer, joining the staff of General George Berkeley, {{commander-in-chief}} in Madras, as an aide-de-camp in January 1849. He quickly became close friends with Berkeley's two sons, Charles and George, who were also enthusiastic about horse-racing. In 1850 Nolan accompanied Berkeley {{on a tour of}} the region, conducting horse trials <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was also promoted, purchasing a Captaincy on 8 March. Despite these successes, Nolan recognised that his prospects were far more limited in India than in England, and he could not afford the increased costs of serving in the colonies. At the same time, service in India was not taken seriously by many of the officers in high command, and would not be sufficient on its own to advance him. Accordingly, he obtained two years sick leave on 16 January 1851 and returned to England, intending to tour Europe and write a book on cavalry theory.|$|E

25|$|Minting {{began with}} 3-ruble coins, and 6-ruble and 12-ruble coins were added in 1829 and 1830, respectively. 1,371,691 3-ruble coins were minted, along with 14,847 6-ruble and 3,474 12-ruble coins. The first coin {{was sent to}} the {{prominent}} German scientist Alexander von Humboldt, who was previously asked <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of platinum as a currency and confirm its price relative to silver. After his death, the emperor Alexander II bought that coin, and in 1859 it was returned to Russia and later became an exhibit of the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.|$|E

Her forward 6-inch gun was removed and a tracked launching platform was built over the forecastle. A canvas hangar was fitted at the aft end of the rails to shelter the aircraft from the weather and a derrick was rigged from the foremast to lift the seaplane from the water. The guns on the quarterdeck were removed to allow for a seaplane to be stowed there in another hangar. A third aircraft could also be carried amidships, exposed to the elements. Three storage lockers were fitted with a total capacity of [...] of petrol in tins.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} how <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> resource <b>use</b> for sales opportunities in a production situation that is dually constrained: in operator capacity and machine capacity. The operator capacity is flexible, while the machine capacity is not. Therefore, there is a certain machine overcapacity. This overcapacity can be used for sales opportunities. Important then is how <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> resource <b>use</b> for these sales opportunities. The influence of uncertainty is important in this costing problem. Sales opportunities come one by one and have to be accepted one by one, without knowing the attractiveness of future sales opportunities. Dynamic programming is <b>used</b> to investigate <b>the</b> influence of this uncertainty...|$|R
