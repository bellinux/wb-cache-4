He believed that the British Government was wrong, but hoped for an honorable reconciliation. Gradually, the faction of <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> remained loyal to the King lost its influence, with some not participating on a regular basis. Montgomery was selected to serve in a site selection committee to decide the placement of military defensive positions in New York, and was also involved in organizing the provincial militia and securing its supplies.|$|E

25|$|Ismail Qemali {{invited the}} representatives of all parts of Albanian Vilayet to attend the All-Albanian Congress held in Vlorë on November 28, 1912. At the {{beginning}} of the session, Ismail Qemali referred to the threatened Albanian rights gained during the Albanian revolts in the previous four years, and explained to the participants of <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> <b>that</b> they should do whatever was necessary to save Albania. After his speech they began by checking the documents because it was decided that each kaza of Albanian Vilayet would be counted as one vote, regardless of the number of its delegates.

He played a role in establishing the Samogitian Regiment commanded by Feliksas Baltušis-Žemaitis and organizing a communist revolt in the city on 8 January 1919. The Red Army took over the city on 15 January. Požela was elected a member of the Central Executive Committee (parliament) of the Lithuanian SSR. However, the Soviet regime was short-lived and he moved to Joniškėlis and later to Raseiniai.|$|E

500|$|During the battle, the British had {{captured}} General John Sullivan. [...] Admiral Howe {{convinced him to}} deliver a message to Congress in Philadelphia, and released him on parole. [...] Washington also gave his permission, and on September 2 Sullivan told <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> the Howes wanted to negotiate, and had been given much broader powers to treat than those they actually held. [...] This created a diplomatic problem for Congress, which {{did not want to}} be seen as aggressive, which is how some representatives felt a direct rejection of the appeal would appear. [...] Consequently, Congress agreed to send a committee to meet with the Howes in a move they did not think would bear any fruit. [...] On September 11, the Howe brothers met with John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Edward Rutledge in the Staten Island Peace Conference. [...] It had exactly the outcome the Americans expected.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Indian Express, {{soon after}} its {{inception}} in May 1999 the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) {{worked hard to get}} rid of its [...] "Kunbi Only" [...] image. Sharad Pawar found, after breaking away from <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>that</b> {{it was not possible to}} win elections with just the Kunbi vote. In order to attract the non-Kunbi OBC vote, estimated to form 40% of the electorate, Pawar recruited Chhagan Bhujbal (a Mali), and Pandurang Hajare (a Teli). Even though Pawar recruited other Telis like Pandurang Dhole, the Indian Express wondered if it would be enough to counter the age-old and keen Kunbi versus Teli rivalry. A closer look at local and regional leaders in the NCP revealed that almost all of them belonged to the Kunbi community. In 2009, the NCP president Sharad Pawar chose Anil Deshmukh over Rajendra Shingane as party candidate from the Vidharbha region because he represented the huge Kunbi-Marathi community there.|$|E

2500|$|It is not {{accurate}} to say that originalism rejects change or that originalists necessarily oppose the use of [...] "the evolving standards of decency" [...] in determining what the Constitution ought to say; rather, originalism rejects the concept that the courts should consider what the Constitution ought to say but instead rule solely on what it said as understood {{at the time of its}} enactment. Originalists argue that the business of determining what the Constitution and the law ought to say is within the purview of <b>the</b> <b>Congress,</b> <b>that</b> changes to the law should come through the legislature, and changes to the constitution should be made per the amendment process outlined in Article V. Sometimes this approach yields results that please conservatives (see, for example, Justice Scalia's dissents in Roper v. Simmons or Romer), and sometimes it yields results that do not (see, for example, Justice Scalia's dissents in BMW v. Gore or Hamdi v. Rumsfeld).|$|E
2500|$|Leading <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> {{was now in}} Democratic hands, {{he oversaw}} the passage of {{progressive}} legislative policies unparalleled until the New Deal in 1933. [...] The Federal Reserve Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, the Clayton Antitrust Act, and the Federal Farm Loan Act were some of these new policies. Having taken office one month after ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, Wilson called a special session of Congress, whose work culminated in the Revenue Act of 1913, introducing an income tax and lowering tariffs. Through passage of the Adamson Act that imposed an 8-hour workday for railroads, he averted a railroad strike and an ensuing economic crisis. Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Wilson maintained a policy of neutrality, while pursuing a more aggressive policy in dealing with Mexico's civil war. Wilson staffed his government with Southern Democrats who implemented racial segregation at the Treasury, Navy and other Federal offices. In the presidential election of 1916, Wilson faced former New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes. By a narrow margin, {{he became the first}} Democrat since Andrew Jackson elected to two consecutive terms.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{this period}} the {{problems}} with NIF were not being reported up the management chain. In 1999 then Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson reported to Congress that the NIF project was on time and budget, following the information that had been passed onto him by NIF's management. In August that year {{it was revealed that}} NIF management had misled Richardson, and in fact neither claim was close to the truth. As the GAO would later note, [...] "Furthermore, the Laboratory's former laser director, who oversaw NIF and all other laser activities, assured Laboratory managers, DOE, the university, and <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> the NIF project was adequately funded and staffed and was continuing on cost and schedule, even while he was briefed on clear and growing evidence that NIF had serious problems". Richardson later commented [...] "I have been very concerned about the management of this facility... bad management has overtaken good science. I don't want this to ever happen again". A DOE Task Force reporting to Richardson late in January 2000 summarized that [...] "organizations of the NIF project failed to implement program and project management procedures and processes commensurate with a major research and development project.....no one gets a passing grade on NIF Management: not the DOE's office of Defense Programs, not the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and not the University of California".|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after signing}} the Treaty of Córdoba, the Spanish {{government}} reneged. [...] Ferdinand VII had regained {{the upper hand}} against the liberals in Spain and increased his influence outside the country. [...] He even had credible plans for the reconquest of the old colony. [...] For these reasons, no European noble would accept the offer of a Mexican crown. [...] Inside Mexico itself, there was no noble family that the populace would accept as royalty. [...] In the meantime, the governing junta that Iturbide headed convened a constituent congress {{to set up the}} new government. [...] This new government did have indirect representation, based on the Cadiz model. [...] However, the Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of Córdoba were clear that the order of things would be kept as it had been before the Cadiz constitution. Thus, Iturbide and the junta therefore declared {{that they would not be}} bound by the Cadiz Constitution but kept <b>the</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>that</b> was convened. [...] This led to divisiveness which came to a head in February 1822. [...] In its inauguration Congress swore that it would never abide for all of the powers of the State to fall into the hands of a single person or entity. It however proceeded to assign sovereignty to itself rather than to the people, and proclaimed that it held all three powers of the State. It also considered lowering military pay and decreasing the size of the army. These moves threatened to reduce Iturbide's influence in current and future governments.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 May 1823, the ex-emperor {{boarded the}} British ship Rawlins {{en route to}} Livorno, Italy (then part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany) {{accompanied}} by his wife, children, and some servants. [...] There he rented a small country house and began to write his memoirs, known {{with the name of}} Manifiesto de Liorna. Iturbide and his family struggled financially during this time, despite claims by historians and some members of <b>the</b> <b>congress</b> <b>that</b> deposed him that Iturbide had indulged in illegal enrichment throughout his military career and rule. In exile, Iturbide was approached by a Catholic Coalition of nations that sought to enlist his help in a campaign to reconquer México for Spain. Iturbide declined. Spain pressured Tuscany to expel Iturbide, and the Iturbide family moved to England. [...] Here, he published his autobiography, Statement of Some of the Principal Events in the Public Life of Agustín de Iturbide. [...] When he was exiled, Iturbide was given a government pension, although such was never received by Iturbide because of his new status: Congress also declared him a traitor and [...] "outside of the law," [...] to be killed if he ever returned to Mexico. Iturbide was unaware of this second part, and some authors contest it. After his death, many an author decried the decree calling for Iturbide's death, as it was against all known precepts of the law at the time, for it was unheard of that a law could be applied solely against a particular, meaning a specific citizen, instead of issuing a general law which would then be applied to particular cases.|$|E
