5|$|Phosphoryl {{chloride}} (commonly called phosphorus oxychloride) is a {{colourless liquid}} with the formula 3. It hydrolyses in moist air releasing phosphoric acid and choking fumes of hydrogen chloride. It is manufactured industrially {{on a large}} scale from phosphorus trichloride and oxygen or phosphorus pentoxide. It is mainly used to make phosphate esters such as <b>tricresyl</b> <b>phosphate.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} use for phosphoryl chloride {{is in the}} manufacture of triarylphosphate esters (as described above) such as triphenyl phosphate and <b>tricresyl</b> <b>phosphate.</b> These esters have been used for many years as flame retardants and plasticisers for PVC.

25|$|A fume event {{occurs when}} bleed air used for cabin {{pressurization}} {{and air conditioning}} in a pressurized aircraft is contaminated by fluids such as engine oil, hydraulic fluid, anti-icing fluid, and other potentially hazardous chemicals.

However, there is some historical evidence {{that would seem to}} contradict this statement. In 1959, over 10,000 people in Morocco were paralyzed or otherwise effected after ingesting small quantities of <b>tricresyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> in their cooking oil. Unlike <b>tricresyl</b> <b>phosphate,</b> hydraulic fluid — although non-toxic in small quantities — is extremely irritating to the eyes and skin, which creates a hazard to pilots during a fume event but causes no lasting damage.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the DSC and Raman {{measurements}} of hydrated multilamellar dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE) liposomes {{in the presence of}} raw <b>tricresyl</b> <b>phosphates</b> (TCP) and pure tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP). The results on TCP/DMPC and TOCP/DMPC liposomes showed no significant differences. Both the Tm decrease and DT 1 / 2 increase, obtained by increasing the relative amount of TCP with respect to liposomes, suggested that the hydrophobic core is strongly affected by the presence of TCP molecules, whose deep penetration into the bilayer is prevented by the polar interactions between the P=O group of the TCP molecules and the polar head on DMPC. On the contrary, the TCP/DMPE and TOCP/DMPE systems showed a phase segregation that takes place {{in the presence of a}} very small amount of TCP, and occurs somewhat more easily in the presence of TOCP than of raw TCP. Both TCP and TOCP molecules interact mainly with the outer face of the bilayer and only secondly affect the hydrophobic core of membranes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{measurements on}} the absolute viscosity (eta) and density (rho) of trisubstituted phosphoric esters which {{are useful in}} understanding their now mechanism necessary for accessing their role as plasticizers. The effect of chain length and branching has been examined on the eta and rho trends. From eta data, by using the Vogel-Tammann-Fulchur (VTF) equation, the VTF temperature (T-o) has been obtained which also represents the ideal glass transition temperature. T-o {{is related to the}} flexibility of the molecules. It is observed that T-o initially decreases with molecular weight, reaches ii minimum, and increases thereafter. The initial decrease in T-o has been attributed to the enhanced flexibility of the phosphate esters. Reversal of flexibility with relative molar mass beyond 400 is due to the gentle collision of the arms of the trisubstituted phosphoric esters. This has been further corroborated from the molar mass exponent as exhibited in the eta-molar mass plot. The isomeric effect on eta has also been investigated in <b>tricresyl</b> <b>phosphates,</b> hitherto for the first time. The ortho isomer has highest eta among the isomers. The para isomer was found to have lowest T-o and hence highest flexibility compared to the ortho and meta isomers...|$|R

40|$|The current {{research}} examines {{the possibility of}} using recirculation filters from aircraft to document the nature of air quality incidents on aircraft. These filters are highly effective at collecting solid and liquid particulates. Identification of engine oil contaminants arriving through the bleed air system on the filter was chosen as the initial focus. A two-step study was undertaken. First, a compressor/bleed air simulator (BAS) was developed to simulate an engine oil leak and samples were analyzed with gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GCMS). These samples provided a concrete link between <b>tricresyl</b> <b>phosphates</b> (TCPs) and a homologous series of synthetic pentaerythritol esters from oil and contaminants found on the sample paper. The second step was to test 184 used aircraft filters with the same GC-MS system: of that total, 107 were standard filters and 77 nonstandard. Four of the standard filters had both markers for oil, with the homologous series synthetic pentaerythritol esters being the less common marker. It was also found that 90 % of the filters had some detectable level of TCPs. Of the 77 nonstandard filters, 30 had both markers for oil, a significantly higher percent than the standard filters...|$|R
40|$|Possible {{exposure}} to <b>TriCresyl</b> <b>Phosphates</b> (TCPs) {{has led to}} concerns among airline crew members. One isomer, Tri-ortho-Cresyl Phosphate (ToCP) {{is known to be}} neurotoxic and {{exposure to}} ToCP via contaminated cabin air has been suggested {{to be associated with the}} alleged Aerotoxic syndrome. The symptoms associated with Aerotoxic syndrome are diverse, including headaches, loss of balance, numbness and neurobehavioral abnormalities such as emotional instability, depression and cognitive dysfunction. Other ortho-isomers are toxic as well, but the non-ortho isomers are regarded as less toxic. In a collaborative effort to increase insight into the possible association between exposure to TCPs via contaminated cabin air and Aerotoxic syndrome, we performed an exposure- and toxicological risk assessment. Measurements in KLM 737 aircraft have demonstrated the presence of non-ortho isomers in low concentrations, though ToCP and other ortho-isomers could not be detected. Based on this exposure assessment, we established a toxicological risk model that also takes into account human differences in bioactivation and detoxification to derive a hazard quotient. From this model it appears unlikely that the health effects and alleged Aerotoxic syndrome are due to exposure to ToCP. Alternative explanations for the reported symptoms are discussed, but evaluation of the current findings in light of the criteria for occupational disease leads to the conclusion that the Aerotoxic Syndrome cannot be regarded as such. Additional research is thus required to unravel the underlying causes for the reported health complaint...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSensory {{effects in}} eyes and airways are common {{symptoms}} reported by aircraft crew and office workers. Neurological symptoms, such as headache, {{have also been}} reported. To assess the commonality and differences in exposures and health symptoms, a literature search of aircraft cabin and office air concentrations of non-reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ozone-initiated terpene reaction products were compiled and assessed. Data for <b>tricresyl</b> <b>phosphates,</b> in particular tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (ToCP), were also compiled, {{as well as information}} on other risk factors such as low relative humidity. A conservative health risk assessment for eye, airway and neurological effects was undertaken based on a “worst-case scenario” which assumed a simultaneous constant exposure for 8 h to identified maximum concentrations in aircraft and offices. This used guidelines and reference values for sensory irritation for eyes and upper airways and airflow limitation; a tolerable daily intake value was used for ToCP. The assessment involved the use of hazard quotients or indexes, defined as the summed ratio(s) (%) of compound concentration(s) divided by their guideline value(s). The concentration data suggest that, under the assumption of a conservative “worst-case scenario”, aircraft air and office concentrations of the compounds in question {{are not likely to be}} associated with sensory symptoms in eyes and airways. This is supported by the fact that maximum concentrations are, in general, associated with infrequent incidents and brief exposures. Sensory symptoms, in particular in eyes, appear to be exacerbated by environmental and occupational conditions that differ in aircraft and offices, e. g., ozone incidents, low relative humidity, low cabin pressure, and visual display unit work. The data do not support airflow limitation effects. For ToCP, in view of the conservative approach adopted here and the rareness of reported incidents, the health risk of exposure to this compound in aircraft is considered negligible...|$|R
