5|$|Banksia spinulosa {{was named}} by James Edward Smith in England in 1793, after being {{collected}} by John White, most likely in 1792. He {{gave it the}} common name prickly-leaved banksia, though this has fallen out of use. With four currently recognised varieties, the species has had a complicated taxonomic history, with two varieties initially described as separate species in the early 19th century. A fourth, from the New England region, has only recently been described. However, there has been disagreement whether one, var.cunninghamii, is distinct enough to once again have specific status. The pre-eminent authority on Banksia, Alex George, concedes there is still more work <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the Banksia spinulosa complex.|$|E
5|$|Her {{armament}} {{arrived in}} Philadelphia missing electrical cables and with incomplete documentation, which required Cramp's electricians to piece things together themselves, for which Cramp charged an extra $50,000. She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before {{he received his}} last payment. More work needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the armament, {{but it had to}} wait until she arrived in Russia. Retvizan was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of Captain Eduard Schensnovich who commanded her throughout her Russian service.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Done?</b> <b>On</b> July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E

5|$|The {{place where}} Ahalya is held to have practised her penance and was {{redeemed}} has been celebrated in scriptures as a sacred {{place called the}} Ahalya-tirtha. A tirtha is a sacred place with a body of water, where pilgrims generally bathe to purify themselves. The location of the Ahalya-tirtha is disputed: according to some scriptures, {{it is on the}} river Godavari, others place it on the river Narmada. Two sites are widely held to be the Ahalya-tirtha. One is located near Ahalyeshvara Temple in Bhalod, {{on the banks of the}} Narmada; another is located in Darbhanga district, Bihar. The Ahilya Asthan temple in Ahalya-gram ("Ahalya's village") in the same district is dedicated to Ahalya. For those seeking to attract women and be handsome like the love-god Kamadeva, the Matsya Purana and the Kurma Purana prescribe the worship of Ahalya at the Ahalya-tirtha. This is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the day of Kamadeva, in the Hindu month of Chaitra. According to the texts, he who bathes in the tirtha will enjoy pleasure with the celestial nymphs.|$|E

25|$|As a {{critical}} component of restoring native riparian communities, restoration practitioners often have to remove invasive species and prevent them from reestablishing. This can be accomplished through herbicide application, mechanical removal, etc. When restoration is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> long stretches of rivers and streams, it is often useful to begin the project upstream and work downstream so that propagules from exotic species upstream will not hamper restoration attempts. Ensuring the establishment of native species is considered vital in preventing future colonizations of exotic plants.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{definite}} {{record as}} to who gave the order to begin shelling the Four Courts. Historians have only presumed that it was Collins. There is only anecdotal evidence as to how and when the ultimatum was served on the anti-Treaty garrison, whether adequate time was allowed the Four Courts men to surrender, or whether shelling began precipitately while the garrison was loading up their arms to leave the building. Further study remains <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> this most critical event of 1922, which actually started the Civil War in earnest.|$|E

25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Norwegian State Railways in 1883, Hamar Station became the administrative site for Hamar District. This would by 1924 reach an area consisting of the Dovre Line from Eidsvoll Station to Dombås Station, the Rauma Line, and the Røros Line north to Tynset Station. From 1880 to 1931 Hamar Station received a high amount of activity from its role as transshipment point between the narrow-gauge Røros Line and the standard gauge Eidsvoll–Sel Line. With increasing traffic the station area grew gradually, with an increasing number of tracks, built without any long-term plan. By 1916 there were 96 switches, resulting in low speeds, inefficient and unreliable operation. Despite the number of tracks, shunting often had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the main line. The track arrangements were not cleaned up until the gauge conversion on the Røros Line was completed in 1931. The following year a new interlocking system was installed.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{a report}} by {{journalist}} Natalia Antelava, doctors reported that the Ministry of Health told doctors they must perform surgical sterilizations on women. One doctor reported, “It's ruling number 1098 and it says that after two children, in some areas after three, a woman should be sterilized.”, {{in a loss of}} the former surface decency of Central Asian mores in regard of female chastity. In 2010, the Ministry of Health passed a decree stating all clinics in Uzbekistan should have sterilization equipment ready for use. The same report also states that sterilization is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> a voluntary basis with the informed consent of the patient. In the 2010 Human Rights Report of Uzbekistan, there were many reports of forced sterilization of women along with allegations of the government pressuring doctors to sterilize women in order to control the population. Doctors also reported to Antelava that there are quotas they must reach every month on how many women they need to sterilize. These orders are passed on to them through their bosses and, allegedly, from the government.|$|E
25|$|Problems soon developed, and the {{mausoleum}} site became {{the target of}} vandals. As a preventative measure, the entrance was bricked up to prevent access, but the wall was breached in 1956. By 1958 the church vestry became concerned, and in 1962 refused to grant permission for any more work <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the site. Soon negotiations began to break the original contract; in 1968 the property reverted to the church, and Remey was given five years to remove anything of value from the site. Most of the dead were taken by relatives to another family cemetery in New York; Remey's wife Gertrude was reinterred in the main church cemetery. After {{the last of the}} bodies were removed, the Remeum was demolished beginning in 1973, and the last of the aboveground ruins was finally bulldozed ten years later. Little remains on the site to mark the former presence of the complex save an obelisk dedicated to Remey's parents and a pair of structures which served as chimneys or vents. Urban legends about the site persist, describing parties in the crypts below {{the mausoleum}}.|$|E
