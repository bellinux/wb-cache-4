5|$|John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford, 9th Lord of Skipton (8 April 1435 – 28 March 1461), was a Lancastrian {{military}} leader during <b>the</b> <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> the Roses.

He was orphaned at about twenty years of age when his father was slain at the first battle of <b>the</b> <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> the Roses, the Battle of St Albans in 1455. It was probably as a result of his father's death there that Clifford became one of the strongest supporters of Queen Margaret of Anjou, consort of King Henry VI, who ended up as effective leader of the Lancastrian faction.|$|E

5|$|Not {{in itself}} a part of <b>the</b> <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> Scottish Independence, the battle is {{significant}} for its employment of tactics learned in the Scottish wars in a domestic, English conflict.

5|$|Percy married Eleanor Poynings, who outlived him; {{together}} they had four children.

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the House of Plantagenet's two cadet {{branches}} of York and Lancaster brought about <b>the</b> <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> the Roses, a decades-long {{fight for the}} English succession, culminating in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, when {{the reign of the}} Plantagenets and the English Middle Ages both met their end with the death of King Richard III. Henry VII, of Lancastrian descent, became king of England; two years later, he married Elizabeth of York, thus ending <b>the</b> <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> the Roses, and giving rise to the Tudor dynasty. The Tudors worked to centralise English royal power, which allowed them to avoid {{some of the problems that}} had plagued the last Plantagenet rulers.
