The song features a [...] "pleading" [...] refrain: [...] "Don't leave, don't leave." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Lady Penelope and Parker (the latter {{voiced by}} Graham) {{were among the}} first {{characters}} developed, neither was conceived as a major role. Parker's Cockney manner was based on a waiter at a pub in Cookham that was sometimes visited by the crew. On Gerry Anderson's recommendation, Graham dined there regularly to study the accent. Anderson's first choice for the role of Penelope had been Fenella Fielding, but Sylvia insisted she take the part herself. Her Penelope voice was intended to emulate Fielding and Joan Greenwood. On Penelope and Parker's secondary role as comic relief, Gerry explained, [...] "We British can laugh at ourselves, so therefore we had Penelope and Parker as this comedy team. And in America <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> British aristocracy too.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The poem {{is one of}} five {{surviving}} {{poems by}} Sappho which is about [...] "the power of love". [...] It expresses the speaker's desire for the absent Anactoria, praising her beauty. This encomium follows the poet making the broader point that the most beautiful thing to any person is whatever <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>the</b> most; an argument that Sappho supports with the mythological example of Helen's love for Paris. [...] Some commentators have argued that the poem deliberately adopts this position as a rejection of typical Greek male values. [...] The poem follows a chiastic structure, beginning with a preamble, moving through to the mythical exemplum of the story of Paris and Helen, and returning to the subject of the preamble for the concluding stanza.|$|E
500|$|Glenn Close {{has been}} well-received {{as the voice}} of Mona. IGN.com ranked Close as the 25th best guest star in the show's history for her first two {{performances}} as Mona.

In 2008, Entertainment Weekly also named Close one of the 16 best Simpsons guest stars. The Phoenix.com placed Close in the second position on their list of the best 20 Simpsons guest stars. Star News Online listed Close as one of the four hundred reasons why <b>they</b> <b>love</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons. Close appeared on AOL's list of their favorite 25 Simpsons guest stars.

500|$|Ritchson {{described}} Arthur Curry {{as someone}} who will [...] "do anything to save what he loves". The actor {{goes on to say}} that Arthur is [...] "passionate about nature, about the earth, and about the seas", and is not afraid to use his abilities to save those things that are dear to him. When comparing his character to Clark, Ritchson stated that Arthur is more confident in his abilities, and already knows what he can do and what his path is in life. Another big difference the actor pointed out is that unlike Clark, Arthur is willing to sacrifice people and things if it means preserving the greater good. When he first appears, one of Victor Stone's key characteristics is that both he and Clark can relate to the fact that they feel their abilities inhibit them from having a true relationship with the women <b>they</b> <b>love.</b> <b>The</b> writers tried to create parallels between the characters to emphasize this more, like Victor's fear of telling his girlfriend the truth about what LuthorCorp did to his body, and Clark's fear of Lana Lang discovering he is an alien. Writer Tracy Bellomo characterized Oliver as a guy that does not take himself very seriously, and enjoys making fun of people that try to take him that way. Bellomo believed that this is one of the reasons that Oliver is attracted to Lois, with the other being that Lois provides a challenge for him. Oliver's relationship with Clark is designed to [...] "broaden Clark's rather limited horizons", and to teach Clark that a world exists beyond Smallville.|$|E

Caryn James of The New York Times called it a show with an [...] "outrageously satirical family" [...] that [...] "includes plenty of comic possibilities and parodies". The Sydney Morning Herald named Family Guy the [...] "Show of the Week" [...] on April 21, 2009, hailing it a [...] "pop culture-heavy masterpiece". Frazier Moore from The Seattle Times called it an [...] "endless craving for humor about bodily emissions".

The show has become a hit on Hulu; it is the second-highest viewed show after Saturday Night Live. IGN called Family Guy a great show, and commented that it has gotten better since its revival. They stated that they cannot imagine another half-hour sitcom that provides as many laughs as Family Guy. Empire praised the show and its writers for creating really hilarious moments with unlikely material.

Robin Pierson of The TV Critic praised the series as [...] "a different kind of animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can't do."

2500|$|This populist {{version of}} the story served Coke's interests, however, as the whole episode did more to {{position}} and define Coca-Cola as a brand embodying values distinct from Pepsi than any deliberate effort to do so probably could have done.

[...] From the same period, Jim Miller wrote, [...] "They have become a figment of their own past, prisoners of their unflagging popularity—incongruous emblems of a sunny myth of eternal youth belied by much of their own best music. … The group is still largely identified with its hits from the early Sixties."
