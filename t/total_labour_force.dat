Even so, nominal wages in recent years have been slightly above those in competitor countries.

In 2006, the <b>total</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> on Devon farms was 23,240 people, with around 7,953 employed full-time. The majority of land within the biosphere reserve is farmland, which helps support the local economy, {{but is not}} designated with statutory protection. The reserve is therefore managed carefully {{with the cooperation of}} farmers and landowners; as the boundaries of the reserve are the catchment areas of the River Taw and River Torridge, extra precaution must be taken in protecting water supplies from nonpoint source pollution. Rainwater can accumulate residues of fertilisers, especially nitrates and phosphates. Once leached into the rivers they can affect the river ecology through eutrophication, causing damage to plants and animals. This {{is one of the most}} pervasive water quality problems in Europe. Pathogens excreted by animals can also directly affect humans when transported by rainwater to rivers and the sea where people swim. Another problem is river sedimentation caused by fine soil particles washing from the land into rivers, this causes high rates of mortality in fish eggs and can affect fish feeding habits. The Biosphere Reserve Partnership provides support to farms that encourage sustainable practices, benefit the environment, and have a good role within the community.|$|E

Using data from the 1988 and 2000 agricultural censuses in France, we analyse {{the factors that influence}} households' decisions regarding the use of hired labour. We show that the increase in permanent wage employment observed over that period results from two opposite trends: an important increase in the proportion of family farms using permanent wage labour and a slight decrease in the average volume of permanent hired labour per employer. The first trend was mainly due to an improvement in family labour productivity and to a sharp rise in farm size, whereas the second results from a rise in agricultural wages, and possibly also from an increase in the productivity of hired labour.

40|$|Purpose: This {{ecological}} study examined demographic and institutional differences in informal caregiving. We conducted a cross-national study about {{the characteristics of}} informal caregivers in 12 European countries and Korea. Methods: Data were collected from individuals aged 50 years and older participating in the 2004 / 2005 Survey of Health, Ageing and Re¬≠tirement in Europe (SHARE) and the 2006 Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing (KLoSA). We examined the associations between informal caregiving and macro-level characteristics (GDP, <b>total</b> fertility rates, <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation rates, level of women‚Äôs empowerment, long-term care resources). Results: Korea and some southern European countries (notably Spain and Italy) had high percentages of women, homemakers, co-residents, and spouses in informal care giving roles. In contrast, Northern European countries (Denmark and Sweden) had high proportions of employed informal caregivers. Lower female <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation was associated with higher proportions of women caregivers. A higher proportion of women caregivers in the population were also associated with a lower national GDP per capita.
