25|$|On 28 October 1923, O-5 was {{operating}} with other {{units of the}} U.S. Atlantic Fleet {{under the command of}} Commander Submarine Force, Coco Solo, Canal Zone. At approximately 0630, O-5, under the command of Lieutenant Harrison Avery, was underway across Limon Bay <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> to the Panama Canal. The steamship SS Abangarez, owned by the United Fruit Company and captained by Master W.A. Card, was underway toward Dock No. 6 at Cristobal. Through a series of maneuvering errors and miscommunication, the SS Abangarez collided with the O-5 and struck the submarine on the starboard side of the control room, opening a hole some ten feet long and penetrating the number one main ballast tank. The submarine rolled sharply to port – then back to starboard – and sank bow first in 42 feet of water.|$|E
25|$|Three 11-year-old boys rode {{their bikes}} {{into the west}} parking lot to {{purchase}} soft drinks. Hearing {{a member of the}} public yell something unintelligible from across the street, all three hesitated, before Huberty shot the three boys with his shotgun and Uzi. Joshua Coleman fell to the ground critically wounded in the back, arm, and leg; he later recalled looking toward his two friends, Omarr Alonso Hernandez and David Flores Delgado, noting that Hernandez was on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds to his back and had started vomiting; Delgado had received several gunshot wounds to his head. Coleman survived; Hernandez and Delgado both died at the scene. Huberty next noticed an elderly couple, Miguel Victoria Ulloa (74) and Aida Velazquez Victoria (69), walking <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance.</b> As Miguel reached to open the door for his wife, Huberty fired his shotgun, killing Aida with a gunshot to the face and wounding Miguel. An uninjured survivor, Oscar Mondragon, later reported that he had seen Miguel cradling his wife in his arms and wiping blood from her face. Miguel shouted curses at Huberty, who approached and killed him with a shot to the head.|$|E

2500|$|The {{eleventh}} {{match of}} the event was the encounter between The Undertaker and Kane. After Kane made his entrance, he was seen looking <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrance</b> ramp saying, [...] "You're not coming back tonight. You're not coming back, I buried you alive." [...] After this, {{the lights in the}} arena went out and Paul Bearer, Undertaker's former manager and Kane's (storyline) father, was heard screaming [...] "oh yes!". Blue light began to fill the arena as Bearer, carrying the Undertaker's former trademark urn, led a group of Druids, all chanting and carrying torches, onto the entrance ramp. As the Druids made a formation {{at the top of the}} ramp, Bearer walked to ringside, turned and said to Kane, [...] "my son...you're no son of mine." [...] He then turned back to face the entryway and raised the urn to summon The Undertaker. As Kane continued to watch in the ring, refusing to believe his brother was back, Undertaker entered the arena in his [...] "Deadman" [...] persona, wearing a long black trenchcoat and hat, and walked through the Druid formation. Bearer met him at ringside and directed him to the ring steps, where Undertaker raised his arms to bring the arena lights back up. Before the match officially got underway, a now visibly shaken and distressed Kane began shouting at his brother repeatedly, saying things like [...] "I killed you!", [...] "I buried you alive!", and [...] "you're not real!", while Undertaker simply stood staring stoically at Kane. Eventually, Kane decided to see if Undertaker was indeed standing in front of him by slowly inching forward with his hand outstretched. Undertaker responded by punching Kane, knocking him down, and the match got underway. The two continued brawling until Kane delivered a Chokeslam to Undertaker, which he sat up from shortly afterward while Kane was taunting Paul Bearer. The Undertaker then retaliated with a Chokeslam and Tombstone piledriver to win the match and remaining undefeated at WrestleMania with a 12–0 record.|$|E

2500|$|They shot toward {{students}} standing {{close to}} a soccer field but did not hit anyone.

Meanwhile, inside the school, Patti Nielson, an art teacher, had noticed the commotion and walked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west <b>entrance</b> with a 17-year-old student, Brian Anderson. She had intended to walk outside to tell the two students to [...] "Knock it off," [...] thinking Klebold and Harris were either filming a video or pulling a student prank. As Anderson opened {{the first set of}} double doors, Harris and Klebold shot out the windows, injuring him with flying glass and hitting Nielson in the shoulder with shrapnel. Nielson stood and ran back down the hall into the library, alerting the students inside to the danger and telling them to get under desks and keep silent. Nielson dialed 9-1-1 and hid under the library's administrative counter. Anderson remained behind, caught between the exterior and interior doors.|$|R

50|$|The Medici Pope Leo X gave Michelangelo the {{commission}} to design a façade in white Carrara marble in 1518. Michelangelo made a wooden model, which shows how he adjusted the classical proportions of the facade, drawn to scale, after the ideal proportions of the human body, to the greater height of the nave. The work remained unbuilt. Michelangelo did, however, design and build the internal facade, seen from the nave looking back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>entrances.</b> It comprises three doors between two pilasters with garlands of oak and laurel and a balcony on two Corinthian columns.In recent years, the association of “Friends of the Elettrice Palatina” and the Comune of Florence re-visited the question of completing the outer facade according to Michelangelo's designs. To assist with the public debate, a computerized reconstruction was projected onto the plain brick facade in February 2007. As yet, no {{decision has been made}} on the project.|$|R
