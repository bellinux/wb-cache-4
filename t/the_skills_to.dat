5|$|A {{supportive}} {{environment and}} family generally gives those with Tourette's <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel {{the energy of}} their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.|$|E

She has explained that Terri feels threatened by her husband's commitment to the glee club, worried that it is pulling him away from her, and will stop at nothing to keep her marriage together. She {{does not know how}} long Terri will be featured in the series, as she was initially created simply as an obstacle to come between Will and Emma.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 July around 900 people formed outside the Bastille, {{primarily}} working-class members of the nearby faubourg Saint-Antoine, but also including some mutinous soldiers and local traders. The crowd had gathered {{in an attempt to}} commandeer the gunpowder stocks known to be held in the Bastille, and at 10:00 am de Launay let in two of their leaders to negotiate with him. Just after midday, another negotiator was let in to discuss the situation, but no compromise could be reached: the revolutionary representatives now wanted both the guns and the gunpowder in the Bastille to be handed over, but de Launay refused to do so unless he received authorisation from his leadership in Versailles. By this point {{it was clear that the}} governor lacked the experience or <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> defuse the situation.|$|E

5|$|The {{college was}} {{established}} in 1871 by the English philanthropist Thomas Rhodes Armitage and the American anti-slavery campaigner Francis Joseph Campbell, who lost his sight as a young boy. Campbell had originally planned to establish a college for the blind in the United States, but was persuaded by Armitage that London {{would be a more}} suitable location. At the time, English schools for the blind did not provide their students with <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> become independent and, dissatisfied with this situation, Armitage dreamed of establishing a school whose emphasis was on music and which would prepare its students for careers as organists, piano tuners, and music teachers.|$|E
5|$|On their journey, they {{encounter}} Phineas, the blind human who helped Jason, {{leader of the}} Argonauts on his journey, and befriend a harpy named Ella that supposedly torments him. They also see the three Cyclopes that Jason Grace, Piper McLean, and Leo Valdez encountered in The Lost Hero. During the trip, the trio learns that the goddess Gaea is awakening from several millennia of slumber {{with a plan to}} destroy the gods and the world along with them. Her seven Giant children are being woken, each of whom is matched to fight a their counterpart god. Each Giant has <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> oppose one god and they can only be defeated if the gods and the demigods join forces. This proves to be difficult. Percy and his friends manage to defeat the Alaskan Giant and save Camp Jupiter from destruction. During their journey, Hazel and Frank become true heroes who know how to use their powers and have self-confidence. Percy regains his memory on their return to Camp Jupiter and finds an army of monsters (including Stheno, Euryale, and the three Cyclopes) led by Polybotes attacking it. Percy successfully defeats him with the help of Terminus, his Cyclops half-brother, Tyson and the hellhound, Mrs. O'Leary. At the end of the book, the Greek airship, Argo II arrives setting up the plot for The Mark of Athena.|$|E

This {{research is}} a class action one. It used a descriptive qualitative method, and was conducted at State Junior Secondary School 2 of Kejobong, Purbalingga Regency. Data of the research were gathered through in-depth interview, observation, and test. Sources of the data included places and events, informants, and documents. The research was conducted through a phase of cycles of actions. Prior to the cycles of actions, they were preceded by an action of pre-cycles through a conventional instruction method. Following the action, cycle I, cycle II, and cycle III were consecutively executed by using the cooperative learning of Jigsaw. The results of the research show that the application of cooperative learning model of Jigsaw in the instruction of <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>to</b> read Javanese characters in Javanese subject matter at State Junior Secondary School 2 of Kejobong, Purbalingga Regency is able to improve the students’ achievement in <b>the</b> <b>skill</b> <b>to</b> read <b>the</b> Javanese characters.
