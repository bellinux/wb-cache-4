5|$|After World War II, the {{military}} {{continued to play}} a major role in the local economy, but post-Cold War cutbacks took a heavy <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the local defense and aerospace industries. The resulting downturn led San Diego leaders to seek to diversify the city's economy by focusing on research and science, as well as tourism.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought {{to drive out}} foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, Michigan's harsh winters {{had taken a}} <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the terra cotta statue, as had {{vandalism}} by fans of MSU's rival school, the University of Michigan.

5|$|In 1971, Applewhite briefly {{moved to}} New Mexico, where he {{operated}} a delicatessen. He was popular with customers {{but decided to}} return to Texas later that year.

5|$|In 1975, the Jones Beach Parkway Authority {{raised the}} <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the Southern State Parkway from to 25cents, while the Loop Parkway {{retained}} its 25cent toll. The change faced immediate {{criticism from the}} New York State Legislature, and the Democratic members tried to rescind the toll hike. The power Robert Moses still had in {{a deal with the}} State of New York made sure that only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls. However, the deals never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12billion state budget for 1978, and he proposed a deal to forgo the $24 million (1978USD) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate the <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads.|$|E
5|$|In April, Austrian forces {{approached}} Mantua {{and started}} their siege. At first, the Austrians were content to simply blockade the fortress, {{but with the}} artillery duels and occasional skirmishes, attrition began taking its <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the defenders. The defenders were also weakened by diminishing food supplies, and their morale was undermined by lack of payment.|$|E
5|$|In July 1934, {{as part of}} a depression-relief effort, the Carrying Place Trail through Prince Edward County and the United Counties of Lennox and Addington {{was assumed}} as an {{extension}} of Highway33.

At 8:30a.m., the men of the 2nd Battalion of the 39th Infantry Regiment started their attack but found only an empty battery. The fighting over the battery took a heavy <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> both sides, 307 German soldiers died to defend it and about as many Americans died to take it.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 1916, the Webb {{house was}} {{opened to the}} public with a 25 cent {{admission}} charge, but the American entry into World War I and the rationing of gasoline took its <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> Nutting's business. Nutting sold the house in 1919 to The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in Connecticut, which opened it to the public as a historic house museum.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression {{took its}} <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the congregation, and {{membership}} dropped. In order {{to cope with}} the financial burdens, dues were raised, teachers were given endorsed notes rather than paychecks, the Executive Secretary was laid off, pews were sold, and individual members provided mortgage guarantees. The synagogue survived, and membership recovered; by 1934 there were 300 members, and by 1944 there were 1,100.|$|E
5|$|The {{losses at}} Fort Lee and Washington placed a heavy <b>toll</b> <b>on</b> the Patriots.
