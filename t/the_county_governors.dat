5|$|In 1894 the {{authorities}} decided {{to abolish the}} position of bailiff and {{it was decided that}} some of its tasks would be transferred to the sheriffs. This resulted in 26 new chief of police positions, largely corresponding to the old bailiwicks. Some received jurisdiction over both cities and rural areas, other just rural areas. At the same time the existing police districts were expanded to include the surrounding rural areas. However, the individual bailiff were not removed from office until their natural retirement, leaving some bailiwick in place until 1919. The reform eliminated the difference between the rural and city police forces; yet the sheriffs were only subordinate to the chief of police in police matters—in civil matters and administration they remained under <b>the</b> <b>county</b> <b>governors.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{disagreement}} {{at first}} resulted in negotiations between various public agencies.

The route was finalized in a joint announcement from the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and the Ministry of the Environment on 24 February 2009. Minister of Transport, Liv Signe Navarsete, described the choice as a compromise. Most of the route was placed along the lakeshore, while the most valuable sections, at Morskogen and Ulvin, were protected by placing the railway and motorway through tunnels.|$|E

In response to the crisis, <b>the</b> <b>County</b> <b>Governors</b> were given a task {{by the government in}} September 1996 to co-ordinate various measures in the counties to increase economic growth and employment by bringing in regional actors. The first proposal for regional autonomy and a regional parliament had been introduced by the Social Democratic Party's local districts in Scania and Västra Götaland already in 1993. When Sweden joined the European Union two years later, the concept [...] "Regions of Europe" [...] came in focus and a more regionalist-friendly approach was adopted in national politics.

30|$|According to {{the local}} {{agricultural}} officers, mobilization is lacking at <b>the</b> regional level (<b>County</b> <b>Governor)</b> towards defending <b>the</b> pastoralists’ case.

As {{a response to the}} lack of mobilization, the local government invited pastoralists, the agricultural department at <b>the</b> <b>County</b> <b>Governor’s</b> Office and <b>the</b> Norwegian Food Safety Authority to an ad hoc meeting to discuss the carnivore-pastoralism issue and to find some answers to what the herders themselves can do, and what <b>the</b> <b>County</b> <b>Governor</b> is willing to do to assist the pastoralists in their struggle against carnivores. They omitted inviting the environmental department at <b>the</b> <b>County</b> <b>Governor’s</b> Offices and <b>the</b> State Nature Inspectorate, as they wanted to avoid a discussion on carnivore politics.
