2500|$|Henry Ford, who {{has become}} a messianic figure to the World State. [...] "Our Ford" [...] is used in place of [...] "Our Lord", as a credit to popularising {{the use of the}} {{assembly}} line. Huxley's description of Ford as a central figure in the emergence of <b>the</b> <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> might also be a reference to the utopian industrial city of Fordlândia commissioned by Ford in 1927.|$|E
2500|$|The {{events of}} the Depression in Britain in 1931, with its mass {{unemployment}} and the abandonment of the gold currency standard, persuaded Huxley to assert that stability was the [...] "primal and ultimate need" [...] if civilisation was to survive the present crisis. <b>The</b> <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> character Mustapha Mond, Resident World Controller of Western Europe, is named after Sir Alfred Mond. Shortly before writing the novel, Huxley visited Mond's technologically advanced plant near Billingham, north east England, and it made a great impression on him.|$|E
2500|$|Will Self's story License to Hug {{appeared}} in the November 1995 issue of Esquire. Bond goes to Holland to kill an IRA hitman involved in drug smuggling. This story, part thriller, part satire on modern life, also mentions Bond by name and code number. Sorrell Kerbel notes that [...] "Self proves just as adept at skewering by mimicry the stiff upper lip style and macho substance of Ian Fleming's James Bond books as he is at pillorying <b>the</b> <b>brave</b> <b>new</b> <b>world</b> of political correctness (with its very own thought police) in which the 'Therapeutic Hug and Stroke' is the weapon of choice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pelton {{has written}} about {{contemporary}} private military contractors (Licensed to Kill, Hired Guns in the War on Terror), {{as well as his}} experiences with US Special Forces in the opening weeks in the War on Terror. Of Licensed to Kill, one reviewer summarized: [...] "His is a journalistic story-quilt of characters engaged as private security contractors and mercenaries {{in a variety of settings}} from Afghanistan to Equatorial Guinea.... The pages turn... because Pelton’s stories are intrinsically interesting." [...] The book was reviewed by author and filmmaker Sebastian Junger (“An incredible look into the murky and virtually impenetrable world of private military contractors [...] [...] [...] Pelton may well have seen the future.”) and terrorism expert Peter Bergen ("A rollicking read that takes the reader inside the murky world of military contractors—from the craggy passes of the Afghan-Pakistan border, to the extreme danger of Baghdad’s airport road, to the diamond fields of Africa. Licensed to Kill is not only a great travelogue, it also has some important things to say about <b>the</b> <b>brave</b> <b>new</b> <b>world</b> of privatized violence").|$|E
6000|$|Indeed, {{there was}} good reason for {{confidence}} in those early days; [...] for never had a young nation looked forth upon a more heartening [...] prospect. The primitive hamlets of Colonial days had been replaced [...] by a multitude of substantial towns, the somber wilderness by a [...] prosperous farming country. The power of a thousand rivers was [...] turning the wheels of as many mills or factories, and to the [...] natural wealth of America was added the increase of a mighty [...] commerce with other nations. By the Louisiana Purchase and the [...] acquisition of Florida her territory was vastly increased, and [...] still her sturdy pioneers were pressing eagerly into more spacious [...] lands beyond the Mississippi. Best of all, this enlarging nation, [...] once a number of scattered colonies holding each to its own course, [...] was now the Union; her people were as one in their patriotism, [...] their loyalty, their intense conviction that <b>the</b> <b>brave</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> [...] experiment in free government, once scoffed at as an idle dream, [...] was destined to a glorious future. American democracy was not [...] merely a success; {{it was an amazing}} triumph. Moreover, this [...] democracy, supposed to be the weakest form of government, had [...] already proved its power; it had sent its navy abroad to humble the [...] insolent Barbary States, and had measured the temper of its soul [...] and the strength of its arm in the second war with Great Britain.|$|E
