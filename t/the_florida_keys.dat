Later, hurricane warnings were issued from Charleston, South Carolina to Hatteras, North Carolina. Before Gladys made landfall in Florida, all schools in Pinellas County were closed, and officials evacuated 60jet fighters from MacDill Air Force Base to Mississippi. The HMS Sirius, which was visiting St. Petersburg, rode out the storm in the open Gulf of Mexico. The American Red Cross opened shelters across western Florida for people to stay in during the storm, and about 40,000people evacuated their homes during the storm's passage. Then-governor Claude R.

5|$|While Kate {{was moving}} through the Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a {{hurricane}} warning from Jupiter to Fort Myers, Florida, including <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys.</b> Then-Governor of Florida Bob Graham {{declared a state of}} emergency for six counties in South Florida. However, it was reversed following the relatively minor effects in the area. Officials recommended evacuation of <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys,</b> leading to heavy traffic on the Overseas Highway and prompting the Red Cross to open 12shelters. Three shelters were opened in Key West, but only 500 individuals utilized them during the storm. Most residents chose to endure the storm in their homes. In Fort Lauderdale, schools were closed and residents of mobile homes were required to leave.|$|E
5|$|After Gordon {{emerged into}} the Atlantic north of Cuba, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{tropical}} storm warning for southern Florida from Jupiter to the Dry Tortugas, and later extended it to Boca Grande up along the west coast; this was extended to Bayport {{on the west coast}} and to Titusville on the east coast while the storm was approaching <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys.</b> When Gordon attained hurricane status and turned suddenly to the northwest, a hurricane warning was issued from Bogue Banks to the North Carolina/Virginia border. Florida governor Lawton Chiles activated the state's Emergency Operations Center. In <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys,</b> state parks were closed, which forced some campers to leave, and all schools were closed. On the mainland, University of Miami and Miami Dade College were also closed. Space Shuttle Atlantis was forced to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California instead of Kennedy Space Center. The storm caused flights to be canceled or delayed at Miami International Airport, and nearly all flights were canceled to and from <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys.</b> Hundreds of people evacuated to shelters in five counties in east-central Florida. In North Carolina, officials suggested people in low-lying areas to go to higher ground, but they did not issue evacuation orders.|$|E
5|$|As Dennis {{approached}} <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys,</b> several gale warnings were issued, {{with the}} first from Long Key to Dry Tortugas at 04:00UTC on August16. These gale warnings were posted progressively farther north along the East Coast of the United States, reaching {{as far north as}} Windmill Point in Virginia. Additionally, a hurricane watch was issued in South Florida from Fort Myers to Palm Beach, including <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys.</b> Hundreds of people were evacuated from the campgrounds of Bahia Honda and John Pennekamp state parks. Shelters were also prepared to open in <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys</b> if necessary. Typically, when a tropical cyclone approaches South Florida, the South Florida Water Management District drains Lake Okeechobee using the floodgates. However, due to a severe drought, water was instead directed into the lake from the connector canals. The storm resulted in a postponement of a second spraying to combat the spread of Mediterranean fruit flies in the Tampa Bay Area. About 40,000tourists fled Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, including about 500people from a campground, causing a loss of about $2million to tourism. Some United States Military vessels were sent out to sea, while about 70A-10 jets at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base were flown to England Air Force Base near Alexandria, Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|August 31– September 1– Hurricane Gustav brushed <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys</b> before {{tracking}} into central Louisiana, producing six tornadoes, {{heavy rain}} up to , and strong rip currents throughout the state. The outer rain bands produced three waterspouts in the Panhandle, each coming ashore near Valparaiso. Four people drowned {{as a result}} of the rip currents in southern Florida.|$|E
5|$|August 7, 1980- Hurricane Allen passes about 310miles (500km) {{south of}} Key West, Florida. The {{threat of the}} large {{hurricane}} prompts the National Hurricane Center to issue gale warnings for <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys.</b> The hurricane produces gale force winds across the keys, {{though there was no}} significant damage.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on September7, {{hurricane}} watches {{were put}} in place for the Florida coast from Key West to Melbourne. The next day, the watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings from Key West to Key Largo, with hurricane watches raised on the west coast northward to Fort Myers, and gale warnings issued from Key Largo to Vero Beach. By September11, hurricane warnings were in effect for southern Florida from Daytona Beach on the east coast to Cedar Key on the west coast, including Lake Okeechobee. Gale warnings were in place northward from Cedar Key to St. Marks, as well as from Daytona Beach northward to Savannah, Georgia. Evacuations in <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys</b> disrupted traffic along the Overseas Highway. The Air Force evacuated 90Boeing B-47 Stratojets from Homestead Air Reserve Base. At Cape Canaveral, the threat of the storm caused the launching of two missiles to be postponed. Most flights out of Miami International Airport were canceled during the storm's approach. Officials closed schools in Miami and <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys,</b> and recommended residents in low-lying areas of <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys</b> and southwestern Florida to evacuate. Ultimately, about 12,000people in southern Florida sought refuge in storm shelters, two of which were damaged during the storm. In Miami-Dade County alone, there were 77storm shelters housing 10,000people.|$|E
