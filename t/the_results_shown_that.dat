It was not clear why the engines were kept at idle thrust even after selecting Flaps 40. It was perhaps because the aircraft was higher than normal on approach. If the intention was to regain the correct glide path then classic flying technique would have required the Pilot to maintain speed by reducing the angle of attack by pushing the control column forward while allowing the aircraft to regain the correct glide path with an increased rate of descent.|$|E
5000|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} a {{profound}} effect on explicit memory. Mild cognitive impairment is an early sign of Alzheimer's disease. People with memory conditions often receive cognitive training. When an fMRI was used to view brain activity after training, it found increased activation in various neural systems that are involved with explicit memory. People with Alzheimer's have problems learning new tasks. However, if the task is presented repeatedly they can learn and retain some new knowledge of the task. This effect is more apparent if the information is familiar. The person with Alzheimer's must also be guided through the task and prevented from making errors. Alzheimer's also has an effect on explicit spatial memory. This means that people with Alzheimer's have difficulty remembering where items are placed in unfamiliar environments. The hippocampus has been shown to become active in semantic and episodic memory. [...] The effects of Alzheimer's disease are seen in the episodic part of explicit memory. This can lead to problems with communication. A study was conducted where Alzheimer's patients were asked to name a variety of objects from different periods. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> their ability to name the object depended on frequency of use of the item and when the item was first acquired. This effect on semantic memory also has an effect on music and tones. Alzheimer's patients have difficulty distinguishing between different melodies they have never heard before. People with Alzheimer's also have issues with picturing future events. This is due to a deficit in episodic future thinking.|$|E
