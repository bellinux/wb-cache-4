Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general's office, {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence; on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> only to the cabinet. This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister of Justice, which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from prosecutors and police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957.|$|E

[...] Wood's considerable influence helped hold in check the organization's more radical elements, who were generally antagonistic to the cautious and conservative Brownlee. [...] Even so, Foster and Byrne suggest that towards the beginning of Brownlee's term, he started to replace Wood as the [...] "centre" [...] of the UFA in a way that Greenfield had not. [...] Despite this, his relationship with the UFA grassroots was sometimes stormy. [...] The 1929 UFA convention saw vocal criticisms of Brownlee's failure to adopt the old age pension and his decision to withdraw the Debt Adjustment Act in the face of opposition from banks. [...] He also rejected the notion, dear to many UFA members, that a UFA government should be bound by the resolutions of the UFA membership. [...] He felt that the heated atmosphere of UFA conventions did not lend itself to the development of prudent policy, and that the government of Alberta ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> not only to UFA members but to the population at large.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after {{completing}} his lengthy confessions in 1991, Dahmer had requested to Detective Patrick Murphy {{that he be}} given {{a copy of the}} Bible. This request was granted and Dahmer gradually devoted himself to Christianity and became a born-again Christian. On his father's urging, he also read creationist books from the Institute for Creation Research. In May 1994, Dahmer was baptized by Roy Ratcliff, a minister in the Church Of Christ and a graduate of Oklahoma Christian University, in the prison whirlpool. Following his baptism, Ratcliff visited Dahmer on a weekly basis up until November 1994. Dahmer and Ratcliff regularly discussed the prospect of death, and Dahmer questioned whether he was sinning against God by continuing to live. Referring to his crimes in a 1994 interview with Stone Phillips on Dateline NBC, Dahmer had stated: [...] "If a person doesn't {{think that there is a}} God <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> to, then what's the point of trying to modify your behavior to keep it within acceptable ranges?

[...] He was particularly angered that those involved had denied there was a bounty program in place. In an interview with NFL Network's Rich Eisen, Goodell said that the threat to player safety, as well as the fact the Saints lied about it, demanded significant punishment. [...] "I don't think you can be too hard on people that put at risk our players' health and safety," [...] Goodell told Eisen. He reiterated this in an interview later that day with ESPN's Schefter, saying that the fact those involved [...] "continued to mislead" [...] the league about it was a significant factor in the sanctions. [...] "You have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> and responsible in the NFL," [...] Goodell said. Goodell also implied that Payton would have faced significant punishment in any event, since his contractual obligation to supervise his assistants meant that he at least should have known about the scheme. He {{also said that the}}re would be zero tolerance for payments for in-game performance in the future, saying that payments for good play eventually escalate to bounties for deliberately injuring players. Later, Schefter said on ESPN's SportsCenter that league officials felt Payton was at least as guilty as Williams, despite initial focus on Williams' role as the mastermind in the scheme.|$|E
2500|$|The {{facility}} sits {{on about}} 20 acres just one mile {{west of the}} city of St. Anthony. It is a large campus like facility that currently houses a maximum of 120 juveniles in a treatment environment plus ten beds utilized for regional observation and assessment and special management. There are 6 different residential cottages and 15 other buildings that include several educational buildings, a large food service area, gymnasium, administration building, laundry, and a chapel. There are many areas dedicated to outdoor recreation such as a large soccer area, softball diamond, outdoor basketball court, and a state-of-the art challenge course, with high and low elements. JCC–St. Anthony provides a highly structured, staff-secure program using a [...] model for the custody and treatment of male and female offenders who have a history of various crimes, and have failed in less secure community-based programs and facilities. The JCC–St. Anthony program focuses juveniles on victim and community restoration related to their crimes. The program also offers cognitive skills building to alter their criminal patterns of thought and requires the juveniles <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> daily for their behavior and progress through the program. Employees at JCC–St. Anthony are dedicated to helping each of the juveniles that come to the facility. All staff, including all of those who occasionally interact with the juveniles, are trained in the treatment philosophy of the facility and can help the juveniles with their issues. There are many employees who have been employed at the facility for 10 to 25 years, and their experience working with juveniles is invaluable. Staff and juveniles continually work together to create a safe and secure environment that is conducive to making the changes necessary for juveniles to be able to return to their communities with the skills and values that will give them the opportunity to be successful citizens.|$|E
2500|$|While {{shareholders}} have {{a privileged}} position in UK corporate governance, most are themselves institutions - mainly asset managers - holding [...] "other people's money" [...] from pension funds, life insurance policies and mutual funds. Shareholding institutions, who are entered on the share registers of public {{companies on the}} London Stock Exchange, are mainly asset managers and they infrequently exercise their governance rights. In turn, asset managers take money from other institutional investors, particularly pension funds, mutual funds and insurance funds, own most shares. Thousands or perhaps millions of persons, particularly through pensions, are beneficiaries from the returns on shares. Historically institutions have often not voted or participated in general meetings on their beneficiaries' behalf, and often display an uncritical pattern of supporting management. Under the Pensions Act 2004 sections 241 to 243 require that pension fund trustees are elected or appointed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>accountable</b> to the beneficiaries of the fund, while the Companies Act 2006 section 168 ensures that directors are accountable to shareholders. However, the rules of contract, equity and fiduciary duty that operate between asset managers and the real capital investors have not been codified. Government reports have suggested, and case law requires, that asset managers follow the instructions about voting rights from investors in pooled funds according to the proportion of their investment, and follow instructions entirely when investors have separate accounts. Some institutional investors {{have been found to}} work [...] "behind the scenes" [...] to achieve corporate governance objectives through informal but direct communication with management, although an increasing concern has developed since the global financial crisis that asset managers and all financial intermediaries face structural conflicts of interest and should be banned from voting on other people's money entirely. Individual shareholders form an increasingly small part of total investments, while foreign investment and institutional investor ownership have grown their share steadily over the last forty years. Institutional investors, who deal with other people's money, are bound by fiduciary obligations, deriving from the law of trusts and obligations to exercise care deriving from the common law. The Stewardship Code 2010, drafted by the Financial Reporting Council (the corporate governance watchdog), reinforces the duty on institutions to actively engage in governance affairs by disclosing their voting policy, voting record and voting. The aim is to make directors more accountable, at least, to investors of capital.|$|E
