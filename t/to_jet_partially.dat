40|$|By use {{of various}} lengths of shroud an {{experimental}} study {{was made of}} a <b>partially</b> confined <b>jet</b> <b>to</b> examine the transition between the flow configuration for a free <b>jet</b> <b>to</b> that of a confined jet. An examination of the reattachment pressure distributions and the parameters {{at the entrance of}} the abrupt channel expansion was made. A smooth transition of mean flow quantities was found to occur in the transition from a free <b>jet</b> <b>to</b> a <b>partially</b> confined <b>jet</b> and then <b>to</b> a fully confined <b>jet.</b> The distance <b>to</b> reattachment was measured for various shroud lengths and shown to exhibit an asymptotic value which was Reynolds number dependent. Associated with this maximum reattachment length was a maximum pressure recovery factor. The range of Reynolds numbers - based upon the jet diameter - for the present study was 80, 000 to 280, 000...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{straightforward}} and efficient {{mechanism of the}} high energy emission of astrophysical jets associated with an exchange of interacting high energy photons between the jet and external environment and vice versa. Interactions which play the main role in this mechanism, are e^+ e^- pair production by photons and inverse Compton scattering. The process has been studied with numerical simulations demonstrating that under reasonable conditions it has a supercritical character: high energy photons breed exponentially being fed directly by the bulk kinetic energy of the jet. Eventually, there is a feedback of particles on the fluid dynamics and the <b>jet</b> <b>partially</b> decelerates.

40|$|Particle Image Velocimetry {{measurements}} were {{obtained in the}} highly unsteady turbulent flow issuing from a triangular oscillating jet (TOJ) nozzle into a fluid of different density. The TOJ nozzle comprises a triangular <b>jet</b> <b>partially</b> confined within an axi-symmetric chamber that produces a large-scale flow oscillation which is analogous {{to that in a}} precessing jet nozzle previously investigated. The initial spreading angle of the emerging <b>jet</b> was found <b>to</b> depend upon the density ratio, but in a more complex and different way to that of an unconfined jet. Instead, an increase in the density ratio of the <b>jet</b> fluid <b>to</b> the surroundings is found to be analogous to a decrease in the ratio of the nozzle length to diameter...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{hydraulic}} conductivity of hydrated and partially hydrated geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) with respect <b>to</b> <b>Jet</b> Fuel A- 1 (Arctic diesel) is examined at 208 C, 58 C, 58 C, and 208 C. Methods developed to hydrate GCLs to specific water contents (60 %, 90 %, 120 %) and subject them to subzero temperatures without the additional uptake of water are described. Results {{indicate that there}} are two main mechanisms that affect the {{hydraulic conductivity}} of Jet Fuel A- 1. For a constant bulk void ratio, as the water content increases, the hydraulic conductivity with respect <b>to</b> <b>Jet</b> Fuel A- 1 decreases. Similarly, for a constant water content, as bulk void ratio decreases, the hydraulic conductivity with respect <b>to</b> <b>Jet</b> Fuel A- 1 decreases. GCLs at positive temperatures with an initial degree of saturation (Sr) greater then 0. 77 had a hydraulic conductivity with respect <b>to</b> <b>Jet</b> Fuel A- 1 of less than 109 m/s, whereas GCLs at subzero temperatures with Sr. 0 : 70 had a hydraulic conductivity with respect <b>to</b> <b>Jet</b> Fuel A- 1 of less than 2 : 53 1010 m=s. Highly saturated (Sr. 0 : 85) GCLs at subzero temperatures were essentially impermeable, having a hydraulic conductivity with respect <b>to</b> <b>Jet</b> Fuel A- 1 of less than 1012 m/s...|$|R

50|$|While Modern's 990s {{were more}} {{expensive}} to operate than the dedicated short-/medium-haul jets of their British rivals in West Berlin due to higher fuel consumption and had more seats to fill, the airline compensated for these disadvantages with its single type fleet. This resulted in cost savings compared with mixed type fleet rivals. In addition, in the pre-1973 oil crisis era of low fuel prices, the relatively low acquisition costs of these well-maintained, older generation second-hand <b>jets</b> <b>partially</b> compensated for the superior economics of comparable, contemporary new-built, state-of-the-art jet aircraft such as the Boeing 727. Moreover, the 990's ability to carry a similar number of passengers as the 727 over greater distances made it more versatile and resulted in greater operational flexibility.|$|R
