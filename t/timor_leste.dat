However, by early-2010 the security situation had been stabilised and just 400 Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force. Following a drawdown, the International Stabilisation Force commenced withdrawing from Timor-Leste in November 2012, a process which was completed in April 2013.|$|E

In March 2007, the commandos, along with elements of the SASR, took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader, Alfredo Reinado.

In addition, it is expected that by e - procurement people are more interested and it can give positive impact on increasing the tender. Tender manually which is below 1 Million U. S.

The purpose of this research is to propose a new method in expanding and developing e-procurement service quality from manual to electronic effectively and efficiently.

Other important activities include supporting {{the development of the}} <b>Timor</b> <b>Leste</b> Defence Force and Papua New Guinea Defence Force and supplying watercraft to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

5|$|An SASR troop was {{deployed}} to <b>Timor</b> <b>Leste</b> in May 2006 {{as part of}} Operation Astute, operating alongside a Commando Company Group {{as part of the}} Special Forces Component following renewed unrest there. On 4 March 2007, along with the commandos, SASR personnel took part in the Battle of Same during which five rebels were killed during an unsuccessful attempt to apprehend the rebel leader, Alfredo Reinado. It was reported in October 2006 that 20 SASR operators were in the southern Philippines, supporting Filipino operations against the Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiah terrorist groups, but this was denied by the Department of Defence. Meanwhile, following tensions in Fiji between the military and the government the Australian Government dispatched three naval vessels in November and December 2006 as part of Operation Quickstep, in preparation for a potential evacuation of Australian citizens. On 29 November 2006, a Black Hawk helicopter from the 171st Aviation Squadron carrying four crew and six soldiers from the SASR crashed while attempting to land on HMAS Kanimbla and sank in international waters off Fiji. The helicopter's pilot and a soldier from SASR were killed in the crash.|$|E
5|$|The Special Air Service Regiment {{owes its}} {{heritage}} to the RAR. Originally formed as the 1st SAS Company in 1957, in 1960 {{it became an}} independent company of the RAR and was tasked with providing the army's special operations capability. The SASR became a regiment {{in its own right}} on 20 August 1964, severing the link with the RAR at this time. Re-raised as a commando battalion from 1997, 4 RAR (Commando) served in East Timor as a conventional light-role battalion in 2001, before focusing on the development of its special operations capability. In this role the battalion was designed to be a flexible, self-contained force element able to deploy at short notice to undertake offensive operations in support of Australia's national interests. Once full operational capability was reached, elements of 4 RAR (Commando) would serve in <b>Timor</b> <b>Leste,</b> Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as providing a domestic counter terrorism capability as part of Tactical Assault Group (East). In 2009, 4 RAR (Commando) was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment, and as such is no longer part of the RAR. Rather than being formally disbanded, 4 RAR remained on the Army's order of battle with its colours and traditions maintained and protected, ready to be re-raised in the future if required.|$|E

After the story became public in 2012, the Gillard Government inflamed tensions with East Timor by denying the alleged facts of the dispute and sending as a representative to Dili someone who was known by Gusmao to {{have been involved in the}} bugging. In 2015, Guamao said of Prime Minister Julia Gillard's response: [...] "It meant that the Prime Minister of a modern democracy on <b>Timor</b> <b>Leste's</b> doorstep Australia did not know what her intelligence service was doing." [...] The response of the Gillard Government led to East Timor's application to have the case heard in the Permanent Court of Arbitration. According to Gusmao, Prime Minister Tony Abbott sought to assuage East Timor's concerns over the spying scandal by assuring X that [...] "the Chinese are listening to Australia".In 2015, the bugging scandal received renewed interest after the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ran a story revealing the level of concern amongst senior intelligence officials in the Australian intelligence apparatus. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop banned Witness K from using his or her passport. As Collaery has pointed out, such security assessments are usually conducted by ASIO and not, as in the case of Witness K, by ASIS. Attorney-General George Brandis, under lengthy questioning by a panel of Australian senators, admitted that new national security laws could enable prosecution of Witness K and his lawyer, Collaery. Further, Australia's Solicitor General, Justin Gleeson SC, claimed in a submission to the ICJ that Witness K and Collaery could have breached parts of the Criminal Code pertaining to espionage and could be stripped of their Australia citizenship if they are dual-nationals (as, indeed, Collaery is). Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said in April 2016 that: [...] "We stand by the existing treaties, which are fair and consistent with international law." ...|$|R
