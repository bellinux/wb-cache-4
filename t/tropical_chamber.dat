40|$|Biocides play an {{important}} role in the preservation of a variety of products susceptible to microbiological growth such as paint, a material that can undergo microbial deterioration both in storing (inside the can) and after the application on a surface. In this work, artificial neural networks were used to predict the level of fungal growth on surfaces painted with water-based paints with biocide formulations containing different concentrations of ten kinds of commercial and experimental chemical agents. The use of neural networks is well known in chemical processes and they are a powerful tool for discovering relationships between sets of data. Industrial Environmental <b>Tropical</b> <b>Chamber</b> tests were used as the network training set. The importance of the each additive of the dry-film biocide formulation in prevention of biodeterioration was also examined...|$|E
40|$|We {{initiate}} {{a new approach}} {{to the study of the}} combinatorics of several parametrizations of canonical bases. In this work we deal with Lie algebras of type A. Using geometric objects called Rhombic tilings we derive a "crossing formula" to compute the actions of the crystal operators on Lusztig data for an arbitrary reduced word of the longest Weyl group element. We provide the following three applications of this result. Using the <b>tropical</b> <b>Chamber</b> Ansatz of Berenstein-Fomin-Zelevinsky we prove an enhanced version of the Anderson-Mirković conjecture for the crystal structure on MV polytopes. We establish a duality between Kashiwara's string and Lusztig's parametrization, revealing that each of them is controlled by the crystal structure of the other. We identify the potential functions of the unipotent radical of SL_n defined by Berenstein-Kazhdan and Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich, respectively, with a function arising from the crystal structure on Lusztig data...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the resistance of}} C. oleifera Abel. fruit shell's probe to fungi and termites. The degree of decay of C. oleifera Abel. fruit shells inoculated with Coriolus versicolor, Pycnoporus sanguineus, Coniophora puteana and Antrodia spp. in temperate or tropical environment was assessed. The resistance of the shells to subterranean termites in a <b>tropical</b> <b>chamber</b> was also assessed. It was found {{that there is an}} overall difference between the resistance to fungi decay and to termite attack. It was found that: the degree of degradation of the shell colonized by white-rot fungi is more severe than the fragmentation of the shell by brown-rot fungi. It was also found that the white-rot decay of C. oleifera Abel. fruit shell is greater than to beech wood, and then brown-rot decay of Scots pine sapwood is severer than to C. oleifera Abel. fruit shell. The resistance of C. oleifera Abel. fruit shell to attack by the subterranean termites was found to be high. It was concluded that the fungal species was an important controlling factor to the decomposition of C. oleifera Abel. fruit shell; and that termite infestation of C. oleifera Abel. fruit shell did take place but termite mortality (100 %) occurred. Based on these results, further investigations are being made in order to solve the use of massive by-product from edible tea-seed oil industries. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the performance of}} a displacement ventilation system in a thermal <b>chamber</b> with <b>tropical</b> subjects. The <b>chamber</b> is served by an Air-Conditioning and Mechanical Ventilation (ACMV) system in either Mixing or Displacement Ventilation modes. In the experiments, tropical subjects were surveyed with respect to their thermal sensations under different room conditions in either displacement ventilation or mixing ventilation. Objective measurements such as room air temperature, air velocity and relative humidity were measured at different heights in the chamber. The results show that the room neutral temperature for a displacement ventilation system is higher than the conventional mixing ventilation system. Subjects in the tropics can accept supply air temperature as low as 16. 2 °C and relative humidity as high as 77 % with room temperature of 23 °C...|$|R
40|$|Greenhouse gas budgets {{quantified}} via land-surface eddy covariance (EC) flux sites {{differ significantly}} from those obtained via inverse modeling. A possible reason for the discrepancy between methods may be our gap in quantitative knowledge of methane (CH 4) fluxes. In this study we carried out EC flux measurements during two intensive campaigns in summer 2008 to quantify methane flux from a hydropower reservoir and link its temporal variability to environmental driving forces: water temperature and pressure changes (atmospheric and due to changes in lake level). Methane fluxes were extremely high and highly variable, but consistently showed gas efflux from the lake when the wind was approaching the EC sensors across the open water, as confirmed by floating chamber flux measurements. The average flux was 3. 8 ± 0. 4 μg C m − 2 s − 1 (mean ± SE) with a median of 1. 4 μg C m − 2 s − 1, which is quite high even compared to <b>tropical</b> reservoirs. Floating <b>chamber</b> fluxes from four selected days confirmed such high fluxes with 7. 4 ± 1. 3 μg C m − 2 s − 1. Fluxes increased exponentially with increasing temperatures, but were decreasing exponentially with increasing atmospheric and/or lake level pressure. A multiple regression using lake surface temperatures (0. 1 m depth), temperature at depth (10 m deep {{in front of the}} dam), atmospheric pressure, and lake level was able to explain 35. 4 % of the overall variance. This best fit included each variable averaged over a 9 -h moving window, plus the respective short-term residuals thereof. We estimate that an annual average of 3 % of the particulate organic matter (POM) input via the river is sufficient to sustain these large CH 4 fluxes. To compensate the global warming potential associated with the CH 4 effluxes from this hydropower reservoir a 1. 3 to 3. 7 times larger terrestrial area with net carbon dioxide uptake is needed if a European-scale compilation of grasslands, croplands and forests is taken as reference. This indicates the potential relevance of temperate reservoirs and lakes in local and regional greenhouse gas budgets...|$|R
40|$|Certain fungal types {{can grow}} on dried paint films. They cause to {{deteriorate}} the dried paint films. Currently synthetic fungicides {{are used to}} prevent fungal growth. They are hazardous compounds, which caused irritation of eyes and skin, skin rashes, etc of humans. Therefore {{it is important to}} replace synthetic fungicides by environmentally friendly natural fungicides (extracted from plants). In this work cinnamon leaf oil, citronella oil and neem seed oil were used as natural fungicides. 8 fungal types grown on dried paint films were used to investigate the anti-fungal activity of the above oils. Quantitative analysis of cinnamon leaf oil and citronella oil were done using gas chromatography and quantitative analysis of neem seed oil was not done due to unavailability of standards. Modified method of agar over-lay technique was used to determine minimum inhibition concentration of the fungal types used, after introducing three oils. The results indicated cinnamon leaf oil is the best to use as fungicide for exterior emulsion paint out of three oils, as growth of all used fungal types were inhibited below at concentration of 2000 ppm, when introducing cinnamon leaf oil into each fungal type individually. It was more than 12000 ppm in citronella oil and more than 20000 ppm in neem seed oil. Modified method of ASTM D 2373 - 74 was used to determine the minimum inhibition concentration of cinnamon leaf oil to inhibit fungal growth on exterior emulsion paint film. Aging tests were done to determine effect of cinnamon leaf oil on viscosity, pH, colour of exterior emulsion paint and adherence of binder to the substrate after aging for three years. <b>Tropical</b> <b>chamber</b> test was used as an accelerated test method to investigate fungal degradation after applying cinnamon leaf oil as fungicide. According to the results, fungal growth in exterior emulsion paint could be inhibited below 3500 ppm of cinnamon leaf oil and applied paint film on a surface of an exterior substrate will not attack by fungi" for 2 - 3 years. Significant changes in viscosity, pH, colour of the exterior emulsion paint and adherence of binder to the. substrate were not detected due to cinnamon leaf oil. Results suggest that cinnamon leaf oil {{can be used as a}} fungicide to prevent growth of fungi considered and for the exterior emulsion paint used...|$|E
