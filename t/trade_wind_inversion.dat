40|$|A 20 -yr {{simulation}} with a fine-resolution regional {{atmospheric model}} for projected late twenty-first-century conditions in Hawaii is presented. The pseudo-global-warming method is employed, and the boundary conditions {{are based on}} a multimodel mean of projections made with global coupled models run with a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Results show that surface air temperature over land increases ~ 2 °– 4 °C with the greatest warming at the highest topographic heights. A modest tendency for the warming to be larger on the leeward sides of the major islands is also apparent. Climatological rainfall is projected to change up to ~ 25 % at many locations. The currently wet windward sides of the major islands will have more clouds and receive more rainfall, while the currently dry leeward sides will generally have even less clouds and rainfall. The average <b>trade</b> <b>wind</b> inversion–base height and the mean marine boundary layer cloud heights are projected to exhibit only small changes. However, the frequency of days with clearly defined <b>trade</b> <b>wind</b> <b>inversions</b> is predicted to increase substantially (~ 83 % to ~ 91 %). The extreme rainfall events are projected to increase significantly. An analysis of the model’s moisture budget in the lower troposphere shows that the increased mean rainfall on the windward sides of the islands is largely attributable to increased boundary layer moisture in the warmer climate. Rainfall changes attributable to mean low-level circulation changes are modest in comparison...|$|R

A nested version of the advanced Weather Research and Forecasting model with fine horizontal resolution and improved physics for the Hawaiian region has been configured. A 20 -year triply-nested simulation of the atmospheric flow was undertaken with a 3 -km Resolution mesh covering all main Hawaiian Islands and a 1 -km mesh over Maui. Ocean surface temperatures are prescribed from observations and meteorological fields at the boundaries of the outermost domain are taken from global reanalyses.

The 3 -km version of the model simulates realistically the frequency of <b>trade</b> <b>wind</b> <b>inversions,</b> time-mean rainfall and other variables on relatively small scales over Hawaii Island. There is a reasonable agreement between observed and simulated mean rainfall patterns over the other islands as well.

Precipitable water (PW) is retrieved over the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean from TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) infrared and microwave brightness temperatures (BTs) by statistical regression onto collocated Radiosonde Observations (RAOBs). All basic models which use only TOVS observations explain about 75 % of the variance. All OLR-enhanced models which also include Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) as a stratification criterion explain about 80 % of the variance. A radiative transfer model applied to RAOB soundings shows that collocation errors may explain about 10 % of the variance. Given the resultant 80 - 85 % variance explained by all basic models, the statistical method approaches the lower limit accuracy of microwave techniques. All OLR-enhanced models capture more variance and show more detailed features in the PW fields, but they are overly sensitive to calibration data sets and not easily transportable to other time periods. Independent regressions are performed for two data sets, and two best-fit models are chosen. Each model is dominated by different predictors, partly because of the high correlations between TOVS- channels and partly because of the climate changes during the time period. For climatological study of PW, a comprehensive model is developed from the calibration data set for winters of 1982 - 1990. The model explains 74 % of the variance with 0. 6 g/CM 2 root mean square error. The model explains stationary variance better than transient variance. The model is biased toward the climate mean PW, overestimating in dry regions and underestimating in wet regions.

The rain rate is lower than 2. 5 mm h- 1 throughout the lower part of the troposphere (about 2 km) and decreases in the higher altitudes.

The dynamical and microphysical properties (including drop size distributions) of four distinct rainfall events are also investigated through the analysis of four case studies representative of the variety of rain events occurring on Réunion: summer deep convection, northerly-to-northeasterly flow atmospheric pattern, cold front and winter depression embedded in <b>trade</b> <b>winds.</b> Radar-derived rain parameters are in good agreement with those obtained from collocated rain gauge observations in all cases, which demonstrates that accurate qualitative and quantitative analysis can be inferred from wind profiler data.

Results show that horizontal kinetic energy fluxes are systematically one order of magnitude higher than vertical kinetic energy fluxes.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with climate change {{in the region of}} the Canary Islands and the potential implications for the laurel forests of Tenerife. Frequent orographic cloud formation during the dry season is of vital importance to the altitudinal distribution of the laurel forests, because it maintains a semi-humid environment in the otherwise semi-arid climate of the Canary Islands. The distinctive environmental conditions in conjunction with the location of the Canary Islands on the Northern poleward edge of the Hadley Circulation make these ecosystems potentially highly sensitive to regional changes in climatic conditions. To explore this sensitivity, we first quantify observed trends in humidity and temperature across an altitudinal transect {{at the base of the}} Anaga peninsular, and second, analyse the results of three GCM experiments (CGCM 1, ECHAM 4 and CSIRO) to develop alternative climate change scenarios, and third, use these data to assess likely shifts in the elevational distribution of the laurel forest climate envelope. We report a significant increase in relative humidity and decreases in the diurnal temperature range on Tenerife at altitudes below the <b>trade</b> <b>wind</b> <b>inversion</b> within the last 30 years during the dry season, which suggests an increased occurrence of low-level clouds.
