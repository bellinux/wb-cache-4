5|$|The Great Plague {{killed an}} {{estimated}} 100,000 people—almost {{a quarter of}} London's population—in 18 months. The plague {{was caused by the}} Yersinia pestis bacterium, which is usually transmitted through <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> <b>of</b> an infected rat flea.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} possesses powers {{similar to}} those of the original Spider-Man, which were derived from <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> <b>of</b> a spider genetically engineered by Spider-Man's nemesis Norman Osborn in an attempt to duplicate those abilities.|$|E
5|$|All {{octopuses}} are venomous, {{but only}} a few species pose a significant threat to humans. Blue-ringed octopuses in the genus Hapalochlaena, which live around Australia and New Guinea, bite humans only if severely provoked, but their venom kills 25% of human victims. Another tropical species, Octopus apollyon, causes severe inflammation that can last for over a month even if treated correctly, and <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> <b>of</b> Octopus rubescens can cause necrosis that lasts longer than one month if untreated, and headaches and weakness persisting for up to a week even if treated.|$|E

50|$|Until 1955, {{the only}} {{antivenom}} available for general distribution for Australian snakes was the monovalent (specific) tiger snake (Notechis) antivenom, which gave varying degrees <b>of</b> cross-protection against <b>the</b> <b>bites</b> <b>of</b> most other dangerous Australian snakes. Thereafter followed specific anti-venom for other common snakes {{among them the}} coastal taipan, and finally, a polyvalent (broad spectrum) antivenom, a combined antivenom for <b>the</b> <b>bites</b> <b>of</b> any unidentified snake from Australia.|$|R
50|$|Often {{mistaken for}} Funnel-webs, <b>the</b> <b>bites</b> <b>of</b> Sydney brown trapdoors are not dangerous. Local pain and {{swelling}} may occur.|$|R
5|$|Among Seattle's {{prominent}} annual {{fairs and}} festivals are the 24-day Seattle International Film Festival, Northwest Folklife over the Memorial Day weekend, numerous Seafair events throughout July and August (ranging from a Bon Odori celebration to the Seafair Cup hydroplane races), <b>the</b> <b>Bite</b> <b>of</b> Seattle, {{one of the}} largest Gay Pride festivals in the United States, and the art and music festival Bumbershoot, which programs music as well as other art and entertainment over the Labor Day weekend. All are typically attended by 100,000people annually, as are the Seattle Hempfest and two separate Independence Day celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Mollusc {{species can}} also {{represent}} hazards or pests for human activities. <b>The</b> <b>bite</b> <b>of</b> the blue-ringed octopus is often fatal, {{and that of}} Octopus apollyon causes inflammation that can last for over a month. Stings from a few species of large tropical cone shells can also kill, but their sophisticated, though easily produced, venoms have become important tools in neurological research. Schistosomiasis (also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis or snail fever) is transmitted to humans via water snail hosts, and affects about 200million people. Snails and slugs can also be serious agricultural pests, and accidental or deliberate introduction of some snail species into new environments has seriously damaged some ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|The venom of {{the black}} mamba is {{extremely}} toxic. Its bites can deliver about 100–120mg of venom on average and the maximum dose recorded is 400mg. It is reported that before antivenom was widely available, the mortality rate from a bite was nearly 100%. <b>The</b> <b>bite</b> <b>of</b> a black mamba can potentially cause collapse in humans within 45 minutes, or less. Without effective antivenom therapy, death typically occurs in 7–15 hours. Presently, there is a polyvalent antivenom produced by the South African Institute for Medical Research to treat black mamba bites from many localities, and a new antivenom is currently being developed by the Universidad de Costa Rica's Instituto Clodomiro Picado.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} smaller mandibles {{and need to}} chew through {{decaying}} wood to lay eggs, females {{are thought to have}} a greater biting force. However, contrary to popular belief, <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male mandibles can in fact exceed <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> females, for example, <b>the</b> <b>biting</b> force <b>of</b> Cyclommatus metallifer males was found to 3 times that of females.|$|R

25|$|In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>bites</b> by widow spiders, Australian funnel-web spiders, or Brazilian {{wandering}} spiders, {{medical attention}} should be sought immediately as in some cases <b>the</b> <b>bites</b> <b>of</b> these spiders develop into a medical emergency. Antivenom is available for severe widow and funnel-web envenomation.|$|R
5|$|In the Oldman Formation (the {{geological}} {{equivalent of}} the Judith River formation), Daspletosaurus torosus could have preyed upon the hadrosaur species Brachylophosaurus canadensis, the ceratopsians Coronosaurus brinkmani and Albertaceratops nesmoi, pachycephalosaurs, ornithomimids, therizinosaurs and possibly ankylosaurs. Other predators included troodontids, oviraptorosaurs, the dromaeosaurid Saurornitholestes and possibly an albertosaurine tyrannosaur (genus currently unknown). The younger Dinosaur Park and Two Medicine Formations had faunas similar to the Oldman, with the Dinosaur Park in particular preserving an unrivaled array of dinosaurs. The albertosaurine Gorgosaurus lived alongside unnamed species of Daspletosaurus in the Dinosaur Park and Upper Two Medicine environments. Young tyrannosaurs may have filled the niches in between adult tyrannosaurs and smaller theropods, which were separated by two orders of magnitude in mass. A Saurornitholestes dentary has been discovered in the Dinosaur Park Formation that bore tooth marks left by <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> <b>of</b> a young tyrannosaur, possibly Daspletosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Themistocles left {{three sons}} by Archippe, {{daughter}} to Lysander of Alopece,—Archeptolis, Polyeuctus, and Cleophantus. Plato the philosopher mentions Cleophantus as a most excellent horseman, but otherwise insignificant person. And Themistocles had two sons older than these three, Neocles and Diocles. Neocles {{died when he}} was young by <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> <b>of</b> a horse, and Diocles was adopted by his grandfather, Lysander. Themistocles had many daughters, of whom Mnesiptolema, whom he had by a second marriage, was wife to Archeptolis, her brother by another mother, and became priestess of Cybele; Italia was married to Panthoides, of the island of Chios; Sybaris to Nicomedes the Athenian. After the death of Themistocles, his nephew, Phrasicles, went to Magnesia, and married, with her brothers' consent, another daughter, Nicomache, and took charge of her sister Asia, the youngest of all ten children.|$|E
5|$|Though not aggressive, {{the common}} {{stingray}} can inflict an excruciating wound with its serrated, venomous tail spine. The ancient Greeks and Romans greatly feared its venom, with authors such as Aelian (175–235 AD) stating that stingray wounds were incurable. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23–79 AD), in his Natural History, asserted that its spine {{was capable of}} killing trees, piercing armor like an arrow, and corroding iron. Greek poet Oppian (172–210 AD) claimed that the touch of stingray venom could even dissolve stone. In Greek mythology, Hercules {{was said to have}} lost a finger to <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> <b>of</b> a stingray, and Circe was said to have armed her son Telegonus with a spear tipped with a stingray spine, with which he accidentally slew his father Odysseus.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife may {{sometimes}} <b>bite</b> humans. <b>The</b> <b>bites</b> <b>of</b> various mammals such as bats, skunks, wolves, raccoons, etc. may transmit rabies, {{which is almost}} always fatal if left untreated.|$|R
50|$|Bibron's blind snakes are fossorial, {{and will}} burrow into brood {{chambers}} of termites and ants. They are protected from <b>the</b> <b>bites</b> <b>of</b> soldier ants by their close-fitting, shiny scales.|$|R

5|$|The Dinosaur Park Formation {{preserves}} a {{great wealth}} of vertebrate fossils. A {{wide variety of}} fish swam the rivers and estuaries, including gars, sturgeons, sharks and rays, among others. Frogs, salamanders, turtles, crocodilians and champsosaurs also dwelled in the aquatic habitats. Azhdarchid pterosaurs and neornithine birds like Apatornis flew overhead, while the enantiornithine bird Avisaurus lived on the ground alongside multituberculate, marsupial and placental mammals. A number of species of terrestrial lizards were also present, including whiptails, skinks, monitors and alligator lizards. Dinosaur fossils in particular are found with unrivaled abundance and diversity. Huge herds of ceratopsids roamed the floodplains alongside equally large groups of hadrosaurine and lambeosaurine hadrosaurs. Other herbivorous groups like ornithomimids, therizinosaurs, pachycephalosaurs, small ornithopods, nodosaurids and ankylosaurids were also represented. Small predatory dinosaurs like oviraptorosaurs, troodonts and dromaeosaurs hunted smaller prey than the huge tyrannosaurids; Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus, which were two orders of magnitude larger in mass. Intervening predatory niches may have been filled by young tyrannosaurids. A Saurornitholestes dentary has been discovered in the Dinosaur Park Formation that bore tooth marks left by <b>the</b> <b>bite</b> <b>of</b> a young tyrannosaur, possibly Gorgosaurus.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bite</b> <b>of</b> Salem, held in July at the Riverfront Park, is {{an event}} similar to others such as <b>the</b> <b>Bite</b> <b>of</b> Oregon in Portland. The event {{consists}} of a weekend of local restaurants in Salem offering samples of their menus to patrons in a festival atmosphere, with live entertainment and benefiting local charities. In the summer, Chef's Nite Out is a wine and food benefit held for Marion-Polk Food Share. Oregon Wine & Food Festival takes place at that state's fairgrounds in January.|$|E
