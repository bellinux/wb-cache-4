40|$|Abstract: The article {{deals with}} the {{conception}} of carrying out investigation work on lateral resistance {{in the course of}} geometrical railway track alignment by using a <b>tamping</b> <b>machine.</b> It is a continuation of the experimental work on the application of the <b>tamping</b> <b>machine</b> to the continuous welded rail track diagnosis. In earlier articles, attention was concentrated on the determination of axial forces in rails. An analytical approach to the evaluation of lateral resis-tances based on a continuous registration of the displacement and the force used by the <b>tamping</b> <b>machine</b> for the displacement of track on a horizontal plane (so-called slewing or shifting) is presented. The obtained results offer a possibility of estimating a phenomenon tested taking into consideration the state of the track ballast (the layer of crushed rock or gravel upon which the railway track is laid) bed stabilization, the distribution of the lateral resistances occurring along the length of railway track sections under tests, and also the effect of the longitudinal forces appear in track sections. The performed experiments have confirmed the thesis about the use of the <b>tamping</b> <b>machine</b> to diagnose the lateral resistance state in railway tracks. Some trends towards further undertakings in this sphere, of development character intended to polish up the measuring system, and the way of archiving and interpreting the measuring results have been formulated...|$|R

2500|$|If the {{trackbed}} becomes uneven, it {{is necessary}} to pack ballast underneath sunk ties to level the track out again. This is, in the mechanized age, usually done by a ballast <b>tamping</b> <b>machine.</b> A more recent, and probably better, technique is to lift the rails and ties, and to force stones, smaller than the track ballast particles and all of the same size, into the gap. This has the advantage of not disturbing the well-compacted ballast on the trackbed, as tamping is likely to do. This technique is called pneumatic ballast injection (PBI), or, less formally, [...] "stoneblowing". However, this technique is not as effective with fresh ballast, as the smaller stones tend to move down between the larger pieces of ballast.|$|R
50|$|A {{tamping machine}} or ballast tamper is a machine used to pack (or tamp) the track ballast under railway tracks {{to make the}} tracks more durable.

50|$|The {{traditional}} use {{of these}} locomotives has been to haul trains using power from the rails until they reach the area where work is to be undertaken, where they switch to battery operation if the traction supply has been isolated. They are also used for transporting diesel powered equipment such as track <b>tamping</b> <b>machines</b> through tunnel sections. Normally one locomotive is marshalled {{at each end of}} the train, allowing the train to be reversed easily. The connections between different Underground lines often require reversals on route. Early locomotives were not allowed to operate on their own as they only had a single air compressor, but twin compressors were fitted to vehicles built from 1964 onwards, to allow single operation.With the building of the Jubilee line diesel-powered locomotives manufactured by Schöma of Germany in 1996 took over some of the duties of the battery locomotives.|$|E

30|$|Plan the {{maintenance}} for each track. Maintenance planning {{is done by}} the Trafikverket contractor. The car inspection records the faults, as shown in Fig.  4, and equates risk level to required maintenance. Corrective tamping maintenance is governed by regulations in the SS-EN 13848 standard and preventive tamping should be planned in advance. There are two main aspects to consider in maintenance planning: applying for track possession time and decreasing {{the maintenance}} cost by predicting the required tamping. For instance, predicting tamping for nine months is enough time to consider the maintenance plan and budget. However, the costs depend on the distance of the track needing maintenance and the location needing maintenance. Another person claimed setting up a maintenance plan for a certain part of the track will help estimate the cost required to order the <b>tamping</b> <b>machine.</b> At the same time, it will decrease the cost and improve the track quality and performance.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] 31 railway {{workers and}} 32 lumberjacks were {{examined}} {{to compare the}} dose-response relation between the exposure to two types of hand-arm vibration and the sensory disturbances in peripheral nerves as evaluated by the vibration perception thresholds (VPTs). METHODS [...] Clinical examinations were carried out that included measurements of the VPTs, and electroneuromyography (ENMG), and an inquiry to confirm the use of vibrating tools. Diseases of {{the central nervous system}} and neuropathies were checked by inquiry and a clinical examination, diabetes was excluded by a blood sample analysis, and the subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome confirmed with ENMG were excluded from the study. RESULTS [...] Lifetime use of hand held <b>tamping</b> <b>machines</b> (railway workers) and chain saws (lumberjacks) had a significant correlation with the VPTs at frequencies from 32 to 500 Hz. The increase of the VPTs (250 Hz) in relation to use of vibrating tools was 1. 8 -fold higher on average in the whole group and 2. 3 -fold higher in the young (< 45) railway workers who had used hand held <b>tamping</b> <b>machines,</b> than in the corresponding groups of lumberjacks, who had used chain saws, whereas the frequency weighted acceleration of vibration in <b>tamping</b> <b>machines</b> was fourfold. CONCLUSION [...] There was a significant dose-response relation between the exposure to hand-arm vibration and the VPTs. The VPTs {{as a function of the}} frequency weighted acceleration of vibration and the exposure to vibration gave promising results for assessment of the risk of damage to sensory nerves induced by vibration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{requirements}} of higher speed, safety and more smooth and comfortable travelling are increasing strongly, {{this leads to}} the need of predictive maintenance of railway line, <b>tamping</b> <b>machines</b> have been used for this purpose. This paper presents the results of vibration characteristic of tamping device. Firstly, the basic working principle of tamping device was simply described; Then a simulation model of tamping device was established using SIMULINK in terms of mechanism principle; Finally, some vibration parameters were researched, such as velocity, acceleration, displacement of tamping device, which reflect the vibration characteristic of tamping device. In addition, the modeling process of simulation model was described, the function of SIMULINK was also simply recommended. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} propose an analysis method on facility vibration characteristic, which visualized reflects the kinematics characteristic of mechanism. The results show that the application of the technology can make the simulation process more visualization. The modeling process more simply, thus greatly improve modeling and simulation efficiency, and directly achieve our aims...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of the strategy {{to ensure that the}} geometry for railway track is kept within acceptable limits, in a cost effective manner, is a complex process. It requires the simultaneous consideration of the activities which govern inspection, maintenance and renewal. In addition to this the geometry degradation process is dependent upon the maintenance history. The condition where the track geometry is shown to have deteriorated to a level where intervention is required can be improved using a <b>tamping</b> <b>machine.</b> <b>Tamping</b> is carried out by a special train which measures the geometry of the rails, predicts the correction needed, lifts the rails to the required position, inserts tines into the ballast either side of the sleepers and packs the ballast such that the correct rail position is attained. Whilst improving the geometry this process has the disadvantage that it also breaks the ballast which accelerates the track geometry degradation and reduces the time between interventions. This paper describes a modelling process to predict the state of the track geometry given any specified asset management strategy. It is based on the Petri net method and in addition to predicting the track condition over time it can also compute the expected whole life costs. By varying the parameters which govern the inspection, maintenance and renewal of the ballast as the most cost effective means to achieve the required level of performance can be predicted...|$|R
50|$|The Soviet Union {{made the}} {{transition}} to automatic brakes and couplers long after the United States did {{and as a result}} their brakes and couplers were more advanced.Their (air) brakes could operate in a mode where it was possible to slowly reduce braking effort, while the US system required full release of the brakes (in the entire train) and reapplication of the brakes in order to reduce braking effort.The Soviet Union developed advanced machinery for track maintenance and renewal such as a Continuous Action <b>Tamping</b> <b>Machine</b> which in 1977 could move at 3 km/hr and also straighten the track and dress the ballast. It was model ВПО-3000 (VPO-3000) and at that time no such machinery like this existed outside of the Soviet Union. It was claimed to be several times faster than non-Soviet tamping machinery of cyclical action. However, the reliability of locomotives in the USSR was much worse than for the US. Their high traffic density often resulted in traffic congestion and delays, especially after an accident blocked the line.|$|R
40|$|Four {{different}} granule size {{fractions of}} Sorbitol instant(R) were filled into hard gelatine capsules on a tamp filling (Bosch) and a dosator nozzle machine (Zanasi) to allow {{comparison of the}} filling principles. An acceptable filling performance was always achieved and was independent of the <b>machine</b> type employed. <b>Tamp</b> filling {{was found to be}} slightly better for the coarser granule size fractions, because {{it does not seem to}} rely on a firm plug formation. A direct relationship between the angle of internal flow (Varthalis and Pilpel, 1976) and the coefficient of fill weight variation was found for both systems. Using the dosator nozzle machine, the plug formed was always denser than the maximum bulk density, whereas on the <b>tamp</b> filling <b>machine</b> for smallest granule size the maximum plug density could not be achieved with the settings employed. The results suggest that in situations where a low plug density is an essential prerequisite for drug dissolution and bioavailability the <b>tamp</b> filling <b>machine</b> appears the more suitable filling principle. However, if a greater extent of compression is required in order to fill large dose drugs or to use a smaller capsule size, the dosator nozzle principle might work more successfully for granules...|$|R
