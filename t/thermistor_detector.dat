40|$|Total {{hemispherical}} emittance measurements are made routinely for materials {{which may be}} heated by electrical resistance methods over the temperature range of 600 degrees to 2, 000 F by using a black-body reference method. This employs a conical black body and a thermopile detector with a calcium fluoride lens. Emittance is obtained by measuring the radiant flux from the specimen strip and comparing it with the flux from an equal area of the black-body cone at the same temperature. The temperature measurements are made by use of thermocouples. It is planned to extend the temperature range {{of this type of}} measurement to temperatures above 2, 000 F. Another technique has been investigated for measuring emittance of materials not amenable to electrical heating or thermocouple attachment. This method uses a black-body-cavity furnace similar to that used in reference 5 to measure emittance of transparent materials such as glass. The method employs a heated black-body cavity in which the semicircular specimen is allowed to come to the equilibrium temperature of the cavity and then is rotated in front of a water-cooled viewing port where a sensitive <b>thermistor</b> <b>detector</b> alternately views the specimen surface and the black-body cavity. The ratio of the two readings gives the specimen emittance directly, for the temperature of the black body. The detector output is recorded on a fast Brown self-balancing potentiometer. The furnace is provided with a water-cooled blackened shutter which may be inserted behind the specimen to eliminate any transmitted black-body radiation if the specimen is transparent. This apparatus is capable of measuring total normal emittance over the temperature range of 1, 000 degrees to 2, 000 F. Preliminary data for boron nitride specimens of two thicknesses are shown where total normal emittance is plotted against temperature for two experimental conditions: (1) black-body radiation incident {{on the back of the}} specimen and (2) no black-body radiation incident on the back of the specimen (that is, with a watercooled shutter behind the specimen). The data appear to indicate a slight transparency for the thin specimen and emittances of from 0. 7 to 0. 8 over the temperature range...|$|E

Spectrographic analysis of failed bolometers revealed selenium pure zones in the insulating selenium arsenic (Se-As) glass film which surrounds the active sintered Mn, Ni, Co oxide flake.

40|$|We {{have been}} {{developing}} thermal detectors for X-ray astronomy. These detectors have {{the advantages of}} both high energy resolution and high quantum efficiency. A practical detector operating at a temperature of 0. 1 K could ideally have a resolution as good as 1 eV (FWHM). We have produced a detector with a measured resolution of 7 eV (FWHM) for 6 keV X-rays. The detailed behavior of the <b>detector</b> <b>thermistor</b> and thermal links impose limits on performance. Techniques for improving detector behavior will be discussed.

40|$|The {{temperature}} stabilization {{requirements of}} unchopped thermistor bolometers and thermopile detectors are analyzed. The detector temperature, {{on which the}} bolometer output signal depends, is quite sensitive to changes in instrument temperature but relatively insensitive to changes in scene temperature. In contrast, the difference in temperature between detector and substrate (instrument), on which the thermopile signal depends, is equally sensitive to changes in instrument and scene temperature. Expressions for these dependencies are derived based on a simplified instrument model. It is shown that for a typical uncooled thermal imager, the temperature stabilization requirements for a bolometer are two orders of magnitude more stringent than those for a thermopile <b>detector.</b> Keywords: <b>thermistor,</b> bolometer, thermopile, <b>detector,</b> IR, thermal, temperature stabilizatio...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{complete}} {{design of a}} multi channels PID controller for Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC) using a pulse width modulation (PWM) technique implemented by a dedicated programmable logic device (PLD) programmed by VHDL. The PID control loop is implemented by software written by National Instrument Lab-Windows CVI. Due {{to the fact that}} the implementation is by a VHDL and PLD the design is modular, as a result, the circuit is very compact in size and very low cost as compared to any commercial product. In addition, since the control loop is implemented by software running on a personal computer (PC) using a C language, it is easy to adjust the controller to various environmental conditions and for a width range of sensors like: a thermo couple (TC), <b>thermistor,</b> resistance temperature <b>detectors</b> (RTD) etc. We demonstrate the performance of this circuit as a controller for a small incubator using thermistor as the temperature sensor...|$|R
40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} flow injection analysis (FIA) -based thermal enzyme-linked immunoassay, TELISA, {{was developed for}} the rapid detection of atrazine (ATZ) in tap water. ATZ and beta-lactamase-labeled ATZ were employed in a competitive immunoassay using a monoclonal antibody (mAb). After the off-column liquid-phase competition, the mAb was captured on the Protein G Sepharose (TM) 4 Fast Flow (PGSFF) column support material. Injected beta-lactamase substrate ampicillin was degraded by the column-bound ATZ-beta-lactamase, generating a detectable heat signal. Several assay parameters were optimized, including substrate concentration, flow rates and regeneration conditions, {{as well as the}} mAb and ATZ-beta dilution ratios and concentrations. The assay linear range was 0. 73 - 4. 83 ng mL(- 1) with a detection limit of 0. 66 ng mL(- 1). An entire heat signal requires 10 min for generation, and the cycle time is less than 40 min. The results were reproducible and stable. ATZ-spiked tap water samples exhibited a recovery rate of 103 %- 116 %, which correlated with the UHPLC-MS/MS measurements. We attributed this significant increase in sensitivity over our previously published work to the following factors: (i) the capture of already-formed immune complexes on the column via immobilized Protein G, which eliminated chemical immobilization of the antibody; (ii) off-column preincubation allows the formation of immune complexes under nearly ideal conditions; and (iii) multiple buffers can be used to, in one case, enhance immune-complex formation and in the other to maximize enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the scheme creates a universal assay platform in which sensing is performed in the off-column incubation and detection after capture in the enzyme <b>thermistor</b> (ET) <b>detector,</b> which opens up the possibility of detecting any antigen for which antibodies were available...|$|R
40|$|The High-Frequency Instrument (HFI) for the Planck Surveyor {{mission will}} measure anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) down to scales of 6 arcmin {{and to an}} {{accuracy}} of ΔT/T= 2 × 10 − 6. Channels ranging in frequency from 100 to 857 GHz will use 100 mK spider web bolometer detectors with NTD Ge <b>thermistors.</b> The <b>detectors</b> must be photon noise limited and fast enough to preserve signal information at the 1 r. p. m. scan rate of the satellite. The prime low-frequency CMB channels at 143 and 217 GHz are the most technically demanding owing to the lower background limited NEPs. For the 143 GHz channel the requirements are that the time constant τ< 5. 7 ms and the NEPbol < 1. 53 × 10 − 17 WHz− 1 / 2 including contribution from amplifier noise. We present here thermal, electrical and optical data on a prototype detector which, although optimised for the 100 GHz channel, satisfies most of {{the requirements of the}} more demanding 143 GHz channel. The measurements are consistent with ideal thermal behaviour of the detector over the appropriate bias and temperature ranges for optimum performance. From optically blanked electrical measurements we determined the dependence of resistance and thermal conductance on temperature over a wide range, 70 – 200 mK. The optical responsivity and NEP were measured under photon background conditions similar to those expected in flight. Measurements of speed of response as a function of bias at different temperatures allowed us to determine the variation of total heat capacity with temperature. Extrapolation of these data show that in principal performance for all the Planck HFI channels can be met...|$|R
50|$|Instruments with moving coils can be {{calibrated}} {{for direct}} current or power frequency currents up {{to a few}} hundred hertz. At radio frequencies a common method is a rectifier circuit arranged to respond to current in a transmission line; the system is calibrated for the known circuit impedance. Diode detectors are either directly connected to the source, or used with a sampling system that diverts {{only a portion of}} the RF power through the <b>detector.</b> <b>Thermistors</b> and thermocouples are used to measure heat produced by RF power and can be calibrated either directly or by comparison with a known reference source of power. A bolometer power sensor converts incident radio frequency power to heat. The sensor element is maintained at a constant temperature by a small direct current. The reduction in current required to maintain temperature is related to the incident RF power. Instruments of this type are used throughout the RF spectrum and can even measure visible light power. For high-power measurements, a calorimeter directly measures heat produced by RF power.|$|R

40|$|Human body {{temperature}} is of vital {{importance to the}} well being of the person and therefore it is routinely monitored to indicate {{the state of the}} person’s health. Despite the fact that temperature measurement in humans seems so simple, a wide variety of devices are available to record a temperature from skin, oral or rectal mucosa or the tympanic membrane. The choice of clinical thermometers for health professionals and parents has never been so complicated. This chapter makes an attempt to provide an overview of temperature sensing technologies in medicine. The introductory sections give a brief and general description of temperature and its effect on the human body. A synoptic historical review on the evolution of the thermometer including the clinical thermometer is given in section 3. Section 4 describes the main sensors/transducers used in the development of clinical thermometers, such as thermocouples, <b>thermistors,</b> Resistance Temperature <b>Detectors</b> (RTDs), semiconductor temperature sensors, liquid crystal temperature sensors, and infra-red radiation sensors.
