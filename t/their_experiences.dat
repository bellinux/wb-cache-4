5|$|After Jesus' death, his {{followers}} said {{he rose from}} the dead, although exact details of <b>their</b> <b>experiences</b> are unclear.

According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E
