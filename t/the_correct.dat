40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we study}} the {{thermodynamic}} quantities of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe {{by using the}} tunneling formalism beyond semiclassical approximation developed by Banerjee and Majhi[25]. For this we first calculate <b>the</b> <b>corrected</b> Hawking-like temperature on apparent horizon by considering both scalar particle and fermion tunneling. With this <b>corrected</b> Hawking-like temperature, <b>the</b> explicit expressions of <b>the</b> <b>corrected</b> entropy of apparent horizon for various gravity theories including Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity, Lovelock gravity, f(R) gravity and scalar-tensor gravity, are computed. Our results show that <b>the</b> <b>corrected</b> entropy formula for different gravity theories can be written into a general expression (4. 39) of a same form. It is also shown that this expression is also valid for black holes. This might imply that the expression for <b>the</b> <b>corrected</b> entropy derived from tunneling method is independent of gravity theory, spacetime and dimension of the spacetime. Moreover, it is concluded that the basic thermodynamical property that <b>the</b> <b>corrected</b> entropy on apparent horizon is a state function is satisfied by the FRW universe...|$|R

This feature strongly suggests deep universality of <b>the</b> <b>corrected</b> entropy formula (), which may {{not depend on the}} dimensions of spacetime and gravity theories. In addition, the leading order correction of corrected entropy formula always appears as the logarithmic of the semiclassical entropy, rather than the logarithmic of the area of black hole horizon, this might imply that the logarithmic of the semiclassical entropy is more appropriate for quantum correction than the logarithmic of the area.
