The measure of economic activity was an index of <b>total</b> industrial <b>output</b> sold, <b>recorded</b> monthly from January 1999 to December 2008, adjusted for seasonal and random fluctuations. The analysis of dominant business cycles was performed using spectral analysis. To assess the synchronization of cycles, characteristics of cospectral analysis were used: coefficient of coherence, amplitude intensification and phase difference. In the conclusion, an attempt is made to construct a synthetic indicator as a means of ranking the regions by degree of business cycle synchronization. spectral analysis, cospectral analysis, business cycle, synthetic indicator. ...|$|R

40|$|Ageing is {{associated}} with an increased incidence of constipation in humans. The contribution that the ageing process makes to this condition is unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of age on faecal output and colonic motility in male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice and to determine the role that altered tachykinin signalling plays in this process. <b>Total</b> faecal <b>output</b> <b>recorded</b> over a 24 h period decreased with age due to a reduction in the number of pellets produced and their water content. These changes occurred in the absence of any significant change in food and water intake. There was an increase in the amount of faecal matter stored in the isolated colon with age which caused a proportional increase in colonic length. Analysis of colonic motility using an artificial pellet demonstrated that pellets moved in a stepwise fashion through the colon. There was an age-related increase in pellet transit time due to decreases in the step distance, velocity, and frequency of stepwise movements. These changes were reversed using the neurokinin 2 (NK 2) receptor agonist neurokinin A. Addition of the NK 2 receptor antagonist GR 159897 significantly increased transit time in the young animals by decreasing step distance, velocity and frequency, but was without effect in the aged colon. In summary, the ageing C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse shows an impaired motility phenotype. These effects appear, at least in part, to be due to an attenuation of tachykinin signalling via NK 2 receptors...|$|R
