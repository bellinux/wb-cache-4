25|$|In England, {{the celebration}} of the Night before Epiphany, Epiphany Eve, is known as Twelfth Night (The first night of Christmas is December 25–26, and Twelfth Night is January 5–6), and was a {{traditional}} time for mumming and the wassail. The yule log was left burning until this day, and the charcoal left was kept until the next Christmas to kindle next year's yule log, as well as to protect the house from fire and lightning. In the past, Epiphany was also a day for playing practical jokes, similar to April Fool's Day. Today in England, Twelfth Night is still as popular a day for plays as when Shakespeare's Twelfth Night was first performed in 1601, and annual celebrations involving the Holly Man are held in London. A traditional dish for Epiphany was Twelfth Cake, a rich, dense, typically English fruitcake. As in Europe, whoever found the baked-in bean was king for a day, but unique to English tradition other items were sometimes included in the cake. Whoever found the clove was the villain, the twig, the fool, and <b>the</b> <b>rag,</b> the tart. Anything spicy or hot, like ginger snaps and spiced ale, was considered proper Twelfth Night fare, recalling the costly spices brought by the Wise Men. Another English Epiphany dessert was the jam tart, but made into a six-point star for the occasion to symbolize the Star of Bethlehem, and thus called Epiphany tart. The discerning English cook sometimes tried to use thirteen different coloured jams on the tart on this day for luck, creating a dessert with the appearance of stained glass.|$|E

500|$|... "Bethena, A Concert Waltz" [...] (copyright {{registered}} March 6, 1905) is {{a composition}} by Scott Joplin. It {{was the first}} Joplin work since his wife Freddie's death on September 10, 1904 of pneumonia, ten weeks after their wedding. At the time the composer had significant financial problems; the work did not sell successfully {{at the time of}} publication and was soon neglected and forgotten. It was rediscovered {{as a result of the}} Joplin revival in the 1970s and has received acclaim from Joplin's biographers and other critics. The piece combines two different styles of music, the classical waltz and <b>the</b> <b>rag,</b> and has been seen as demonstrating Joplin's excellence as a classical composer. The work has been described as [...] "an enchantingly beautiful piece that is among the greatest of Ragtime Waltzes", a [...] "masterpiece", and [...] "Joplin's finest waltz".|$|E
500|$|In 1930 {{the company}} adapted <b>the</b> <b>Rag</b> Room {{for use as}} the company museum, a role it has filled since. [...] Following plans {{developed}} by architect Charles S. Keefe, the company reinforced the building's foundation with steel and concrete, filling {{in a number of}} its windows with stonework. [...] The interior was significantly reworked, with new structural woodwork and flooring. [...] Upon completion the interior was said to resemble that of the Old Ship Church in Hingham, Massachusetts. [...] In 1967 the company retained the Olmsted Brothers firm to design landscaping of the area, although their work has since been compromised to some extent by later development on the property. [...] The site was declared a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. [...] In 2005 it became part of the listed Cranesville Historic District, which includes, among other properties, the 1816 home of Zenas Crane.|$|E
500|$|Joplin's {{usage of}} Italian tempo {{indications}} in [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] {{has been interpreted}} as his intention to give the piece a serious aspect {{in a similar manner}} to Treemonisha and [...] "Scott Joplin's New Rag". [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] begins with the instruction [...] "Allegretto ma non troppo" [...] (moderately fast, but not too much) and continues in the D strain with [...] "Tempo l'istesso" [...] (tempo remains the same), a warning against slowing down for the minor-mode section. As well, Joplin employed in [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] the classic [...] "common time" [...] 4/4 time signature instead of the more usual 2/4 time of rag tunes. Simultaneously, Joplin doubled all the note values, effectively making the unusual 4/4 time signature have no practical effect on the way the piece sounded or the way it was performed. His publishing it in 4/4 was simply a way to connect <b>the</b> <b>rag</b> with classical and popular piano works of prior fame. Since Joplin published [...] "Magnetic Rag" [...] himself, {{it has been suggested that}} the composition fully reflected his wishes and contained no compromises.|$|E

500|$|As Country Joe and the Fish's {{popularity}} grew, {{the band}} relocated to San Francisco in early 1966 and became popular fixtures at the Avalon and the Filmore Auditorium. On June 6, 1966, the band recorded a second self-produced EP, which was packaged separately from <b>the</b> <b>Rag</b> Baby magazine and, upon its release, debuted the new psychedelic rock {{incarnation of the}} group. The EP fulfilled the band's ambitions to incorporate electric instruments into their music, effectively melding the instrumentals and pioneering an early template for the musical subgenre of acid rock. It included McDonald's compositions [...] "(Thing Called) Love" [...] and [...] "Bass Strings" [...] on the A-side and the six-minute [...] "Section 43" [...] on the B-side. Music historian Richie Unterberger praised [...] "Section 43", saying its [...] "Asiatic guitar, tribal maracas, devious organ, floating harmonica, and ethereal mid-sections of delicate koto-like guitar picking rivaled the Paul Butterfield Blues Band's East West as the finest psychedelic instrumental ever". Within three months, airplay of the EP spread across the new so-called progressive radio stations, reaching as far as New York City, and establishing Country Joe and the Fish as a nationally relevant musical act.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{a parody of}} the Michael Jackson song [...] "Thriller", {{as well as the}} music video. When Chef becomes a zombie, he is dressed like Jackson from the [...] "Thriller" [...] video, and he and the other zombies dance in a similar way. Chef also shouts [...] "Oh" [...] the same way Jackson often did during music performances. The song Chef sings is also similar to the actual [...] "Thriller" [...] song, but Parker said they deliberately made it [...] "(just) different enough that we can't get sued". Stan is ridiculed for his likeness to Raggedy Andy, based on <b>the</b> <b>rag</b> doll character by children's writer Johnny Gruelle; Stan's girlfriend Wendy was originally supposed to dress as Raggedy Ann with Stan, but she instead chose to dress as Chewbacca. When Cartman later dons a [...] "ghost" [...] costume, it resembles a costume from the Ku Klux Klan, the militant white supremacy organization. Parker and Stone said they feel Klan jokes are particularly funny because the concept of KKK is so stupid. Stone said, [...] "Dressing up like ghosts to scare black people is just stupid. Stupidly funny." [...] The zombie-version of Kenny is said to resemble Edward James Olmos, the American actor who played Lt. Martin Costillo in Miami Vice.|$|E
