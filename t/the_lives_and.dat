5|$|Trees {{have been}} venerated since time immemorial. To the ancient Celts, certain trees, {{especially}} the oak, ash and thorn, held special significance as providing fuel, building materials, ornamental objects and weaponry. Other cultures have similarly revered trees, often linking <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> fortunes {{of individuals to}} them or using them as oracles. In Greek mythology, dryads {{were believed to be}} shy nymphs who inhabited trees.|$|E
5|$|For the album, the Strokes strived {{to capture}} a simple rock sound that was not {{significantly}} enhanced in the studio. Building {{on the work of}} their 2001 extended play, The Modern Age, the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during the recording sessions, while songwriter Julian Casablancas continued to detail <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> relationships of urban youth. Following the completion of Is This It, the Strokes embarked on a promotional world tour before its release. The album's cover photograph courted controversy for being too sexually explicit and was replaced for the US market. The American track listing was also amended in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology is {{explicitly}} embodied {{in a large}} collection of narratives, and implicitly in Greek representational arts, such as ancient vase-paintings and votive gifts. Greek myth attempts to explain {{the origins of the}} world, and details <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> adventures {{of a wide variety of}} gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines and mythological creatures. These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition; today the Greek myths are known primarily from ancient Greek literature.|$|E

5|$|Hesketh enjoyed {{looking after}} the Rossall estate (which had no steward or agent), but {{struggled}} to keep on top of finances; he was an indulgent landlord.

5|$|In 1972, key {{elements}} of the park, including the Memorial to Heroic Self Sacrifice, were grade II listed to preserve their character. Following the 2004 film Closer, based on the 1997 play Closer by Patrick Marber, Postman's Park experienced a resurgence of interest; key scenes of both were set in the park itself. In June 2009, a city worker, Jane Shaka (née Michele), via the Diocese of London added a new tablet to the Memorial, the first new addition for 78 years. In November 2013 a free mobile app, The Everyday Heroes of Postman’s Park, was launched which documents <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> deaths of those commemorated on the memorial.|$|E

5|$|Many congregations {{gathered}} in their churches upon hearing {{news of the}} attacks, volunteering {{to spend the night}} there to protect them from further attacks. The local Catholic leaders demanded a peaceful bandh on 15 September in and around the city of Mangalore, and as a response Catholic traders and transport owners closed their shops and stopped their vehicles. A memorandum was submitted to the district council at 10.30 am, seeking protection for <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> property of Christians. Prayers were to be held in all the 48 churches of the district on Wednesday, 17 September. On 6 October 2008, some 10,000 people from civil society and religious organisations organised a march to protest against the anti-Christian perpetrators of the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Part of the Dinorwig Slate Quarry is now {{within the}} Padarn Country Park, {{and the other}} part houses the Dinorwig power station in caverns under the old quarry workings. The National Slate Museum is located {{in some of the}} quarry workshops. The museum has {{displays}} including Victorian slate-workers' cottages that once stood at Tanygrisiau near Blaenau Ffestiniog. As well as many exhibits, it has the multi-media display To Steal a Mountain, showing <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> work of the men who quarried slate here. The museum has the largest working water wheel in the United Kingdom, which is available for viewing via several walkways, and a restored incline formerly used to carry slate waggons uphill and downhill.|$|E
5|$|The {{stories were}} written when Irish {{nationalism}} {{was at its}} peak and {{a search for a}} national identity and purpose was raging; at a crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by converging ideas and influences. The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel Ulysses. The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists. Subsequent stories deal with <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.|$|E

Dayton {{is also home to}} America's Packard Museum, which contains many restored historical Packard vehicles. SunWatch Indian Village/Archaeological Park, a partially reconstructed 12th-century prehistoric American Indian village, is on the south end of Dayton; it is organized around a central plaza dominated by wood posts forming an astronomical calendar. The park includes a museum where visitors can learn about the Indian history of the Miami Valley.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} funerary stelas for {{officials}} of the late Third dynasty, small amounts of biographical detail were added next to the deceased men's titles. However, {{it was not until}} the Sixth dynasty that narratives of <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> careers of government officials were inscribed. Tomb biographies became more detailed during the Middle Kingdom, and included information about the deceased person's family. The vast majority of autobiographical texts are dedicated to scribal bureaucrats, but during the New Kingdom some were dedicated to military officers and soldiers. Autobiographical texts of the Late Period place a greater stress upon seeking help from deities than acting righteously to succeed in life. Whereas earlier autobiographical texts exclusively dealt with celebrating successful lives, Late Period autobiographical texts include laments for premature death, similar to the epitaphs of ancient Greece.|$|E
5|$|His {{behaviour}} {{on campaign}} {{can only be}} described as perfectly honourable and at times humane, a trait which was illustrated during the French Revolutionary Wars, when he spared no effort to protect captured émigrés from the wrath of the Revolutionary radicals in the army. He also showed respect for occupied populations and never tolerated pillaging nor violence from his men. As a sign a gratitude, he was offered gifts several times but he was often seen refusing and sending them back. While on campaign in Tyrol, he was recorded to have accepted a large sum of money but he immediately distributed it to the local hospitals. Further evidence of his humanity was the care that he displayed for <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> well-being of his men, whom he was always reluctant to sacrifice for the sake of glory.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Ed Harris {{directed}} Connelly in the biopic Pollock {{in which}} she played Ruth Kligman, Jackson Pollock's mistress. In 2000 she appeared in what critics considered her breakthrough film, Requiem for a Dream, directed by Darren Aronofsky {{and based on the}} novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. Connelly played Marion Silver, the girlfriend of Harry, played by Jared Leto; the movie also starred Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn. Her character is a middle-class girl from Manhattan Beach who pursues the dream of establishing a dress shop. She becomes addicted to heroin and descends into a life of prostitution. Connelly prepared for the role by renting an apartment in the building where the character lived. During her time in the apartment, Connelly isolated herself, painted, listened to music that she considered that her character would, designed clothes, and used the time to reflect about addictions and their origin. Connelly also talked to addicts and attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings with a friend who was in recovery. Critics acclaimed the individual performances for the actors' emotional courage in portraying physical and mental degradation. Connelly said she became interested in the script for its depiction of the addictions and their effects on <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> affections of the characters and their relatives.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Todd Ocvirk, Nanette Napoleon, Justin Vance, Anita Manning {{and others}} {{began the process}} of {{creating}} a historical documentary film about the individual experiences and stories of Hawaii-born soldiers and sailors of the Civil War, including Pitman, Samuel C. Armstrong, Nathaniel Bright Emerson, James Wood Bush, J. R. Kealoha and many other unnamed combatants of both the Union and the Confederacy. In 2014, Maui-based author Wayne Moniz wrote a fictionalized story based on <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> Civil War service of Hawaiian soldiers like Henry Hoʻolulu Pitman in his book Pukoko: A Hawaiian in the American Civil War. In 2015, the sesquicentennial {{of the end of the}} war, the National Park Service released a publication titled Asians and Pacific Islanders and the Civil War about the service of the large number of combatants of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who fought during the war. The history of Hawaiʻi's involvement and the biographies of Pitman, Bush, Kealoha and others were co-written by historians Anita Manning and Justin Vance.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, Simon Bates {{presented}} {{a week of}} programmes from South Australia {{as part of a}} promotion in which the station gave away a holiday to the state. In December 2011, Bates travelled to Afghanistan to present a series of shows with British troops at Camp Bastion, which featured Christmas messages from British soldiers serving there to their friends and relatives. Bates discussed the possible future of Afghanistan as coalition forces prepared to hand over control to the Afghan National Army. On 8 April 2012, Easter Sunday, the forces broadcaster BFBS simulcast a two-hour show presented jointly by Bates and BFBS's Rachel Cochrane, with Smooth, allowing family and friends of serving troops to connect with their loved ones. On 27 May 2012, Bates {{presented a}} special programme ahead of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, previewing Elizabeth II's journey along the River Thames on the royal barge, Spirit of Chartwell. He was given special access to the vessel and spoke to the boat's owner, Philip Morrell and to composer Debbie Wiseman who was commissioned to write the music for the event. To commemorate the 30th anniversary {{of the end of the}} 1982 Falklands War, Bates broadcast the breakfast show from the Falkland Islands for a week; he explored <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>and</b> experiences of Islanders and reflected on the conflict.|$|E
