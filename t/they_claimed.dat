5|$|Hostilities {{over the}} Suwałki Region resumed in summer 1920. When the Polish Army began to retreat {{during the course}} of the Polish–Soviet War, the Lithuanians moved to secure what <b>they</b> <b>claimed</b> to be their new borders, set by the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty of July 1920. The Peace Treaty granted Sejny and {{surrounding}} area to Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|John Jackson, Patrick Martin and Harriet Hughes, {{all members}} of the Countryside Alliance, sought {{judicial}} review of the use of the Parliament Acts to pass the Hunting Act. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> that the 1949 Act had not been lawfully passed either because the 1911 Act could not be used to amend itself or because it provided a method of making delegated or subordinate legislation which could not alter the process of legislating. Consequently, <b>they</b> <b>claimed,</b> the 1949 Act had not reduced the delay specified in the 1911 Act and the Hunting Act, which was passed only in accordance with the requirements as amended by the 1949 Act, was invalid.|$|E

5|$|Đính and {{the leading}} generals in the MRC {{also had a}} secret plan to end the {{communist}} insurgency, which called itself the National Liberation Front (NLF) and claimed to be independent {{of the government of}} North Vietnam. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> that most of them were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Diệm. The generals agreed with this viewpoint and thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible. The government also rebuffed American proposals to bomb North Vietnam on the grounds that such actions would cede the moral high ground, which <b>they</b> <b>claimed</b> on the basis of fighting in a purely defensive manner. However, the plans to bring the NLF into the mainstream were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|During spring {{training}} in 2014, Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson decided that Corbin would start on Opening Day. However, Corbin felt arm tightness during a {{spring training}} start. An MRI revealed {{damage to his}} ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow. He underwent Tommy John surgery, and missed the entire 2014 season. The Diamondbacks placed Corbin on the 15-day disabled list on March 30, and transferred him to the 60-day disabled list on April 4, in order to open a roster spot for Roger Kieschnick, who <b>they</b> <b>claimed</b> off waivers.|$|E
5|$|Following the attack, the German Ministry of Propaganda checked {{incoming}} {{reports from}} both London and the German Naval High command. Having {{been told by}} Kriegsmarine {{that there was not}} a single U-boat in the vicinity of Athenia on the day of her sinking, the Propaganda Ministry promptly denied all allegations that any German U-boat had sunk Athenia. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> instead that the British had torpedoed their own vessel in an attempt to bring the United States into the war on the side of the Allies.|$|E

5|$|In April 1970, a {{team led}} by Albert Ghiorso working at the University of California (Berkeley, California, United States) stepped into the competition. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> to have {{synthesized}} the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with nitrogen-15 ions. Alpha activity with the energy of 9.1MeV was formed; the team attempted reaction with other nuclides—bombardment of 249Cf with 14N, Pb with 15N, Hg with 15N—and stated no such activity was found in those reactions. The characteristics of the daughter nuclei correlated with those of 256103, implying the assignment of the parent to 260105.|$|E
5|$|In July 1941, Blenheims from Bomber Command's No. 2 Group {{joined the}} campaign. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> 104 vessels sunk and 72 damaged. Only 73 vessels totalling 178,000 tons were {{credited}} destroyed and 62 vessels, totalling 96,780 tons damaged. Intelligence in August 1941 saw this drop to 31 destroyed (73,348 tons) and 58 (148,000 tons) damaged. Post-war assessments reveal even this was over stated. Final figures were seven sunk (9,556 tons) and six (13,088) seriously damaged.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu joined other National Liberals {{in expressing}} {{opposition}} to the trade convention Catargiu had signed with Austria-Hungary, which was advantageous to the latter's exports, and which, <b>they</b> <b>claimed,</b> was leading Romanian industry to ruin.

5000|$|Critics of TSSI, {{including}} David Laibman (see Criticism section, below), {{argue that}} Marx intended to present what they characterize as [...] "a structurally consistent" [...] model of value formation in a capitalist economy with competitive profit-rate equalization. <b>They</b> <b>claim</b> that Marx's formulations {{fail to do}} this. But <b>they</b> <b>claim</b> that what <b>they</b> characterize as his fundamental insights can be revealed, and extended, by means of models and concepts that emerged after his time. Instead of trying to defend the consistency of Marx's original statements, non-TSSI Marxist theorists pursue what they characterize as ever-more effective versions of what <b>they</b> <b>claim</b> to be the core theory. <b>They</b> also <b>claim</b> that <b>they</b> believe that Marx himself would have done this.|$|R

Corephotonics said that they approached Apple over a possible partnership, but Apple's lead negotiator apparently declined the idea, with Apple going ahead and launching the iPhone 7 Plus in late 2016, and then the 8 Plus in late 2017.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 2006, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Donald and Robert Hughes {{filed a lawsuit}} against Fox Broadcasting Company and the show's executive producer and creator, Paul Scheuring, for copyright infringement, seeking unspecified damages and other costs. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> that in 2001, they had sent Fox their manuscript which was based on their own experiences of a prison break at a juvenile facility. In the 1960s, Donald Hughes planned and successfully executed a prison escape for his brother, Robert Hughes, who was wrongfully incarcerated.|$|E

5|$|The board {{claimed that}} the Goebel Election Law did not give them the power to hear proof of vote fraud or call witnesses, {{although}} the wording of their decision implied {{that they would have}} invalidated Taylor votes if they had been empowered to do so. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Days later, the Democratic-dominated General Assembly convened in Frankfort. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> the power to decide disputed elections, and formed a partisan commission (ten Democrats and one Republican) to examine the election results.|$|E
5|$|The strike action {{began on}} a local level after postal workers at Royal Mail offices in London and Edinburgh accused their bosses of cutting jobs and services, which <b>they</b> <b>claimed</b> broke the 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement, the {{agreement}} that was struck to end the 2007 strikes, and accused Royal Mail of threatening modernisation of the service. After a series of localised walkouts over the summer months, and after failing to reach an agreement, the CWU opened a national ballot for industrial action in September 2009.|$|E
5|$|According to French {{intelligence}} reports, the Turks sent political {{agents to}} northern Syria {{to persuade the}} inhabitants to drop their armed resistance to the French and embrace French rule, which <b>they</b> <b>claimed</b> would benefit the population. Sometime between April and May, Hananu had Uwaid execute field commander Mustafa Asim Bey for his involvement in an attack against the mostly Christian town of al-Suqaylabiyah, in which many of its inhabitants were killed. Asim Bey was a strongly pro-Ottoman, Arab officer with particularly close connections to the Anatolian insurgency. Hananu believed that the Turks had instructed him {{to carry out the}} raids on al-Suqaylabiyah and other villages to tarnish the image of the rebels among the local inhabitants, as part of Turkey's agreements with France to stifle the revolt in northern Syria. Asim's execution {{may have contributed to the}} rapid withdrawal of the rebels' Turkish military advisers who were upset with the execution.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} of Bloody Sunday in January 1905 sparked a {{revolution}} in Russia, Tsar Nicholas II was forced to make concessions. In April 1905 a decree guaranteed complete freedom of religion, and even allowed religious studies to be conducted in native languages. The most important decree, the October Manifesto, was announced on October 30 (October 17 O.S.), 1905. It guaranteed many political rights, {{including the right to}} form political parties and organize convocations. This decree formed the legal basis for the assembly in Vilnius. The October Manifesto also announced the intent to hold elections to the Russian Parliament (Duma), and the Lithuanian organizers used this as an official pretext for the Seimas: <b>they</b> <b>claimed</b> that the Lithuanians needed to prepare themselves for this election.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{brothers}} received initial {{support from the}} government, the Soviet Union officially protested the airport on 5 November 1958. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> {{it could be used}} as an air force base—and thus would be a violation of the Svalbard Treaty—and pointed out that planning was partially financed with American military funding and that Gunnar was a military officer. From then on the Norwegian government started actively opposing the airport. At first they asked the company to cease operations, then asked the American military to cut funding. They also instructed all government-owned companies to not allow an airport to be built on their ground. The government also used Gunnar's military rank to hinder him, to limited extent, from pursuing the plans. The Aviation Act, which required all airports to have a concession to operate, came into effect from 1961, effectively stopping the plans.|$|E
