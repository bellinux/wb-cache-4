500|$|Following his triumph, Napoleon imposed {{the first}} {{elements}} of the Continental System through the Berlin Decree issued in November 1806. The Continental System, which prohibited European nations from trading with Britain, was widely violated throughout his reign. In the next few months, Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and {{was involved in the}} bloody stalemate at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807. After a period of rest and consolidation on both sides, the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at Heilsberg that proved indecisive. On 14 June, however, Napoleon finally obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland, wiping out the majority of the Russian army in a very bloody struggle. The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French. On 19 June, Czar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon. The latter assured the envoy that the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe. On that basis, the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of Tilsit after meeting on an iconic raft on the River Niemen. <b>The</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated: [...] "I hate the English as much as you do".|$|E

2500|$|At this First Council of Nicaea twenty-two bishops, led by Eusebius of Nicomedia, came as {{supporters}} of Arius. But {{when some of}} Arius's writings were read aloud, they are reported to have been denounced as blasphemous by most participants. Those who upheld the notion that Christ was co-eternal and con-substantial with the Father were led by the priest Alexander. Athanasius {{was not allowed to}} sit in on the Council since he was only an arch-deacon. [...] But Athanasius is seen as doing the legwork and concluded (as Bishop Alexander conveyed in the Athanasian Trinitarian defense and also according to the Nicene Creed adopted at this Council and,) that the Son was of the same essence (homoousios) with the Father (or one in essence with the Father), and was eternally generated from that essence of the Father. Those who instead insisted that the Son of God came after God the Father in time and substance, were led by Arius the presbyter. For about two months, the two sides argued and debated, with each appealing to Scripture to justify their respective positions. Arius argued for the supremacy of God the Father, and maintained that the Son of God was simply the oldest and most beloved Creature of God, made from nothing, because of being the direct offspring. [...] Arius taught that the pre-existent Son was God's First Production (<b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that God actually ever did in His entire eternal existence up to that point), before all ages. [...] Thus he insisted that only God the Father had no beginning, and that the Father alone was infinite and eternal. [...] Arius maintained that the Son had a beginning. And he argued that everything else was created through the Son. [...] Thus, said Arius, only the Son was directly created and begotten of God; furthermore, there was a time that He had no existence. [...] He was capable of His own free will, said Arius, and thus [...] "were He in the truest sense a son, He must have come after the Father, therefore the time obviously was when He was not, and hence He was a finite being." [...] Arius appealed to Scripture, quoting verses such as : [...] "the Father is greater than I". And also : [...] "the firstborn of all creation." [...] Thus, Arius insisted that the Father's Divinity was greater than the Son's, and that the Son was under God the Father, and not co-equal or co-eternal with Him.|$|E

50|$|The {{production}} of organic solvents like acetone, butanol, and isopropanol through fermentation {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> to be produced by using bacteria, since achieving the necessary chirality of the products is easily achieved by using living systems. Solvent fermentation uses a series of Clostridia bacterial species. Solvent fermentation at first was not as productive as it is used today. The amount of bacteria required to yield a product was high, and the actual yield of product was low. Later technological advances were discovered that allowed scientist to genetically alter these strains to achieve a higher yield for these solvents. These Clostridial strains were transformed to have extra gene copies of enzymes necessary for solvent production, {{as well as being}} more tolerant to higher concentrations of the solvent being produced, since these bacteria have a range of product in which they can survive in before the environment becomes toxic. Yielding more strains that can use other subtrates was also another way to increase the productivity of these bacteria.|$|R

Usually the ice was not thick enough to have a fire built on it; and it must have been on ice which was just strong enough to bear that my boy skated all one bitter afternoon at Old River, without a fire to warm by.

30|$|As we {{mentioned}} in the previous sections, most of the traditional data mining algorithms are not designed for parallel computing; therefore, they are not particularly useful for the big data mining. Several recent studies have attempted to modify the traditional data mining algorithms to make them applicable to Hadoop-based platforms. As long as porting the data mining algorithms to Hadoop is inevitable, making the data mining algorithms work on a map-reduce architecture is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> to do to apply traditional data mining methods to big data analytics. Unfortunately, not many studies attempted to make the data mining and soft computing algorithms work on Hadoop because several different backgrounds are needed to develop and design such algorithms. For instance, the researcher {{and his or her}} research group need to have the background in data mining and Hadoop so as to develop and design such algorithms. Another open issue is that most data mining algorithms are designed for centralized computing; that is, they can only work on all the data at the same time. Thus, how to make them work on a parallel computing system is also a difficult work. The good news is that some studies [145] have successfully applied the traditional data mining algorithms to the map-reduce architecture. These results imply {{that it is possible to}} do so. According to our observation, although the traditional mining or soft computing algorithms can be used to help us analyze the data in big data analytics, unfortunately, until now, not many studies are focused on it. As a consequence, it is an important open issue in big data analytics.|$|R
