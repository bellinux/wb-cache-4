The effort to eliminate LF has been highly successful, {{and is now}} in the monitoring phase to ensure continued progress. One of the monitoring methods is molecular xenomonitoring (MX) using PCR to detect W. bancrofti DNA in mosquitoes. Currently MX uses BG Sentinel <b>traps</b> <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> the LF vector Aedes polynesiensis.

The observed increase in foraging distances with decreasing landscape diversity suggests that honey bees compensated for lower landscape diversity by increasing their pollen foraging range in order to maintain pollen amount and diversity.

Gravimetric analysis, frequency of occurrence, and mean percent by number all indicated macroinvertebrates as the primary diet component, with chironomid larvae as the most numerous prey eaten. Graphical analysis of prey-specific abundance also indicated that oriental weatherfish fed on a generalized diet, of which detritus is likely an important part.

One approach {{to the development of}} chemical lures is to manufacture blends that comprise odors released in human emanations.

In this report, we compared the attraction of mosquitoes to various chemicals, blends, and odors from humans. Noncompetitive (single-treatment) bioassays established that some blends are equivalent or more attractive to Aedes aegypti than human odors. Competitive bioassays were conducted; these involved simultaneous comparison of 2 treatments: single compounds to binary blends; binary blends to a trinary blend of L-lactic acid, acetone, and dimethyl disulfide; and the trinary blend to human odors from 3 volunteers. The overall trend was that the trinary blend was more attractive than binary blends, and binary blends were more attractive than single compounds. However, human odors were still significantly more attractive than the trinary blend. Therefore, further modifications and refinements to blends will be needed to better compete against human odors...|$|R

In contrast, cadmium that passed through 92 mm glass fiber filters on a rotary smoking machine was significantly higher, ranging from 3. 5 to 22. 9 % of total smoke cadmium deliveries. Cadmium passed through 44 mm filters typically used on linear smoking machines to an even greater degree, ranging from 13. 6 to 30. 4 % of the total smoke cadmium deliveries. Differences in the cadmium that passed through from the glass fiber filters and electrostatic precipitator could be explained in part if cadmium resides in the smaller mainstream smoke aerosol particle sizes. Differences in particle size distribution could have toxicological implications and could help explain the pulmonary and cardiovascular cadmium uptake in smokers.

Consequently, the correlation between potassium and radiocesium was clear but independently observable in each of the litterfalls and the green leaves. It is possible that the reduction in radiocesium concentration occurred as a part of physiological demand, a translocation of potassium from the leaves to the body/twigs...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{simultaneous}} CNS {{stable isotope}} abundance measurements of solid samples usually require high sample amounts, up to 1 mg carbon, to achieve exact analytical results. This rarely used application is often impaired by high C:S element ratios when organic samples are analyzed and {{problems such as}} incomplete conversion into sulphur dioxide occur during analysis. We introduce, as a technical innovation, a high sensitivity elemental analyzer coupled to a conventional isotope ratio mass spectrometer, with which CNS-stable isotope ratios can be determined simultaneously in samples with low carbon content (< 40 mu g C corresponding to similar to 100 mu g dry weight). The system includes downsized reactors, a temperature program-controlled gas chromatography (GC) column and a cryogenic <b>trap</b> <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> small amounts of sulphur dioxide. This modified application allows for highly sensitive measurements in a fully automated operation with standard deviations better than +/- 0. 47 parts per thousand for delta N- 15 and delta S- 34 and +/- 0. 12 parts per thousand for delta C- 13 (n= 127). Samples collected from one sampling site in a Baltic fjord {{within a short time}} period were measured with the new system to get a first impression of triple stable isotope signatures. The results confirm the potential of using delta S- 34 as a stable isotope tracer in combination with delta N- 15 and delta C- 13 measurements to improve discrimination of food sources in aquatic food webs.

40|$|Background: Urban {{mosquitoes}} in temperate regions {{may represent}} a high nuisance and {{are associated with the}} risk of arbovirus transmission. Common practices to reduce this burden, at least in Italian highly infested urban areas, imply calendar-based larvicide treatments of street catch basins – which represent the main non-removable urban breeding site and/or insecticide ground spraying. The planning of these interventions, as well as the evaluation of their effectiveness, rarely benefit of adequate monitoring of the mosquito abundance and dynamics. We propose the use of adhesive <b>traps</b> <b>to</b> monitor Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens adults and to evaluate the efficacy of insecticide-based control strategies. Methods: We designed two novel types of adhesive <b>traps</b> <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> adult mosquitoes visiting and/or emerging from catch basins. The Mosquito Emerging Trap (MET) was exploited to assess the efficacy of larvicide treatments. The Catch Basin Trap (CBT) was exploited together with the Sticky Trap (ST, commonly used <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> ovipositing/resting females) <b>to</b> monitor adults abundance in the campus of the University of Rome “Sapienza” - where catch basins were treated with Insect Growth Regulators (IGR) bi-monthly and Low-Volume insecticide spraying were carried out before sunset - and in a nearby control area. Results: Results obtained by MET showed that, although all monitored diflubenzuron-treated catch basins were repeatedly visited by Ae. albopictus and Cx. pipiens, adult emergence was inhibited in most basins. Results obtained by ST and CBT showed a significant lower adult abundance in the treated area than in the untreated one after the second adulticide spraying, which was carried out during the major phase of Ae. albopictus population expansion in Rome. Spatial heterogeneities in the effect of the treatments were also revealed. Conclusions: The results support the potential of the three adhesive traps tested in passively monitoring urban mosquito adult abundance and seasonal dynamics and in assessing the efficacy of control measures. ST showed higher specificity for Ae. albopictus and CBT for Cx. pipiens. The results also provide a preliminary indication on the effectiveness of common mosquito control strategies carried out against urban mosquito in European urban areas...|$|R
