5000|$|Effective for {{accounting}} periods beginning on or after 1 April 2015, the Finance Act 2015 imposes a levy on company profitsexcluding those {{of small and}} medium-sized enterprisesthat are routed via [...] "contrived arrangements" [...] to tax havens. The arrangements can concern either those that involve entities or transactions lacking economic substance, or efforts by a non-UK company to avoid a UK <b>taxable</b> <b>presence.</b> Companies that determine that {{they are subject to}} the tax have a statutory duty to notify Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs of that fact within three months {{after the end of the}} accounting period in question.|$|E
5000|$|Formulary apportionment, {{also known}} as unitary taxation, is a method of allocating profit earned (or loss incurred) by a {{corporation}} or corporate group to a particular tax jurisdiction in which the corporation or group has a <b>taxable</b> <b>presence.</b> It is an alternative to separate entity accounting, under which a branch or subsidiary within the jurisdiction is accounted for as a separate entity, requiring prices for transactions with {{other parts of the}} corporation or group to be assigned according to the arm's length standard commonly used in transfer pricing. In contrast, formulary apportionment attributes the corporation's total worldwide profit (or loss) to each jurisdiction, based on factors such as the proportion of sales, assets or payroll in that jurisdiction.|$|E
40|$|In 2008, New York {{passed a}} state {{sales tax on}} out-of-state e-tailers by {{creating}} a rebuttable presumption that the vendor has a <b>taxable</b> physical <b>presence</b> in New York. Amazon. com and Overstock. com challenged the statute as unconstitutional. The New York Supreme Court disagreed and granted summary judgment to the State of New York. This Comment argues that the NY Court’s dismissal was only partially correct. The court was correct in noting that applying the Statute to the plaintiffs {{is consistent with the}} Due Process Clause under current U. S. Supreme Court precedent because the plaintiffs purposefully directed their activities toward New York. However, the NY Court erred in holding that the Statute meets the dormant Commerce Clause’s “substantial nexus” requirement by imputing affiliates’ activities to the plaintiffs. While the activities of an in-state contractor or salesperson are sufficient to create a taxable nexus, traditional advertising is considered insufficient in this regard. Because the affiliates’ activities more closely resemble traditional advertising than the activities of an in-state contractor or salesperson, the Statute is in violation of the Commerce Clause. Because of this violation, the Statute is unconstitutional and should be overturned. Part II of this Comment describes sales and use taxes, particularly their significance as a state revenue source and problems with collecting them. Additionally, Part II discusses the motivations behind taxing e-commerce. Part III explores applicable case law, including several relevant Supreme Court cases that define the parameters of the plaintiffs’ claims and a New York Court of Appeals case. Part IV introduces the statutory language and describes how the Statute has been interpreted by the agency charged with enforcing it—the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (DTF). Part V examines the NY Court’s Amazon and Overstock decisions on both the Due Process Clause and the dormant Commerce Clause challenges. Finally, Part VI briefly discusses the Statute’s side effects, including a reduction in business for the New York affiliates...|$|R
5000|$|The {{final report}} on Action 7 proposes {{substantial}} {{changes to the}} definition of Agency PE and stricter requirements to the exclusions provision:"These changes will ensure that where the activities that an intermediary exercises in a country are intended to result in the regular conclusion of contracts to be performed by a foreign enterprise, that enterprise will be considered to have a <b>taxable</b> <b>presence</b> in that country unless the intermediary is performing these activities in the course of an independent business. The changes will also restrict the application of a number of exceptions {{to the definition of}} permanent establishment to activities that are preparatory or auxiliary nature and will ensure that {{it is not possible to}} take advantage of these exceptions by the fragmentation of a cohesive operating business into several small operations; they will also address situations where the exception applicable to construction sites is circumvented through the splitting-up contracts between closely related enterprises." ...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{principle}} of international tax law that a country may not tax the business profits of a non-resident enterprise unless those profits are attributed to a “permanent establishment” located in the source country. A “permanent establishment” {{is defined as a}} fixed place of business through which the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. The “business establishment” concept is however based on the world where {{there had to be a}} physical presence of the business in order for its profits to be taxed. The requirement of a fixed place of business faces challenges when trade is conducted electronically as e-commerce makes it difficult to identifying a <b>taxable</b> <b>presence</b> in the source country. This article analyses the challenges that e-commerce poses to the “permanent establishment” concept...|$|E
40|$|Hockey’s budget {{announcement}} {{of two major}} tax integrity measures was flagged before the budget was handed down, but even that came as no surprise. Integrity, or lack thereof, in our tax system is a hot topic and {{an easy target for}} a Treasurer looking to sell a federal budget. The first of the proposed changes is to our GST regime. No-one likes hearing that they will be paying more tax. But, the charging of GST on supplies of digital products and services in Australia by an off-shore supplier will at least make sense to the general public. With the inherent unfairness in the current system and a revenue raising prediction of A 350 million over the next four years, most are likely to accept the logic of such a measure. The second of the proposed changes are new laws to be included in Australia’s general anti-avoidance provision. New laws, which will apply from 1 January 2016, are aimed at multinational companies engaged in aggressive tax practices. The proposed anti-avoidance law is designed to stop multinationals that artificially avoid a <b>taxable</b> <b>presence</b> in Australia. It is difficult to see how this strategy of addressing specific behaviour through what is considered a general provision will work. And, it is these changes that are already causing confusion...|$|E
