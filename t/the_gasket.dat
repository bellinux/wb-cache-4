25|$|A gasket used in {{a diamond}} anvil cell {{experiment}} is a thin metal foil, typically 0.3mm in thickness, which is placed in between the diamonds. Desirable materials for gaskets are strong, stiff metals such as rhenium or tungsten. Steel is frequently used as a cheaper alternative for low pressure experiments. The above-mentioned materials cannot be used in radial geometries where the x-ray beam must pass through <b>the</b> <b>gasket.</b> They are not transparent to x-rays, and thus if x-ray illumination through <b>the</b> <b>gasket</b> is required then lighter materials, such as beryllium, boron nitride, boron or diamond are used as a gasket. Gaskets are preindented by the diamonds and a hole is drilled {{in the center of}} the indentation to create the sample chamber.|$|E

2500|$|Because of its {{chemical}} inertness, PTFE {{cannot be}} cross-linked like an elastomer. Therefore, {{it has no}} [...] "memory" [...] and is subject to creep. Because of its superior chemical and thermal properties, PTFE is often used as a gasket material within industries that require resistance to aggressive chemicals such as pharmaceuticals or chemical processing. However, because of the propensity to creep, the long-term performance of such seals is worse than for elastomers which exhibit zero, or near-zero, levels of creep. In critical applications, Belleville washers are often used to apply continuous force to PTFE gaskets, ensuring a minimal loss of performance over the lifetime of <b>the</b> <b>gasket.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Another type of heat {{exchanger}} is the plate {{heat exchanger}}. These exchangers {{are composed of}} many thin, slightly separated plates that have very large surface areas and small fluid flow passages for heat transfer. [...] Advances in gasket and brazing technology have made the plate-type heat exchanger increasingly practical. In HVAC applications, large heat exchangers of this type are called plate-and-frame; when used in open loops, these heat exchangers are normally of <b>the</b> <b>gasket</b> type to allow periodic disassembly, cleaning, and inspection. There are many types of permanently bonded plate heat exchangers, such as dip-brazed, vacuum-brazed, and welded plate varieties, and they are often specified for closed-loop applications such as refrigeration.
