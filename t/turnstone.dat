The beach has gained a European Blue Flag Award for its cleanliness and safety. The village has three other smaller beaches, which are surrounded by chalk cliffs and cliff stacks. Wildlife that {{can be observed in}} the Thames Estuary includes seals, velvet swimming crabs and the migrant <b>turnstone.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{visitors}} to the island are the bar-tailed godwit (Limosa lapponica baueri), grey-tailed tattler (Tringa brevipes), ruddy <b>turnstone</b> (Arenaria interpres interpres), red-necked stint (Calidris ruficollis) and curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea). Other observed visitors include the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo novaehollandiae), nankeen kestrel (Falco cenchroides cenchroides), banded lapwing (Vanellus tricolor), greater sand plover (Charadrius leschenaultii), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus variegatus), greenshank (Tringa nebularia), sanderling (Calidris alba), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys leucophrys) and brown songlark (Cincloramphus cruralis).|$|E
25|$|Migrant birds include {{small numbers}} of the ruddy <b>turnstone,</b> {{wandering}} tattler, bristle-thighed curlew, lesser golden plover, and Pacific reef heron.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{wintering}} sites, ruddy <b>turnstones</b> are particularly faithful to specific locations. A {{study published in}} 2009 examined <b>turnstones</b> wintering along a stretch of coastline in the Firth of Clyde. It found that 95% of birds resident to the area {{at the end of}} winter returned the following autumn. The same study also confirmed ruddy <b>turnstones</b> as one of the longest lived wader species, with annual adult mortality rates of under 15%. Their average lifespan is 9 years with 19 years and 2 months being the longest recorded.|$|R
50|$|They {{have also}} been {{observed}} preying on the eggs of other bird species such as gulls, terns, ducks, and even other <b>turnstones,</b> though this behaviour is uncommon. In the majority of observed cases, <b>turnstones</b> typically go after undefended or unattended nests, puncturing the shells with their beaks {{to get at the}} contents within.|$|R

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that <b>turnstones</b> vary between these feeding behaviours based on individual preference, sex, and even social status with respect to other <b>turnstones.</b> In one studied population, dominant individuals tended to engage in routing while preventing subordinates from doing the same. When these dominant individuals were temporarily removed, some of the subordinates started to rout, while others enacted no change in foraging strategy.|$|R
25|$|Kiritimati's lagoon and the saltflats are a prime {{location}} for migratory birds to stop over or even stay all winter. The most commonly seen migrants are ruddy <b>turnstone</b> (Arenaria interpres), Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva), bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis) and wandering tattler (Tringa incana); other seabirds, waders and even dabbling ducks can be encountered {{every now and}} then.|$|E
25|$|Several {{varieties}} of shorebirds {{and other species}} inhabit the island and nearby waters, some considered endangered. The ruddy <b>turnstone,</b> bar-tailed godwit, sanderling and Pacific golden plover are considered species of least concern. The bristle-thighed curlew is considered vulnerable on the national conservation priority scheme. Green turtles and hawksbill turtles, both critically endangered, can be found along the reef.|$|E
25|$|The furry-legged rock {{ptarmigan}} {{is a widespread}} bird in this region. Typical birds of prey include the gyrfalcon and snowy owl. Some of the more widespread shore and seabirds are the thick-billed murre, black-legged kittiwake, ruddy <b>turnstone,</b> red knot, black guillemot, widespread ringed plover, little ringed plover and northern fulmar. Songbirds found in the Arctic Cordillera include the hoary redpoll, common redpoll, snow bunting, and Lapland longspur.

5000|$|Ruddy <b>turnstones</b> {{engage in}} a variety of {{behaviours}} to locate and capture prey. These behaviours can be placed into six general categories: ...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether shorebirds breeding in the High Arctic have relatively {{high rates of}} energy expenditure due to the harsh climatic conditions that prevail even in summer, we measured daily energy expenditure (DEE) and water turnover of Ruddy <b>Turnstones</b> (Arenaria interpres) during the incubation phase on Rowley Island in Foxe Basin, N. W. T., Canada, at 69 °N, using the doubly-labeled-water technique. Simultaneously, we conducted detailed measurements of ambient climatic conditions, including in situ measurements with heated taxidermic mounts. A series of 11 doubly-labeled-water measurements with eight individual Ruddy <b>Turnstones,</b> of which at least seven successfully hatched eggs, yielded a mean DEE of 4. 08 W. This is a relatively high value for a 108 -g bird, equalling four times their basal metabolic rate (BMR). Most variation in DEE was attributable to standard operative temperature, which combines the effects of air temperature, wind and radiation on heat loss from the <b>turnstone's</b> point of view. On average, 25 % of DEE was attributable to BMR, 31 % {{to the cost of}} thermoregulation, and 44 % to the cost of activity. The average value for water turnover of 96. 6 g/day is high compared to published values for other birds and confirms the large requirement for food (which is water-rich) of incubating Ruddy <b>Turnstones.</b> An analysis of the climatic conditions prevalent in Foxe Basin during the breeding seasons of Ruddy <b>Turnstones,</b> based on the 33 -year period 1958 - 1990, indicated that they faced thermostatic hardships, defined as energy expenditure exceeding the maximum sustained working level (estimated at 4. 5 times BMR), on 15 % of the days. Climatic conditions were most severe in the early 1960 s, but have improved since. ...|$|R
25|$|The atoll {{supports}} {{a large population}} of sea and shorebirds, with up to 26 species present. Species breeding during 1988 included the brown booby, red-footed booby, great frigatebird, red-tailed tropicbird, sooty tern, white tern, brown noddy, and possibly the reef heron. Migratory birds present included the bristle-thighed curlew, <b>turnstone,</b> wandering tattler, golden plover, and the sanderling. The densest bird populations are on three islets {{to the north of}} Sibylla: North (Kita), Kamwome and an unnamed islet. Bokak is the only known breeding ground of Christmas shearwater and possibly Bulwer's petrel.|$|E
25|$|As of 2006, the {{following}} birds {{have been observed}} - Richard's pipit, wedge tailed eagle, white-faced heron, eastern reef egret, ruddy <b>turnstone,</b> masked woodswallow, galah, red-necked stint, Cape Barren geese, Horsfield's rufous tailed, Australian raven, white-fronted chat, crimson chat, rockhopper penguin, Australian kestrel, white bellied sea eagle, welcome swallow, silver gull, Pacific gull, singing honeyeater, budgerigah, rock parrot, golden whistler, osprey, house sparrow, red-capped robin, red-tailed tropicbird, great cormorant, white-browed scrubwren, crested tern, common starling, hooded dotterel, barn owl, masked plover, silver eye and breeding colonies of fairy tern, little penguin and sooty oystercatcher.|$|E
25|$|Many coastal {{birds are}} {{frequently}} found in Rottnest. These include the pied cormorant, osprey, pied oystercatcher, silver gull, crested tern, fairy tern, bridled tern, rock parrot and the reef heron. The island salt lakes contain brine shrimp which support birds {{such as the}} red-necked avocet, banded stilt, ruddy <b>turnstone,</b> curlew sandpiper, red-capped dotterel, Australian shelduck, red-necked stint, grey plover, white-fronted chat, Caspian tern and the crested tern. Several pairs of osprey nest at Rottnest each year; one nest at Salmon Point {{is estimated to be}} 70 years old. Introduced peafowl are often seen near the main settlement.|$|E
30|$|Observations at East Bay 1999 – 2007 {{suggest that}} ruddy <b>turnstones</b> nest early {{relative}} to the other three species, and white-rumped sandpipers nest late and {{over a longer period}} (Smith et al. 2010). The elevated (albeit, non-significant) levels of mercury in the eggs of white-rumped sandpipers relative to ruddy <b>turnstones,</b> and the great variability in concentrations for white-rumped sandpipers are consistent with an effect of amount time spent foraging on the breeding grounds. In the future, testing for an effect of nest initiation date on egg mercury concentration (with a larger sample size) could provide some insight into how pre-breeding activities (e.g., foraging) affect mercury dynamics.|$|R
50|$|Phalaropes {{are close}} {{relatives}} of the shanks and tattlers, the Actitis and Terek sandpipers, and also of the <b>turnstones</b> and calidrids. They are especially notable for two things: their unusual nesting behavior, and their unique feeding technique.|$|R
5000|$|The surfbird (Calidris virgata) {{is a small}} stocky wader in {{the family}} Scolopacidae. It was once {{considered}} to be allied to the <b>turnstones,</b> {{and placed in the}} monotypic genus Aphriza, but is now placed in the genus Calidris.|$|R
25|$|Yala {{is one of}} the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 {{bird species}} of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed {{bee-eater}} and brown-capped babbler. The number of waterbirds inhabiting wetlands of Yala is 90 and half of them are migrants. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck, garganey), cormorants (little cormorant, Indian cormorant), large waterbirds (grey heron, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, Asian openbill, painted stork), medium-sized waders Tringa spp., and small waders Charadrius spp. are among the most common waterbirds. Black-necked stork and lesser adjutant are many of the rare birds that {{can be seen in the}} park. The migrant great white pelican and resident spot-billed pelican are also have been recorded. Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, godwits, and ruddy <b>turnstone.</b> The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew. Rock pigeon, barred buttonquail, Indian peafowl, black stork, black-winged stilt, and greater flamingo are among the other bird species.

The forest birds are orange-breasted green pigeon, hornbills, Old World flycatchers, Indian paradise flycatcher, Asian barbets, and orioles.|$|E
500|$|The {{bookseller}} Isabelline Books {{argues that}} [...] "Yarrell’s History [...] probably contains the richest collection of colour descriptions in any bird {{book in the}} English language", with [...] "various parts of the Bee-Eater described as verditer blue, saffron-yellow, chestnut, duck-green, verdigris-green, buff, greyish-brown and fawn colour. The Roller as berlin-blue, brownish-yellow, coppery-purple and light cinnamon. The Spotted Eagle as chocolate-brown, pale wood-brown and reddish liver-brown. The Golden Oriole had lead-colour toes, other parts oil-green, brocoli-brown and wine-yellow. The Cuneate-Tailed Gull was smoke-brown and pearl-grey, the <b>Turnstone</b> had ferruginus portions, the Little Auk was livid-brown and sooty-brown, while the American Bittern was leaden-brown. The variations in these terms seems to be inexhaustable. They can now be considered a , somewhat romantic or just pure pedantry on the author’s part. But it was a serious attempt to try to define quite subtle colourings." ...|$|E

40|$|Studies of {{interference}} competition among foraging animals generally assume that {{variation in the}} spatial distribution of food can be neglected. This assumption may be problematic as resource defence experiments suggest that such variation {{is of the essence}} in some interference mechanisms. Interpretation of the results of field experiments on this topic, however, is hard because most studies used univariate statistics to analyse multivariate data. Because in free-living foragers interference and patch selection are connected behaviours, treatment effects on these responses are best studied simultaneously, through multivariate analyses. We performed a field experiment in which we provided wild ruddy <b>turnstones,</b> Arenaria interpres, with experimental plots that varied in the distance between a fixed number of so-called food pits, and, using multivariate statistics, we studied effects on the combination of the turnstones' behaviour and abundance. We found that when food pits were more spaced out, <b>turnstones</b> were present in higher numbers, while interacting less with each other. Nevertheless, <b>turnstones</b> spent about {{the same amount of time}} digging for food, our measure of intake rate, at each interpit distance. These findings imply that to reliably predict the combination of the number, intake rate and aggression of <b>turnstones,</b> the spatial distribution of food has to be known. We would not have reached this conclusion if we had used univariate statistics. In addition, we argue that multivariate statistics helps to clarify the way field experiments on the spatial distribution of food are to be interpreted.
