Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to <b>the</b> <b>exciting</b> laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Noted for his sound defence, he was {{a patient}} and dogged batsman, in {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> <b>exciting</b> styles of brothers Merv, Ray and Neil. According to Neil, Mick had a weakness against spin bowling. Harvey was a rare bowler during his first-class career. He bowled only five overs in total, delivering one over in five different matches. He never took a wicket. Altogether, he made 1,716 first-class runs (mostly as an opener) in 37 matches {{at an average of}} 27.23. Harvey was also a regular choice for the Queensland baseball team during his career. His daughter Pauline Harvey-Short represented Australia at softball, before becoming a sports administrator. She is a fellow of the Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation, and was a founding member of Womensport Queensland in 1993, serving as the chair of the board from 2007 until 2010. Her daughter Kirby Short plays cricket for the Queensland women's team.|$|E

40|$|Electron donor-acceptor {{hybrid systems}} have {{received}} {{great interest in}} photovoltaic applications, 1 - 5 in which photo-induced electrons of photosensitizers convert to electrical energy via electron transfer to electron acceptors.

Consequently, the photosensitizer with a slow rate of recombination, which means a long lifetime for <b>the</b> <b>excited</b> electrons, could be a good candidate for achieving high electron transfer efficiency in donor-acceptor hybrids.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate how}} population can be trapped in <b>the</b> <b>excited</b> doublet in presence of vacuum-induced coherence (VIC). We employ delayed pulses to transfer population from a metastable state to <b>the</b> <b>excited</b> states. Subsequently, spontaneous emission from <b>the</b> <b>excited</b> doublet builds coherence between them. This coherence can be probed by using chirping, {{which leads to}} the decoupling of <b>the</b> <b>excited</b> doublet from <b>the</b> ground state thereby ensuring population transfer via delayed pulses. Our results indicate that the existence of VIC leads to the generation of a mixed state in <b>the</b> <b>excited</b> state manifold, where trapping of the population occurs even in the presence of large decay. This trapping may be realized in molecular systems and can be understood as a sensitive probe of VIC. We present suitable numerical analysis to support our results...|$|R

50|$|Consider an {{electron}} bound to an atom in an <b>excited</b> state. As <b>the</b> electron undergoes {{a transition from}} <b>the</b> <b>excited</b> state to a lower energy state it will emit a photon with a frequency corresponding to the difference in energy between <b>the</b> <b>excited</b> state and <b>the</b> lower energy state. The reverse process will also occur: if the electron is in the lower energy state then it can undergo a transition to <b>the</b> <b>excited</b> state by absorbing a photon at the resonant frequency for this transition. In practice the photon frequency {{is not required to}} be at exactly the resonant frequency, but must be in a narrow range of frequencies centred on the resonant frequency: a photon with a frequency outside this region cannot <b>excite</b> <b>the</b> electron to <b>the</b> <b>excited</b> state.|$|R
