5|$|The Revolutionary War was {{ended by}} the Treaty of Paris in 1783, and by 1785 the Continental Navy was disbanded and the {{remaining}} ships were sold. The frigate , which had fired the last shots of the American Revolutionary War, was also the last ship in the Navy. A faction within Congress {{wanted to keep the}} ship, but the new nation did not have the funds to keep her in service. Other than a general lack of money, factors for the disarmament of the navy were the loose confederation of the states, a change of goals from war <b>to</b> <b>peace,</b> <b>and</b> more domestic and fewer foreign interests.|$|E
5|$|Little factual {{information}} survives about Vespasian's government during {{the ten years}} he was Emperor. Vespasian spent his first year as a ruler in Egypt, during which {{the administration of the}} empire was given to Mucianus, aided by Vespasian's son Domitian. Modern historians believe that Vespasian remained there in order to consolidate support from the Egyptians. In mid-70, Vespasian first came to Rome and immediately embarked on a widespread propaganda campaign to consolidate his power and promote the new dynasty. His reign is best known for financial reforms following the demise of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, such as the institution of the tax on urinals, and the numerous military campaigns fought during the 70s. The most significant of these was the First Jewish-Roman War, which ended in the destruction of the city of Jerusalem by Titus. In addition, Vespasian faced several uprisings in Egypt, Gaul and Germania, and reportedly survived several conspiracies against him. Vespasian helped rebuild Rome after the civil war, adding a temple <b>to</b> <b>peace</b> <b>and</b> beginning construction of the Flavian Amphitheatre, better known as the Colosseum. Vespasian died of natural causes on June 23, 79, and was immediately succeeded by his eldest son Titus. The ancient historians that lived through the period such as Tacitus, Suetonius, Josephus and Pliny the Elder speak well of Vespasian while condemning the emperors that came before him.|$|E

25|$|In 1938, {{when the}} entire nation was {{preparing}} for war, Strauss created Friedenstag (Peace Day), a one-act opera set in a besieged fortress during the Thirty Years' War.

With its contrasts between freedom and enslavement, war and peace, light and dark, this work has a close affinity with Beethoven's Fidelio. Productions of the opera ceased shortly after the outbreak of war in 1939.|$|E
