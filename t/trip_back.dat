The win made Stevens, at age 33, the youngest coach to lead a team to the Final Four since Bob Knight made his first Final Four appearance at age 32 in 1973. Butler became the smallest school (enrollment 4,200) to make the Final Four since seeding began in 1979.|$|E
5|$|After US President Richard Nixon {{made his}} famous 1972 visit to China, {{a wave of}} exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a {{delegation}} of the American Institute of Architects in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first <b>trip</b> <b>back</b> to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, {{and a series of}} lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Booth's {{body was}} {{shrouded}} {{in a blanket}} and tied {{to the side of}} an old farm wagon for the <b>trip</b> <b>back</b> to Belle Plain. There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for identification and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him. Among the identifying features used {{to make sure that the}} man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.|$|E

A tall man at , he was awarded the Royal Humane Society of Australasia's Bronze Medal for saving the life of a youth caught in the rip while surfing at Victor Harbor, South Australia in 1927. He had three children: Samuel Gerald Wood (Sam) Burston became a grazier; Robin Archibald (Bob) Burston became a physician like his father; and Helen Elizabeth (Betty), who married Chris Sangster, an Adelaide physician on 12 January 1939. Both sons and son in law would serve in the Army during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest to the type of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the <b>trip</b> <b>back</b> to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.|$|E
5|$|Practical {{implementations}} of road {{congestion pricing}} are found {{almost exclusively in}} urban areas, because traffic congestion is common in and around city centers. Autoroute A1 in Northern France {{is one of the}} few cases of congestion pricing implemented outside of urban areas. This is an expressway connecting Paris to Lille, and since 1992 congestion prices have been applied during weekends with the objective of spreading demand on the <b>trip</b> <b>back</b> to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings. As congestion pricing has been increasing worldwide, the schemes implemented have been classified into four different types: cordon area around a city center; area wide congestion pricing; city center toll ring; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing.|$|E

They were married in June 1955 and Fulham {{teammate}} Tom Wilson was Robson's best man. After 1991, Robson was repeatedly diagnosed as suffering from cancer. He had several operations and, in 2006, was operated on for a brain tumour. This, on occasion, affected his work; while at Porto, for example, Robson suffered from malignant melanoma, which resulted in his missing {{the first few months}} of the 1995–96 season.|$|E
5|$|Some {{events and}} their timing are unclear during this early period. Sources {{disagree}} {{on whether he}} brought his family to California from Illinois in 1852 or 1854. Carranco dates Seth's first return to Illinois starting in 1850, with his return to California in August 1852, his arrival in Humboldt County in February 1853, another return to Illinois in September 1853, and a <b>trip</b> <b>back</b> to California starting in May 1854 with his mother, two children, and a herd of cattle. Thus, {{in the course of}} the six years 1849-1854, he is believed to have crossed the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains five times, travelling mostly on foot.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} {{is filled}} with ironwork, consisting of its stairs, elevator columns and associated tie beams, none of which supports {{the weight of the}} stonework. It was redesigned in 1958 to reduce congestion and improve the flow of visitors. Originally, visitors entered and exited {{the west side of the}} elevator on the observation floor, causing congestion. So the large landing at the 490-foot level was expanded to a full floor and the original spiral stair in the northeast corner between the 490- and 500-foot levels was replaced by two spiral stairs in the northeast and southeast corners. Now visitors exit the elevator on the observation floor, then walk down either spiral stair before reboarding the elevator for their <b>trip</b> <b>back</b> down.|$|E

5|$|With the {{republic}} suffering heavy losses after the war, Stalin allowed an open immigration policy in Armenia; the diaspora {{were invited to}} repatriate to Armenia (nergaght) and revitalize the country's population and bolster its workforce. Armenians living {{in countries such as}} Cyprus, France, Greece, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria were primarily the survivors or the descendants of the genocide. They were offered the option of having their expenses paid by the Soviet government for their <b>trip</b> <b>back</b> to their homeland. An estimated 150,000Armenians immigrated to Soviet Armenia between 1946 and 1948 and settled in Yerevan, Leninakan, Kirovakan and other towns.|$|E
5|$|After working up, Pioneer sailed for Australia on 30 March 1945. She {{arrived in}} Sydney on 13 May and was {{transferred}} to Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, on 21 June to prepare for operations off Japan. She was still there when Japan surrendered on 15 August and had repaired 24 aircraft since her arrival. Pioneer arrived in Hong Kong in late September {{to help with the}} rebuilding of the colony's infrastructure. Her sailors restored power, telephone service and repaired trains and buses. She made one <b>trip</b> <b>back</b> to Manus, but was back in Hong Kong in late November. The ship sailed for Sydney the following month and departed for the UK on 17 February 1946. Upon her arrival, she was placed in reserve. Pioneer was sold to Thos W Ward for scrap in September 1954 and broken up in Inverkeithing.|$|E
5|$|In February 1909, Beebe and Blair {{traveled}} to British Guiana, {{in the hope}} that with Roosevelt's support, {{it might be possible to}} establish a permanent field research station there. Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a hoatzin, a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important link in the evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of hoatzin behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were new to the zoo, although several of these died or escaped during the long <b>trip</b> <b>back</b> to New York. Beebe summarized this expedition in his book Our Search for a Wilderness, which was enthusiastically well reviewed.|$|E

5|$|Integritys first voyage was in February 1804, {{heading south}} along the eastern {{coastline}} of Australia to transport settlers and supplies across Bass Strait to the colonial outpost in Van Diemen's Land. The administrator of that outpost, Lieutenant John Bowen, had recently resigned his position and returned to Port Jackson. Governor King now directed that Bowen travel back to Van Diemen's Land aboard Integrity in order to formalise the transfer of colonial authority to his successor. However Bowen refused to go aboard, and the cutter ultimately sailed without him in order to deliver its supplies. The voyage was a success other than a broken rudder fastener which was repaired when Integrity reached Van Diemen's Land in early March. The cutter then completed the round <b>trip</b> <b>back</b> to Port Jackson, arriving safely at her home port on 24 April.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Kalacoon research station enabled Beebe to research {{the ecology of the}} surrounding jungle in far more detail than had been possible during his earlier expeditions. Using Kalacoon as his base of operations, Beebe performed a novel type of study: methodically dissecting a small area of jungle, and all of the animals which inhabit it, {{from the top of the}} canopy to below the ground. In a second study, Beebe performed the same task for a much larger area of jungle, approximately a quarter mile (0.4km) square. During his first season at Kalacoon in 1916, Beebe brought back 300 living specimens for the zoo. This time he succeeded at capturing a hoatzin, the bird that he had narrowly missed during his earlier trip to Guiana, although he was unable to keep it alive for the zoo during the <b>trip</b> <b>back</b> to New York.|$|E
5|$|Bohr did {{not enjoy}} {{teaching}} medical students. He {{decided to return to}} Manchester, where Rutherford had offered him a job as a reader in place of Darwin, whose tenure had expired. Bohr accepted. He took a leave of absence from the University of Copenhagen, which he started by taking a holiday in Tyrol with his brother Harald and aunt Hanna Adler. There, he visited the University of Göttingen and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he met Sommerfeld and conducted seminars on the trilogy. The First World War broke out while they were in Tyrol, greatly complicating the <b>trip</b> <b>back</b> to Denmark and Bohr's subsequent voyage with Margrethe to England, where he arrived in October 1914. They stayed until July 1916, by which time he had been appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, a position created especially for him. His docentship was abolished at the same time, so he still had to teach physics to medical students. New professors were formally introduced to King Christian X, who expressed his delight at meeting such a famous football player.|$|E
