5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{is indicated}} {{in a variety}} of situations when illness or a medical procedure prevents a person from maintaining a clear airway, breathing, and oxygenating <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> <b>In</b> these circumstances, oxygen supplementation using a simple face mask is inadequate.|$|E
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> {{the deep}} {{part of the}} brain drains, through a venous plexus into the {{cavernous}} sinus at the front, and the superior and inferior petrosal sinuses at the sides, and the inferior sagittal sinus at the back. Blood drains from the outer brain into the large superior saggital sinus, which rests in the midline on top of the brain. Blood from here joins with blood from the straight sinus at the confluence of sinuses.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering <b>the</b> <b>blood.</b> <b>In</b> orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E

5|$|Archosaurs (crocodilians and birds) {{and mammals}} show {{complete}} {{separation of the}} heart into two pumps {{for a total of}} four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. In crocodilians, there is a small opening, the foramen of Panizza, {{at the base of the}} arterial trunks and there is some degree of mixing between <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> each side of the heart, during a dive underwater; thus, only in birds and mammals are the two streams of blood – those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations – permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in two steps. Firstly, a filtered form of plasma moves from fenestrated capillaries in the choroid plexus into an interstitial space, with movement guided by a difference in pressure between <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> the capillaries and the interstitial fluid. This fluid then needs {{to pass through the}} epithelium cells lining the choroid plexus into the ventricles, an active process requiring the transport of sodium, potassium and chloride that draws water into the CSF by creating osmotic pressure. Unlike blood passing from the capillaries into the choroid plexus, the epithelial cells lining the choroid plexus contain tight junctions between cells, which act to prevent most substances flowing freely into the CSF.|$|E
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> {{a single}} loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart {{consists of four}} parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E

5|$|Most spiders convert {{nitrogenous}} {{waste products}} into uric acid, {{which can be}} excreted as a dry material. Malphigian tubules ("little tubes") extract these wastes from <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> the hemocoel and dump them into the cloacal chamber, from which they are expelled through the anus. Production of uric acid and its removal via Malphigian tubules are a water-conserving feature that has evolved independently in several arthropod lineages that can live far away from water, for example the tubules of insects and arachnids develop from completely {{different parts of the}} embryo. However, a few primitive spiders, the sub-order Mesothelae and infra-order Mygalomorphae, retain the ancestral arthropod nephridia ("little kidneys"), which use large amounts of water to excrete nitrogenous waste products as ammonia.|$|E
5|$|Penis pumps induce erections {{without the}} need for drugs or {{invasive}} treatments. To use a pump, the man inserts his penis into a cylinder, then pumps it to create a vacuum which draws blood into the penis, making it erect. He then slides a ring from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of the penis to hold <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> and maintain the erection. A man who is able to get an erection but has trouble maintaining it for long enough can use a ring by itself. The ring cannot be left on for more than 30 minutes and cannot be used {{at the same time as}} anticoagulant medications.|$|E
5|$|When {{a key to}} {{a room at the}} Marina View Hotel is {{delivered}} inside a jar of blood to the Homicide Department, Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) and Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) visit the hotel, where they find a room completely covered in blood. Dexter is sent in first to investigate, but seeing the blood-covered room brings back a repressed memory from his childhood— Dexter at the age of three years sitting in a pool of blood—and he collapses and runs from the room. The forensics team surmises that <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> the hotel room came from at least five different bodies, although none were in the room. Since there were only one set of footprints in the room, they assume that the victims were killed elsewhere and their blood spread around the room by the killer. Debra suggests that the Ice Truck Killer, who had five bloodless victims, may have been responsible.|$|E

5|$|Inside {{their hotel}} room, Spears {{and her boyfriend}} start {{screaming}} at each other. When he tries to make amends and get close to her, she brushes off his attempts and walks away. Her boyfriend gets mad and then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling something at the mirror. She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white shirt {{in front of a}} bright white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah is seen in her wrist. She touches her head and looks at her hand, realizing she is bleeding from the wound. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> her hand is stigmata. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors in a hospital bed. The ghost of Spears in a white shirt, watches herself in the bed and walks into the next room, where a baby girl is born. Spears is then seen running away from the camera into the light. The music video ends with her rising from under the water, resting her head and smiling, suggesting the whole scene of her death was a dream or a morbid fantasy.|$|E
5|$|Professor Ellis (Rudolf Martin), a {{lecturer}} {{of the dead}} woman, gives a eulogy at her funeral. Chloe, {{a friend of the}} dead woman, attacks Ellis and slashes his neck, whose blood Mick recognizes as <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> the vial. Beth tracks down Chloe, who explains that the professor has a vampire-worshipping blood cult, and he believes that he is a vampire. Later, Mick finds Chloe's dead body, who was murdered by Ellis. Knowing that Beth has gone to Ellis's class, he rushes to save her. After the class, Beth talks to Ellis about vampires and the young woman's murder, but he discovers that she is wearing a wire. Ellis attacks Beth and although she escapes, she is kidnapped by the professor's teaching assistant. Mick tracks down the assistant, defeats him, and takes an unconscious Beth to his apartment. In flashbacks to 22years in the past, Mick investigates the case of a missing girl. In a domestic fight between Mick and his ex-wife Coraline over the kidnapped girl, Mick stabs Coraline's heart with the leg of a broken chair. He lights the house on fire and rescues the girl, leaving Coraline to the fire. It is revealed that the little girl has grown up to be Beth, and that Mick has tried to watch over her and keep her safe over the years. In the present, Beth wakes up and remembers that Mick was stabbed by the assistant, and that {{he was the one who}} saved her as a child. Mick dismisses the claims as being caused by her head injury. Thanking him for saving her, she hugs him.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E
