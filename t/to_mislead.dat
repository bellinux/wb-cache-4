5|$|After ReaLemon {{met with}} success in European markets, Borden {{introduced}} {{it into the}} United Kingdom in 1975, as a 250 ml bottle of lemon juice. By 1980, ReaLemon comprised around 25% of the U.K. lemon juice market. In response to this competition, Reckitt & Coleman, the producers of Jif lemon juice began producing Jif in 150 ml- and 250 ml-sized bottles. Borden then began making plans to market ReaLemon in a lemon-shaped package that was similar to Jif's packaging. This resulted in a lawsuit initiated by Reckitt & Coleman against Borden, alleging that ReaLemon copied Jif's packaging <b>to</b> <b>mislead</b> consumers by confusing their product with Jif.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} {{proposed that}} small boats, towing large radar reflecting balloons (code named Filbert) and carrying both Moonshine jamming and standard wireless equipment (for transmitting fake traffic), would advance toward the French coast {{under a cloud}} of Window. The chaff and other countermeasures would hide {{the small size of}} the naval force while wireless traffic would play on the FUSAG story <b>to</b> <b>mislead</b> the Germans into expecting a major landing. A third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use radar countermeasures on the western flank of the true invasion fleet. This operation was intended to lend confusion as to the extent of the landings in Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{conflicting}} {{conclusions of the}} first two, a third post-mortem was conducted on 22 April by Kenneth Shorrock {{on behalf of the}} Metropolitan police, and Ben Swift on behalf of Simon Harwood. Shorrock and Swift agreed with the results of the second autopsy. The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, told the pathologists before the final post-mortem that Tomlinson had fallen to {{the ground in front of}} a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence that this had happened.

5|$|Courts {{and state}} legislatures also opined on the {{inappropriate}} uses of state seals and arms. Most states barred their use {{for any kind}} of advertising.

He also diverted Texas troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear {{that they did not have}} an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.|$|E

The Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death, Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, had told the pathologists that Tomlinson had fallen to {{the ground in front of}} a police van earlier in the evening, although there was no evidence to support this.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, when David Stirling was {{pitching}} his idea for a dedicated airborne commando unit (which later evolved into the Special Air Service) he obtained Clarke's support partly by promising to use the SAS name. From late 1942, Clarke used the 1st SAS in his major order of battle deception (codenamed Operation Cascade). The brigade formed part of the fictional 4th Airborne Division; between then {{and the end of}} the war it was used <b>to</b> <b>mislead</b> Axis commanders about the strength of Allied forces in North Africa, and as part of several specific tactical deceptions.|$|E

She states the meld is safe when performed by those trained in the art, and that Pa'nar Syndrome is merely the by-product of an improperly conducted meld. The trio are then attacked by Major Talok and Vulcan commandos, and T'Pol is captured while the others escape.

5|$|Operation Copperhead {{was a small}} {{military}} deception operation run by the British {{during the}} Second World War. It formed part of Operation Bodyguard, the cover plan for the invasion of Normandy in 1944, and was intended <b>to</b> <b>mislead</b> German intelligence as {{to the location of}} General Bernard Montgomery. The operation was conceived by Dudley Clarke in early 1944 after he watched the film Five Graves to Cairo. Following the war M. E. Clifton James wrote a book about the operation, I Was Monty's Double. It was later adapted into a film, with James in the lead role.|$|E
5|$|Planning for the {{operation}} began in 1943. In {{the months leading up}} to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, <b>to</b> <b>mislead</b> the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. The weather on D-Day was far from ideal, but postponing would have meant a delay of at least two weeks, as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days in each month were deemed suitable. Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion.|$|E

Finally, training reduced susceptibility in both groups, although it also reduced discrimination in the young adults (Experiment 3).

5|$|The carrot is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are {{a good source of}} vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II <b>to</b> <b>mislead</b> the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Then-Bruins {{head coach}} Don Cherry {{suggested}} that the reason Orr never re-signed with the Bruins was Orr's complete trust in Eagleson at the time (Orr said that he described Eagleson as a brother). Cherry recalled Orr had refused {{to speak with the}} Bruins team president directly, allowing Eagleson <b>to</b> <b>mislead</b> or withhold enough details from Boston's offer. Orr's departure from the Bruins was acrimonious and he has not held an official role with the Bruins since. Years later, it emerged that Eagleson had very good relations with Black Hawks owner Bill Wirtz and NHL president John Ziegler that colluded to hold back salaries of certain players. Orr disassociated himself from Eagleson in 1980.|$|E
30|$|Eyewitness memory {{researchers}} {{have long been}} concerned with factors that influence accurate memory for an originally witnessed event. Towards this end, {{there has been a}} substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding the misinformation effect.

After some retention interval participants are exposed <b>to</b> <b>misleading</b> post-event information in the form of a narrative or suggestive questions. Following misinformation presentation, memory for the original event is assessed. The typical finding is that exposure <b>to</b> <b>misleading</b> post-event information results in reduced access to original event details and increased reporting of misleading post-event details (Frenda, Nichols, & Loftus 2011).|$|R
