500|$|Although Churchill's, {{described}} by Lewington as [...] "the worst club {{that has ever}} been in Reading", tolerated such behaviour, the town's fashionable Sindlesham Mill nightclub did not, regularly barring Friday for his bizarre activities, including a dance he invented called [...] "the elephant" [...] which consisted of turning <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jeans inside out and undoing his flies to expose himself. He and his friends would regularly drink all day, though {{he was able to}} exert some self-control; according to his friend Syd Simmonds, Friday would obey Hurley's instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game. However, he would play his prized heavy metal records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take LSD with casual indifference. Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club's elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail: [...] "Even if it was three in the morning, the first thing would be to get the music playing", Simmonds later said. [...] "We had an old boy living below us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog's life in the flat. Pounding music, people knocking on the door, girls throwing stones at the windows. Poor old sod." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{years of}} heavy {{drinking}} (including consumption of absinthe), Satie died on 1 July 1925 from cirrhosis of the liver. He {{is buried in}} the cemetery in Arcueil. There is a tiny stone monument designating a grassy area {{in front of an}} apartment building – 'Parc Erik Satie'. Over the course of his 27 years in residence at Arcueil, where Satie lived in stark simplicity, no one had ever visited his room. After his death, Satie's friends discovered an apartment replete with squalor and chaos. Among many other unsorted papers and miscellaneous items, it contained a large number of umbrellas, and two grand pianos placed {{one on top of the}} other, the upper instrument used as storage for letters and parcels. They discovered compositions that were either thought to have been lost or totally unknown. The score to Jack in the Box was thought, by Satie, to have been left on a bus years before. These were found behind the piano, in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> velvet suits, and in other odd places, and included Vexations; Geneviève de Brabant and other unpublished or unfinished stage works; The Dreamy Fish; many Schola Cantorum exercises; a previously unseen set of [...] "canine" [...] piano pieces; and several other works for piano, many untitled. Some of these would be published later as additional , , , and furniture music.|$|E
60|$|Lord Ashleigh smiled. His {{hand had}} {{disappeared}} into <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dinner-coat.|$|R
60|$|Then he felt in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{jacket and}} brought out a sixpenny-piece.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel {{rose again}} to his feet, and began fumbling in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat.|$|R
60|$|He stopped short, {{and thrust}} {{his hands into}} <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> checked trousers.|$|E
60|$|But Ciccio vouchsafed no answer, {{and walked}} {{with his hands}} in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> water-proof, wincing from the weather.|$|E
60|$|He eyed me {{with one}} of his blackest looks, and thrust his hands savagely into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> riding-coat.|$|E
60|$|From <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat he {{drew the}} letter which Blakeney had written an hour ago.|$|R
50|$|Smallwood was a superstitious player, {{who would}} always carry a lucky rabbit's foot in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shorts on match days.|$|R
60|$|Huxter arose {{with great}} {{perturbation}} at this news, and plunged <b>his</b> stick into <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> paletot, and seized his hat.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} sat forward hurriedly, felt rapidly in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat, and then {{jumped to his}} feet.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood with}} his hands in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> great-coat, and a most amused smile upon his square-jawed, clean-shaven face.|$|E
60|$|Stumpy Nuggs carried matches, {{and quickly}} lit {{a bit of}} candle which he {{produced}} from one of <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ragged attire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't shoot!" [...] she cried, as Mr. Peters absent-mindedly dipped <b>his</b> {{hand into}} <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat. [...] "Oh, please don't shoot!" ...|$|R
60|$|Again Richard {{began to}} search, {{and this time}} {{produced}} from <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat a long and thick strip of sun-dried meat.|$|R
60|$|De Batz {{thought it}} well {{at this point}} to finger once more nonchalantly the bundle of crisp paper in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat.|$|R
60|$|As Pep concluded, he {{suddenly}} dived {{into one of}} <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new trousers, and, after considerable difficulty, extricated a silver dollar.|$|E
60|$|The Demon did not reply. He was busily {{forcing the}} various {{electrical}} devices that Rob had relinquished into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fiery jacket.|$|E
60|$|Button-Bright sat on {{the bench}} beside her and thrust his hands in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> knickerbockers. Then he {{reflected}} somewhat gravely for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{think that}} d'Aguilar is this man?" [...] asked Peter, while Castell folded up {{the letter and}} hid it in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> robe.|$|R
60|$|He {{produced}} {{a copy of}} the paper from <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> great-coat which hung from the door, and passed it to his bounding brother.|$|R
60|$|He paused, {{and from}} <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shabby {{trousers}} he half drew out a long, sheathed hunting-knife, {{and then quickly}} hid it again from her sight.|$|R
60|$|He stopped short; {{his hands}} clenched and thrust deeply downwards, {{seemed ready to}} burst <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket. A slight sigh escaped Captain Whalley.|$|E
60|$|Jorgenson, {{with his}} hands deep in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tunic, listened, looking down. Jaffir showed as much consternation as his nature was capable of.|$|E
60|$|Bluenose {{drained the}} pot, flung a half-crown on the table, and swaggered {{out of the}} house with his hands deep in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rough pea-jacket.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Gracedieu's {{object was}} to consult me--" [...] Before I {{could say the}} next words, I saw him put <b>his</b> hand into <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dressing-gown.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, {{several of}} them. Here they are," [...] and placing <b>his</b> hand in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket, <b>the</b> youth brought forth {{over a dozen}} epistles.|$|R
60|$|The poetical one drew a sack <b>of</b> tobacco from <b>his</b> hip {{pocket and}} a rumpled package <b>of</b> papers from <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shirt, {{extending}} both toward Billy.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy did {{not stop}} to consider. He knew that every dollar the {{schooner}} brought now would go into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father, {{and that was enough}} for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll go {{back and}} be damned to it!" [...] said the captain recklessly, {{plunging}} his hands into <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pea jacket and plumping back into his chair.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{had already}} {{felt that there}} was some money in <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> trousers, and he now handed his letter to the old woman and pulled out some gold.|$|E
6000|$|Chauvelin {{gave him}} no direct reply. He was busy {{collecting}} his precious papers together and thrusting {{them back into}} <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat. Then he said quietly: ...|$|R
60|$|Julius ensconced himself comfortably by {{the side}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> victim. He kept <b>his</b> hand in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat, but his manner was urbane to the last degree.|$|R
60|$|So Inga gave Rinkitink the Pink Pearl and {{the little}} King placed it in <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> red-and-green brocaded velvet vest, pinning <b>the</b> flap <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> down tightly.|$|R
