Such systems could find applications in industrial and environmental monitoring(4), threat detection(5), medical diagnostics(6) and free-space communication(7). Nevertheless, the advancement of chip-scale systems is impeded by the narrow-bandgap semiconductors traditionally used to detect mid-infrared photons.

Furthermore, such detectors typically have larger detectivity and bandwidth than their mid-infrared counterparts(8). Here, we use efficient four-wave mixing in silicon nanophotonic wires(9 - 12) to facilitate spectral translation of a signal at 2, 440 nm to the telecom band at 1, 620 nm, across a span of 62 THz.

However, some factors limit {{the development of the}} electric vehicle, especially performance, cost, lifetime and safety of the battery. Therefore, the management of batteries is necessary in order to reach the maximum performance when operating at various conditions. The battery thermal management system (BTMS) plays a vital role in the control of the battery thermal behaviour. The BTMS technologies are: air cooling system, liquid cooling system, direct refrigerant cooling system, phase change material (PCM) cooling system, and <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>cooling</b> system as well as heating. These systems are analysed through a trade-off between performance, weight, size, cost, reliability, safety and energy consumption. According to the analysis two prime battery thermal management systems are recommended: combined liquid system (CLS) and a variant system with PCM. The models of CLS and PCM system were built and simulated using software MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results predict the battery temperature variation and the energy consumption of BTMS. Through simulating the PCM system model, the effect of PCM on battery temperature variation was investigated and the proper PCM mass was estimated. Seen from the simulation results, BTMS is of great importance to control battery thermal behaviour.

40|$|Expanding {{far beyond}} {{traditional}} applications in optical interconnects at telecommunications wavelengths, the silicon nanophotonic integrated circuit platform has recently proven its merits {{for working with}} mid-infrared (mid-IR) optical signals in the 2 - 8 μm range. Mid-IR integrated optical systems are capable of addressing applications including industrial process and environmental monitoring, threat detection, medical diagnostics, and free-space communication. Rapid progress {{has led to the}} demonstration of various silicon components designed for the on-chip processing of mid-IR signals, including waveguides, vertical grating couplers, microcavities, and electrooptic modulators. Even so, a notable obstacle to the continued advancement of chip-scale systems is imposed by the narrow-bandgap semiconductors, such as InSb and HgCdTe, traditionally used to convert mid-IR photons to electrical currents. The cryogenic or multi-stage <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>cooling</b> required to suppress dark current noise, exponentially dependent upon the ratio Eg/kT, can limit the development of small, low-power, and low-cost integrated optical systems for the mid-IR. However, if the mid-IR optical signal could be spectrally translated to shorter wavelengths, for example within the near-infrared telecom band, photodetectors using wider bandgap semiconductors such as InGaAs or Ge could be used to eliminate prohibitive cooling requirements. Moreover, telecom band detectors typically perform with higher detectivity and faster response times when compared with their mid-IR counterparts.

This has been the basis for the thematic interpretation of the MOS data. The three different and independent in-orbit calibration methods: lamp calibration, sun calibration and ground target based (vicarious) calibration as well as different possibilities of dark signal determination and the extensive knowledge of instrument performance data and instrument characteristics from the lab measurements have enabled us to overcome all failures and difficulties of the instrument which occurred in orbit. The failure of the lamp and sun calibration equipment in September 2000 has been overcome by using the vicarious calibration and dark signal measurements at the earth night side at new moon. The failure of the <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>cooling</b> of the detectors in November 2002 could be overcome only by the knowledge of the temperature dependence of the spectral responsivity of the different spectral channels and its dark signals.

40|$|Combined {{thermionic}} emission and tunneling of hot electrons (thermo-tunneling) {{has emerged as}} a potential new solid state cooling technology. Practical implementation of thermotunneling, however, requires the formation of a nanometer-sized gap spanning macroscopically significant surfaces. Thermotunneling is a term used to describe combined emission of hot electrons ({{thermionic emission}}) and tunneling of electrons through a narrow potential barrier between two surfaces (field emission). Thermo-tunneling of hot electrons across a few nanometer gap has application to vacuum electronics, at panel displays, and holds great potential in <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>cooling</b> and energy generation. Development of new thermo-tunneling applications requires creation of a stable nanometer gap between two surfaces. Formation of such a small scale gap is very challenging. Due to the various type of the forces that come to the picture in the scale of nanometer gap creates a complex interaction between the engaged surfaces. In this project different setups of a test device is suggested to form a nanometer-sized gap appropriate for tunneling current generation. Having a mathematical model describing the physical characteristics of such a system is inevitable in order to examine the stability of the system's dynamics. The first set of externally applied forces selected to stabilize the system is composed of electrostatic force that attracts two surfaces opposed by an electro-magnetic force. The electro-magnetic force is produced by applying an external magnetic field to in the proximity of the thin flexible electrode which carries electrical current due to the electron tunneling. The orientation of the external magnetic field is set to generate a force in the opposite direction of the electrostatic force. The second setup of the experimental model is composed of electrostatic force opposed by the thermoelastic force. The thermoelastic force is generated due to the thermal expansion/contraction of the flexible beam. The configuration of the designed device determines the direction of which the thermoelastic force is applied.

These are supported by the passive instruments BroadBand Radiometer (BBR) and the Multispectral Imager (MSI) providing the radiometric and spatial context of the ground scene being probed. The MSI will form Earth images at 500 m ground sample distance over a swath width of 150 km; it will image the Earth atmosphere in 7 spectral bands. The MSI instrument will be formed in two parts: the Visible, Near infrared and Short wave infrared (VNS) unit, and the Thermal InfraRed (TIR) unit. In the VNS optical unit, the ground scene is imaged onto four linear detectors via four separate optical channels. Driving requirements for the VNS instrument performance are radiometric accuracy, signal-to-noise ratio, optical image quality and coregistration. Driving requirements for the VNS instrument performance are the spectral sensitivity, the image quality, co-registration and the inter-channel radiometric accuracy. Derived thermal design requirements: • The Short Wave Infrared- 2 (SWIR- 2) detector needs to be cooled to a narrow temperature band around 230 K {{in order to meet}} the sensitivity requirements. • Thermal stabilization of optical housing and the detectors is required to meet het radiometric accuracy requirements. • Reduction of spatial and temporal temperature gradients in the optical unit is required to prevent distortions leading to reduced image quality and loss of co-registration between the channels.

40|$|To {{unravel the}} {{complexity}} of cellular systems, protein prefractionation tools {{can be used to}} reduce cell lysate complexity and increase assay sensitivity. Rapid free flow isoelectric focusing (FF-IEF) is achieved in a microfluidic device by isolating the electrodes from the focusing region with porous buffer regions. Moving the electrodes enables the use of large electric fields without the detrimental effects of bubble formation in the focusing region of the device. The anode and cathode porous buffer regions, which are formed by acrylamide functionalized with immobilized pH groups, allow ion transport while providing buffering capacity. <b>Thermo-electric</b> <b>cooling</b> mitigates the effects of Joule heating on sample focusing at high field strengths (- 500 V/cm). This localized cooling was observed to increase device performance. Rapid focusing of low molecular weight isoelectric point markers proteins and protein complexes demonstrate the versatility of the technique. Simulations provide insight into and predict device performance based on a well-defined sample composition. This thesis also presents the first implementation of cascaded stages for a microfabricated free-flow isoelectric focusing device. Both analytical and computational models for IEF suggest device performance will be improved by utilizing multiple stages to reduce device residence time. These predictions are shown to be valid by using focusing of small IEF markers as a demonstration. We also show focusing of fluorescently tagged proteins under different channel geometries, with the most efficient focusing occurring in the cascaded design, as predicted by theory. An additional aim of this work is to demonstrate the compatibility of cascaded FF-IEF with common bioanalytical tools. As an example, outlet fractions from cascaded FF-IEF were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Processing of whole cell lysate followed by immunoblotting for cell signaling markers demonstrates the reduction of albumin from samples, as well as the enrichment of apoptotic markers. Commercial FF-IEF equipment requires multiple inlets to approximate the linear pH gradient commonly used in IEF. These inlets require many premixed pH buffers and a dedicated pumping system, increasing system cost and complexity. (cont.) As an alternative approach, a preparative scale FF-IEF microfluidic device is also designed and tested. The advantages of the divergent IEF design versus a rectangular design are demonstrated using pH indicators to visualize the formation of pH gradients within the devices. Theoretical and experimental observations indicate that using a divergent channel circumvents many of the difficulties associated with preparative FF-IEF equipment. Protein pI markers are used to demonstrate the devices ability to fractionate samples, even in the presence of salt levels too high for conventional IEF techniques. The devices process complex biological samples, fractionating whole cell lysate at a rate of 2 mL/hr. The device performance is further analyzed by 2 -D gels of the fractionated outlets to show that cell lysate can be enriched based on pI. These findings underscore the promise of small, inexpensive, and disposable FF-IEF devices in proteomics and systems biology research. by Jacob William Albrecht. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, TEC thermal performance has been evaluated using a heat pump test.

In the C-SAM experiments, images were taken at the interfaces between the housing and TEC, as well as at the interfaces between the chip-on-carrier (CoC) and TEC. Findings – The heat pump test results indicate a strong correlation with the C-SAM test results. The C-SAM observations show good solder joint at the interface between the TEC and housing in the case of the device that yielded a good heat pump test result (11. 5 °C) and poor solder joints (gross de-lamination) at the interface between the TEC and housing in the case of the device that yielded a poor heat pump test result (24. 4 °C). The C-SAM observations did not show much difference at the interface between the CoC and TEC.

A Si APD is shown to offer increased sensitivity by measuring a lower temperature than a Si photodiode in order to satisfy specific threshold voltages. The Si APD is also shown to offer improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and temperature error. By combining the Si APD with a phase sensitive detection (PSD) method, further improvement is achieved. The MWIR InAs/GaSb type-II superlattice (T 2 SL) offers the potential development of minimally cooled MWIR arrays for radiation thermometry, as well as longer wavelength multi-colour detectors for ratio radiation thermometry. An uncooled T 2 SL detector on a GaSb substrate is demonstrated for measurement of a target temperature of 25 oC with SNR > 1. Cooling improves the detector’s performance, allowing operation at the <b>thermo-electric</b> <b>cooler</b> compatible temperature of 200 K. Further characterisation of a T 2 SL detector on a GaAs substrate demonstrates similar temperature dependence, suggesting challenges to the material growth for improved detector performance. Other potential challenges with T 2 SL development are identified and discussed. The quantum dot infrared photodetector (QDIP) also offers the potential for longer wavelength multi-colour detection. Combination with an infrared algorithmic spectrometer (IRAS) offers flexibility for development of a versatile ratio radiation thermometer. The QDIP-IRAS combination is demonstrated to successfully reproduce arbitrary filter shapes from blackbody photocurrent measurements. Ratios computed using the IRAS correspond well with ratios computed from the arbitrary target filters. ...|$|R
