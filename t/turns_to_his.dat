Mrs Horner, the gunner's wife, engages in {{an affair with}} Hollom, and becomes pregnant. Maturin will {{not interfere with the}} pregnancy, so she <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> assistant, Higgins, who leaves her near death. Maturin saves her life.

500|$|As {{the poem}} begins, Ulysses has {{returned}} to his kingdom, Ithaca, having made a long journey home after fighting in the Trojan War. Confronted again by domestic life, Ulysses expresses his lack of contentment, including his indifference toward the [...] "savage race" [...] (line 4) whom he governs. Ulysses contrasts his present restlessness with his heroic past, and contemplates his old age and eventual death—"Life piled on life / Were all too little, and of one to me / Little remains" [...] (24–26)—and longs for further experience and knowledge. His son Telemachus will inherit the throne that Ulysses finds burdensome. While Ulysses thinks that Telemachus {{will be a good}} king—"Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere / Of common duties" [...] (39)—he seems to have lost any connection to his son—"He works his work, I mine" [...] (43)—and the conventional methods of governing—"by slow prudence" [...] and [...] "through soft degrees" [...] (36, 37). In the final section, Ulysses <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> fellow mariners and calls on them to join him on another quest, making no guarantees as to their fate but attempting to conjure their heroic past: ...|$|E

Janet decides to remain as Wasp and be Hank’s partner as she has fallen in love with him, though Hank initially rejects her feelings due to the similarities between her and his first wife that had been murdered.|$|E

2500|$|Einstein {{considers}} a box (called Einstein's box; see figure) containing electromagnetic radiation and a clock which controls {{the opening of}} a shutter which covers a hole made in one of the walls of the box. The shutter uncovers the hole for a time [...] which can be chosen arbitrarily. During the opening, we are to suppose that a photon, from among those inside the box, escapes through the hole. In this way a wave of limited spatial extension has been created, following the explanation given above. In order to challenge the indeterminacy relation between time and energy, it is necessary {{to find a way to}} determine with adequate precision the energy that the photon has brought with it. At this point, Einstein <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> celebrated relation between mass and energy of special relativity: [...] From this it follows that knowledge of the mass of an object provides a precise indication about its energy. The argument is therefore very simple: if one weighs the box before and after the opening of the shutter and if a certain amount of energy has escaped from the box, the box will be lighter. The variation in mass multiplied by ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the season}} 8 finale, [...] "The Commitment Determination", Sheldon and Amy {{get into a}} fight over their {{definition}} of [...] "commitment". [...] Sheldon feels his relationship with Amy is going fast on its own, but Amy argues he is taking things too slowly and does not properly bestow on her unlimited affection. By the episode's end she has {{decided to take a}} break from their relationship while Sheldon is left numb from Amy's revelation. [...] He glumly <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> Gollum figurine and asks it, [...] "Well, Gollum, you're an expert on rings, what do I do with this one?", while simultaneously taking his grandmother's ring, a family heirloom, out of this desk drawer. In the season 9 premiere, Sheldon keeps pushing Amy to make up her mind about their relationship, but goes too far and insults her to her face and she angrily breaks up with him for good, thus officially ending their relationship. In [...] "The Earworm Reverberation", Sheldon can't get a song out his head but after suddenly remembering the title and the lyrics, he realizes that Amy changed his life for the better and then goes to her apartment to profess his love, at which time Amy reciprocates. [...] Amy's date that night was Dave, who has great adoration for Sheldon because of his intellect; after seeing how much they love each other, Dave urges Sheldon to kiss Amy. [...] In the following episode, [...] "The Opening Night Excitation" [...] Leonard, Wolowitz and Raj go to see [...] without Sheldon as he has somewhat reluctantly opted to celebrate Amy's birthday with her instead. [...] As Amy made Sheldon's birthday party enjoyable and memorable, Sheldon seeks out Penny and Bernadette as he respects their opinions regarding all things socially appropriate. [...] He tells them that he has narrowed things down to 3 options, the first being a chance to play the harp with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the second being an all-expense paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival (though Amy would have to go alone because Sheldon's ornithophobia is nothing compares to his Ovinophobia, the fear of sheep), and the third being the two of them engaging in coitus, at which point Penny squeezes and shatters the wine glass in her hand due to disbelief and/or shock. In the tenth season, Sheldon and Amy move in together for a five-week experiment to test out their compatibility. Afterwards, they decide to move in together permanently. In the final episode of the season, Sheldon unexpectedly proposes to Amy after being hit on by Ramona Nowitzki; the eleventh season premiere was basically a continuation of this, and Amy accepts his proposal.|$|E
2500|$|Vincent Gray {{played by}} Dan Futterman: He is Amy's gifted younger brother, {{with whom she}} has always been closest. Vincent is the winner of a Pushcart Prize during college, but then went on a {{backpack}} tour of Europe because he was overwhelmed with the expectations for success. He later writes a novel titled A Fortunate Son, about a Rabbi and his son. He sells the rights to this book to a movie company, who he says are going to turn the Rabbi and other characters into Walkens. He's torn about giving up his characters and <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sister Amy, who advises him to [...] "take the money and run", given that he is about to move to San Francisco with his new wife. He later gets a deal for a collection of short stories, but is unable to meet the deadline after the emotional stress of his divorce and he had to give back the considerable advance ($15,000) that he was paid. At the beginning of the series, he is roommates with a man with whom he owns a dog-washing business. When his roommate gets married, he becomes roommates with Donna, with whom he later becomes best friends. As he attempts to continue his writing career, he holds a number of jobs: dogwasher, reporter, and freelancer. He eventually marries his girlfriend, Carole Tobey (Sara Mornell), who has breast cancer, and leaves with her for San Francisco. The impending move causes Amy to become angry with Vincent, but when Amy finds out about Carole's breast cancer, she makes amends with him, gives him legal advice on his movie deal – even giving him the family's good luck talisman [...] "the Surfing Monkey" [...] at the airport. He comes home briefly when his mother calls and asks him to come help Maxine and Amy patch things up – as a fight has resulted in Amy moving out with extreme tension existing between mother and daughter. Because of Vincent's visit, Amy buys the family home, Maxine becomes a renter, and the family is put back together. Sometime later, his cousin Kyle arranges for him to arrive as a surprise to Amy's wedding to Stuart Collins. The wedding never happens. He returns home permanently soon after, explaining that Carole has left him for her oncologist. He later explains that this was because he couldn't [...] "be there" [...] for her in the way that she needed him to be while her doctor could. Stuck after his book deal is canceled and he is in debt to the publishing company, he starts driving for the Department of Social Services, then gets a job at a teen center. When a teen is shot in front of him, his boss goes on a bender and realizes she's [...] "addicted" [...] to Vincent and gets him a job teaching writing at a Maximum Security Detention Center. Vincent seems to attract bad luck – he gets shot while helping a woman being mugged in a grocery store parking lot, then later gets blown up and loses his ability to walk and read.|$|E
