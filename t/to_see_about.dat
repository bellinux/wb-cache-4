5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>about</b> producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E
25|$|Barney McKinney Giles {{was born}} on a farm near Mineola, Texas in 1892 to Richard Portlock Giles and Louisa (Read) Giles. He and his {{identical}} twin, Benjamin Franklin Giles, both attended East Texas Normal College and taught school for three years. Both twins studied law at the University of Texas at Austin until World War I began in Europe. Benjamin Giles went to Canada <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>about</b> joining the Royal Flying Corps, and then America became directly involved, allowing both brothers to join the United States Army Air Service, Benjamin as an officer candidate becoming second lieutenant in April 1917 and Barney as a flying cadet in August 1917. Giles attained the rank of second lieutenant in April 1918 and flew with the 168th Aero Squadron in France for a year. Giles resigned his commission in September 1919, Benjamin in October.|$|E
25|$|Two {{locomotives}} were {{inherited from}} the predecessor companies: Moel Tryfan and Russell. When these proved insufficient, Baldwin 590 was acquired by H.F. Stephens and several Festiniog Railway locomotives saw regular use on the Welsh Highland Railway throughout its entire pre-closure existence from 1923 to 1937. 590 was planned {{to be part of}} a larger fleet to replace Moel Tryfan and Russell but it gained so little popularity that Stephens never bought another. By 1936 Moel Tryfan was out of use at Boston Lodge. When Russell and 590 were withdrawn the following year, they were placed in Dinas shed, but when the Second World War broke out, the Ministry of War came <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>about</b> appropriating them for the war effort. After some examination of the engines and questioning of those who had worked them, Russell (regarded as a good engine) was removed for further use, and 590 (seen as an unreliable, rough rider with difficult controls and inadequate adhesion) was broken up at Dinas. Despite the unpopularity of 590, the WHHR (Porthmadog) is currently refurbishing a similar Baldwin to act as a replica.|$|E

The crew put the ship's engines at half speed {{to try to}} drop out of the convoy. Lieutenant Spencer, the chief engineer, and his assistant, Lieutenant (j.g.) Hillery, headed to the machinery spaces <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>about</b> effecting repairs. At 02:30, men on the bridge sighted the red light from the oncoming , which had been steaming behind and to the port of West Gate.

500|$|The University of Oklahoma {{recruited}} Hager as a two-sport {{athlete in}} football and wrestling. He was the second-string defensive tackle behind eventual National Football League players Tommie Harris and Dusty Dvoracek. He stopped playing football and concentrated fully on wrestling his sophomore year. During his junior year, {{he was introduced}} to Jim Ross, who was World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)'s Head of Talent Relations at the time, through former OU defensive tackle Dusty Dvoracek, Hager’s close friend and college roommate. Ross encouraged Hager to contact him after graduating <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>about</b> a career in professional wrestling. [...] At the 2005 NCAA Division I championships, he lost to University of Pennsylvania's Matt Feast in the second round, and did not place. As a senior in 2006, Hager had a seventh-place finish in the NCAA championships and also defeated the future national champion, Dustin Fox from Northwestern University. Hager was named an All-American at season's end while setting the Oklahoma record for most pins in a single season with 30.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the first}} of the Australian shows, Minister for Fair Trading for New South Wales Virginia Judge, said she was aware that Spears would lipsync during the concerts and was {{considering}} to include disclaimers on promotional materials and tickets, indicating that portions of the show would be pre-recorded. This measures would mean a change in the country's legislation similar to the debacle of the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. Judge further explained her position saying, [...] "Let's be clear– live means live. If you are spending up to $200 I think you deserve better than a film clip". Tour director Steve Dixon defended Spears, claiming, [...] "This is a pop spectacular, this is a showband show. You come for the experience. There is a lot <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>about</b> this show, there's nothing like this in the world. Britney Spears will entertain you, that's what people come for. We absolutely give them a show". After opening night in Perth, The Advertiser writer Rebekah Devlin reported that a number of fans had walked out of the show. They were apparently [...] "disappointed" [...] and [...] "outraged" [...] regarding Spears's lip syncing and subdued dancing. Australian tour promoter Paul Dainty talked about the situation saying, ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{reported}} on January 31, 2008, that Redick asked his agent, Arn Tellem, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>about</b> a possible trade. [...] "We {{want to see}} what's out there," [...] Redick told the Orlando Sentinel, [...] "I want to stay here, but it's been frustrating." [...] Magic coach Stan Van Gundy responded: [...] "Right now {{it would be very}} hard to fit him in. I know it's also hard to keep sitting him on the bench... Should we be playing him? Right now we're going good so we probably won't disrupt things." [...] The Orlando Magic confirmed Van Gundy's comments by stating that Redick would not receive more minutes or a trade before the Feb 21 trade deadline. In the last game of the season, with the playoff seed locked up, Redick received more time than he had all season and led the Magic with 18 points, {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Studio Brussel, Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker accused Knowles of using concepts from two of her pieces, Rosas danst Rosas (1983) and Achterlund (1990). De Keersmaeker commented, [...] "It's a bit rude, [...] What’s rude about it its that they don’t even bother about hiding it", further adding that [...] "this is pure plagiarism". Rosas spokeswoman Johanne De Bie added about the clip: [...] "We noticed {{more than a few}} resemblances... We have passed the details to our lawyer <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>about</b> our rights." [...] The director of the music video, Adria Petty, in {{an interview}} with MTV, stated that along with Knowles, had viewed some German modern dance clips as they were exploring cultural reference points, although she never mentioned De Keersmaeker specifically. She concluded that [...] "very little of Keersmaeker's actual choreography inspired the finished result." [...] An alternative video for [...] "Countdown" [...] premiered on November 28, 2011 and it excluded the dance moves from Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker's video.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} return to Austin, John Lomax's son, John Jr., was born, on June 14, 1907. Galvanized by Kittredge's advice and support, Lomax had begun {{collecting}} cowboy songs and ballads,although he paid generous tribute to John A. Lomax's greatness as a collector, as a first-generation professional academic folklorist, Wilgus could be harshly critical. In particular, although he acknowledged the accuracy of Lomax's transcriptions and notations of sources, he objected to his having published composite versions of the songs in his books intended for the public. but his work was interrupted on February 7, 1908, when [...] "The Great A Strike" [...] broke out. The strike, caused by student dissatisfaction with the administration, continued even after February 14, 1908, when the University, in a conciliatory gesture, fired some of its administrators. Unable to teach because of the strike, Lomax decided <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>about</b> resuming his collecting of cowboy ballads {{with a view to}} publishing them in a book. Encouraged by Wendell, he applied for and was awarded a Sheldon Fellowship grant. In June 1908, Lomax became a full professor at A That August the strike ended when the President of the University resigned.|$|E
