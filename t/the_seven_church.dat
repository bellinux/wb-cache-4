500|$|In 1960, Branham preached {{a series}} of sermons on <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> <b>church</b> ages based on {{chapters}} two {{and three of the}} Book of Revelation. The sermons depended heavily on C. I. Scofield's dispensationalism and the publications of Clarence Larkin. Branham described each church as representing a historical age and suggested that the angel of each age was an earthly messenger. His most important [...] "revelation" [...] was the description of the messenger to the Laodicean Church age, which would immediately precede the rapture; the characteristics of this age were all similar to the age Branham was living in at that time.|$|E
60|$|The lake of Ratzeburg {{runs from}} south to north, about nine miles in length, and varying in breadth from three miles {{to half a}} mile. About {{a mile from the}} southernmost point it is divided into two, of course very unequal, parts by an island, which, being {{connected}} by a bridge and a narrow slip of land with the one shore, and by another bridge of immense length with the other shore, forms a complete isthmus. On this island the town of Ratzeburg is built. The pastor's house or vicarage, together with the Amtmann's Amtsschreiber's, and the church, stands near the summit of a hill, which slopes down to the slip of land and the little bridge, from which, through a superb military gate, you step into the island-town of Ratzeburg. This again is itself a little hill, by ascending and descending which, you arrive at the long bridge, and so to the other shore. The water to the south of the town is called the Little Lake, which however almost engrosses the beauties of the whole the shores being just often enough green and bare to give the proper effect to the magnificent groves which occupy the greater part of their circumference. From the turnings, windings, and indentations of the shore, the views vary almost every ten steps, and the whole has a sort of majestic beauty, a feminine grandeur. At the north of the Great Lake, and peeping over it, I see <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> <b>church</b> towers of Luebec, at the distance of twelve or thirteen miles, yet as distinctly as if they were not three. The only defect in the view is, that Ratzeburg is built entirely of red bricks, and all the houses roofed with red tiles. To the eye, therefore, it presents a clump of brick-dust red. Yet this evening, Oct. 10th, twenty minutes past five, I saw the town perfectly beautiful, and the whole softened down into complete keeping, if I may borrow a term from the painters. The sky over Ratzeburg and all the east was a pure evening blue, while over the west it was covered with light sandy clouds. Hence a deep red light spread over the whole prospect, in undisturbed harmony with the red town, the brown-red woods, and the yellow-red reeds on the skirts of the lake. Two or three boats, with single persons paddling them, floated {{up and down in the}} rich light, which not only was itself in harmony with all, but brought all into harmony.|$|E

50|$|The last of <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> <b>church</b> {{buildings}} to be erected in Lydbrook was the Independent mission chapel on Forge Hill, built in 1889. The Reverend Arthur William Latham, Baptist minister at Lydbrook 1883-1900 {{appears on the}} Deeds as a Trustee and is also mentioned throughout the account rendered by the solicitor to the Trustees. The Baptist involvement was probably due to a dispute between {{the founders of the}} mission as to whether there should be a Trust Deed or not. Mr Latham, Baptist minister for Lydbrook was called in to advise on the Trust Deed. The mission seems to have been, and remained a joint venture between Non-conformists. It certainly always remained an independent venture. Once full to capacity, over the length of years the congregation declined to such a point where only occasional services were held, and the building eventually fell into disuse. Previously to this decline services were held most Sunday afternoons, with an average attendance of 8. A ladies meeting was held on Thursday evenings. The chapel closed in 1980. When the last remaining Trustee of the mission died (Alderman Stan Hatton), the Charity Commission approached the vicar of Lydbrook (the Reverend Stuart Parker) who organised four new trustees (one from each of the four Lydbrook Churches) to consider the charities future.|$|E
40|$|Church {{forests are}} sanctuaries for {{different}} organisms, ranging from microbes to large animals, which have almost disappeared {{in most parts}} of northern Ethiopia. Despite the actual and potential significance of these forests, studies and documented information on their bio-physical features and socio-economic setting are either scanty or totally lacking. A study was, therefore, carried out in seven of these church forests, namely Hiruy, Zahara, Gibtsawit, Gelawdiwos, Dengolt, Debresena and Ascha with the objective of assessing the composition, densities and spatial heterogeneity of soil seed banks. The number of viable seeds in the soil samples, from both germination and sieving, corresponded to a seed bank density down to 9 cm in the soil of 7594 seeds m(- 2) at Ascha, 2064 seeds m(- 2) at Debresena, 4208 seeds m(- 2) at Dengolt, 3158 seeds m- 2 at Gelawdiwos, 2754 seeds m(- 2) at Gibtsawit, 2759 seeds m(- 2) at Hiruy, and 1909 seeds m(- 2) at Zahra. The total number of species recorded was 50, representing at least 22 plant families, in <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> <b>church</b> forests, of which 13 were recorded from Ascha, 29 from Debresena, 26 from Dengolt, 19 from Gibtsawit, 22 from Gelawdiwos, 20 from Hiruy and 21 from Zahra. There was a significant difference in seed densities and number of species recovered from the soil seed banks of <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> <b>church</b> forests. Ascha had a significantly higher seed bank density than all other church forests. Dengolt exhibited a significantly higher number of species compared with other church forests. Of the identified species recorded from <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> <b>church</b> forests, 83 % were herbs, 11 % trees and 6 % shrubs. Our results revealed that church forests accumulate large quantities of persistent seeds of herbaceous species in the soil while only five (6 %) of the 91 woody species recorded in the standing vegetation of <b>the</b> <b>seven</b> <b>church</b> forests were represented in the soil seed banks. The fact that most of the dominant tree species do not accumulate seeds in the soil suggests that their regeneration from seeds would be prevented by removal of mature individuals in the standing vegetation. The results also provided further evidences that consolidate the conclusions of previous studies, i. e. the future existence of the woody flora characteristic of dry Afromontane areas in Ethiopia depends on the conservation and sustainable utilization of the few remnant natural forests...|$|E
