The Feedback Based Model was able to fit the data well for either low frequencies and high frequencies, but not both. Further, the model was able to model the effects of changes in copper roughness well.

40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} {{wireless}} industry needs new high performance materials to build low loss, high density, thermally stable integrated packages. Applications include automotive safety, control, {{global positioning system}} (GPS) mapping and entertainment, multifunctional portable phones, home entertainment, office voice, video and data transmission through wireless local area networks (WLAN). This paper describes ceramic tapes developed to meet these needs. The GHz operating frequencies of these systems require substrate materials with lower loss, low dielectric constant (K) and good power handling characteristics which are important {{in many of these}} applications. Low loss is a critical requirement for lightweight portable devices for long battery life. The dielectric constant of 4. 2 is lower than alumina and some other ceramic materials which have been used in multilayer packages. This is important because higher dielectric constant results in slower signal velocity, and higher resistivity in thinner <b>trace</b> <b>widths</b> of transmission lines. Higher K also contributes to cross-talk problems between traces. The system described here is fired at 850 °C and thus allows the use of high conductivity precious metal conductors.

The circular electrodes involve a concentric design (Fig.  1 b), consisting of inner disks (150 or 125  μm in radius) surrounding by open-ended rings (inner radius: 200  μm, outer radius: 300  μm). The interdigitated electrodes incorporate 8 (upper digit) or 7 (bottom digit) fingers each with dimensions of 20  ×  50  μm 2 and spacings of 20  μm. The meander electrodes involve {{two sets of}} four semicircular lines (radii: 30, 90, 150, and 210  μm, width: 20  μm) and two 60 ° and 150 ° arc lines (radii: 310 and 270  μm, width: 20  μm) interconnected into spiral shapes. In {{each of these three}} cases, the electrodes connect to corresponding bonding pads (width: 500  μm, spacing: 500  μm) and a common ground pad through serpentine <b>traces</b> (<b>width</b> 50  μm; ~ 225  μm radii of curvature). The floating ground plates consists of 600  ×  600  μm 2 pads situated above the reference electrodes and connected with serpentine traces through vias in the PI (230  ×  230  μm 2 in dimension). The use of different electrode designs in a single device allows us to assess various hydration sensing methods and sensor parameters under the same experimental conditions. The meander electrodes perform as resistors, which can be used for assessment of skin hydration through purely resistivity measurement. The other electrodes measure both resistance and capacitance changes. The circular electrodes offer symmetries that facilitate theoretical analysis; these geometries are also found in macroscale electrodes used in CMM [22, 23], to enable direct comparison.|$|R

These authors argued that damage zones are formed at the tips of the slipping patches of the fault zones when these are subject to enhanced stress.

40|$|Making {{communication}} devices smaller, lighter, and cheaper {{has been the}} driving force behind the development of new technologies which have made the cellular phones and wireless networks we now take for granted possible. The frequent emphasis on miniaturization particularly has required the development of a variety of new approaches to creating communications circuits. One such technology that has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years is passives that are embedded into the package of communications integrated circuits. Using these devices reduces the amount of surface area required to implement a communications device, in addition to potentially improving performance and making them cost less. One area of application which is immediately obvious is the RF filtering which is required in {{communication devices}}. The primary contribution of the present work is to establish a procedure for using such embedded passives to implement RF filters. While a large body of work has been previously devoted to the modeling and creation of individual embedded passives, the challenge of combining them into functional networks for use in communications system has not yet been the subject of a significant amount of academic analysis. By consolidating the knowledge gained by previous work concerning the modeling and optimization of embedded passives, the present work attempts to formulate an optimized procedure for creating embedded passive filter networks. The present work presents the design and implementation of LC ladder filters for microwave frequencies using passives embedded in an organic substrate provided by Intel Corporation. The work presents an efficient and accurate methodology for the design and implementation of such filters in a limited footprint area, with an emphasis on creating a straightforward, fast design procedure. For both embedded passive inductors and capacitors a parameterized three dimensional model suitable for use in a fullwave solver has been developed. An exhaustive documentation of the simulation parameters used to simulate these structures is provided in order to assist others in repeating the work presented here. In order to create embedded filters, libraries spanning the design space of both embedded inductors and capacitors have been formed. Inductors with different numbers of turns, <b>trace</b> <b>widths,</b> <b>trace</b> spacing, and inner diameters have been simulated from 1 to 10 GHz and analyzed to obtain the inductance, self resonant frequency, Q, and parasitic effects. Capacitors with plate areas ranging from a minimum size up to 1 mm 2 ̆ 2 are also simulated and empirical formulas for their capacitance, resistance and inductance are provided. Based on this, a design methodology is proposed and documented. The design methodology includes compensation for the coupling effects that exist between embedded passives placed in close proximity to one another. Based on the simulated coupling effects suggestions for layout are made. A design procedure developed in this work has been applied to a three pole and five pole low pass filters. The filters 2 ̆ 7 characteristics show an excellent agreement the response of the LC ladder filter. Finally the work presents a study of some the effects of manufacturing tolerances on filter construction.

Observations and simulations of the fault-zone trapped waves show a ~ 150 - 200 -m-wide low-velocity waveguide along the SAF, within which shear velocities are reduced by 20 - 40 % from wall-rock velocities and the Q value of fault-zone rocks is 10 - 50, indicating {{the existence of a}} damage zone on the major plate boundary at Parkfield.

The central stellar velocity dispersion σ_c of the sample galaxies is derived from new long-slit spectra from ground-based observations and the bulge effective radius is obtained from a two-dimensional photometric decomposition of the i-band images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} mass (M_dyn) {{is a key}} {{property of}} any galaxy, yet a determination of M_dyn is not straight-forward if spatially resolved measurements are not available. This situation occurs in single-dish HI observations of the local universe, but also frequently in high-redshift observations. M_dyn-measurements in high-redshift galaxies are commonly obtained through observations of the CO line, the most abundant tracer of the molecular medium. Even though the CO linewidth can in most cases be determined with reasonable accuracy, a measurement {{of the size of}} the emitting region is typically challenging given current facilities. We show how the integrated spectra (`global profiles') of a variety of galaxy models depend on the spatial distribution of the tracer gas as well as its velocity dispersion. We demonstrate that the choice of tracer emission line significantly affects the shape of the global profiles. In particular, in the case of high (~ 50 kms- 1) velocity dispersions, compact tracers (such as CO) result in Gaussian-like (non-double-horned) profiles, as is indeed frequently seen in high-redshift observations. We determine at which radii the rotation curve reaches the rotation velocity corresponding to the velocity width, and find that for each tracer this happens at a well-defined radius: HI velocity widths typically originate at ~ 5 optical scale lengths, while CO velocity <b>widths</b> <b>trace</b> the rotation velocity at ~ 2 scale lengths. We additionally explore other distributions to take into account that CO distributions at high redshift likely differ from those at low redshift. Our models, while not trying to reproduce individual galaxies, define characteristic radii that can be used in conjunction with the measured velocity widths in order to define dynamical masses consistent with the assumed gas distribution.

The six-port transfer matrix approach enables easy computation of the transfer function, as well as near-end and far-end crosstalk. The intersymbol interference is accounted for by computing the pulse response for the worst case bit pattern. Furthermore, the models developed here are used to optimize the data-rate and <b>trace</b> <b>width</b> {{for each of the}} links, so that the aggregate bandwidth obtained per joule of energy supplied to the link is maximized. The modeling and optimization approach developed here serves as a good platform to compare the air-gap interconnects against BP, PCB, and SI interconnects on lossy dielectrics. It is shown that air-gap interconnects can provide an aggregate bandwidth improvement of 3 ×– 4 × for BP links at a comparable energy per bit, and a 5 ×– 9 × improvement in aggregate bandwidth of PCB links at the expense of 20 % higher energy per bit.

The proposed bidirectional scanner (4 mm × 4 mm × 250 μm) is fabricated by micromolding an isotropic Nd-Fe-B micropowder (MQFP- 12 - 5) doped in a PDMS matrix at 80 % weight percentage and magnetized using a standard dipole electromagnet. A reflective gold layer of 100 nm is evaporated onto the polymer composite structure. A maximum magnetic field of 20 mT is measured for the polymer magnetic mirror. Rectangular planar coils (<b>trace</b> <b>width</b> and spacing: 254 μm; 10 turns) are employed to actuate the bidirectional scanner electromagnetically by Lorentz force. Actuation in both static and dynamic excitation modes is tested. Power consumption at a maximum rotational angle (15 degrees – optical) is one watt at 40 Hz resonant frequency. Initial surface roughness of the mirror (165 nm) and radius of curvature (75 mm) has been addressed by depositing {{a thin layer of}} PDMS, resulting in 66. 24 nm surface roughness and 321. 37 mm overall radius of curvature after integration. Major advantages of the proposed bidirectional scanner include low fabrication cost, low input voltage and large actuator displacement compared to existing electrostatic scanners...|$|E
40|$|Dynamical mass (M dyn) {{is a key}} {{property}} of any galaxy, yet a determination of M dyn is not straightforward if spatially resolved measurements are not available. This situation occurs in single-dish H I observations of the local universe, but also frequently in high-redshift observations. M dyn measurements in high-redshift galaxies are commonly obtained through observations of the CO line, the most abundant tracer of the molecular medium. Even though {{in most cases the}} CO line width can be determined with reasonable accuracy, a measurement {{of the size of the}} emitting region is typically challenging given current facilities. We show how the integrated spectra ("global profiles") of a variety of galaxy models depend on the spatial distribution of the tracer gas as well as its velocity dispersion. We demonstrate that the choice of tracer emission line (e. g., H I tracing extended, "flat," emission versus CO tracing more compact, "exponential," emission) significantly affects the shape of the global profiles. In particular, in the case of high (~ 50 km s- 1) velocity dispersions, compact tracers (such as CO) result in Gaussian-like (non-double-horned) profiles, as is indeed frequently seen in high-redshift observations. This leads to significantly different determinations of M dyn if different distributions of the tracer material ("flat" versus "exponential") are considered. We determine at which radii the rotation curve reaches the rotation velocity corresponding to the velocity width, and find that for each tracer this happens at a well-defined radius: H I velocity widths typically originate at ~ 5 optical scale lengths, while CO velocity <b>widths</b> <b>trace</b> the rotation velocity at ~ 2 scale lengths. We additionally explore other distributions to take into account that CO distributions at high redshift likely differ from those at low redshift. Our models, while not trying to reproduce individual galaxies, define characteristic radii that can be used in conjunction with the measured velocity widths in order to define dynamical masses consistent with the assumed gas distribution...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedHypocenters of small, {{relocated}} earthquakes {{are used}} to constrain how seismicity rates vary with distance from strike-slip faults in California. Stacks of events in a fault-referenced coordinate system show that out to a fault-normal distance x of 3 - 6 km, seismicity obeys a power-law ~(1 +x^ 2 /d^ 2) ^(-g/ 2), where g is the asymptotic roll-off rate and d is a near-fault inner scale. These results are compatible with a 'rough fault loading' model in which the inner scale d measures the half-width of a volumetric damage zone and the roll-off rate g is governed by stress variations due to fault roughness. Two-dimensional numerical simulations by J. Dieterich and D. Smith indicate that g is approximately equal to the fractal dimension of along-strike roughness. Results of a multi-catalog error analysis and catalog simulations {{are used to}} correct the estimates of g and d for mislocation bias. Near-fault seismicity is more localized on faults in Northern California (NoCal: d= 50 ± 20 m, g= 1. 51 ± 0. 05) than in Southern California (SoCal: d= 210 ± 40 m, g= 0. 97 ± 0. 05). The Parkfield region has a damage-zone half-width (d= 120 ± 30 m) consistent with the SAFOD drilling estimate and its high roll-off rate (g= 2. 30 ± 0. 25) indicates a relatively flat roughness spectrum: ~k^- 1 vs. ~k^- 2 for NoCal and ~k^- 3 for SoCal. Fault surfaces in SoCal are therefore nearly self-similar, and their roughness spectra are redder than in NoCal, consistent with the macroscopic complexity of the observed fault <b>traces.</b> The damage-zone <b>widths</b> [...] the first direct estimates averaged over the seismogenic layer [...] can be interpreted {{in terms of an}} across-strike 'fault-core multiplicity' that is ~ 1 in NoCal, ~ 2 at Parkfield, and ~ 3 in SoCal.; The localization of seismicity near individual faults correlates with cumulative offset, seismic productivity, and aseismic slip, consistent with a model in which faults originate as branched networks with broad, multi-core damage zones and evolve towards more localized, lineated features with low fault-core multiplicity, thinner damage zones, and less seismic coupling. The spatial distribution of aftershocks is modified by the presence of faults and is well described by an elliptical kernel, in which an aspect parameter scales with distance from a fault...|$|R
40|$|Silicon interposers {{enable the}} {{heterogeneous}} integration of high performance systems. This paper focuses on interconnections from one chip to a neighboring chip in a side-by-side interposer approach. We investigate {{the performance of}} interconnections on a typical silicon interposer with polymer applied to the redistribution layer on both sides using electromagnetic simulations. The simulations are valued by measurements. Our measurements show that microstrip lines with < 0. 3 dB/mm insertion loss at 30 GHz can be achieved with a typical polymer based interposer process. In contrast to other work we extend the microstrip line model with pads on both ends to form a complete interconnection. Our investigations show that an insertion loss of < 0. 55 dB/mm can be achieved assuming dense inter-connections. We investigate the impact of technological variations during the manufacturing process of a silicon interposer. This is important to ensure electrical functionality (signal and power integrity) of the system in mass production. The results on technology variations during the manufacturing process of an interposer show that variations of 20 % in <b>trace</b> <b>width</b> and trace height are changing the characteristic impedance of the line, but do not significantly affect the signal integrity of sufficiently long lines. In contrast, variations of 20 % in polymer height and polymer permittivity in the redistribution layer have more influence on signal integrity of sufficiently long interposer interconnections...|$|E
