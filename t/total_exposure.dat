A further 10 Hubble orbits were used to make short exposures of flanking fields to aid follow-up observations by other instruments.|$|E
5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical <b>total</b> <b>exposure</b> was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} shown that total-body {{clearance}} of mycophenolic acid (MPA) is increased and <b>total</b> MPA <b>exposure</b> decreased in renal allograft recipients with severe renal dysfunction. In contrast to these studies, other studies have associated renal impairment with higher MPA exposure. The reason for these inconsistencies is not clear. METHODS: In 120 renal allograft recipients with stable graft function and treated with a combination of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and corticosteroids, clinical determinants of <b>exposure</b> to <b>total</b> MPA and its glucuronide metabolite MPA 7 -O-glucuronide (MPAG) were investigated in a multivariate regression model at 3 (n= 118) and 12 (n= 63) months after transplantation. RESULTS: Almost 50 % of <b>total</b> MPA <b>exposure</b> could be explained by the final model, in which proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate, diabetes mellitus, and the mycophenolate mofetil dose were independent determinants of <b>total</b> MPA <b>exposure.</b> Lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was independently associated with higher MPA exposure both at 3 and 12 months after transplantation. GFR, alanine aminotransferase, and serum albumin levels and mycophenolate mofetil dose explained 69 % of <b>total</b> MPAG <b>exposure</b> variability. CONCLUSION: In stable renal recipients, <b>total</b> MPA <b>exposure</b> negatively associates with renal function, through accumulation of both MPA and MPAG in patients with moderately reduced renal allograft function. This is in contrast to severe graft dysfunction, where MPA clearance is higher due to increased free fraction of MPA, as shown in previous studies. The duality in the effect of graft function on MPA pharmacokinetics is of clinical importance, adjusting mycophenolate mofetil dose according to renal function might help to avoid side effects and improve efficacy. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{economy of}} the Republic of Ireland {{expanded}} rapidly during the Celtic Tiger years (1995–2007) due to a low corporate tax rate, low ECB interest rates, and other systemic factors (such as soft surveillance of banking supervision including against observance of Basel Core Principles, underdeveloped public financial management and anti-corruption systems and adoption of poor policies including a corporate tax system that fostered non-tradable goods and services through the construction industry).

40|$|Average daily {{ultrafine}} particles (UFP) {{exposure of}} adult Milan subpopulations (defined {{on the basis}} of gender, and then for age, employment or educational status), in different exposure scenarios (typical working day in summer and winter) were simulated using a microenvironmental stochastic simulation model. The basic concept of this kind of model is that time-weighted average exposure is defined as the sum of partial microenvironmental exposures, which are determined by the product of UFP concentration and time spent in each microenvironment. In this work, environmental concentrations were derived from previous experimental studies that were based on microenvironmental measurements in the city of Milan by means of personal or individual monitoring, while time-activity patterns were derived from the EXPOLIS study.

2500|$|On {{behalf of}} the bank and its clients, a large {{investment}} bank's primary function is [...] buying and selling products. In market making, traders will buy and sell financial products {{with the goal of}} making money on each trade. Sales is the term for the investment bank's sales force, whose primary job is to call on institutional and high-net-worth investors to suggest trading ideas (on a caveat emptor basis) and take orders. Sales desks then communicate their clients' orders to the appropriate trading rooms, which can price and execute trades, or structure new products that fit a specific need. Structuring has been a relatively recent activity as derivatives have come into play, with highly technical and numerate employees working on creating complex structured products which typically offer much greater margins and returns than underlying cash securities. In 2010, investment banks came under pressure as a result of selling complex derivatives contracts to local municipalities in Europe and the US. Strategists advise external as well as internal clients on the strategies that can be adopted in various markets. Ranging from derivatives to specific industries, strategists place companies and industries in a quantitative framework with full consideration of the macroeconomic scene. This strategy often affects the way the firm will operate in the market, the direction it would like to take in terms of its proprietary and flow positions, the suggestions salespersons give to clients, as well as the way structurers create new products. Banks also undertake risk through proprietary trading, performed by a special set of traders who do not interface with clients and through [...] "principal risk"—risk undertaken by a trader after he buys or sells a product to a client and does not hedge his <b>total</b> <b>exposure.</b> Banks seek to maximize profitability for a given amount of risk on their balance sheet.

60|$|The portraits being thus arranged, a {{photographic}} camera is directed upon them. Suppose {{there are eight}} portraits in the pack, and that under existing circumstances it would require an exposure of eighty seconds to give an exact photographic copy of any one of them. The general principle of proceeding is this, subject in practice to some variations of detail, depending on the different brightness of the several portraits. We throw the image {{of each of the}} eight portraits in turn upon the same part of the sensitised plate for ten seconds. Thus, portrait No. 1 is {{in the front of the}} pack; we take the cap off the object glass of the camera for ten seconds, and afterwards replace it. We then remove No. 1 from the pins, and No. 2 appears in the front; we take off the cap a second time for ten seconds, and again replace it. Next we remove No. 2, and No. 3 appears in the front, which we treat as its predecessors, and so we go on to the last of the pack. The sensitised plate will now have had its <b>total</b> <b>exposure</b> of eighty seconds; it is then developed, and the print taken from it is the generalised picture of which I speak. It is a composite of eight component portraits. Those of its outlines are sharpest and darkest that are common to the largest number of the components; the purely individual peculiarities leave little or no visible trace. The latter being necessarily disposed equally on both sides of the average, the outline of the composite is the average of all the components. It is a band and not a fine line, because the outlines of the components are seldom exactly superimposed. The band will be darkest in its middle whenever the component portraits have the same general type of features, and its breadth, or amount of blur, will measure the tendency of the components to deviate from the common type. This is so for the very same reason that the shot-marks on a target are more thickly disposed near the bull's-eye than away from it, and in a greater degree as the marksmen are more skilful. All that has been said of the outlines is equally true as regards the shadows; the result being that the composite represents an averaged figure, whose lineaments have been softly drawn. The eyes come out with appropriate distinctness, owing to the mechanical conditions under which the components are hung.|$|E
