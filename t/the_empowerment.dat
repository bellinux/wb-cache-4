40|$|AIM: To {{assess whether}} a {{structured}} diabetes education programme, <b>the</b> Patient <b>Empowerment</b> Programme, {{was associated with}} a lower rate of all-cause hospitalization and emergency department visits in a population-based cohort of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus in primary care. METHODS: A cohort of 24 250 patients was evaluated using a linked administrative database during 2009 - 2013. We selected 12 125 patients with Type 2 diabetes who had at least one Patient Empowerment Programme session attendance. Patients who did not participate in <b>the</b> Patient <b>Empowerment</b> Programme were matched one-to-one with patients who did, using the propensity score method. Hospitalization events and emergency department visits were the events of interest. Cox proportional hazard and negative binomial regressions were performed to estimate the hazard ratios for the initial event, and incidence rate ratios for the number of events. RESULTS: During a median 30. 5 months of follow-up, participants in <b>the</b> Patient <b>Empowerment</b> Programme had a lower incidence of an initial hospitalization event (22. 1 vs 25. 2 %; hazard ratio 0. 879; P< 0. 001) and emergency department visit (40. 5 vs 44 %; hazard ratio 0. 901; P< 0. 001) {{than those who did not}} participate in <b>the</b> Patient <b>Empowerment</b> Programme. Participation in <b>the</b> Patient <b>Empowerment</b> Programme {{was associated with a}} significantly lower number of emergency department visits (incidence rate ratio 0. 903; P< 0. 001) : 40. 4 visits per 100 patients annually in those who did not participate in <b>the</b> Patient <b>Empowerment</b> Programme vs. 36. 2 per 100 patients annually in those who did. There were significantly fewer hospitalization episodes (incidence rate ratio 0. 854; P< 0. 001) : 200 hospitalizations per 100 patients annually in those who did not participate in <b>the</b> Patient <b>Empowerment</b> Programme vs. 16. 9 hospitalizations per 100 patients annually in those who did. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with Type 2 diabetes, <b>the</b> Patient <b>Empowerment</b> Programme was shown to be effective in delaying the initial hospitalization event and in reducing their frequency.
