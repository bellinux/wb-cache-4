5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> healthy people, {{although}} {{it is possible that}} there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a heart attack or stroke in the past. One study found that among those who have never had a heart attack or stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal heart attack or stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a heart attack or stroke.|$|E
5|$|The LIRGs that host {{hydroxyl}} megamasers may {{be distinguished}} from <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> LIRGs by their molecular gas content. The majority of molecular gas is molecular hydrogen, and typical hydroxyl megamaser hosts have molecular gas densities greater than 1000cm−3. These densities are among the highest mean densities of molecular gas among LIRGs. The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers also have high fractions of dense gas relative to typical LIRGs. The dense gas fraction {{is measured by the}} ratio of the luminosity produced by hydrogen cyanide (HCN) relative to the luminosity of carbon monoxide (CO).|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of nymphs into adults can take months; {{the time period}} depends on food availability, temperature, and <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> the colony. Since nymphs are unable to feed themselves, workers must feed them, but workers also {{take part in the}} social life of the colony and have certain other tasks to accomplish such as foraging, building or maintaining the nest or tending to the queen. Pheromones regulate the caste system in termite colonies, preventing all but a very few of the termites from becoming fertile queens.|$|E

5|$|The {{homecoming}} celebration {{went on for}} days. Officials and <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> {{the island}} crowded the shoreline to cheer their returning monarch. Speeches were made in both English and Hawaiian, and some people stood on rooftops for a glimpse. Floral arrangements permeated the city, welcome-home signs were displayed, and music was everywhere. Along his route to Iolani Palace, the procession passed beneath numerous festooned arches erected for his homecoming. A daytime parade was held in his honor. The palace was opened {{for the public to}} personally greet the King. The Honolulu Fire Department and the Poola Association began an evening torchlight parade at a bell tower brightly lit with Chinese lanterns, and proceeded through the streets of downtown Honolulu to the palace.|$|E
5|$|Dreaming of You {{was among}} the top ten best-selling debuts for a musician, best-selling debut by a female act, and the fastest-selling U.S. album of 1995. It has since been ranked among {{the best and most}} {{important}} recordings produced during the rock and roll era. Media outlets have since ranked the recording among the best posthumous releases. When Dreaming of You peaked at number one, Tejano music entered the mainstream market. Music critics said <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. would not have known about Tejano or Latin music {{had it not been for}} Dreaming of You. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album 35×platinum (Latin field), for shipping 3.5 million units in the U.S. The album was eventually certified gold by Music Canada and by Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON). As of January 2015, the album has sold five million copies worldwide, and remains the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis used several public {{relations}} tactics to convince <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> Germany not to smoke. Well-known health magazines like the Gesundes Volk (Healthy People), Volksgesundheit (People's Health) and Gesundes Leben (Healthy Life) published warnings {{about the health}} consequences of smoking and posters showing {{the harmful effects of}} tobacco were displayed. Anti-smoking messages were sent to the people in their workplaces, often {{with the help of the}} Hitler-Jugend (HJ) and the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM). The anti-smoking campaign undertaken by the Nazis also included health education. In June 1939, a Bureau against the Hazards of Alcohol and Tobacco was formed and the Reichsstelle für Rauschgiftbekämpfung (Reich Office for Drug Control) also helped in the anti-tobacco campaign. Articles advocating nonsmoking were published in the magazines Die Genussgifte (The Recreational Stimulants), Auf der Wacht (On the Guard) and Reine Luft (Clean Air). Out of these magazines, Reine Luft was the main journal of the anti-tobacco movement. Karl Astel's Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research at Jena University purchased and distributed hundreds of reprints from Reine Luft.|$|E

50|$|At a {{cultural}} level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance {{during the past}} two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are socialism, communism, social anarchism, libertarian socialism, left-libertarianism, one-nation conservatism and progressivism, some of which propound economic egalitarianism. Several egalitarian ideas enjoy wide support among intellectuals and in <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> many countries. Whether any of these ideas have been significantly implemented in practice, however, remains a controversial question. A position of opposition to egalitarianism is antiegalitarianism.|$|R

25|$|The former type {{of study}} is purely {{descriptive}} and {{cannot be used}} to make inferences about <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> <b>of</b> patients with that disease. These types of studies, in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patient's history, may lead to formulation of a new hypothesis. Using the data from the series, analytic studies could be done to investigate possible causal factors. These can include case control studies or prospective studies. A case control study would involve matching comparable controls without the disease to the cases in the series. A prospective study would involve following the case series over time to evaluate the disease's natural history.|$|E
