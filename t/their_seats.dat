5|$|In November 2008, SMRT Corporation and Land Transport Authority (LTA) {{announced}} that the last ten refurbished trainsets would have one-third of <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> replaced with metal rails to create extra standing space. The move was justified on grounds of allowing more standing space onboard during peak-hour services. The reduction of seats per row from nine to seven after refurbishment was already unpopular among commuters; the decision to further reduce seating capacity drew sharp criticism against the operator and LTA. As of December 2015, all 66 C151s from one-third of <b>their</b> <b>seats</b> {{have been replaced by}} metal bars to create extra standing space.|$|E

It was notable both for being inhabited mostly by full-bloods (as many Cherokee of the other towns were of mixed race but identified as Cherokee) and for being the largest town in the Cherokee Nation.

50|$|Solms had {{its first}} {{documentary}} mention in 788 in a donation document from the Lorsch Monastery. The villages that nowadays form {{the town of}} Solms belonged for centuries to the County of Solms, an independent state within the Holy Roman Empire, elevated to a county in 1223, until it was dissolved in 1806. The still existing lines of the House of Solms are the princely branches of Solms-Braunfels with <b>their</b> <b>seat</b> in Braunfels, Solms-Hohensolms-Lich with <b>their</b> <b>seat</b> in Lich and Solms-Baruth, furthermore the Counts of Solms-Laubach with <b>their</b> <b>seat</b> in Laubach, Solms-Rödelheim-Assenheim with <b>their</b> <b>seat</b> in Assenheim, Solms-Sonnewalde and Solms-Wildenfels. The Burgsolms castle at Solms, ancestral seat of the family since around 1100, was destroyed in 1384 {{by a coalition of}} nearby towns under the leadership of Wetzlar, forcing count John to move to Greifenstein castle.
