5|$|As constructed, {{the main}} {{facade of the}} station faced Glenwood Avenue. The two-story {{entrance}} loggia consisted of seven arched bays, with a three-bay wing to the northeast and a <b>two-bay</b> wing to the southwest, and acted as a transition point between {{the street and the}} station interior. The first floor (at track level) featured a large waiting room occupying the entire center block, with vault lights providing natural illumination and a fountain set into the western wall. Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the medieval}} stonework, is made from {{limestone}} taken from quarries around Dundry and Felton with Bath stone being used in other areas. The <b>two-bay</b> Elder Lady Chapel, which includes some Purbeck Marble, lies {{to the north of}} the five-bay aisled chancel or presbytery. The Eastern Lady Chapel has two bays, the sacristy one-bay and the Berkeley Chapel two bays. The exterior has deep buttresses with finials to weathered tops and crenellated parapets with crocketed pinnacles below the Perpendicular crossing tower.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte's Way, {{formerly}} known as Hill House, {{is located in a}} prominent setting close to Saint Paul's Church of Ireland church. This house was once the home of Charlotte Brontë's husband, Mr. Nicholls, who returned to Banagher after Charlotte's death. Nicholls remarried and lived at Hill House until his death in 1906. The house was sold to a Major Bell in 1919. He died in 1944 and his wife inherited the property. Florence Bell died in 1959. This connection to Brontë, one of the most renowned writers of the 19th century, is revealed in its present name, giving the house cultural interest. It is a detached three-bay two-storey house, built in 1753, with a gabled central bay to the façade with modern porch and single-bay two-storey wing to the south and <b>two-bay</b> two-storey wing to the north. It is now used as a bed and breakfast and visitors can enjoy its restored appearance and sense the history of a place connected in a curious way with the Brontë family.|$|E

5000|$|The {{house built}} by John Congreve in about 1700 was {{originally}} two-storeyed with dormers above, a three-bay pedimented central block and <b>two-bayed</b> wings {{with a central}} pedimented entrance door.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} comprises a compact, three-storey house, in the Dutch-classical style {{which was}} introduced into England by Sir Roger Pratt, and {{is typical of}} Bruce's work. The six-bay entrance front has a <b>two-bay</b> projecting central section, surmounted by a pediment topped by three pineapples, of which one remains. The tympanum is carved with the coat of arms of the Earl and his wife, with their initials (WEA and SCA for William, Earl of Annandale, and Sophia Countess of Annandale) and the date 1699. The roof behind was bell-cast, with a cupola and four tall chimneys symmetrically placed, although this was replaced in the 1950s. The centrally placed entrance is reached by steps, and surmounted by carved decorations. The garden front is similar, and is also topped by a decorated pediment. Once the house was complete, two wings connected by curved passages were added. These incorporated additional accommodation and a library, but the passages and south wing were later demolished.|$|E

There are handsome early 18th century paneling {{in one of the}} lower rooms.|$|R
25|$|The N.1 was a <b>two-bay</b> biplane of {{conventional}} design, with staggered wings, two open cockpits in tandem, and fixed, tailskid undercarriage. At least eight aircraft were built {{during the war}} and converted to P.I standard after the Armistice.|$|E
25|$|First {{flown in}} 1917, only one C.XIII was built {{and the type}} did not enter production; instead Albatros built the flat-sided, <b>two-bay,</b> more {{powerful}} C.XIV the following year for the light two-seat category, developing it into the production C.XV.|$|E
25|$|The Type 166 was a <b>two-bay</b> biplane {{with twin}} wooden pontoon floats, with a water rudder fitted to the tail float, plus a {{stabilizing}} float mounted near the wingtip under each lower wing. It was {{powered by a}} nose-mounted 200hp (149kW) Salmson engine.|$|E
5000|$|The sacristy is {{adjacent}} to the presbytery in the north, the road to it leads through a rectangular late Gothic portal with a stone profiled jamb. The portal is round out the cross-hatched design together with stonework mark on top. The portal demonstrates {{the fact that the}} sacristy dates from the late Middle Ages. The current sacristy was built in baroque style together with the chapel St. Saviour. This proves reinforced overlay on the northeast corner, visible from the outside. The space of the sacristy is vaulted with <b>two-bays</b> of baroque vault [...] In this space is the niche that is compressed oval arched. The chimney with architectonic top is one of the original features of the sacristy. The top of the chimney was rebuilt in the years 1914-1915. Rectangular sacristy windows are situated in the north. Above the northeast corner is situated a frame for painting (now empty).|$|R
40|$|Severe {{earthquakes}} in year 2004 {{had caused}} a destructive tsunami and {{killed more than}} 170, 000 people in Aceh Indonesia. The disaster raises the public awareness and demand in safe house. This paper presented the structural failure behaviour, strength and performance level of <b>two-bays</b> double storeys safe house structure with the scaled of 1 : 5. Cyclic pushover test was conducted with compliance to the standard guidelines from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA 356) in year 2000. The structural behaviour and deformation patterns under repeated cyclic lateral loads were identified through experimental test. The structural stiffness capacity, performance level, seismic energy dissipation and spectral acceleration of the safe house model were obtained through calculations from the hysteresis curves. Experimental result shows the ultimate lateral load of safe house model was 9. 9 kN with roof top displacement of 49. 1 mm. The model has performance level of Immediate Occupancy (IO), Life Safety (LS) and Collapse Prevention (CP) at 6. 3 mm, 16 mm and 49. 1 mm roof top displacement, respectively. It was found that, the safe house structure is able to withstand seismic excitation of 0. 98 g spectral acceleration...|$|R
50|$|The medium nave is vaulted by <b>two-bays</b> cross vaults. The vaults are {{supported}} by double mangered stone ribs. Rib vaults converge on multi-lobed brackets. In {{the eastern part of}} the nave brackets are drowned in the baroque wall. The trapezoidal presbytery is connected to the nave on the east side. Its height coincides with the height of the central nave. The central nave defines a pair of Baroque arcades supported with pillars. In the middle of the nave arcades are drained massive stone pillars that seem to come from the late 14th century. Columns' tops terminate with Corinthian capitals. At the end of the 19th century's northern nave arched vaults with two cross pyriform ribs. Ribs grow from facing pyramidal consoles. The console in the middle of the north wall is a replica circa 1914. Bolts vaults are the target or circular type. Bolts adorn the coat tanners. On the northern boat continues on the east side chapel of St.Salvatora. The chapel is vaulted with placková vault with stucco mirror. Chapel corners are broken niches that culminates conches and pilasters frame. Pilasters carry peripheral cornice chapel. Above the niches in the corners are a motif stucco, crossed, laurel branches. The north nave and chapels are connected through high semicircular culminating in the arcade. The wall-pillar with leaf capitals and the entablature cover plate frame created by the nave for the connecting arcade. At the top of the arcade is located stucco cartouche with Veraikon.|$|R
25|$|The main facade {{is divided}} into five bays in an A-B-A rhythm {{established}} by a single-bay central section and flanking <b>two-bay</b> sections. Rustic quoins turn {{the east and west}} corners of the facade. An italianate cornice spans the roof-line between the rusticated quoins.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} aircraft, designated N.T.2B, was a single-engined pusher biplane, with unequal span <b>two-bay</b> {{wings and}} {{powered by a}} 160hp (119kW) Beardmore 160 hp engine mounted between the wings driving a four-bladed propeller. The trainee pilot and instructor {{sat side by side}} in an enclosed cockpit, fitted with dual controls.|$|E
25|$|The Ca.1 had an {{uncovered}} rectangular truss as a fuselage; its <b>two-bay</b> wing cellule featured unstaggered mainplanes {{of equal}} span. Although {{the engine was}} mounted in the nose, it drove propellers mounted {{in front of the}} wings on long struts. The landing gear consisted of a dual mainwheel and skid arrangement, with outrigger wheels at each wingtip and a tailwheel.|$|E
25|$|It was a {{conventional}} <b>two-bay</b> biplane design {{based on the}} M.F.6 and M.F.7, with open cockpits in tandem for the student and instructor. The main difference between the M.F.8 and the M.F.7 were that M.F.8 had a new tail rudder and wing profile, {{in order to increase}} landing speed. The new profile had been developed by the Swedish professor Nordensvan, in cooperation with the Norwegian Army Air Service.|$|E
25|$|The Wanamaker Flier was a {{conventional}} biplane design with <b>two-bay,</b> unstaggered wings of unequal span with two tractor engines mounted {{side by side}} above the fuselage in the interplane gap. Wingtip pontoons were attached directly below the lower wings near their tips. The aircraft resembled Curtiss' earlier flying boat designs, but was considerably larger in order to carry enough fuel to cover 1,100mi (1,770km). The three crew members were accommodated in a fully enclosed cabin.|$|E
25|$|On {{either side}} of the {{entrance}} portal are square two-storey <b>two-bay</b> wings with plain walls with a string course containing grotesques and large octagonal lanterns. Behind the entrance portal flanked by square towers is the three-light east window of the reading hall. It has reticulated tracery and shafts in a similar style to the parapet. In front of the library are Art Nouveau bronze railings with central double gates and lamp standards.|$|E
25|$|Sopwith's design, the 3F.2 Buffalo, was a single-engined tractor biplane, {{with its}} <b>two-bay</b> wooden wings taken from Sopwith's earlier Bulldog fighter. Like the Salamander, the forward {{fuselage}} was {{made out of}} armour plate, weighing about 750lb (340kg), with {{the bottom of the}} fuselage 0.315in (8mm) thick, with the sides and front of 0.179in (5mm) plate. The armoured box reached back to the observer's cockpit, protecting the crew together with the fuel tanks and pipes, the carburettor and the magnetos.|$|E
25|$|The Boarhound, {{designed}} by Captain Frank Barnwell, was a <b>two-bay</b> biplane which used {{a method of}} steel construction which involved high-tensile steel strips, rolled into cusped and flanged sections, which were riveted together to form longerons and struts. The resulting structure was lighter, stronger and cheaper than one made from drawn tubes. It had a deep fuselage allowing bulky radio and camera equipment to be carried, and was powered by a Bristol Jupiter IV engine with variable timing.|$|E
25|$|The DH.18 was {{designed}} and built in 1919 by Airco as their first aircraft specifically for commercial work, earlier aircraft such as the DH.16 being modified military types. The DH.18 was a single-engined biplane, powered by a Napier Lion engine with wooden <b>two-bay,</b> wire-braced wings, and a forward fuselage clad in plywood. It accommodated eight passengers in an enclosed cabin with the pilot in an open cockpit behind the cabin. The first prototype flew early in 1920.|$|E
25|$|The slim {{fuselage}} of the Nautilus did {{not have}} its keel aligned with the lower wing, as on most biplanes; rather, the centreline was at mid-gap. Blackburn used the gap between keel and wing to insert a faired radiator with a shutter-controlled front intake. This rather enhanced the Nautilus' pointed appearance. The wings were of <b>two-bay</b> construction with parallel struts, staggered and swept. Only the lower wing had dihedral. There were ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The wings were foldable for carrier storage.|$|E
25|$|Based on a {{prototype}} with the factory designation 4A15, the G.I and its successors were built to a conventional bomber design for their time, <b>two-bay</b> biplanes with unstaggered wings of unequal span. The pilot sat {{in an open}} cockpit just forward of the wings, and open positions were provided in the nose and amidships for a gunner and observer. The engines were mounted pusher-fashion in nacelles atop the lower wings and enclosed in streamlined cowlings. Fixed tricycle undercarriage was fitted, with dual wheels on each unit.|$|E
25|$|Located at 121 N. 6th Street, the Windsor Severance Fire Rescue Museum houses many {{displays}} {{of the history}} of Windsor Fire Department, established in 1902. The fire department was dissolved as a division of the Town of Windsor and re-organized in 1950 as the Windsor Severance Fire Protection District. Today, the agency operates under the name of Windsor Severance Fire Rescue, which more accurately describes the mission of the organization. The displays are stored in a replica of a <b>two-bay,</b> 2,500-square-foot fire house constructed in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The Short Type 320 was {{designed}} to meet an official requirement for a seaplane to carry a Mark IX torpedo. It was larger than the earlier Short 184, and was a typical Short folder design of the time, with <b>two-bay</b> uneven span wings. Two prototypes were built, powered by a 310hp Sunbeam Cossack engine, and initially known as the Short 310 Type A from the engine fitted to the prototypes. When the torpedo bomber went into production, it was powered by a 320hp (238kW) Cossack engine which was {{the origin of the}} name, Type 320.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} that Fairey Aviation designed in response first flew on 16 February 1917. It was a single-engined tractor biplane of fabric-covered wooden construction. The <b>two-bay</b> wings folded rearwards for storage. The crew of two sat in separate cockpits, with the observer's cockpit {{provided with a}} single Lewis gun on a Scarff ring This {{was the first of}} two prototypes, designated F.16 and powered by a 250hp (190kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle IV. The second, powered by an Eagle V of 275hp (205kW), was designated F.17. Both prototypes would later see active service operating from Scapa Flow.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} of the Fairey III was the N.10 floatplane, which was designed and built in 1917 by Fairey Aviation (along with the smaller N.9) to meet Admiralty Specification N.2(a) for a carrier-based seaplane for the Royal Naval Air Service during the First World War. N.10, also known by its constructor's number F.128 was a <b>two-bay</b> biplane with folding wings and powered by a 260hp (190kW) Sunbeam Maori engine. It first flew from the Port Victoria seaplane station on the Isle of Grain, Kent on 14 September 1917.|$|E
25|$|The Vespa was {{designed}} by Vickers as a private venture {{to meet the requirements}} of Air Ministry Specification 30/24, the first prototype, the Vespa I being flown in September 1925. The Vespa, which was a single-engine biplane with a slim fuselage suspended between closely spaced and highly staggered <b>two-bay</b> wooden wings, was delivered for evaluation by the Royal Air Force, but crash landed owing to engine trouble on 24 June 1926 and was badly damaged. It was then rebuilt with steel, fabric-covered wings as the Vespa II, but this was unsuccessful in getting orders from the RAF.|$|E
25|$|The M.19 {{began as}} an effort to improve the {{performance}} of the Fokker D.II (Fokker designation M.17). The M.19 featured the Oberursel U.III 14-cylinder, two-row rotary engine, combined with the <b>two-bay</b> wing cellule of the Fokker D.I. The U.III engine, first used in the Fokker E.IV, required a revised fore-and-aft mount and a strengthened fuselage. The prototype M.19 arrived at Adlershof for testing on 20 July 1916. Idflieg issued a production order for 50 aircraft at that time, followed by orders for an additional 60 aircraft in August and 100 in November. The new aircraft was designated D.III by Idflieg.|$|E
25|$|The {{timber frame}} {{features}} close studding with a middle rail. It {{rests on a}} stone plinth, the infill is rendered brick and the roof is of slate. At the west end is a shingled square tower with a shingled broach spire ending in a weather cock. This is surrounded by lean-to roofed aisles on the north, west and south sides. The tower has a western arched door with a 20th-century door which incorporates 17th-century iron strap hinges. The body of the church consists of a three-bay nave with north and south aisles, a <b>two-bay</b> chancel and north and south chapels {{at the ends of}} the aisles, and a south porch.|$|E
