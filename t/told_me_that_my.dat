2500|$|Arminio enters stealthily and {{approaches}} some nearby ruins. Hearing a voice within the ruins, Carlo investigates and discovers the emaciated figure of his father. Massimiliano fails to recognise his son, but nevertheless describes to him how Francesco attempted to bury him alive after his collapse on hearing of Carlo's death (Un ignoto tre lune or saranno / [...] "An unknown - {{it will be}} three moons ago now - <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> Carlo had been killed"). Fortunately Arminio saved him and has kept him hidden in the ruins where Carlo has found him.|$|E
2500|$|Burns' {{academic}} {{family moved}} frequently. Among places they called home were Saint-Véran, France; Newark, Delaware; and Ann Arbor {{where his father}} taught at the University of Michigan. Burns' mother {{was found to have}} breast cancer when he was three and she died when he was 11, a circumstance that he said helped shape his career; he credited his father-in-law, a psychologist, with a significant insight: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> whole work was an attempt to make people long gone come back alive." [...] Well-read as a child, he absorbed the family encyclopedia, preferring history to fiction.|$|E
6000|$|... “If your honour {{will believe}} me Shank’s pony’s {{the best for}} this job. I {{would have to leave}} the beast somewhere, anyhow, since the captain has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> half <b>my</b> way will be along paths fit only for goats.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do I {{remember}} if not you? You are my first remembrance. It was you who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> was <b>my</b> name. It was you who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> on every twentieth of December {{my life had}} a penitential anniversary in it called a birthday. I suppose the last communication was truer than the first!" ...|$|R

2500|$|This {{confirmed}} Thérèse {{in her own}} intuitions. She wrote, [...] "My {{soul was}} like a book which the priest read better than I did. He launched me full sail on the waves of confidence and love which held such an attraction for me, but upon which I had not dared to venture. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> faults did not offend God." [...] Her spiritual life drew {{more and more on}} the Gospels that she carried with her at all times. The piety of her time was fed more on commentaries, but Thérèse had asked Céline to get the Gospels and the Epistles of St Paul bound into a single small volume which she could carry on her heart. She said, [...] "But it is especially the Gospels which sustain me during my hours of prayer, for in them I find what is necessary for my poor little soul. I am constantly discovering in them new lights, hidden and mysterious meanings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like {{the other}} players in the Heartbreakers, Campbell avoids the virtuoso {{approach}} to playing, preferring to have his work {{serve the needs of}} each song. Guitar World magazine noted [...] "there are only a handful of guitarists who can claim to have never wasted a note. Mike Campbell is certainly one of them". He is a highly melodic player, often using two or three-strings-at-a-time leads instead of the more conventional one-at-a-time approach. [...] "People have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> playing sounds like bagpipes," [...] he muses. [...] "I'm not exactly sure what that means." [...] His estimation of his own style is typically modest: [...] "I don't think people can really top Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as far as lead guitar goes. I like my playing to bring out the songs." [...] Like Tench, he is heavily involved in constructing the arrangements for the Heartbreakers' tunes. And also like Tench, he prefers rawness to polish in the studio and onstage.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2005, Tom Cruise, {{an actor}} and scientologist whose beliefs frown upon psychiatry, {{condemned}} Brooke, both personally and professionally, for both using and speaking {{in favor of the}} antidepressant drug Paxil. As Cruise said, [...] "Here is a woman and I care about Brooke Shields, because I think she is an incredibly talented woman, you look at , where has her career gone?" [...] Shields responded that Cruise's statements about anti-depressants were [...] "irresponsible" [...] and [...] "dangerous." [...] She said that he should [...] "stick to fighting aliens" [...] (a reference to Cruise's starring role in War of the Worlds {{as well as some of}} the more esoteric aspects of Scientology doctrine and teachings), [...] "and let mothers decide the best way to treat postpartum depression." [...] The actress responded to a further attack by Cruise in an essay [...] "War of Words" [...] published in The New York Times on July 1, 2005, in which she made an individual case for the medication and said, [...] "In a strange way, it was comforting to me when my obstetrician <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> feelings of extreme despair and my suicidal thoughts were directly tied to a biochemical shift in my body. Once we admit that postpartum is a serious medical condition, then the treatment becomes more available and socially acceptable. With a doctor's care, I have since tapered off the medication but, without it, I wouldn't have become the loving parent I am today." [...] On August 31, 2006, according to USAToday.com, Cruise privately apologized to Shields for the incident. Shields accepted Cruise's apology, which she said was [...] "heartfelt." [...] Three months later in November 2006, she and her husband attended the wedding of Cruise and Katie Holmes.|$|E
6000|$|The other--an {{even more}} {{striking}} instance of the possibility, at least, of heroism anywhere and everywhere--is Mr. Thackeray's [...] "Esmond."

6000|$|... "That won't do--you don't mean it. You never cared--you {{were too}} proud to care; and when I spoke to you about my fault, {{you did n't even}} know what I meant.

6000|$|... "Ah, yes; ah, yes--so they did. I {{remember}} now. You <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> Bad business <b>that,</b> <b>my</b> dear Baxter. Mr. Peters gave <b>me</b> <b>that</b> scarab. He {{will be most}} deucedly annoyed if it's lost. Yes, indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My mother <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> She said <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{father was}} a gentleman, and--that I looked like him. She would not tell me his name, because she had taken an oath never to reveal it to anyone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{my heart}} wept {{as though it}} would burst, and I wept in my joy--wept and blessed God and Masouda.

60|$|I {{entertain}} a conviction, {{based upon}} large experience, that {{if in the}} days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met somebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Pumblechook was <b>my</b> earliest patron and the founder of my fortunes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Garth has {{forgotten}} everything," [...] cried Noel Vanstone, recovering his lost composure on the re-appearance of Mrs. Lecount. [...] "Miss Garth has threatened {{me in the}} most outrageous manner. I forbid you to pity either of those two girls any more, Lecount--especially the younger one. She is the most desperate wretch I ever heard of! If she can't get my money by fair means, she threatens to have it by foul. Miss Garth has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> to <b>my</b> face.

6000|$|... "She {{from whom}} we both drew our first nourishment, Signore, often <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> next to <b>my</b> own kin, {{it was my}} duty to love the noble race she had helped to support.

6000|$|... 'When {{she came}} near, the {{twilight}} {{was sufficient to}} show me her attire: it was a cloak reaching {{to the bottom of}} her dress, and a thick veil covering her face.

6000|$|... "So I have found,--with a vengeance. Nobody {{was ever}} so put down as I was.

6000|$|She hearkened at {{his ribs}} and mouth, and there seemed, Nod thought, a little {{kindness}} in her ways. So {{he put out}} his shrunken hand, and said: [...] "Tell me truly, witch-hare.

60|$|It {{was long}} before he was restored, and I often thought that life was entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with {{difficulty}} {{and was unable to}} speak.

6000|$|She {{had sunk}} into a chair. Her hands were folded in a {{listless}} manner in her lap, {{and her eyes}} were lowered, her cheeks pale.
