5|$|Ten of GO's <b>train</b> <b>stations</b> {{are shared}} with Via Rail. GO also connects with fifteen other {{municipal}} transit providers, {{such as the}} TTC. Metrolinx calls many of these transfer points between services mobility hubs, and it has made them a priority as it moves forward with The Big Move regional transportation plan.|$|E
5|$|Mini Metro is puzzle {{strategy}} video game, {{in which}} players are tasked with building an efficient rail transit network for {{a rapidly growing}} city. Each level is a flat depiction of a real city and begins with three <b>train</b> <b>stations.</b> <b>Train</b> <b>stations</b> are represented by different shaped nodes. Players can construct routes to link stations by drawing lines between them; each route has a different colour. Passengers appear at stations, each denoted by a shape that identifies which station they want to travel to. Trains travel along routes taking passengers to their desired stations. Rivers, intersecting train lines {{and the appearance of}} more stations and passengers over time causes the transit network to become more complex and difficult to manage. Common-shaped stations can also change their node shape into rarer ones. The game's visual style is minimalist, employing straight lines and bold colours, similar to modern transit maps.|$|E
50|$|Besides the Silver Star, Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach (with {{connection}} {{service by}} Martz First Class) is {{provided to the}} following: Orlando (<b>train</b> <b>station),</b> Tampa (<b>train</b> <b>station),</b> Pinellas Park (Clearwater and St. Petersburg), Bradenton, Sarasota, Port Charlotte, and Fort Myers. Thruway Motorcoach service is also provided (with connection service by Amtrak) to Dade City (<b>train</b> <b>station),</b> Wildwood (<b>train</b> <b>station),</b> The Villages (Spanish Springs Shuttle <b>Station),</b> Ocala (<b>train</b> <b>station),</b> Gainesville (Rosa Parks Region Transportation System Downtown <b>Station),</b> Waldo (<b>train</b> <b>station),</b> and Jacksonville (<b>train</b> <b>station)</b> since <b>train</b> service by the Palmetto was discontinued south of Savannah, Georgia in 2004.|$|R

5|$|The GO Transit {{authority}} has two major commuter train lines running through Scarborough, and operates seven GO <b>train</b> <b>stations.</b> The Lakeshore East line runs {{across the south}} end of the city, while the Stouffville line runs in a more north-south fashion in the centre of Scarborough. GO Transit also has a few bus stations and stops in Scarborough.|$|E
5|$|A {{couple weeks}} later {{and during the}} full moon of September 19, 2013 an update was {{released}} which revealed limited edition railcards featuring promotional images of the film. The cards were scheduled to go on sale at the Shimbashi and Toyosu <b>train</b> <b>stations</b> between October 1 and 31, 2013. They granted a bearer access to the New Transit Yurikamome train which connects to the artificial island of Odaiba in Tokyo Bay between Minato and Kōtō in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Fares on {{the network}} {{are based on a}} zone tariff set between two {{specified}} points by GO Transit, and the type of passenger using the ticket. Passenger categories exist for adults, students, seniors, children, and groups. Tickets are also sold for single trip, or passes for one day or one month. Tickets can be used on a GO train, bus, or a combination of both. They can be purchased at <b>train</b> <b>stations,</b> bus terminals, ticket agencies, or on GO buses.|$|E

50|$|With {{the demise}} of the New York and Putnam Railroad, {{commuter}} rail service to New York City is available via the Dobbs Ferry <b>train</b> <b>station</b> and Ardsley-on-Hudson <b>train</b> <b>station,</b> served by Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line, and the Hartsdale <b>train</b> <b>station</b> and Scarsdale <b>train</b> <b>station</b> served by Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line.|$|R
5|$|The station {{opened in}} the 1870s and was known as New York Junction and Germantown Junction. A new station, which ushered in the Beaux-Arts style for large <b>train</b> <b>stations,</b> was built from 1896 to 1901. After a 1912–1915 enlargement, it was renamed as North Philadelphia. Despite several other renovations, its use {{declined}} in the mid and late 20th century; in 1991, Amtrak constructed a smaller replacement station across the tracks. The building was renovated once more in 1999 and is now used as commercial space. It {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places the same year.|$|E
5|$|GO Bus service {{consists}} {{of a combination of}} routes, many of which stand in for train service when it is not operating and/or which extend the reach of train service to communities beyond their termini. Other GO buses are independent of rail services, such as the Highway 407 series of routes, which provides an orbital-type service that encircles Toronto proper and makes connections between all train lines. There are also routes that serve Pearson International Airport, seasonal destinations such as Canada's Wonderland, and several colleges and universities. The vast majority of GO <b>train</b> <b>stations</b> have connecting GO bus service, of which almost all the exceptions are situated within Toronto proper. There are also 16 bus terminals served by GO buses, many of which provide local transit connections, as well as intermediate stops and ticket agencies.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna was {{combined}} {{with several other}} railroads to create the Consolidated Rail Corporation, who continued maintenance of the New Jersey and New York Line {{for the next seven}} years, until the newly formed New Jersey Transit took over the station in 1983. On March 17, 1984, the station building, now 114 years old, was added to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and by that June, the station was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The station building was restored in 2001 by contractors from Jablonski Building Conservation Incorporated in Midtown Manhattan, who had experience restoring <b>train</b> <b>stations.</b> The building conservation repainted the old station's wooden siding yellow and the bay windows to a brand new brown on the station's ground-level platform.|$|E

5|$|October 3, 2001: At {{approximately}} 4:15a.m. local time, a passenger, Damir Igric, assaulted {{the driver}} of his bus, attempting to slit his throat, and causing the bus to crash near Manchester, Tennessee, killing Igric himself and five other passengers and injuring 32 others. Since the incident occurred {{three weeks after the}} September 11 terrorist attacks, Greyhound temporarily suspended all schedules as soon as the company learned of the incident for fear that it may have been part of a larger co-ordinated attack. After investigation by the company and the FBI, it was confirmed that Igric had acted alone and service resumed later that afternoon. After the incident, Greyhound bus stations increased security, though not nearly to the same level as airports or <b>train</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|E
5|$|Overnight, {{thousands}} of protesters continued {{to defy the}} curfew and, as the night progressed, troops and armoured vehicles deployed across Cairo to guard key places such as <b>train</b> <b>stations,</b> major government buildings and banks. The army had insufficient capacity to patrol neighbourhoods, so residents set up armed vigilante groups to drive off looters and robbers. A heavy army presence (though no police) was reported in Suez. Chaos was rampant in Suez during the night, but as day broke the streets remained relatively quiet. As in Cairo, many residents formed vigilante groups to protect their homes and businesses {{in the absence of}} police. The military set up numerous checkpoints throughout the city. An estimation of about 30 bodies including the bodies of two children were taken to El Demerdash Hospital in central Cairo.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} {{mountain}} railways was conceived by the British Raj {{in order to}} establish control over the Himalayas and other mountain ranges within India. In 1844, Sir John Lawrence, Viceroy of India, embraced the idea of making the mountains more accessible, particularly to the British military. In a proposal called Hill Railway, the British planned for a system of <b>train</b> <b>stations</b> across the Indian subcontinent. The locations proposed included: Shimla, deemed the summer capital of British India; Darjeeling, located in the state of West Bengal, known for its tea gardens and scenic views; Ootacamund, located in the Nilgiri mountains of the Tamil Nadu state; and the Matheran hill station, located in the Western Ghats near Bombay (now Mumbai).|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} sets of {{greenhouses}} near the property; one set behind Law's home produced decorations for Law's Briarcliff Farms, his house, the lodge, and workers' houses. The other set, the Pierson Greenhouses, were used for growing the American Beauty rose and rare carnations, producing between 5,000 and 8,000 per week. Foreman George Romaine first propagated the Briarcliff rose there. The lodge also ran an annual American Beauty carnival, with events including a golf tournament, water sports, moonlight bathing and night diving, a dinner dance, cinema program, and a concert. During the lodge's service, carriage transportation was provided for guests from the Scarborough and Briarcliff Manor <b>train</b> <b>stations</b> to the lodge.|$|E
5|$|Two rail {{companies}} have major <b>train</b> <b>stations</b> downtown: JR Central (Central Japan Railway Company) and Meitetsu (Nagoya Railroad). The JR Tōkaidō Main Line runs through and the Takayama Line begins at JR Gifu Station. Other JR Stations {{in the city}} include Nishi Gifu Station and Nagamori Station. The JR Tōkaidō Shinkansen, however, does not run through Gifu Station; its nearest stops are Nagoya Station and Gifu Hashima Station. The Meitetsu lines include the Nagoya Line, the Kakamigahara Line, and the Takehana Line, all of which originate at Meitetsu Gifu Station. Other Meitetsu Stations in the city include Chajo Station, Kano Station, Tagami Station, Hosobata Station, Kiridoshi Station, Tejikara Station, and Yanaizu Station. Until April 1, 2005, Meitetsu also operated a streetcar line that ran through Gifu.|$|E
5|$|Anspach's {{backing of}} Suys' {{proposal}} was a calculated decision, {{as he had}} radical plans to transform the city. Anspach saw the proposal as an unexpected boon, as it allowed him to accomplish several of his goals at once. It had long been his ambition to transform the impoverished lower city into a centre of business and commerce, suitable for a modern capital (Belgium had declared its independence in 1830, with Brussels its capital). He wanted to attract the middle class, most of whom had left the dingy downtown for the cleaner suburbs, including the Leopold Quarter (now often called the European quarter) and Avenue Louise, causing a large loss in tax revenue for the city. The elimination of the numerous alleys and dead-ends in the lower town in favour of a large, straight, wide, open-air boulevard, linking the two rapidly growing <b>train</b> <b>stations,</b> seemed both a necessity {{and an opportunity to}} beautify the city and improve both traffic circulation and hygiene.|$|E

5|$|Mumbai {{suffers from}} the same major {{urbanisation}} problems seen in many fast growing cities in developing countries: widespread poverty and unemployment, poor public health and poor civic and educational standards for a large section of the population. With available land at a premium, Mumbai residents often reside in cramped, relatively expensive housing, usually far from workplaces, and therefore requiring long commutes on crowded mass transit, or clogged roadways. Many of them live {{in close proximity to}} bus or <b>train</b> <b>stations</b> although suburban residents spend significant time travelling southward to the main commercial district. Dharavi, Asia's second largest slum (if Karachi's Orangi Town is counted as a single slum) is located in central Mumbai and houses between 800,000 and one million people in , {{making it one of the}} most densely populated areas on Earth with a population density of at least 334,728 persons per square kilometre.|$|E
5|$|Newark Penn Station, {{situated}} {{just east}} of downtown, is the city's major train station. It is served by the interurban PATH train (which links Newark to Jersey City and Manhattan), three NJ Transit (NJT) commuter rail lines, and Amtrak service. It was designed by McKim, Mead & White and completed in 1935. One mile north, the Newark Broad Street Station is served by two NJT commuter rail lines. The two <b>train</b> <b>stations</b> are linked by the Newark Light Rail system, which also provides services from Newark Penn Station to Newark's northern communities and into the neighboring towns of Belleville and Bloomfield. Built {{in the bed of}} the Morris Canal, the light rail cars run underground in Newark's downtown area. The city's third train station, Newark Liberty International Airport, connects the Northeast Corridor to the airport via AirTrain Newark. Bus service in Newark is provided by New Jersey Transit, CoachUSA contract operators and DeCamp in North Newark.|$|E
5|$|Venue {{construction}} {{ran from}} spring 1990 to December 1993. All {{the competition and}} most of the non-competition venues were purpose-built for the Games. For the first time in Olympic history, environmental and sustainability issues were considered in venue construction. This resulted in five venues being modified during their design and construction phase to lessen their impact upon the environment. Among the issues considered were the venues blending into surrounding landscape, treatment of terrain with as minimal damage to natural surroundings as possible, use of environmentally-friendly materials, and environmental auditing. Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall was constructed inside a mountain that maintained a year-round temperature of , with the excavated rock used to build a beach promenade. Transport was dominated by the use of buses and trains for spectators. Downtown Lillehammer and the axis between Lillehammer and Oslo were the most congested areas, and the Norwegian State Railways ran up to 22 trains per day between Oslo and Lillehammer. All venues could be reached within walking distance from <b>train</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|E
