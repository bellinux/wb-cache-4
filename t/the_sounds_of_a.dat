5|$|These symbols {{describe}} {{the features of}} a language above the level of individual consonants and vowels, such as prosody, tone, length, and stress, which often operate on syllables, words, or phrases: that is, elements such as the intensity, pitch, and gemination of <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> language, {{as well as the}} rhythm and intonation of speech. Although most of these symbols indicate distinctions that are phonemic at the word level, symbols also exist for intonation on a level greater than that of the word. Various ligatures of tone letters are used in the IPA Handbook despite not being found on the simplified official IPA chart.|$|E

The {{music is}} written by composer Philip Glass and the libretto is written by Hwang. The opera is actually {{made up of}} two short operas: <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice and Hotel of Dreams. The opera is notable for being specifically written for the theatre and not an opera house. It had its premiere on May 24, 2003 at the American Repertory Theatre. It was directed by Robert Woodruff and featured Eugene Perry.|$|R

5|$|In the video, Candy {{is shown}} {{living with a}} cult on a farm {{populated}} by abused women and a tyrannical man. Candy and the other women are seen performing various chores around the house. The man demands that the women prepare dinner, and drags one of them outside by her hair. These opening sequences are accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> piano, the women's cooking knives, and the man's ax. The women seek vengeance against the man, removing all of their clothing, confronting him while he is chopping wood, and shooting him with golden rifles. Following the man's death, the women have dinner together while wearing latex clothing. The visual also includes scenes of Candy posing with a white horse while wearing oversized hats and holding decorated machine guns. During these scenes, Candy is shown only wearing a bodystocking, {{and in some instances}} a large chastity belt. To accommodate restrictions regarding censorship, Candy's nipples are airbrushed out of the shots.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol segment {{followed}} the performances. A tribute {{was made to}} the 20,000 volunteers {{who participated in the}} Games, with Singapore swimmer Rainer Ng making a short speech thanking the volunteers and eight other athletes presenting bouquets to eight representative volunteers. This was then followed by speeches from Ng Ser Miang, Chairman of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee, and Jacques Rogge, IOC President, with Mr. Rogge officially declaring the Games closed in accordance with tradition. The Olympic flag was then lowered with the singing of the Olympic Anthem. In the handover ceremony, the Olympic flag was handed over from Teo Ser Luck, acting as the Mayor of Singapore, through Jacques Rogge, to Ji Jianye, Mayor of Nanjing, China, the host city of the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics. The national anthem of China was then played with the raising of China's flag, and a short video presentation showcasing Nanjing followed. The Youth Olympic Flame was then finally extinguished to <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flugelhorn. A Celebration Concert marked {{the end of the show}} with songs and performances from local artistes.|$|E
5|$|Typewriter in the Sky is {{a science}} fiction novel written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard.

25|$|When {{children}} reach about 15–18 {{months of}} age, language acquisition flourishes. There is {{a surge in}} word production resulting from {{the growth of the}} cortex. Infants begin to learn the words that form a sentence and within the sentence, the word endings can be interpreted. Elissa Newport and colleagues (1999) found that humans learn first about <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> language, and then move on to how to speak the language. This shows how infants learn the end of a word and know that a new word is being spoken. From this step, infants are then able to determine the structure of a language and word.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{uploaded}} to YouTube on 6 January 2012. The video was shot in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In the video Lloyd sings about her jealousy and disappointment of her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend, with the video showing Lloyd's attempts to sabotage her former love's new relationship. As Lloyd sits on her bed scanning at pictures of her and her ex, she drifts off into various schemes to drive the new couple apart. In one scene Lloyd pours {{a bottle of water}} over her former boyfriend, while in another she throws popcorn all over the loved-up pair during a trip to the cinema. Astro makes an appearance in the video to rap in the latter stages of the video, posing as her ex-boyfriend, which ends with Lloyd rather airheadedly imitating <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> helicopter.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} script, Carruth studied physics {{to help him}} make Abe and Aaron's {{technical}} dialogue sound authentic. He took {{the unusual step of}} eschewing contrived exposition, and tried instead to portray the shorthand phrases and jargon used by working scientists. This philosophy carried over into production design. The time machine itself is a plain gray box, with a distinctive electronic [...] "hum" [...] created by overlaying <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mechanical grinder and a car engine, rather than by using a processed digital effect. Carruth also set the story in unglamorous industrial parks and suburban tract homes.|$|E

500|$|... "Lucky Star" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{recorded}} by American singer Madonna for her eponymous debut studio album (1983). It was released as the fourth single from the album on September 8, 1983 by Sire Records. [...] "Lucky Star" [...] was produced by Reggie Lucas. However, during recording, Madonna was not impressed by Lucas' version. She called her then-boyfriend John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to remix the track according to her ideas. [...] "Lucky Star" [...] is a medium-paced dance track and combines the heavy beats of a drum with <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> guitar played in a high riff. The lyrics juxtapose the male body with the heavenly stars in the sky.|$|E
500|$|The GameCube and Wii {{versions}} feature several minor {{differences in}} their controls. The Wii version of the game makes use of the motion sensors and built-in speaker of the Wii Remote.

The player controls Link's sword by swinging the Wii Remote. Other attacks are triggered using similar gestures with the Nunchuk. Unique to the GameCube version is the ability for the player to control the camera freely, without entering a special [...] "lookaround" [...] mode required by the Wii; however, in the GameCube version, only two of Link's secondary weapons can be equipped at a time, as opposed to four in the Wii version.|$|E

500|$|Cooke's musical {{arrangement}} {{follows a}} typical twelve-bar blues structure and is performed {{at a faster}} tempo than Howlin' Wolf's. [...] It has been notated as a moderate blues (92 beats per minute) in [...] time in the key of A. [...] The recording took place in Los Angeles {{with a small group}} of session musicians. [...] A young Billy Preston uses [...] "playful organ vocalizing" [...] or organ lines to imitate <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rooster crowing and, following the lyrics, dogs barking and hounds howling. Also backing Cooke are Ray Johnson on piano and Hal Blaine on drums (Barney Kessel has also been mentioned as the guitarist). The song was a hit, reaching number seven on Billboard's Hot R singles chart. [...] It was also a crossover hit and appeared at number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 pop chart. [...] "Little Red Rooster" [...] is included on Cooke's 1963 album Night Beat, which reached number 62 on the Billboard 200 album chart. [...] It also appears on several Cooke compilation albums, including , which was released in 2003.|$|E
500|$|During {{the writing}} and {{recording}} of the album, the band encountered several obstacles. Vedder has admitted that while working on the album he suffered from writer's block, which {{made it difficult for}} him to come up with lyrics. This inspired the hidden track [...] "Writer's Block" [...] - which consists of <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typewriter - that appears {{at the end of the}} album, starting at 6 minutes and 50 seconds on the track [...] "Parting Ways". Vedder had written music for several songs, including [...] "Insignificance" [...] and [...] "Grievance", but was having trouble coming up with lyrics for the songs. He decided to not write any more music, and to focus only on lyrics, even banning himself from playing guitar. Unable to write more lyrics, Vedder said he saw a ukulele and thought [...] "that's not a guitar," [...] and wrote the song [...] "Soon Forget" [...] using the ukulele. Guitarist Mike McCready went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for an addiction to prescription drugs. Gossard recalled that [...] "everyone wasn't on the same page" [...] due to McCready's absence and the familiarization with Cameron.|$|E
500|$|By {{the mid-1950s}} Britten had {{established}} himself as a major composer, both of operas and of works for mixed professional and amateur forces – his mini-opera The Little Sweep (1949) was written for young audiences, and used child performers. He had previously adapted text from the Chester play cycle in his 1952 Canticle II, which retells the story of Abraham and Isaac. Noye's Fludde was composed as a project for television; to the Chester text Britten added three congregational hymns, the Greek prayer Kyrie eleison as a children's chant, and an Alleluia chorus. A large children's chorus represents the pairs of animals who march {{into and out of the}} ark, and proceedings are directed by the spoken Voice of God. Of the solo sung roles, only the parts of Noye (Noah) and his wife were written to be sung by professionals; the remaining roles are for child and adolescent performers. A small professional ensemble underpins the mainly amateur orchestra which [...] contains numerous unconventional instruments [...] to provide particular musical effects; bugle fanfares for the animals, handbell chimes for the rainbow, and various improvisations to replicate musically <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> storm.|$|E
