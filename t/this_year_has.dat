The denomination 304 for <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>has</b> been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to his brother dated 19March 1819, Keats {{discussed}} indolence as a subject. He may have written the ode as early as March, but the themes and stanza forms suggest May or June 1819; when it is known he was working on [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn", [...] "Ode on Melancholy", [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] and [...] "Ode to Psyche". During this period, Keats's friend Charles Armitage Brown transcribed copies of the spring odes and submitted them to publisher Richard Woodhouse. Keats wrote to his friend Sarah Jeffrey: [...] "he thing I have most enjoyed <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>has</b> been writing an ode to Indolence." [...] Despite this enjoyment, however, he was not entirely satisfied with [...] "Ode on Indolence", and it remained unpublished until 1848.|$|E

People not only showed me their kindness, but more importantly, they {{demonstrated}} their {{love of the game}} of baseball. I give my thanks to baseball fans everywhere. Tonight, I {{want to make sure you}} know how I feel. As I grew up here, I not only had dreams of being a big league ballplayer, but also of being a Baltimore Oriole. For all of your support over the years, I want to thank you, the fans of Baltimore, from the bottom of my heart. This is the greatest place to play." ...|$|E

"Now, every 11-year-old knows dream {{sequences}} are {{the lowest}} form of plotting solution, lower than unexplained superpowers {{such as the}} ability to stop time or become invisible; even lower than a magic get-better potion. Within two minutes, Green Wing had destroyed itself, lost its assured grip on the cliff of comedy and tumbled into the abyss of embarrassing overacting, formless gurning and pointless repetition. What had once looked Dada-ishly brilliant now looked like stoned improv from a show-off's drama school. The lack of plot and coherent narrative that previously had been a blessed freedom was revealed to be a formless free-for-all, brilliant performances as silly mannerisms. Nothing I've seen <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>has</b> disappointed me as sharply as the second series of Green Wing. As Tom Paine so poignantly pointed out, only a step separates the sublime from the ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|James {{signed with}} the National Football League's (NFL) Detroit Lions in 1947. He was still {{eligible}} to play in college at the time, but wartime rules allowed him to skip to the professional ranks and play for the Lions, who had selected him in the 1947 NFL Draft. James broke his arm {{in the second game}} of the season, and he sat on the sidelines {{for the rest of the}} year. Detroit did not renew his contract, and the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown, picked him up. He started at right defensive halfback in 1948 opposite Tommy Colella and intercepted four passes as the Browns went 15–0 and won the All-America Football Conference championship. Brown was pleasantly surprised by his abilities on defense. [...] "Tommy always was a pretty good man on defense at Massillon and Ohio State", he said in 1948. [...] "But his play <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>has</b> even surprised those of us who knew him in high school and college. I think we're definitely improved at defensive right half over last year." ...|$|E

2500|$|The border {{regions of}} Angola, Namibia and Zambia are {{dominated}} by small rivers which flood regularly {{during the rainy season}} from December to April. [...] Floods in 2008 lasted from February to March and affected 250,000 people in Namibia with 42 people losing their lives. [...] The floods this year have primarily been caused by heavy rain; more rain has fallen on the region since December than fell in the entire five-month rainy season of last year. [...] As a result, the flooding <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>has</b> been worse than that usually experienced. [...] It has been reported that the floods could be the worst in the area for four decades. [...] The Angolan National Institute of Meteorology has placed the cause of the heavy rain with a large equatorial depression which is expected to remain over the country until April when it will start to move southwards. [...] One report has blamed the continuing heavy rain on the effects of the meteorological phenomenon La Niña.|$|E

60|$|One little event during <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>has</b> fixed itself very {{firmly in}} my mind, and I {{hope that it}} has done so from my {{conscience}} having been afterwards sorely troubled by it; it is curious as showing that apparently I was interested at this early age in the variability of plants! I told another little boy (I believe it was Leighton, who afterwards became a well-known lichenologist and botanist), that I could produce variously coloured polyanthuses and primroses by watering them with certain coloured fluids, which was of course a monstrous fable, and had never been tried by me. I may here also confess that {{as a little boy}} I was much given to inventing deliberate falsehoods, and this was always done for the sake of causing excitement. For instance, I once gathered much valuable fruit from my father's trees and hid it in the shrubbery, and then ran in breathless haste to spread the news that I had discovered a hoard of stolen fruit.|$|E

There is no light upon Friedrich to tempt us; better light than Bielfeld's there could have been, and much of it: but he prudently, as well as proudly, forbore such topics.
