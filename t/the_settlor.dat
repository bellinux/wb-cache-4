5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E
5|$|Trusts {{where the}} {{doctrine}} is applicable {{are divided into}} two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, {{since there is no}} question of allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds should be subject to cy-près or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of <b>the</b> <b>settlor,</b> something determined on the facts of each individual case.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. The trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> to the trustees.|$|E

25|$|No {{declaration}} of trust is the most straightforward form of resulting trust, and is created when a trust is created, but <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> does not give the form in which the property is to be held. For example, <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> might give property to the beneficiary to hold for life, but fail to explain what is {{to happen to the}} property when the holder dies. When this occurs, the property is held on resulting trust for <b>the</b> <b>settlor,</b> as in Vandervell v IRC. This also occurs where a trust is formed over property which requires formality, but is improperly created (for example, a land transfer that does not adhere to the Law of Property Act 1925).|$|E
25|$|A {{discretionary}} trust in Canadian and English trusts {{law is a}} trust where the beneficiaries and/or their entitlements to the trust fund are not fixed, but {{are determined by the}} criteria set out in the trust instrument by <b>the</b> <b>settlor.</b> It is sometimes referred to as a family trust in Australia or New Zealand. Where the {{discretionary trust}} is a testamentary trust, it is common for <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> to leave a letter of wishes for the trustees to guide them as to the settlor's wishes in the exercise of their discretion. Letters of wishes are not legally binding documents.|$|E
25|$|The trustee's {{right to}} do this, where it exists, is called a power of {{appointment}}. Sometimes, a power of appointment is given to someone other than the trustee, such as <b>the</b> <b>settlor,</b> the protector, or a beneficiary.|$|E

5000|$|The UTC provides, in part, that [...] "if a {{particular}} charitable purpose becomes unlawful, impracticable, impossible to achieve, or wasteful...the court may apply cy-près to modify or terminate the trust...in {{a manner consistent with}} <b>the</b> <b>settlor’s</b> charitable purposes".|$|R

25|$|Hybrid trust: A hybrid trust {{combines}} {{elements of}} both fixed and discretionary trusts. In a hybrid trust, the trustee must pay {{a certain amount of}} the trust property to each beneficiary fixed by <b>the</b> <b>settlor.</b> But the trustee has discretion as to how any remaining trust property, once these fixed amounts have been paid out, is to be paid to the beneficiaries.|$|E
25|$|Resulting trust: A {{resulting}} trust {{is a form}} of implied trust which occurs where (1) a trust fails, wholly or in part, as a result of which <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> becomes entitled to the assets; or (2) a voluntary payment is made by A to B in circumstances which do not suggest gifting. B becomes the {{resulting trust}}ee of A's payment.|$|E
25|$|Revocable trust: A {{trust of}} this kind may be amended, altered or revoked by its settlor at any time, {{provided}} <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> is not mentally incapacitated. Revocable trusts are becoming increasingly common in the US {{as a substitute for}} a will to minimize administrative costs associated with probate and to provide centralized administration of a person's final affairs after death.|$|E
25|$|Testamentary trust (or Will Trust): A trust {{created in}} an individual's will {{is called a}} {{testamentary}} trust. Because a will can become effective only upon death, a testamentary trust is generally created at or following the date of <b>the</b> <b>settlor's</b> death.|$|R
5000|$|... is an English trusts law case, {{concerning}} {{the circumstances under}} which a trust will be held to be uncertain. It followed on from McPhail v Doulton, where the House of Lords affirmed that upholding <b>the</b> <b>settlor's</b> intentions was of paramount importance.|$|R
50|$|A trust can be {{intentionally}} {{created during}} <b>the</b> <b>settlor's</b> life (inter Vivos) by declaration or transfer. A deceased estate is a testamentary trust which automatically arises {{on the death of}} the testator. Courts may also create trusts, such as constructive trusts, as an equitable remedy.|$|R
25|$|An owner placing {{property}} into trust {{turns over}} {{part of his}} or her bundle of rights to the trustee, separating the property's legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits. This may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> is absent, incapacitated, or deceased. Testamentary trusts may be created in wills, defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries.|$|E
25|$|The {{beneficiaries}} are beneficial (or equitable) {{owners of}} the trust property. Either immediately or eventually, the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property, or they will receive the property itself. The extent of a beneficiary's interest depends on {{the wording of the}} trust document. One beneficiary may be entitled to income (for example, interest from a bank account), whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when he attains the age of twenty-five years. <b>The</b> <b>settlor</b> has much discretion when creating the trust, subject to some limitations imposed by law.|$|E
25|$|Express trusts {{are those}} {{expressly}} declared by <b>the</b> <b>settlor.</b> Typically, {{this will be}} intended to create a trust, but there can be situations in which the settlor's intended actions create a trust accidentally, as in Paul v Constance. The creation of express trusts must involve four elements for the trust to be valid. These are capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity refers to the donor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. These are that the trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> to the trustees. For chattels, this can simply be handing the property to them, while transfers of land and shares must be done in writing following certain prescribed forms.|$|E

However, due to the paucity of credible offshore banks in Belize, many trusts established in Belize hold assets with a second trustee or third-party financial institution in another country.|$|R
2500|$|Resulting trusts {{work on a}} {{principle}} of [...] "common intention". This {{is the idea that}} a resulting trust is a mix of <b>the</b> <b>settlor's</b> intention, and <b>the</b> trustee's knowledge that he is not intended to be the beneficiary. In Carreras Rothmans Ltd v Freeman Mathews Treasure Ltd, Gibson J expressed the principle as: ...|$|R
5000|$|Most asset {{protection}} trusts established by U.S. settlors are considered [...] "grantor trusts" [...] under U.S. income tax law, meaning that all {{income of the}} trust is reportable on the grantor's (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>settlor's)</b> individual income tax return. Asset-protection trusts do not, in and of themselves, offer any tax advantages under U.S. income tax law.|$|R
25|$|Trusts may {{be created}} by the {{expressed}} intentions of <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> (express trusts) or they may {{be created by}} operation of law known as implied trusts. An implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties. Implied trusts are divided into two categories: resulting and constructive. A resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties, but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent. A constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties, regardless of their intentions.|$|E
25|$|A {{resulting}} trust {{will also be}} found where the purposes of a trust have been completed, but there is excess property left over; for example, a trust by a settlor to provide for his children's university education. Judges and academics disagree over what should happen to the property; possibilities are {{that it should be}} held for the donors, that it should be held for the beneficiaries (as the donors intended to make an irrevocable gift) or that it should be given to the Crown as bona vacantia. A fourth suggestion is that the trustees take the surplus, as in Re Foord. The general rule was set out in Re Trusts of the Abbot Fund, where it was decided that excess funds will be held on {{resulting trust}} for <b>the</b> <b>settlor.</b> There are exceptions to this rule; the general rule is put aside if the court can find intention to benefit specific individuals, as in Re Osoba.|$|E
500|$|For {{an express}} trust to be valid, the trust {{instrument}} must show certainty of intention, {{subject matter and}} object. Certainty of intention means {{that it must be}} clear that <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> or testator wishes to create a trust; this is not dependent on any particular language used, and a trust can be created without the word [...] "trust" [...] being used, or even <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> knowing he is creating a trust. Since the 1950s, the courts have been more willing to conclude that there was intention to create a trust, rather than hold that the trust is void. Certainty of subject matter means that it must be clear what property is part of the trust. Historically the property must have been segregated from non-trust property; more recently, the courts have drawn a line between tangible and intangible assets, holding that with intangible assets there is not always a need for segregation. Certainty of objects means that it must be clear who the beneficiaries, or objects, are. The test for determining this differs {{depending on the type of}} trust; it can be that all beneficiaries must be individually identified, or that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, if a claimant comes before them, whether he is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the concept}} of a {{protector}} developed in offshore jurisdictions where settlors were (perhaps understandably) concerned about appointing a trust company in a small, distant country as sole trustee of an offshore trust which is to hold a great deal of <b>the</b> <b>settlor's</b> wealth. However, protectors now form a part of mainstream tax planning in most jurisdictions which recognise trusts.|$|R
40|$|Considers the {{discretion}} of the trustees to disclose <b>the</b> <b>settlor's</b> wishes to <b>the</b> beneficiaries of a family discretionary trust. Discusses the confidentiality principle relating to family discretionary trusts and whether a settlor's wish letter falls within the scope of that principle. Sets out the guidance of the court in Breakspear v Ackland for trustees faced with a request for disclosure from a beneficiary...|$|R
500|$|Cases {{of initial}} failure are where, {{rather than an}} {{established}} charitable trust failing, a gift has failed {{at the moment of}} its creation by having an invalid purpose. This raises different questions, as {{it is a matter of}} deciding [...] "has the original charitable gift failed, and, if it has, can the money be applied cy-près or must it go on resulting trust to <b>the</b> <b>settlor's</b> estate"? ...|$|R
500|$|If {{property}} has {{not been}} transferred, the potential trustees and beneficiaries are volunteers, and an equitable maxim is that [...] "equity will not assist a volunteer"; the courts will {{not look at the}} case. To get around this, the courts have developed exceptions to this rule for situations when <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> has done [...] "all that he could do", the trustees or beneficiaries have acquired the property in a different way, or where the gift was made donatio mortis causa. Formality refers to the specific language or forms used when transferring property. For chattels, no formal language or documentation is needed, unless it is made as a will. For land, the transfer must be drafted in line with the Law of Property Act 1925 and the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989. When disposing of an equitable interest, the Law of Property Act 1925 must also be followed; much of the case law in this area has centred on the meaning of [...] "dispose", with many cases involving people attempting to avoid tax.|$|E
500|$|Discretionary trusts are trusts {{which require}} that the {{trustees}} exercise their powers, {{in the same way}} as a fixed trust, but allow some discretion in how to do so, in a similar manner to mere powers. Since trustees hold the discretionary power to choose how to act under an established boundary set out by <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> of a trust, evidential certainty is not relevant and does not affect discretionary trusts anyway. The leading test of certainty of objects here is also the [...] "any given postulant test", applied to discretionary trusts in McPhail v Doulton. The courts attempted to mitigate this test in Re Baden’s Deed Trusts (no 2); however, all three judges of the Court of Appeal gave separate reasons. Stamp LJ had an approach based entirely on the facts, with no greater impact on certainty of objects. Sachs LJ took the approach that the burden of proof was on the claimants to prove they were beneficiaries, not on the trustees to prove the trust was valid. Megaw LJ, however, took the approach that a trust could be valid, even with uncertain beneficiaries, if there was a [...] "core number" [...] of beneficiaries who were certain. Megaw LJ's stand reflects the current position. Otherwise, trusts would have been failed if there is one individual who cannot be said to be the [...] "given postulant".|$|E
500|$|The trust {{must then}} be {{formally}} constituted, by {{the transfer of}} its property to the trustees. For chattels, merely handing the property to the trustees is sufficient, assuming it comes with the relevant intention to create a trust. In some circumstances, providing the intention and telling the trustees {{where to find the}} property is sufficient, as in Thomas v Times Books. Where the property is land or an equitable interest in land, it must be transferred by writing in accordance with Sections 52-3 of the Law of Property Act 1925. When dealing with shares, the transfer is not complete until a transfer document has been completed and the company has entered the change of ownership in its books. One of the equitable maxims is that [...] "equity will not assist a volunteer"; if someone does not have an interest in property, they cannot bring a court case. When trusts are not properly constituted, the trustees and beneficiaries have no equitable interest in the property, and so are volunteers. There are several exceptions to this maxim. The courts are willing to hear cases where the transfer was not completed, providing the intended beneficiaries or trustees have gained an interest through being made executor of the settlor's estate (the rule in Strong v Bird), or the gift was given donatio mortis causa, or where <b>the</b> <b>settlor</b> did all he could do, as in Re Rose, or where it would be [...] "unconscionable" [...] to hold the gift invalid, as in Pennington v Waine.|$|E
500|$|Trusts {{must also}} be for [...] "public benefit", which was {{considered}} at length in Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities Trust. A fund was created to benefit children of employees and former employees of British American Tobacco, which was a large number; {{the total number of}} employees was over 110,000. The House of Lords found that size was not the issue; the group did not count as a section of the public because of the [...] "personal nexus", or common relationship, between <b>the</b> <b>settlors</b> (British American Tobacco) and the beneficiaries. The nature of charitable trusts means that the definition of [...] "public benefit" [...] varies between Macnaghten's four categories.|$|R
50|$|Certain jurisdictions (notably the Cook Islands, but the Bahamas {{also has}} a species of asset {{protection}} trust) have provided special trusts which are styled as asset protection trusts. Whilst all trusts have an asset protection element, some jurisdictions have enacted laws trying to make life difficult for creditors to press claims against the trust (for example, by providing for particularly short limitation periods). In practice, the effectiveness of such trusts is limited as the bankruptcy and/or divorce laws in <b>the</b> <b>settlor's</b> home jurisdiction will usually operate to set aside transfers to the trusts, and most jurisdictions (including offshore jurisdictions) set aside transactions entered into defraud creditors.|$|R
