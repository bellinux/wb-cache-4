40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{advertisements}} have objectified and sexualized women as a tactic to attract men into supporting causes and buying products. This research project focuses on the advertisements published by the animal rights group, PETA, People for <b>the</b> <b>Ethical</b> <b>Treatments</b> <b>of</b> Animals, and its deliberate use of degrading images of women to support its cause. PETA advertisements juxtapose barely clad women with animals or animal references, making the viewer see women as animalistic, out of control, {{and in need of}} taming or saving. Research shows that the results of such negative advertising tactics are correlated with increased aggression in male viewers, as well as increased acceptance of rape attitudes among men. Sexualized and objectified images take away from the purpose of the animal rights movement, making the audience reluctant to support the cause. Furthermore, these advertisements seriously jeopardize and undermine the women 2 ̆ 7 s fight for equality in our culture. [URL]...|$|R

While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties.

It forbade the use of poisons, stating that use of such puts any force who uses them entirely outside the pale of the civilized nations and peoples; it forbade the use of torture to extract confessions; it described the rights and duties of prisoners of war and of capturing forces. It described the state of war, the state of occupied territories, and the ends of war, and discusses permissible and impermissible means to attain those ends; it discussed the nature of states and sovereignties, and insurrections, rebellions, and wars. As such, it is widely considered to be the first written recital of the customary law of war, in force between the civilized nations and peoples since time immemorial, and the precursor to the Hague Regulations of 1907, the treaty-based restatement of the customary law of war.|$|R

As quality of care declined and psychotropic drugs were introduced, those with mental illnesses were reintroduced to the community, where community mental health services were designated as primary care providers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if various convenient and cost affordable body composition techniques correlate well with more expensive “gold standard ” instruments for measuring body composition in female collegiate athletes. Methods: Thirty-two Division I track and field and basketball female athletes participated in the study. The host university’s Institutional Review Board approved <b>the</b> protocols towards <b>ethical</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> all subjects before the study commenced. Within one hour, each subject underwent body composition assessments via air displacement plethysmography (ADP), skinfold (SF) measurements, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Results: No significant differences were found between basketball and track athletes thus data was normalized. No significant difference in calculated percent body fat was noted between ADP and SF (p =. 002), but there was a significant difference between ADP and BIA (p =. 478). Per Pearson correlations, moderate correlations existed between body fat percentages obtained by ADP and SF (r =. 689) as well as between body fat percentages estimated by ADP and BIA (r =. 447). Conclusions: Results indicate the SF technique had the highest correlation when compared to the BOD POD®.

500|$|Facundo - Civilización y Barbarie - Vida de Juan Facundo Quiroga, 1845. Written {{during his}} long exile in Chile. Originally {{published}} in 1845 in Chile in installments in El Progreso newspaper, Facundo is Sarmiento's most famous work. [...] It {{was first published}} in book form in 1851, and the first English translation, by Mary Mann, appeared in 1868. [...] A recent modern edition in English was translated by Kathleen Ross. Facundo promotes further civilization and European influence on Argentine culture through the use of anecdotes and references to Juan Facundo Quiroga, Argentine caudillo general. As well as being a call to progress, Sarmiento discusses the nature of Argentine peoples as well as including his thoughts and objections to Juan Manuel de Rosas, governor of Buenos Aires from 1829 to 1832 and again from 1835, due to the turmoil generated by Facundo's death, to 1852. As literary critic Sylvia Molloy observes, Sarmiento claimed that this book helped explain Argentine struggles to European readers, and was cited in European publications. Written with extensive assistance from others, Sarmiento adds to his own memory the quotes, accounts, and dossiers from other historians and companions of Facundo Quiroga. Facundo maintains its relevance in modern-day as well, bringing attention to the contrast of lifestyles in Latin America, the conflict and struggle for progress while maintaining tradition, as well as <b>the</b> moral and <b>ethical</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public by government officials and regimes.|$|R
