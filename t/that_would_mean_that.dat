5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars {{for more than}} a century concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional. If the latter, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west. The matter was first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.|$|E
25|$|Could the {{woodland}} {{have survived}} {{this level of}} industrial use? The two resources that the Romans needed were ironstone and fuel. With both available on one site, this would make it an attractive location, but to ensure continuity of fuel supply, it would seem most likely that they encouraged re-growth through a coppice-style system. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> there was continuity of woodland trees and habitats throughout and after the Roman period, and possibly since the ice receded.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most Senate Presidents {{that are}} the {{symbolic}} presiding officers of the upper house, the Senate President of the Philippines wields considerate power by influencing the legislative agenda and {{has the ability to}} vote not just in order to break ties, although the Senate President is traditionally the last senator to vote. A tied vote, therefore, means that the motion is lost, and that the Senate President cannot cast a tie-breaking vote since <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the presiding officer would have had voted twice.|$|E
50|$|According to a {{strictly}} geological definition, a small region {{south of the}} Main near Wertheim and another south of Gemünden can be {{considered part of the}} Spessart. <b>That</b> definition <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> part of the Spessart lies in the state of Baden-Württemberg.|$|R

Merlin was an Ancient, {{fleeing from}} Atlantis and later Ascends, then comes back in order build the Sangraal, or Holy Grail, to defeat the Ori.

25|$|The Forum of National Parties, an {{association}} of 12 moderate Islamist parties, said it rejected the proposed election law because it encouraged voting along tribal lines and gave undue influence to the wealthy. According to Wasila al-Ashiq, head {{of one of the}} parties represented in the organization, candidates would have to run as independents under the proposed law because Libya has no law regulating political parties. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> those candidates capable of drawing on tribal power and affiliation would win the seats, she said, while minorities such as the Berbers would be ignored.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} have linked the Nine Mothers of Heimdallr with the Nine Daughters of Ægir (whose parentage and names combined imply waves), an identification <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Heimdallr was thus born from {{the waves of}} the sea. However, this connection has been questioned {{on the grounds that}} the names presented for the Nine Daughters of Ægir (whose names point to waves) and the Nine Mothers of Heimdallr (as found in Völuspá hin skamma) do not match. Scholar John Lindow comments that the identification of Heimdallr's mothers as Ægir's daughters do, however, match on the grounds that Ægir's daughters, like Heimdallr's mothers, are sisters, and that two separate traditions about Heimdallr's mothers may explain the differences between the two.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Rome, fellatio was {{considered}} profoundly taboo. Sexual acts were generally {{seen through the}} prism of submission and control. This is apparent in the two Latin words for the act: irrumare (to penetrate orally), and fellare (to be penetrated orally). Under this system, it {{was considered}} to be abhorrent for a male to perform fellatio, since <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> he was penetrated (controlled), whereas receiving fellatio from a woman or another man of lower social status (such as a slave or debtor) was not humiliating. The Romans regarded oral sex as being far more shameful than, for example, anal sex – known practitioners were supposed to have foul breath and were often unwelcome as guests at a dinner table.|$|E

50|$|On August 1, 2008, the Fifth Circuit denied Texas's {{request to}} re-hear the case en banc. The refusal created a split between federal circuits: the 5th Circuit {{overturned}} the Texas {{law and the}} 11th Circuit upheld a nearly identical Alabama law. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> usually <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the United States Supreme Court would grant a writ of certiorari and rule in order to clear up the disagreement between the two circuits.|$|R
50|$|The {{study of}} landforms and the {{evolution}} of the Earth's surface can be dated back to scholars of Classical Greece. Herodotus argued from observations of soils that the Nile delta was actively growing into the Mediterranean Sea, and estimated its age. Aristotle speculated that due to sediment transport into the sea, eventually those seas would fill while the land lowered. He claimed <b>that</b> this <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> land and water <b>would</b> eventually swap places, whereupon the process would begin again in an endless cycle.|$|R
25|$|First of all, {{the law of}} the pursuer only {{applies to}} a {{spontaneous}} act, whereas Yigal Amir planned this assassination for two years. Secondly, {{the law of the}} pursuer is only intended to save a potential victim from imminent death. There is absolutely no proof that withdrawing from certain territories will directly lead to the death of any Jews. On the contrary, Prime Minister Rabin, over half the members of the Knesset, and over half the population of Israel believe exactly the opposite—that it will save Jewish lives. Lastly, this law does not refer to elected representatives, for if Yitzhak Rabin was really a pursuer, then so are all his followers and <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Amir should have killed over half the population of Israel! In other words, even according to the law of the pursuer, this act was totally futile and senseless since the peace process will continue.|$|E
500|$|Æthelred's descent is unknown. Richard Abels {{describes}} him as [...] "somewhat of {{a mysterious}} character", {{who may have}} claimed royal blood and been related to King Alfred's father-in-law, Ealdorman Æthelred Mucel. In the view of Ian Walker: [...] "He was a royal ealdorman whose power base lay in the south-west of Mercia in the former kingdom of the Hwicce around Gloucester". Alex Woolf suggests that he was probably the son of King Burgred of Mercia and King Alfred's sister Æthelswith, although <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the marriage between Æthelflæd and Æthelred was uncanonical, because Rome then forbade marriage between first cousins.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{title of the}} song was [...] "Dime Store", which originates from the line [...] "In the dime stores and bus stations..." [...] The official title [...] "Love Minus Zero/No Limit" [...] is, according to Dylan, a fraction with [...] "Love Minus Zero" [...] {{on the top and}} [...] "No" [...] on the bottom, and this is how the title appeared on early pressings of the Bringing It All Back Home LP. Therefore, the correct pronunciation of the song's title is [...] "Love Minus Zero over No Limit". This has been interpreted as [...] "absolutely unlimited love." [...] The title is also based on gambling terminology <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> all love is a risk.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} was {{to funnel}} assaulting forces into attacking {{a very narrow}} front and focusing all of the castle's defences in <b>that</b> area.

60|$|The {{chances of}} Kay's in the inter-house Football Competition were not thought {{very much of}} by their rivals. Of late years {{each of the other}} houses had prayed to draw Kay's for the first round, it being a {{certainty}} <b>that</b> this <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> they got at least into the second round, and so a step nearer the cup. Nobody, however weak compared to Blackburn's, which was at the moment the crack football house, ever doubted the result of a match with Kay's. It was looked on as a sort of gentle trial trip.|$|R
2500|$|Later Tolkien hesitated {{about the}} true {{identity}} of [...] "Trotter" [...] {{for a long}} time. One of his notes suggested that the Rangers should not be hobbits as originally planned, and <b>that</b> this <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Trotter was either a man, or a hobbit who associated himself with the Rangers and was [...] "very well known" [...] (within the story). The latter suggestion was linked to an early comment of Bingo: [...] "I keep on feeling that I have seen him somewhere before". Tolkien considered that Trotter might be Bilbo Baggins himself, but soon rejected that idea after Aragorn identified himself.|$|R

If you do not hear from me on 10 March, it would mean that I would have a seat on the plane to return to South Africa and would arrive home on 11 March.

500|$|Augustus {{was granted}} sole imperium {{within the city}} of Rome itself, in {{addition}} to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular [...] "imperium" [...] when they crossed the Pomerium – the sacred boundary of Rome – and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that,</b> {{when he was in the}} city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or auctoritas, his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.|$|E
500|$|Æthelred's descent is unknown, and he {{does not}} appear to have been closely related to his {{immediate}} predecessors, although his name suggests possible descent from earlier Mercian kings. He may have been related to King Alfred's Mercian father-in-law, Æthelred Mucel, and brother-in-law, Æthelwulf, who appears to have been a member of Æthelred's court from the mid 880s. Æthelred may have been the man of the same name who attested two Mercian charters in the late 860s, but he is not listed in the two surviving charters of Ceolwulf. Lists of witnesses to charters show that Æthelred's witan (council) shared bishops and at least two ealdormen with Ceolwulf, but Ceolwulf's thegns all disappeared. In the view of Ian Walker: [...] "He was a royal ealdorman whose power base lay in the south-west of Mercia in the former kingdom of the Hwicce around Gloucester." [...] However, Alex Woolf suggests that he was probably the son of King Burgred of Mercia and Æthelswith, sister of Alfred the Great, although <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> Æthelred's marriage was uncanonical, as Rome then forbade marriage between first cousins.|$|E

500|$|Production of Crash Bandicoot: Warped {{began on}} January 1998, with Naughty Dog given only ten {{and a half}} months and a budget of 2.2 million to {{complete}} the game. Crash Bandicoot - Time Line ] |publisher=Naughty Dog |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }} Programmers Andy Gavin, Stephen White and Greg Omi created three new gameplay engines for the game. Two of the three new engines were three-dimensional in nature and were created for the airplane and jet-ski levels; the third new engine was created for the motorcycle levels in the style of a driving simulator. The new engines combined make up a third of the game, while the other two-thirds of the game consist of the same engine used in the previous games. Jason Rubin explained that the [...] "classic" [...] engine and game style was preserved due {{to the success of the}} previous two games and went on to say that [...] "were we to abandon that style of gameplay, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> we would be abandoning a significant proportion of gamers out there." [...] An arbitrary plane z-buffer was created for the jet-ski and flooded Egyptian hallway levels of the game. To create a completely fluid feel for the water on these levels, an environment map that reflects the sky was fitted onto the surface of the water. A real shadow was given to the Crash character at the request of the Sony Computer Entertainment America producers, who were [...] "sick of that little discus that's following him around." [...] To create an [...] "arcade" [...] experience in the airplane levels and to differentiate them from flight simulators, the enemy planes were programmed to come out in front of the player and give the player ample time to shoot them before they turn around and shoot the player rather than come up behind the player and hit them from behind. The Relic system was introduced to give players a reason to return to the game after it has been completed.|$|E
