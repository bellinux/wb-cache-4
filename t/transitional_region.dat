The caldera is in a <b>transitional</b> <b>region</b> between thick and thin lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma. It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic sedimentary rock (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and metamorphic rock.|$|E
5|$|Hominid {{takes place}} several {{million years ago}} in the Central African <b>transitional</b> <b>region</b> between {{rainforest}} and savanna. The main characters are Australopithecus afarenses, an extinct, mostly tree-dwelling hominid that existed before the use of tools and fire. The story is told through first-person narration by the protagonist, Pitar. In deliberating his social and natural environment, Pitar decides to lead his band to civilization: “Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness, to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on.” His linguistic capacity, thoughts and speech correspond to those of modern man, and he also is knowledgeable about history, politics, philosophy and literature. Intermittent comments made by Pitar concerning a particular prospect or artifact that has not been invented or developed yet add to the humor of the grotesque scenario. Pitar's close friends are Carpediem, who enunciates Latin phrases and quotes the writers of Classical Antiquity, and Lao, who frequently refers to Chinese philosophy.|$|E
25|$|The {{relief of}} Bulgaria is varied. In the {{relatively}} small territory of the country there are extensive lowlands, plains, hills, low and high mountains, many valleys and deep gorges. The main characteristic of Bulgaria's topography is four alternating bands {{of high and low}} terrain that extend east to west across the country. From north to south, those bands, called geomorphological regions, are the Danubian Plain, the Balkan Mountains, the <b>Transitional</b> <b>region</b> and the Rilo-Rhodope region. The easternmost sections near the Black Sea are hilly, but they gradually gain height to the west until the westernmost part of the country is entirely high ground.|$|E

25|$|Amphibians possess {{two types}} of glands, mucous and {{granular}} (serous). Both of these glands {{are part of the}} integument and thus considered cutaneous. Mucous and granular glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the intercalary region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via keratinocytes and passes through {{to the surface of the}} epidermal or outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or base region of the granular gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the intercalary system which can be summed up as a <b>transitional</b> <b>region</b> connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal skin layer. In general, granular glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.|$|E

Persian had been introduced by Central Asian Turkic invaders who migrated into South Asia, and had been patronised by the Turko-Afghan Delhi Sultanate. This language change was designed to institute a universal language throughout the then British Raj in South Asia as well as minimize the influence that Persia, the Ottoman Empire and Afghanistan had on this <b>transitional</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The growth cones are {{continually}} being built up through {{construction of the}} actin microfilaments and extension of the plasma membrane via vesicle fusion. The actin filaments depolymerize and disassemble on the proximal end to allow free monomers to migrate to the leading edge (distal end) of the actin filament where it can polymerize and thus reattach. Actin filaments are also constantly being transported away from the leading edge by a myosin-motor driven process known as retrograde F-actin flow. [...] The actin filaments are polymerized in the peripheral region and then transported backward to the <b>transitional</b> <b>region,</b> where the filaments are depolymerized; thus freeing the monomers to repeat the cycle. [...] This is different from actin treadmilling since the entire protein moves. [...] If the protein were to simply treadmill, the monomers would depolymerize from one end and polymerize onto the other while the protein itself does not move.|$|E

Living organisms were collected from two layers between the surface and 1, 500 m between latitudes of 11 and 44 °N, and they were exposed aboard ship to various pCO 2 up to about 98, 000 µatm. Mortality of copepods from both shallow and deep layers in subarctic to subtropical regions increased with increasing pCO 2 and exposure time. Deep-living copepods showed higher tolerance to pCO 2 than shallow-living copepods.
