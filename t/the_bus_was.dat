5|$|December 18, 1990: A Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago {{and became}} entrenched in a driving {{snowstorm}} on I-80. Just {{short of the}} Wyoming border, <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> hit by a semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading the opposite direction. The force of the collision tipped the bus onto its right side and steered it down a steep embankment. The bus slid for 150 feet and came to rest against a fence, about 35 feet below the eastbound lanes of I-80. 7 passengers were killed and more than 40 injured.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in sharp contrast to the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{handover}} {{occurred during}} the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, when Mayor of London Boris Johnson received the Paralympic Flag from Mayor of Beijing Guo Jinlong. This {{was followed by a}} cultural presentation by Britain, which was similar to its presentation during the Olympics' closing ceremony. It featured urban dance group ZooNation, the Royal Ballet, and Candoco, a physically integrated dance group, all dressed as London commuters and waiting for a bus by a zebra crossing. A double-decker bus drove around the stadium, guided by Ade Adepitan, to music composed by Philip Sheppard. The top of <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> open and folded down to show a privet hedge featuring London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, The Gherkin and the London Eye. Cherisse Osei, drummer for Mika, and Sam Hegedus then performed, before the top of the bus folded up into its original form, sporting multi-coloured Paralympic livery. Both the Paralympic and Olympic flags were formally raised outside of London's City Hall on 26 September 2008. British Paralympians Helene Raynsford and Chris Holmes raised the Paralympic flag.|$|E

25|$|The Second Bank of the United States was America's central bank, {{comparable}} to the Bank of England and the Bank of France, with one key distinction – the United States government owned one-fifth (20%) of its capital.

25|$|Under Biddle's guidance, the BUS {{evolved into}} a {{powerful}} banking institution that produced a strong and sound system of national credit and currency. From 1823 to 1833, Biddle expanded credit steadily, but with restraint, {{in a manner that}} served the needs of the expanding American economy.

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigation}} found that, while {{the bus driver}} was not aware that a portion of <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> on the tracks as she should have been, the timing of signals was so insufficient that, {{even if she had}} identified the hazard as the train approached, she would have had to proceed against a red traffic signal into the highway intersection to have moved out of the train's path.|$|E

40|$|Introduction <b>The</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{most popular}} {{communication}} pathway {{among the various}} components of a computer system. The distinguishing feature of <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> that it consists of a single set of shared communication links to which many components can <b>be</b> attached. <b>The</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> not only a very cost effective means of connecting various components together but is also very versatile in that new components can be added easily. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> has a broadcasting capability which can be extremely useful. The downside of the shared communication links is that they allow only one communication to occur {{at a time and}} the bandwidth does not scale with the number of components attached. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> very popular because there are many situations where several components need to be connected together but they need not all transmit at the same time. This kind of requirement maps naturally onto a bus, allowing a very cost effective solution. However, there are ca...|$|R

25|$|In 1900, Montgomery {{had passed}} a city {{ordinance}} to segregate bus passengers by race. Conductors were empowered to assign seats {{to achieve that}} goal.

Over time and by custom, however, Montgomery bus drivers adopted the practice of requiring black riders to move when there were no white-only seats left.|$|E
50|$|Note: When the {{electrical}} signal reaches {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> <b>the</b> signal <b>is</b> reflected back down the line, causing unwanted interference.
