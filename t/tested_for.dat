5|$|Many European {{models were}} <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> Helga Brandt {{including}} German actress Eva Renzi who {{passed on the}} film, with German actress Karin Dor being cast.

5|$|NHCs {{are widely}} used as {{ancillary}} ligand in organometallic chemistry. One practical application is the ruthenium-based Grubbs' catalyst and NHC-Palladium Complexes for cross-coupling reactions. NHC-metal complexes, specifically Ag(I)-NHC complexes have been widely <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> their biological applications.|$|E
5|$|Niobium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role.

5|$|Rubidium was <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> the {{influence}} on manic depression and depression.

5|$|Three azo- and azoxyformamides {{compounds}} {{have been}} isolated and identified from the puffball and <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> {{their ability to}} inhibit the growth of plants: 4-methoxybenzene-1-ONN-azoxyformamide, 4-methoxybenzene-1-azoformamide, and 4-hydroxybenzene-1-azoformamide. Only the first compound was significantly inhibitory, suggesting {{that the presence of}} the azoxy moiety is required for growth inhibition.|$|E
5|$|A key {{step in the}} {{majority}} of GWA studies is the imputation of genotypes at SNPs not on the genotype chip used in the study. This process greatly increases the number of SNPs that can be <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> association, increases the power of the study, and facilitates meta-analysis of GWAS across distinct cohorts. Genotype imputation is carried out by statistical methods that combine the GWAS data together with a reference panel of haplotypes. These methods take advantage of sharing of haplotypes between individuals over short stretches of sequence to impute alleles. Existing software packages for genotype imputation include IMPUTE2 and MaCH.|$|E

5|$|Although IFA {{can be used}} {{to confirm}} {{infection}} in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used. In general, a second specimen should be collected more than a month later and retested for persons with indeterminate western blot results. Although much less commonly available, nucleic acid testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations. In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen. In these situations, a second specimen is collected and <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> HIV infection.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells {{synthesise}} a {{wide range}} of chemicals with potential medicinal properties. They contain at least 15 biologically active compounds that may provide them with protection against insects and animals. Certain extracts – water-soluble alkaloids – are similar to compounds <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> use in combating HIV and cancer. The bulbs of bluebells are used in folk medicine as a remedy for leucorrhoea, and as a diuretic or styptic, while the sap can be used as an adhesive.|$|E
5|$|CSF can be <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E

50|$|Innogenetics {{was founded}} on 18 July 1985, by Erik Tambuyzer, Hugo Van Heuverswyn and Rudi Mariën.

In 1995, the first commercial Alzheimer's disease research <b>test</b> <b>for</b> hTau was launched (INNOTEST hTau Ag). In 1998, the company launched the first commercial Alzheimer's disease research <b>test</b> <b>for</b> β-Amyloid and in 2002 the first commercial <b>test</b> <b>for</b> Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotyping (INNO-LiPA HBV Genotyping).|$|R
5|$|Data on Kepler-40 was {{analyzed}} {{by a team}} of French and Swiss astronomers, who first <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> false positives. When all obvious false positives were cleared, the science team used the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France to gather radial velocity measurements on the star. Collected data was then checked to see if it corresponded with that of a closely orbiting binary star or that of a planet; it was found to be that of a planet, leading to the confirmation of Kepler-40b.|$|E
5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E
