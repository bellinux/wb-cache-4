The calculation principle and method of material’s cross section area is deduced in the thesis, and mechanical analysis of the <b>trough</b> <b>roller</b> is carried out based on that, in results, the static load of it is calculated. The finite element model of the <b>trough</b> <b>roller</b> is set up by Simulation /Works software, and then the stress and deformation results of it is clear through finite element statics calculation and analysis. Based on this thesis, some valuable basis and reference are offered to trough roller’s strength and stiffness design...|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a conveyor machine with conveying elements movable in relation to each other, by which at least one open <b>troughed</b> <b>roller</b> chain is allocated {{to at least one}} movable conveying element. In the area of the conveying section, guideways (5, 6, 20, 36, 39) which are not overlapping and laterally offset in relation to each other, are provided for the <b>troughed</b> <b>roller</b> chain (4, 23, 25). By selecting the diameter of the troughed rolls (13) or their supporting elements (22) arranged at their longitudinal ends, the situation is obtained that the <b>troughed</b> <b>rollers</b> (13) are tensioned in a plane in the region of the conveying section. This ensures that the conveyance of loads is also possible over long distances without any height differences...|$|R

They have worked with the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty of the UK, [...] in formulating near to exact matches for the {{restoration}} of historic building interiors and exteriors. Today they maintain an updated colour card of 132 colours. Farrow & Ball also produce wallpaper patterns made using traditional block, <b>trough</b> and <b>roller</b> methods and made using Farrow & Ball paint.|$|R
40|$|Kneading is {{the process}} of working into dough by pummeling, {{massaging}} and stretching. The work presented here is the Design, Construction and Performance Evaluation of a manually operated Dough Kneading Machine for Domestic use and small scale bakeries to obtain a good quality pastry to replace the crude and cumbersome method of using rolling pins, bottles, tray and <b>troughs.</b> The <b>Rollers,</b> Worktable, Frame and Gears assembled together make up the Machine. The machine was constructed from locally sourced materials and tested. The result obtained gave a kneading efficiency of 78 % with a kneading capacity of 33. 3 cm 3 /Sec...|$|R
