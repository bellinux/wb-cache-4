50|$|Electric {{pulse fishing}} is a fishing {{technique}} sometimes used in trawl fisheries which produces a limited electric field above the seabed to catch fish. The pulse <b>trawl</b> <b>gear</b> {{consists of a}} number of electrodes, attached to the gear in the tow direction, that emit short electric pulses. The electrodes replace the tickler chains that are used in traditional beam trawl fishery. The pulse trawl fishery is mainly aimed at flatfish like sole, with by-catch plaice. In addition, the pulse <b>trawl</b> <b>gear</b> is applied in shrimp fisheries on a limited scale. Technically, the use of electricity to catch fish is prohibited in European waters. However, the European Union is able to provides exemptions to this rule since 2007. These exemptions are now mainly used by Dutch and British trawlers in the North Sea.|$|E

In this experimental area, fishing disturbance was considered to be low so interference with the experiment was minimalized. Within the experimental area 3 sub-areas (150 m x 1000 m) were established for the BACI experiment: 1) a pulse trawl area; 2) a beam trawl area; 3) a reference area. The pulse and beam trawl areas of the BACI experiment were trawled by a commercial vessel (pulse) and a research vessel (beam) for one day. Before trawling, the areas were sampled with a multibeam, a sediment profile imaging (SPI) camera and a benthic sledge.

40|$|Abstract Fishers {{have been}} {{complaining}} {{about the effects of}} bottom <b>trawl</b> <b>gear</b> on the marine environment since at least the 14 th century. <b>Trawl</b> <b>gear</b> affects the environment in both direct and indirect ways. Direct effects include scraping and ploughing of the substrate, sediment resuspension, destruction of benthos, and dumping of processing waste. Indirect effects include post-fishing mortality and long-term trawl-induced changes to the benthos. There are few conclusive studies linking trawling to observed environmental changes since it is difficult to isolate the cause. However, permanent faunal changes brought about by trawling have been recorded. Research has established that the degree of environmental perturbation from bottom trawling activities is related to the weight of the gear on the seabed, the towing speed, the nature of the bottom sediments, and the strength of the tides and currents. The greater the frequency of gear impact on an area, the greater the likelihood of permanent change. In deeper water where the fauna is less adapted to changes in sediment regimes and disturbance from storm events, the effects of gear take longer to disappear. Studies indicate that in deep water (> 1000 m), the recovery time is probably measured in decades...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThis thesis work is {{performed}} {{to study and}} understand the pipeline global response {{as a result of}} trawl gears pull-over loads triggering lateral buckling on high temperature/high pressure subsea pipeline. The external interference from trawl gears pull-over loads may create substantial imperfection or out-of-straightness on the pipeline to trigger lateral buckling. The pull-over loads also may induce excessive bending moments and strains in the buckle region. To be able to understand the global response of the pipeline under pull-over loading condition, a finite element analysis is carried out based on DNV OS F 101 [1], DNV RP F 110 [2] and DNV RP F 111 [1]. The analysis is carried out using general finite element analysis software ANSYS v 13. Nonlinear-transient analysis is used to incorporate the non-linear effects, such as the nonlinearities of pipeline material, and the response of a structure under the action of pull-over time-dependent loads. The finite element analysis covers two period of duration i. e. during pull-over loads duration and after pull-over loads duration. The analysis during pull-over loads duration deals with the pipeline global response as a result of trawl gears pull-over loads. The pipeline is subjected to substantial horizontal and vertical pull-over forces from the trawl gears. The pull-over forces are applied based on force-time history as recommended in DNV RP F 111 [3]. This thesis work also study the pipeline post buckling condition. After pull-over loads duration, the pipeline global response may be different. The analysis is carried out for additional 5 seconds from the end of pull-over loads duration. In this period, the pull-over loads are no longer applied. The pipeline may expand further more caused by temperature and pressure loads on pipeline. There are four (4) types of <b>trawl</b> <b>gear</b> considered in the analysis i. e. polyvalent and rectangular <b>trawl</b> <b>gear,</b> industrial v-board, beam trawl and clump weight. All the trawl gears data are taken from DNV RP F 111 [3]. The thesis work calculates the pull-over loads and durations from all type of trawl gears. In the finite element analysis, only the pull-over loads from polyvalent and rectangular <b>trawl</b> <b>gear</b> are used as this is considered to adequately represent the cases. The finite element analysis of <b>trawl</b> <b>gear</b> pull-over shows the trawl gears pull-over loads induces lateral buckling on pipeline. The pipeline deform laterally at the pull-over loads location. High bending moments and strain occur at the apex of the buckle. The DNV displacement condition code check shows that the integrity of the pipeline is not satisfy the safety level hence the pipeline cannot withstand the trawl gears pull-over loads. The analysis with variation of operating temperature and pressure should be carried out as further works. The further works shall also take into account a full comparison of lateral and axial soil friction combination. This way, a more accurate result can be obtained and better conclusion can be verified...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} project TOETS was initiated {{as a response}} to a number of specific management questions concerning the discard problems in the Belgian beam trawl fishery, which is characterized by particularly high discard percentages of commercially unimportant organisms (invertebrates, fish species with low or no commercial interest, and individuals of commercially important species below minimum landing size). Several issues concerning the development of a suitable protocol for collecting discard data on board of commercial beam trawl vessels, the quantification of the amount and the composition of discards produced by the Belgian beam trawlers, and the evaluation of technical adaptations to the existing <b>trawling</b> <b>gear</b> resulting in a substantial reduction in the amount of discards, were the main research topics of this project. Informing the fisheries sector about the results of the project also belonged to the objectives. Based on the results of the project TOETS there is concluded that about one fourth of the Belgian catches currently consists of organisms that are discarded (with an extensive variation in discard weights, composition and length-frequency distributions). Including noncommercial organisms in the existing discard monitoring programmes implicates an enormous added value for the insights we build up with respect to the impact of beam trawling on the marine ecosystem, but requires some adaptations to the protocol, and implies as well a significantly higher physical demand of the on-board observers. However, technical adaptations to the <b>trawling</b> <b>gear</b> offer great potentials for reducing discards. (with the best results, in this study, when using a benthos release panel). However, the reduction mainly affected discarded numbers rather than weights. Finally, it is concluded that the fisheries industry is very well aware of the discard problems in the Belgian beam trawl fisheries, as is illustrated by some own initiatives and the willingness to cooperate with scientists from the Institute of Agricultural and Fisheries Research. Additionally, the resultats of the project TOETS can help our fishermen to react pro-actively to the possible future introduction of European measures to achieve discard reductions...|$|R
