40|$|Various {{types of}} visual {{analogue}} scales (VAS) {{are used in}} epidemiologic and clinical research. This paper reports on a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of variations in the orientation and type of scale on bias and precision in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. This trial {{was included in the}} pilot study of the SU. VI. MAX (supplementation by antioxidant vitamins and minerals) prevention trial in France in 1994. Six types of VAS (simple, middle-marked, graphic rating, graduated, graduated-numbered, and numerical rating) and two orientations (horizontal and vertical) were used to measure three symptoms of ear, nose, and throat infection at 2 -month intervals in 870 subjects. Differences between scales were analyzed by comparing variances (Levene's test) and means (variance-covariance analysis for repeated measures). Scale characteristics were shown to influence the proportion of zero and low values (i. e., there was a floor effect), but not mean scores. The precision of measurements varied cross-sectionally according to the type of scale, but no differences were observed in the precision of measurement of change over time. In conclusion, the characteristics of VAS seem to be important in cross-sectional studies, particularly when symptoms of low or high intensity are being measured. Researchers should try to reach a consensus on what <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>VAS</b> to use if studies are to be compared.

40|$|Introduction: Globalisation {{increases}} {{the need for}} suitable “quality of life” (QOL) measures suitable for cross-national comparison or aggregation of data across cultures. QOL as a construct is noted {{to be influenced by}} many factors such as, socio-demographical and cultural variables. It is important, therefore, to ensure that an instrument developed in one culture is valid in another. In measuring SWB, some researchers prefer using a horizontal format of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), while others opt for a vertical presentation of the VAS. However, some investigators suggested that the scales’ orientation and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>VAS</b> may affect the respondent’s response. Aims: The current study, including two experiments, was designed to compare the sensitivity ACSA (1) to cultural differences, (2) to some socioeconomic and demographic variables and (3) to variations in response format. Experiment 1 : A sample of 424 volunteers, Iranians= 83, (teachers, 29 % females), and Belgians= 341, (students, 72 % females), rated their current SWB on the Anamnestic Comparative Self Assessment scale (ACSA), a rating scale for global SWB. Besides some socio demographic data were collected. The results of independent t-test comparing the mean and Levene’s test to compare variances of SWB of the two surveyed samples (Iranians and Belgians) revealed no significant difference between score means (MIran= 70. 48, MBelgium= 70. 75) (t (422) =. 11, P<. 91) of SWB rating and also variances of scores of SWB ratings of two samples (SDIran= 19. 81, SDBelgium= 19. 91) (F=. 26, P=. 61). Meanwhile, using Univariate Analysis of Variance (ANCOVA) a significant main effect of (1) gender (F (1, 45) = 5. 57, P=. 023) was found in Iranian sample (not Belgian sample). Experiment 2 : A sample of 24 male and 124 female undergraduate students (M age= 19. 10) who assigned randomly to three groups, were asked to rate their current overall SWB on the (ACSA). The ACSA presented in three formats: two equivalent vertical and horizontal bipolar scales and a numerical rating scale. Two sets of anchor points were evaluated: (- 5 to + 5) and (0 - 10). The results of the ANOVA to compare the score means and Levene’s test to compare variances of SWB rating on different formats of ACSA indicated that the SWB rating was not influenced by the direction of the scale (Vertical Vs Horizontal) nor by the kind of anchor points ((- 5 to + 5) or (0 - 10)). A negative skew for SWB rating displayed on all scales but a higher percentage of scores distributed on the upper part (center point to top) of the scale with anchor-points (- 5 to + 5) than scales with anchor-points (0 - 10). Conclusion: In cross-notational and cross-cultural comparison studies, depending on one’s study objectives, ACSA should be considered as a complement or an alternative to conventional SWB instruments...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate whether upper-extremity vascular access (VA) creation increases the risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and death in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with an in situ left internal thoracic artery (ITA) graft. A total of 111 patients with CABG with a left ITA graft who underwent upper-extremity VA creation were analyzed retrospectively; 93 patients received left VA creation (83. 8 %, ipsilateral group) and 18 patients received right VA creation (16. 2 %, contralateral group). The primary outcome was the occurrence of MACE, and the secondary outcome was the composite of MACE or late death. There {{were no significant differences in}} the incidence of primary (P = 0. 30) or secondary (P = 0. 09) outcomes between the two groups.

40|$|AbstractA {{retrospective}} analysis of 62 echocardiograms from 22 patients with malaligned outlet septum, subpulmonary ventricular septal defect and abnormal ventriculoarterial (VA) connection was performed {{and the results}} were confirmed by intraoperative inspection, cardiac catheterization and angiography, or pathologic specimen analysis in 21 of the 22 patients. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relative incidence of the primary morphologic features; the correlation between the presence or absence of mitral valve to pulmonary valve fibrous continuity and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> connection; the <b>types</b> and incidence <b>of</b> additional cardiovascular anomalies; and the correlation between the determination <b>of</b> the <b>VA</b> connection by echocardiography versus that ascertained at intraoperative and autopsy inspection.

40|$|Hospitalization to {{initiate}} hemodialysis (HD) through temporary catheterization and subsequent creation of permanent vascular access (VA) is costly. Therefore, we studied {{the influence of}} the timing <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> creation on medical expenses, length of stay (LOS) and 1 -year primary patency rate in incident HD patients. We analyzed the medical expenses associated with hospitalization and LOS at VA creation in 486 incident HD patients at two hospitals in southern Taiwan. Patients with early VA creation, more than 1 month before HD initiation, were defined as the Planned group (n = 70); less than 1 month as the Delayed group (n = 48); and those with VA creation after the initiation of HD as the Urgent group (n = 368). The Urgent group had the highest inpatient medical expenses and LOS compared with the other two groups. Multiple regression analyses of inpatient medical expenses and LOS showed that the timing <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> creation, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>VA,</b> marital and employment status and the number of comorbidities were significant factors responsible for the differences between groups. Furthermore, higher inpatient medical expenses and longer LOS in the Urgent group were noted in the arteriovenous fistula and arteriovenous graft subgroups. Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis showed that the 1 -year primary patency rate was highest in the Delayed group and lowest in the Planned group, while Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>VA,</b> but not the timing <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> creation, was a significant risk factor for VA patency. Arteriovenous graft had a higher risk for occlusion than arteriovenous fistula. In conclusion, planned VA creation before the initiation of HD is associated with lower inpatient medical expenses and shorter LOS, which should be promoted for pre-end-stage renal disease care, but the care for VA should be further emphasized before the progression to end-stage renal disease, and the patency <b>of</b> the <b>VA</b> should be cautiously monitored...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A {{certain number}} of {{anatomic}} variants involving the distal vertebral artery (VA) are explained by variations in size and connection of the lateral spinal artery (LSA). This study examined the possible role of another branch <b>of</b> the <b>VA,</b> the posterior spinal artery (PSA), {{in the development of}} similar vascular variations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> variations in the distal VA, including the C 1 and C 2 origins of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), the duplication <b>of</b> the distal <b>VA,</b> and the aberrant course <b>of</b> the distal <b>VA,</b> are illustrated by 9 angiographic observations. RESULTS: For each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> variant listed above, examples resulting from variations in size and connection of the LSA and PSA could be matched. CONCLUSION: Variation in size and connection of the PSA is at the origin of a set of anatomic variations <b>of</b> the distal <b>VA</b> similar, but not identical, to the vascular variants linked to the LSA. The formation of the distal vertebral artery (VA) and itsprincipal branch, the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), involves the combination of several embryonic vas-cular segments.

40|$|Adult male lizards (Mabuya carinata) {{were studied}} during {{breeding}} and non breeding seasons {{to determine the}} regional and seasonal differences if any in the vas deferens and to compare ultrastructural features of luminal epithelial cells with those <b>of</b> endotherms. The <b>vas</b> deferens <b>of</b> the lizard is a convoluted tube extending from the epididymis to the hemipenis passing over the kidney. Based on morphometric data of luminal diameter and epithelial cell height three distinct regions viz; proximal, middle and distal regions were identified in the vas deferens. The epithelium {{is surrounded by a}} thin layer of lamina propria, many layers of circular smooth muscle fibers and an outer layer of visceral pleuro peritoneum. Based on cell and nuclear morphology and ultrastructure, five different cell types viz; principal cell, basal cell, mitochondria rich cell, halo cell and narrow cell were identified in the epithelium during both breeding and non breeding season. Principal cells and basal cells were more abundant in both seasons. The <b>types</b> <b>of</b> luminal epithelial cells <b>of</b> <b>vas</b> deferens <b>of</b> M. carinata and their ultrastructural features are similar to those <b>of</b> mammals.

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} study the {{association}} between fibrinolytic/endothelial cell function and inflammatory markers in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) and recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) therapies, and {{its relationship with the}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> vascular access (<b>VA)</b> used for the HD procedure. As fibrinolytic/endothelial cell function markers we evaluated plasminogen activator inhibitor type- 1 (PAI- 1), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and D-dimers, and as inflammatory markers; C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble interleukin (IL) - 2 receptor (s-IL 2 R), IL- 6 and serum albumin levels. The study was performed in 50 CKD patients undergoing regular HD, 11 with a central venous dialysis catheter (CVC) and 39 with an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), and in 25 healthy controls. Compared to controls, CKD patients presented with significantly higher levels of CRP, s-IL 2 R, IL- 6 and D-dimers, and significantly lower levels of PAI- 1. The tPA/PAI- 1 ratio was significantly higher in CKD patients. We also found statistical significant correlations in CKD patients between D-dimers levels and inflammatory markers: CRP, albumin, s-IL 2 R and IL- 6. When comparing the two groups of CKD patients, we found that those with a CVC presented statistically significant lower levels of hemoglobin concentration and albumin, and higher levels of CRP, IL- 6, D-dimers and tPA. Our results showed an association between fibrinolytic/endothelial cell function and increased inflammatory markers in CKD patients. The increased levels of Ddimer, tPA and inflammatory markers in CKD patients using a CVC, led us to propose a relationship between the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> chosen for HD, and the risk of thrombogenesis...|$|R
40|$|A {{wide variety}} <b>of</b> {{veterinary}} antibiotics (<b>VAs)</b> has been detected in environmental water samples, {{and this is}} of potential environmental concern due to their adverse effects. In particular, the potential for development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has raised social concerns leading to intensive investigation regarding the influence of antibiotics on human and ecosystem health. One of the main sources of antibiotic effluence to the environment is livestock manures that often contain elevated levels <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> that survive normal digestive procedures following medication in animal husbandry because unlike human waste, waste generated on farms does not undergo tertiary wastewater treatment, and consequently, the concentration of antibiotics entering the environment {{is expected to be}} larger from farming practices. Animal feed is often supplemented with VAs to promote growth and parasite resistance in the medicated animals, and this practice typically resulted in higher use <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> and consequential excretion from livestock through urine and feces. The excretion rate varied depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> used with around 75, 90, and 50 – 100 % being excreted for chlortetracycline, sulfamethazine, and tyolsin, respectively. The excreted VAs that initially present in livestock manures were degraded more than 90 % when proper composting practice was used, and hence, this can be employed as a management strategy to decrease VA environmental loads. The reduction <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> concentrations during composting was mainly attributed to abiotic processes rather than biotic degradation. The VAs released to soils by the application of manure and manure-based composts can be degraded or inactivated to various degrees through abiotic process such as adsorption to soil components. Depending on the antibiotic species and soil properties, residues can be transferred to groundwater and surface water through leaching and runoff and can potentially be taken up by plants. ...|$|R
40|$|Present {{literature}} identifies policy learning (PL) {{as contributing}} to effective and efficient policy design and management processes. Similarly, the participatory nature of specific voluntary agreements (VAs) has been identified {{as contributing to}} increased policy framework effectiveness and efficiency. Against this background, this study aims to prove the hypothesis that an increased attention to the possibilities for PL that exists in the VA policy framework can contribute to a better design <b>of</b> <b>VAs,</b> as well as potentially providing more positive evaluations thereof if acknowledging said learning. Hence, the study analyses to which extent that the literature acknowledges VAs’ learning potentials, and evaluates which policy recommendations that can be provided to increase the potential for PL. The study finds that VAs in the form of negotiated agreements are more successful in promoting PL than other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> that have less focus on the participatory aspect of the policy processes. The study also identifies that the policy cycle of negotiated agreements includes four different stages of learning possibilities. As to facilitate that these stages can be fruitfully explored, the study presents recommended policy design and management elements that can increase learning. To this end, the study does not aim to provide recommendations for the entire VA process, as suggestions focus specifically on the learning aspects. The paper contributes to the existing VA policy literature through highlighting the predominately overseen learning values of implementing negotiated agreements as well as providing policy recommendations on VA learning processes...|$|R
40|$|Voluntary Agreements (VAs) are {{becoming}} increasingly prominent in many countries as a policy instrument for achieving improvements in the environmental performance of industry. They aim to encourage industry led initiatives to set and meet environmental goals, to raise the environmental profile in corporate decision making, and to give participating industries the flexibility to achieve these goals in the manner which best meets their particular economic, social and political circumstances. The first section of this paper establishes an analytical framework for assessing the performance <b>of</b> <b>VAs.</b> This includes a classification <b>of</b> the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> and {{a discussion of the}} different criteria which could be used to evaluate their performance. The paper goes on to review the experience of several OECD countries with the implementation <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> with energy intensive industries aimed at achieving improvements in energy efficiency or reducing the release of greenhouse gases. Three principle case studies are presented on Germany, the Netherlands and the United States with smaller studies on Canada and New Zealand. Each of the case studies sets out to describe the main characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>VA,</b> the different regulatory environments in which they are employed, and to evaluate their effectiveness in achieving environmental goals. Drawing on this information the paper goes on to identify several issues which need to be taken into consideration for the successful implementation <b>of</b> <b>Vas.</b> At present limited information is available to evaluate the success <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> in different countries, especially in terms of economic efficiency and environmental effectiveness. This is partly because VAs have only been recently introduced in many countries and also because VAs rarely operate in isolation from other policy instruments. A significant part of this study, therefore, has focused on evaluation issues, such as how to compare performance <b>of</b> <b>VAs</b> against a "business as usual" baseline scenario or with historical trends. When such analysis has been used in this paper however, the difficulties and limitations of these methods are noted. VAs do, however, appear {{to play an important role}} in changing attitudes and awareness and generating and diffusing information. These so-called "soft effects" are difficult to quantify and often overlooked but appear to be one of the main advantages of a voluntary co-operative approach...|$|R

However, the mechanisms of the anti- tumoral properties in vivo of mistletoe lectins are not fully understood. Because endothelial cells (EC) play {{a pivotal role in}} tumor angiogenesis, we tested the hypothesis that VA extracts induce endothelial cell death and apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effect <b>of</b> various <b>VA</b> preparations on both human venous endothelial cell (HUVEC) and immortalized human venous endothelial cell line (IVEC) using morphologic assessment of EC, FACScan analysis after propidium iodine and annexin V labeling, and detection of cleavage of poly(A) DP-ribose polymerase (PARP). RESULTS: All tested VA preparations, except Iscador P, were cytotoxic in IVEC. Apoptosis, assessed by morphologic examination, annexin V labeling, and Western blot analysis for PARP cleavage, was involved in HUVEC cell death induced by VA preparations derived from plants that grow on oak trees (VA Qu FrF). CONCLUSIONS: Results from the present study suggest that VA extract-induced endothelial apoptosis may explain the tumor regression associated with the therapeutic use <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> preparations and support further investigations to develop novel anti-angiogenic compounds based on mistletoe compounds...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} calculate and compare the costs and outcome of AVF and AVG surgery in terms of early and long-term patencies. MethodsA decision tree and a Markov model were constructed to calculate costs and performance of AVFs and AVGs. The model was populated with a retrospective cohort of HD patients receiving their first VA. The outcomes were determined probabilistically with a 5 -year follow-up. ResultsAVFs were usable for a mean (95 % CI) of 28. 5 months (24. 6 – 32. 5 months), while AVGs showed a patency of 25. 5 months (20. 0 – 31. 2 months). The use of AVFs was the dominant <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> and € 631 could be saved per patient/per month patency compared to AVG use. Regardless of the willingness to pay, the use of AVFs yielded a higher probability of being cost-effective compared to AVGs. ConclusionsAVFs are more cost-effective than AVGs.

This project was a preliminary feasibility study and was not intended to answer long term questions regarding the possible benefits VA mycorrhizae may confer to roadside plantings or other prairie restorations. All phases of the project were successful. The survey indicated that differences in VA mycorrhizae composition exist between different sites. It is possible to produce VA mycorrhizae in a greenhouse by culturing on living plant hosts. The VA mycorrhizae produced was successfully installed along with seed into field plots and did form mycotrophic associations with newly planted prairie species.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundA {{bidirectional}} flow pattern within the intracranial {{segment of the}} vertebral artery (V 4 –VA) should be indicative of a proximal steno-occlusive disorder of the ipsilateral subclavian artery (SA). Here we present two patients revealing this ultrasound finding without evidence of a specific SA pathology. Methods/case reportsIn case 1 duplex sonography revealed a diameter of the left V 2 –VA of 3. 3 mm and 2. 7 mm on the right side. Normal flow signals were detected in the left V 2 –VA, a systolic flow deceleration was seen on the right side. Intracranially, a biphasic flow pattern was observed in the right V 4 –VA. The left V 4 –VA, the basilar artery and the brachial arteries (BrA) {{as well as the}} cuff-test were normal. Conventional angiography ruled out a SA or VA pathology. A bilateral fetal-type posterior cerebral artery (FT-PCA) was seen. CT angiography demonstrated a small diameter of the right intracranial V 4 –VA close to the basilar confluens. In case 2 <b>VA</b> diameter <b>of</b> the left and right V 2 –VA was 3. 3 and 2. 3 mm, respectively. Flow signals, similar to case 1 were observed in the non-dominant V 2 –VA and V 4 –VA segment. The remaining vessels and the cuff-test were normal. MR angiography demonstrated a FT-PCA and an incomplete posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) -ending VA on the right side. ConclusionsA {{bidirectional flow}} in V 4 –VA can not prove a subclavian steal phenomenon. A normal triphasic flow signal of the brachial artery excludes a relevant proximal obstruction of the SA. Also, diameter measurements <b>of</b> the <b>VA</b> are mandatory. It seems that physiological variants of the vertebrobasilar circulation like a VA hypoplasia, PICA-ending VA or FT-PCA might also cause the above <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> flow pattern...|$|R

40|$|<b>Type</b> <b>of</b> {{vascular}} {{access and}} mortality in U. S. hemodialysis patients. BackgroundVascular access (VA) complications account for 16 to 25 % of hospital admissions. This study tested {{the hypothesis that}} the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> in use is correlated with overall mortality and cause-specific mortality. MethodsData were analyzed from the U. S. Renal Data System Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study Wave 1, a random sample of 5507 patients, prevalent on hemodialysis as of December 31, 1993. The relative mortality risk during a two-year observation was analyzed by Cox-regression methods with adjustments for demographic and comorbid conditions. Using similar methods, cause-specific analyses also were performed for death caused by infection and cardiac causes. ResultsIn diabetic mellitus (DM) patients with end-stage renal disease, the associated relative mortality risk was higher for those with arteriovenous graft (AVG; RR = 1. 41, P < 0. 003) and central venous catheter (CVC; RR = 1. 54, P < 0. 002) as compared with arteriovenous fistula (AVF). In non-DM patients, those with CVC had a higher associated mortality (RR = 1. 70, P < 0. 001), as did to a lesser degree those with AVG (RR = 1. 08, P = 0. 35) when compared with AVF. Cause-specific analyses found higher infection-related deaths for CVC (RR = 2. 30, P < 0. 06) and AVG (RR = 2. 47, P < 0. 02) compared with AVF in DM; in non-DM, risk was higher also for CVC (RR = 1. 83, P < 0. 04) and AVG (RR = 1. 27, P < 0. 33). In contrast to our hypothesis that AV shunting increases cardiac risk, deaths caused by cardiac causes were higher in CVC than AVF for both DM (RR = 1. 47, P < 0. 05) and non-DM (RR = 1. 34, P < 0. 05) patients. ConclusionThis case-mix adjusted analysis suggests that CVC and AVG are correlated with increased mortality risk when compared with AVF, both overall and by major causes of death...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{compared}} {{the results of}} daily patching and alternate-day patching to treat amblyopia. Methods: Patients with difference in the visual acuity (VA) between the eyes {{of at least two}} lines were prescribed spectacles ac-cording to the result of cycloplegic refraction. After 4 months, 45 patients with confirmed amblyopia were randomly assigned to daily patching or alternate-day patching group. Patients were patched daily in the daily patching group (n = 24), and patched ev-ery other day in another group. The patching time was 2 - 6 hours according to the <b>VA</b> <b>of</b> the amblyopic eye. The parents were asked to mark on a calendar whether their child performed occlusion or not. The main outcome measure was the mean <b>VA</b> <b>of</b> amblyopic eye and compliance of occlusion after 1, 3, 6 and 9 months. The success of treatment was defined if difference <b>of</b> <b>VA</b> between the eyes was {{less than or equal to}} 1 line. Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in age, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> amblyopia, <b>VA</b> <b>of</b> the amblyopic eye and total treatment duration. <b>VA</b> <b>of</b> the amblyopic eye was significantly improved at 1 month after occlusion in both groups.

Rather than adopting a positive perspective and describing different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> voluntary approaches (<b>VAs)</b> and their main features or their pros and cons, this survey focuses on the economic incentives for firms or industries to adopt VAs. The consequent role that VAs may play within a set of policy tools designed to address environmental problems is then assessed. A careful understanding of the economic incentives that induce a firm to sign a VA is indeed crucial to identify and design the policy mix that makes the VA both environmentally effective and economically efficient. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDouble common {{bile duct}} (DCBD) is a rare {{congenital}} anomaly. Most of these bile duct anomalies are associated with bile duct stones, anomalous pancreaticobiliary junction (APBJ), pancreatitis and bile duct or gastric cancers. Early detection and treatment is important to avoid long term complications. Surgical resection of the anomalous bile duct and reconstruction of the biliary enteric anastomosis is the treatment of choice. We report a rare case of DCBD anomaly in a girl, who presented with recurrent cholangitis. She had type Va DCBD anomaly. She underwent successful resection of the bile duct and reconstruction of the biliary enteric anastomosis. Preoperative imaging and diagnosis of the congenital biliary anomaly {{is very important to}} avoid intraoperative bile duct injury.

40|$|In mice a {{molecular}} motor of the myosin V class (designated myosin Va) {{is known to}} be the product of the dilute locus, where a mutation prevents melanosome transport in melanocytes. There is conflicting evidence about whether it has a role in dendrite outgrowth. We investigated its role by transiently transfecting antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit its expression in a melanocyte cell line. We demonstrated mRNA and protein expression <b>of</b> myosin <b>Va</b> in 3 mouse melanocyte lines and 1 human melanoma cell line, using RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Two splice variants were found in human cells whilst only the longer transcript, containing an additional exon, was present in mouse melanocyte lines. The shorter variant was detected in other mouse tissues. Myosin Va protein levels were similar in 3 melanocyte lines with differing amounts of pigmentation, indicating that expression <b>of</b> myosin <b>Va</b> is not tightly coupled to expression of melanin. Immunocytochemistry showed 2 <b>types</b> <b>of</b> myosin <b>Va</b> localisation. A punctate pattern of staining concentrated in the perinuclear region was indicative of organelle association, and the observation of occasional linear punctate staining aligned with F-actin bundles supported the idea that myosin Va has a role in transporting melanosomes along actin filaments. Staining was also intense at tips of dendrites and at sites of dendrite-cell contact, consistent with a possible role in dendrite growth. Transient transfection of antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides targeted against myosin Va mRNA reduced expression <b>of</b> myosin <b>Va</b> protein in cultured mouse melan-a melanocytes by over 70 % 20 h after transfection whereas a control (shuffled sequence) oligonucleotide did not. Upon trypsinisation and replating these cells the capacity of the transfected cells to extend new dendrites was reduced in the cells containing the specific antisense oligonucleotides but unaffected by the control oligonucleotide. Image analysis confirmed that the effect of transfection on morphology was statistically significant (P< 0. 01). In contrast when cells were not trypsinised and replated following transfection so that previously existing dendrites could persist, the normal dendritic morphology continued to be observed. We conclude that in addition to its involvement in melanosome transport, myosin Va has a role in the extension of new dendrites by melanocytes but not in maintenance of pre-existing dendrites...|$|R

Results: 65 patients of first year of life had vascular tumors, with prevalence of infantile hemangiomas (IHs) in 57 (87. 7 %) patients. 45 children had IHs localized within soft tissues, whereas 7 patients suffered from IHs of the liver, and 5 children from IHs of the respiratory tract. Most patients with soft tissue IHs were diagnosed only with ultrasound; СT or MRI diagnostics were performed on 5 (8. 8 %) patients, and biopsy was carried out in 2 (4. 4 %) children. Vascular malformations (VM) were diagnosed in 140 (68. 3 %) patients. Ultrasound investigation (US) was the screening method. MRI was performed to confirm the diagnosis of low-flow VM, whereas for high-flow VM CT angiography and selective angiography were useful.

METHODS: Analysis of prospectively collected data recorded within an electronic medical record system on treatment-naive, first-eligible eyes with nAMD, treated with ranibizumab using an as-needed treatment regimen with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Data collection included the following: age, gender, laterality, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> nAMD, <b>VA,</b> central 1 mm OCT retinal thickness, number of intravitreal injections, and number of follow-up assessments. RESULTS: Data were available on the first-treated eye from 406 patients with at least 1 year follow-up; of these, 198 had data at 2 years. The mean baseline <b>VA</b> <b>of</b> 54. 4 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters improved to 58. 5 letters at 12 months and to 56. 8 letters at 24 months. The mean VA changes from baseline to 1 year were + 6. 5, + 7. 5, + 1. 7, and - 1. 5 letters, respectively, for baseline <b>VA</b> categories <b>of</b> 23 - 35, 36 - 55, 56 - 70, and > 70 letters.
