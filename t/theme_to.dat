5|$|Kawada's vocal talents {{were first}} {{discovered}} by Eiko Shimamiya, who was her teacher at a vocal school in Sapporo, Hokkaido. She {{was introduced to}} I've Sound, a music production group which featured Shimamiya as a member. Kawada joined I've Sound in 2001, and in that year released her debut song titled , which {{was used as the}} opening <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> the eroge Miss You. The song was later compiled on I've Sound's fifth compilation album Out Flow in 2003.|$|E
25|$|The Upper Lot {{features}} Springfield, <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> The Simpsons television show. This area contains comedic {{motion simulator}} The Simpsons Ride, along with multiple eateries <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> the show, {{a gift shop}} <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> The Kwik-E-Mart, and several character meet and greets.|$|R
5000|$|South County BackroadsCar {{attraction}} featuring two tracks: {{one side}} <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> the 1920s cars, {{and the other}} <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> 1950s cars.|$|R
50|$|In {{the very}} early days of Disneyland in Anaheim, Walt Disney had {{imagined}} two streets adjacent to Main Street, respectively named Liberty Street (<b>themed</b> <b>to</b> American values and history) and Edison Square (<b>themed</b> <b>to</b> this inventor's achievements). Although they were never made reality, these ideas became inspiration for both Arcades in Paris. As such, Imagineers came up with Liberty Arcade, <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> the lasting friendship between France and the United States and embodied by Lady Liberty, and Discovery Arcade, <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> inventions of the 19th century.|$|R
5|$|The second {{movement}} is in E-flat major and strophic form, {{with a statement}} of a theme followed by three variations (the second of which is in E-flat minor) and a coda. Haydn used a similar design for the slow movement of the Opus 20, No. 4 quartet. In 1793 the poet Gabriele von Baumberg set the movement's <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> words, for inscription on a monument honouring Haydn in the composer's home town of Rohrau, Austria.|$|E
5|$|Utami {{has also}} noted that the novel is a {{reflection}} of her own restlessness and anxiety. Although little of it directly reflects events in her life, she notes that Saman's loss of religion reflects her own, and the book reflects her belief that a double standard exists regarding virginity in Indonesian culture. Although the novel touches on racial harmony, Utami said that she considers the <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> be undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|Delta Express {{promoted}} the series {{by having a}} Boeing 737-200 jet painted with a special livery featuring the characters Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup on the exterior. The plane's inaugural flight was held at Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, on July 17, 2000. In 2002 the aircraft was repainted with a different Powerpuff Girls <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> promote The Powerpuff Girls Movie. The Powerpuff Girls series has won two Primetime Emmys, two Annie Awards, and including those four wins, has been nominated a total of sixteen times for various awards.|$|E
5000|$|Tweetsie Railroad {{features}} ghost train {{event that}} is <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> the fictional [...] "Great Train of 1913". By 2015, {{it is now}} <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> [...] "Monster Hunters".|$|R

50|$|Conceptual artwork for the {{expansion}} shows several new additions and changes. Included is a new dark ride <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> Disney's 1989 film The Little Mermaid (also located at Disney California Adventure), and an area <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> Disney's 1991 film Beauty and the Beast featuring the Beast's Castle with a new sit-down restaurant and Belle's cottage. There is also a rest area <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> Disney's 2010 film Tangled, and an interactive queue for Peter Pan's Flight.|$|R
5|$|Gradually, {{women began}} to author their own {{thoughts}} and literary works about lesbian relationships. Until {{the publication of}} The Well of Loneliness, most major works involving lesbianism were penned by men. Foster suggests that women would have encountered suspicion about their own lives had they used same-sex love as a topic, and that some writers including Louise Labé, Charlotte Charke, and Margaret Fuller either changed the pronouns in their literary works to male, or made them ambiguous. Author George Sand was portrayed as a character in several works in the 19th century; writer Mario Praz credited the popularity of lesbianism as a <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> Sand's appearance in Paris society in the 1830s. Charlotte Brontë's Villette in 1853 initiated a genre of boarding school stories with homoerotic themes.|$|E
5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> convey a vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, VisualArt's {{created the}} record label Key Sounds Label (KSL). The music albums and singles {{released}} by Key after this were put under this label, meaning {{that this does}} not include the first two albums and one single which were released before it was officially formed. The first album on this label was Humanity..., though the only direct connection to Key's works is that it contains a remixed version of the opening <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> Air. The albums under the label are mainly composed by Key's signature composers: Jun Maeda, Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi. Three of the singles feature songs sung by Lia and one album, Love Song, features the singer Riya from Eufonius. Three drama CDs have been released as well.|$|E

50|$|It is {{constructed}} on 18 acre of property {{just east of}} the Iowa State Fairgrounds at Sleepy Hollow Sports Park. Festival Park, <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> 16th century England, joins another Des Moines theme park, Living History Farms, which is <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> 19th century America.|$|R
5000|$|The ride is <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> the mako shark. Similarly the 2 acre park {{area around}} it, {{entitled}} [...] "Shark Wreck Reef", is <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> sharks featuring recycled art, a mural created by Guy Harvey, and educational pieces about human and shark interactions.|$|R
5|$|In Hymns of Divine Love (also called Hymns of Divine Eros) most {{of which}} were {{completed}} during his time in exile, Symeon describes his vision of God as uncreated divine light. That experience of divine luminosity is associated by Symeon with the Holy Trinity, with God, and sometimes with Christ. The Hymns are similar in <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> the Discourses, but are written with poetic meter and rhyme. He began writing them {{at the same time as}} the Discourses but only finished editing them during the last thirteen years of his life at the monastery of St. Macrina. There are 58 hymns totaling approximately 11,000 verses.|$|E
5|$|In The Girlie Show in 1993, {{the song}} was {{performed}} in an alternate version as the second to last song of the tour. It had a military <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> it. Halfway through the performance Madonna paused the song for a military drill with the dancers and the audience. The performance met with strong reaction in Puerto Rico, when Madonna rubbed the Puerto Rican national flag between her legs in between the performance. For the Drowned World Tour in 2001 Madonna wore a fur coat, velvet fedora and a customised Dolce & Gabbana T-shirt which proclaimed 'Mother' {{in the front and}} 'F*cker' in the back painted in silver. This demonstrated her ghetto-girl appearance adopted for the song's performance.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Harland {{composed}} most of {{the music}} for Soul Reaver; Jim Hedges handled the remaining audio. Harland remarked that, under Amy Hennig's direction, he programmed music to change based on the current gameplay situation—for example, combat or swimming. This variation was accomplished through a custom Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) driver, which altered music based on signals from the game engine. Each vampire tribe had corresponding music; one tribe of vampires {{was associated with a}} slow, thumping <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> convey a sense of working machinery. To further fit the music to the environment, the sound team consulted level designers regarding layout and appearance. Music from both Soul Reaver and Soul Reaver 2 was released on a promotional soundtrack in 2001.|$|E
50|$|<b>Themed</b> <b>to</b> Sanrio's Hello Kitty franchise.|$|R
50|$|Van Helsing's Factory is themed {{after the}} fictional Abraham Van Helsing, {{originally}} from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula. Movie Park Germany chose this <b>theme</b> due <b>to</b> {{the lack of}} intellectual property restrictions on the work. The outside of the building is <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> a 1950s American garage. The inside of the show building is <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> the factory where Van Helsing prepares his cars for vampire hunting.|$|R
50|$|At the 2015 D23 Expo, it was {{announced}} that an adventure <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> The Force Awakens would be added to the attraction. The new adventure became available beginning November 16, 2015. A new adventure <b>themed</b> <b>to</b> Crait from The Last Jedi will be added to the adventure matrix.|$|R
5|$|Lachanodrakon reappears in 790, {{when the}} young emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797) conspired to {{overturn}} the tutelage of Irene. The general was sent by Constantine to the Armeniac <b>Theme</b> <b>to</b> secure the allegiance of its soldiers. Constantine succeeded in toppling his mother in December 790; it was probably then that Lachanodrakon was rewarded with the supreme non-imperial title, that of magistros. According to the account of Theophanes, he participated in the imperial campaign against the Bulgars in 792 {{that led to the}} disastrous defeat at the Battle of Marcellae on 20 July, where he was killed. The history of John Skylitzes records his death in the Battle of Versinikia, again against the Bulgars, in 813, but this is clearly an error.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have found}} it {{extremely}} difficult to assign one specific, overarching <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters {{that human beings are}} neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike, awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found {{it is clear that the}} play is full of several small, thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Takechi's Daydream {{had been}} {{considered}} a national embarrassment by the Japanese government because of its highly publicized release while the world {{was focused on the}} country for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Takechi's third film had suffered heavily from the governmental censorship, yet no legal action had been taken. Takechi's fourth film, the Nikkatsu-produced Black Snow (1965), was even more controversial than his previous work. David Desser credits Black Snow with bringing a political <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> the pink film. Politics would be featured in many later films in the pink genre, most notably those of Kōji Wakamatsu.|$|E

5|$|The Committee set itself several {{rules and}} over the years {{developed}} many practices. The names had to be euphonious (they had to have a pleasant sound). Also, their meaning had to be readily apparent to anyone interested, whether railwayman or member of the public. There had to be good publicity value in the names as well as providing good morale for the staff, and the collection of names for a class had to provide some form of class identity. Another rule was not to use names of people who were still alive at the time, and some on the Committee had a strong dislike of names or associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> an absurd extent was discouraged.|$|E
5|$|The bassoon sustains its B {{from the}} final chord of the first {{movement}} before moving up a semitone to middle C. This serves as a key change from the E minor opening movement into the lyrical C major slow movement. The movement is in ternary form and is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's own Songs Without Words. The <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> the darker, middle section in A minor is first introduced by the orchestra before the violin then takes up both the melody and the accompaniment simultaneously. The tremulous accompaniment requires nimble dexterity from the soloist before the music returns to the main lyrical C major theme, this time leading towards a serene conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of Spira includes distinct ethnic minorities including a {{portrayal of the}} fictional Al Bhed language that is prevalent throughout the game's dialogue. The backstory and concept behind the dark religious themes of Final Fantasy X were a central <b>theme</b> <b>to</b> the story and their ultimate resolution was well received. The popularity of the Eternal Calm video served as the impetus of Square Enix to do Final Fantasy X-2 to make their first direct sequel in video game form and depict the evolution of Spiran society after religious and political upheaval results in new factions and instability in the world. Spira and its inhabiting characters have been featured in several other Square Enix works including Dissidia Final Fantasy, Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy and three games within the Kingdom Hearts series and Theatrhythm Final Fantasy.|$|E
