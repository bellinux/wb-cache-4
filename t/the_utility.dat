If the coins are circulated through business transactions so that every individual of the ten households can enjoy <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> of the 100,000 coins, then <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> will amount to that of 1,000,000 cash.

5|$|After {{the power}} outage was over, Hydro-Québec made {{numerous}} upgrades to its system {{in order to}} improve the power grid.

5|$|Reaction to <b>the</b> <b>utility</b> by Doom9 forum members, bloggers, and {{mainstream}} media has ranged from supportive to intensely hostile.

One article compared proponents of BackupHDDVD to terrorists. When the release of the tool was first publicized, several articles claimed that AACS had been cracked. In fact no cryptographic weaknesses constituting a crack have yet been found in AES, the underlying cryptographic system of AACS. Keys are actually obtained through a side-channel attack.|$|E

50|$|In other words: if an individual's {{behavior}} always {{satisfies the}} above axioms, {{then there is}} a utility function such that the individual will choose one gamble over another if and only if <b>the</b> expected <b>utility</b> of one exceeds that of the other. <b>The</b> expected <b>utility</b> of any gamble may be expressed as a linear combination of <b>the</b> <b>utilities</b> of <b>the</b> outcomes, with the weights being <b>the</b> respective probabilities. <b>Utility</b> functions are also normally continuous functions.
