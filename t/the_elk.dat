5|$|Elk {{handling}} facilities are areas of pens with {{loading and unloading}} ramps where water and food are provided to <b>the</b> <b>elk.</b> They were created to help reduce herd numbers by increasing wariness and encouraging migratory behaviour, deterring <b>the</b> <b>elk</b> {{from the town of}} Banff. These measures allowed more predator–prey interactions thanks to the creation of corridors. They also increased elk migration, restored the willow and aspen communities and highlighted the primary role of wolves in elk population management.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{is also an}} {{important}} economic support of the Kootenay River area. Although originally valuable minerals such as gold and silver were unearthed, today coal is the primary resource extracted from underground. Conventional coal deposits underlie much of the East Kootenay, especially in <b>the</b> <b>Elk</b> River valley which is home to <b>the</b> <b>Elk</b> Valley Coalfield, and the Crowsnest Coalfield in the Purcell Mountains. The East Kootenay is the most important coal-producing area of British Columbia, has since 1898 produced over 500 million tons, and about 25 percent of the world's steel-making coal comes from the region.|$|E
5|$|Neolithic petroglyphs from Asia depict antler-less female elk, {{which have}} been {{interpreted}} as symbolizing rebirth and sustenance. By {{the beginning of the}} Bronze Age, <b>the</b> <b>elk</b> is depicted less frequently in rock art, coinciding with a cultural transformation away from hunting.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Elks</b> National Home is a {{retirement}} home in Bedford, Virginia built in 1916. In late 2013 <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> sold <b>the</b> {{home to a}} private organization.|$|R
5000|$|The Fisk Block {{stood on}} this site {{as the home}} of <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> until it burned in 1924. <b>The</b> <b>Elks</b> rebuilt their home as a Colonial Revival {{building}} designed by Mr. Whetherfogg. [...] It has a canopied formal entry on Lafayette St. to the upper floors. [...] Major renovation in 1988 created the 150 Lincolnway facilities. <b>The</b> <b>Elks</b> have since sold their interests in the building.|$|R

5|$|Some {{cultures}} revere <b>the</b> <b>elk</b> as {{a spiritual}} force. In parts of Asia, antlers and their velvet are used in traditional medicines. Elk are hunted as a game species. The meat is leaner and higher in protein than beef or chicken.|$|E
5|$|When Marta recovers, her {{instincts}} {{to return}} home are dulled and she begins traveling more slowly. She makes her way through Swan Valley to cross the Swan Range and Mission Mountains. As winter settles in, she makes a winter home around Lindbergh Lake, where hunting is good and humans few. Near the end of winter, she meets another lone wolf, Greatfoot, a large male. Initially they maintain their distance from one another, until Greatfoot hunts <b>the</b> <b>elk</b> herd in Marta's range, specifically the aging leader that Marta favored and refused to hunt herself. She stops the other wolf's hunt, and after a brief skirmish they forget <b>the</b> <b>elk</b> and become friendly. They form a pack of two and leave the area, heading south. After mating, their travels become more urgent to find a home to raise young.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{are a very}} {{important}} species in Banff National Park, partly because they represent a source of food for declining wolves. However they also have harsh impacts on the environment. Large elk populations cause vegetation degradation, human–animal conflicts and destabilization of biological interactions. In 1999, {{the implementation of the}} Banff National Park Elk Management Strategy by Parks Canada and <b>the</b> <b>Elk</b> Advisory Committee aimed to monitor and control the population to decrease conflicts and aid ecological process recovery.|$|E
50|$|The Order of Royal Purple was {{the female}} {{auxiliary}} of <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> of Canada. Unlike {{their counterparts in}} the United States, who have never been officially recognized by the Benevolent and Protective Order of <b>Elks,</b> <b>the</b> ORP was officially recognized by <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> of Canada.|$|R

50|$|In 2014 the Supreme Executive of the Order of Royal Purple {{decided to}} secede from <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> and start a new organization, the Canadian Royal Purple Society. Some locals, however, wished to remain with <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> and these were {{integrated}} into the organization of <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> of Canada as Royal Purple Elks Lodges. Approximately 75 of these new Canadian Royal Purple lodges were formed between August 2014 and Feb. 2015.|$|R

5|$|In 1919, Major William A. Welch ordered 75 elk from Yellowstone National Park; however, {{some had}} died en route. The {{remaining}} elk {{were kept in}} a wired cage between Arden and Southfields. By 1935, some of the animals were still alive. However, by 1942, all of <b>the</b> <b>elk</b> had died. The remaining area {{is now known as}} the Elk's Pen Trailhead, which serves the Appalachian and ArdenSurebridge Trails. The remains of the pen still currently stand.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, {{after several}} years of public {{controversy}} regarding the forced reduction of <b>the</b> <b>elk</b> population in Yellowstone, United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks. In a paper known as the Leopold Report, the committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended management of Yellowstone's elk population.|$|E

5000|$|The Benevolent and Protective Order of <b>the</b> <b>Elks,</b> {{established}} in 1868, has {{almost a million}} members and more than 2000 lodges all over the country. [...] "In the early twentieth century, the Benevolent and Protective Order of <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> commissioned artists, mostly on the east coast, to create statues of elks for fountains in cities across the United States." [...] These images were {{made available to the}} new chapters of <b>the</b> <b>Elks.</b> <b>The</b> Milwaukee Lodge of Elks (No. 46) decided to present an elk statue and fountain to the community in 1901, the year that <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> of America held their Grand Lodge convention in Milwaukee. The statue they chose is a replica of one in Reading, Pennsylvania cast by the Fish Manufacturing Company. It was presented to the community as part of <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> Carnival Parade on July 23, 1901. In 1927 <b>the</b> Milwaukee <b>Elks</b> built a new lodge, called the Wonderlodge, on East Wisconsin Avenue. The sculpture was placed {{in front of the building}} on a pedestal designed by Ruben F. Clas. [...] "Natural spring water from a well in the basement of the lodge was connected to the base of the statue; along with city water, it flowed from two taps at <b>the</b> <b>elk's</b> base." ...|$|R
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Cervus (and hence early {{relatives}} or possible ancestors of <b>the</b> <b>elk)</b> first appear in the fossil record 25 million years ago, during the Oligocene in Eurasia, but do {{not appear in the}} North American fossil record until the early Miocene. The extinct Irish elk (Megaloceros) was not a member {{of the genus}} Cervus, but rather the largest member of the wider deer family (Cervidae) known from the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|After {{several years}} of public {{controversy}} regarding the forced reduction of <b>the</b> <b>elk</b> population in Yellowstone National Park, Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks. The committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended different management of Yellowstone's elk population. In addressing the goals, policies, and methods of managing wildlife in the parks, the report suggested {{that in addition to}} protection, wildlife populations should be managed and regulated to prevent habitat degradation. Touching upon predator control, fire ecology, and other issues, the report suggested that the National Park Service (NPS) hire scientists to manage the parks using current scientific research.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) {{established}} ten {{camps in}} Moshannon State Forest, and ten in Elk State Forest. The {{young men of}} the CCC planted trees, blazed new trails, built roads and bridges, and fought fires, which {{continued to be a}} problem. In 1938 a fast-moving fire in <b>the</b> <b>Elk</b> State Forest, north of Quehanna, killed eight firefighters. The CCC also built structures and established or improved many of the state parks, including Parker Dam and S. B. Elliott State Parks on the western Quehanna plateau. The United States' entry into World War II ended the CCC, and all its camps were closed by the summer of 1942. The Quehanna Trail System passes near or through the sites of several former CCC camps.|$|E
50|$|UF {{professor}} A.O. White led {{an effort}} in 1984 {{for the city}} to acquire the spring and restore it to a natural state. In April, 1986, negotiations between <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> and <b>the</b> city were terminated when <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> insisted on more money than the city would spend. One year later, the city upped their offer to $451,000, which was 10% more than assessed value, but in 1988, <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> again declined to sell.|$|R

5|$|Elk (also {{known as}} wapiti), mule deer, and {{pronghorn}} (also called pronghorn antelope) {{are some of}} the most commonly seen large mammals. During winter, pronghorn that spend the summer in the Sawtooth Valley migrate south to the lower elevations on the Snake River Plain, and some sections of the forest are closed to motorized use to protect <b>the</b> <b>elk</b> winter range. Bighorn sheep are rare sights in the forest, but the forest contains one-third of Idaho's mountain goat population, and they are commonly seen at high elevations in the Boulder, White Cloud, Pioneer, and Sawtooth mountains. Other mammals in the forest include the coyote, moose, bobcat, beaver, yellow-bellied marmot, pika, and badger.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the district's mines, the Wells Fargo office was used as a {{residence}} by Alex and Mayme Colbath until the 1950s. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 11, 1971, and currently serves as an art gallery and a museum. The Rice Building burned down, and was rebuilt in 1991. The Cosmopolitan Restaurant was reconstructed to appear {{as it did in the}} 19th century, and it served European cuisine until it was closed in 2010. There are many remnants of houses and other buildings, and there are also markers indicating where some buildings once stood, such as <b>the</b> <b>Elk</b> Horn Saloon. Some of the area has been preserved for its history.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{the only}} U.S. National Park that permits hunting, but only of elk {{in an effort to}} keep the populations of that species regulated. This {{provision}} was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950. While some National Parks in Alaska permit subsistence hunting by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow hunting under highly regulated circumstances, hunting in U.S. National Parks is not generally allowed. In Grand Teton National Park, hunters are required to obtain Wyoming hunting licenses and be deputized as park rangers. Hunting is restricted to areas east of the Snake River and north of Moran, Wyoming, the hunt is permitted only east of U.S. Route 89. Proponents of continuing <b>the</b> <b>elk</b> hunt, which occurs in the fall, argue that <b>the</b> <b>elk</b> herd would become overpopulated without it, leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds. Opponents cite that there has been an increase of predators such as the wolf and grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park, rendering the annual hunt unnecessary and exposing hunters to attacks by grizzly bears as they become accustomed to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Elks</b> {{first game}} of the Western Canadian Junior B {{championship}} was against the Assiniboia Southern Rebels, a 6-1 loss. They next played the Selkirk Fishermen, resulting in a 9-3 loss. In the third game, <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> lost to <b>the</b> Spruce Grove Regals 11-2, then lost to the Richmond Sockeyes 5-1. In the fifth and final game of the round robin, <b>the</b> <b>Elks</b> lost to <b>the</b> host St. Claude Knights 5-1 to close out their tournament winless.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, {{the city}} {{prohibited}} chlorinated water from being discharged into the creek system, {{and there were}} other pools available in Gainesville, so the pool closed. <b>The</b> <b>Elks</b> Lodge #990 purchased the property and swimming was not permitted. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Elks</b> constructed a deck attached to the upper floor of the springhouse, but no maintenance was performed on the pool's physical structure, which has deteriorated over forty plus years. <b>The</b> <b>Elks</b> Club stocked <b>the</b> pools with bluegills and catfish, and hold an annual fishing derby there.|$|R

5|$|In 1877, in {{connection}} with his commercial fishery, Hume built a hatchery at Ellensburg (Gold Beach), which released fish into the river. In its first year of operation, Hume collected 215,000 salmon eggs and released about 100,000fry. After the first hatchery was destroyed by fire in 1893, Hume built a new hatchery in 1895, and in 1897 he co-operated with the United States Fish Commission in building and operating an egg-collecting station {{at the mouth of}} Elk Creek on the upper Rogue. In 1899, he built a hatchery near Wedderburn, across the river from Gold Beach, and until {{the time of his death}} in 1908 he had salmon eggs shipped to it from <b>the</b> <b>Elk</b> Creek station.|$|E
5|$|John Palliser {{crossed the}} Rockies through a pass in 1858 {{that led to}} the {{headwaters}} of the Palliser River, a tributary of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party referred to it as Palliser's River.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake, but had some trouble making their way back to Alberta; the return route that they had chosen proved too dangerous to negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, they made it back over the Rockies later that year through North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up <b>the</b> <b>Elk</b> River.|$|E
