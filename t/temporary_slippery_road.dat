50|$|Most of {{the schools}} in the {{mountains}} of Mae Sariang District (185 schools with 27,000 children) are only accessible in the dry season.

40|$|Traction {{control system}} (TCS) {{comprises}} the slip control subsystem and the directional stability subsystem. The slip controller {{can enhance the}} traction performance by maintaining the slipratio within a proper range. Additional information about the lateral behavior of the vehicle is necessary to enhance the directional stability during the cornering or lane change on the <b>slippery</b> <b>roads.</b> With an assumption of slowly varying steering input, a new method to measure the mixture of yaw rate and lateral acceleration using the speed difference of non-driven wheels is proposed. Using this measurement, the controller imposes independent pressure to each driven wheel and improves the stability during the cornering on the <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> or acceleration on the split-µ road without additional sensors. The proposed method is verified through the simulation based on the 15 degrees of freedom passenger car model...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{longitudinal}} {{and lateral}} vehicle control for automated highway systems (AHS) are studied together for their coupling effects. It is shown that longitudinal controllers which directly control the wheel slip are inherently more stable, especially during lateral maneuvers on very <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> conditions, than longitudinal controllers {{which do not}} take wheel slip into account...|$|R

40|$|The {{key project}} {{objectives}} were: 1) the demonstration {{and evaluation of}} a low cost data acquisition system that would provide a rich data set accumulated from multiple vehicles, and 2) establish how this data, coupled with situational data from other sources, {{might be used to}} detect <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> conditions, rough road conditions and potentially other beneficial uses by the Michigan DOT. This work is part of an on-going research initiative to identify how state DOTS will use and benefit from the large quantities of data to be generated by future connected vehicle programs and to assist in refining connected vehicle system requirements. This <b>Slippery</b> <b>Road</b> Detection (SRD) project is a focused effort on a specific set of uses but may nevertheless fit under the larger umbrella project called Data Use and Analysis Processing (DUAP) which is similarly identifying Michigan DOT functional requirements for each of the larger operational departments in MDOT...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates a new {{application}} of vehicular sensing: detecting and reporting the <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> conditions. We describe a system and associated algorithm to monitor vehicle skidding events using smartphones and OBD-II (On board Diagnostics) adaptors. This system, {{which we call}} the VehSense, gathers data from smartphone inertial sensors and vehicle wheel speed sensors, and processes the data to monitor <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> conditions in real-time. Specifically, two speed readings are collected: 1) ground speed, which is estimated by vehicle acceleration and rotation, and 2) wheel speed, which is retrieved from the OBD-II interface. The mismatch between these two speeds is used to infer a skidding event. Without tapping into vehicle manufactures' proprietary data (e. g., antilock braking system), VehSense is compatible {{with most of the}} passenger vehicles, and thus can be easily deployed. We evaluate our system on snow-covered roads at Buffalo, and show that it can detect vehicle skidding effectively. Comment: 2017 IEEE 85 th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC 2017 -Spring...|$|R

50|$|Traditional {{automobiles}} of the {{day were}} the typical two-box design, with about 65% of the weight over the rear wheels. When loaded with passengers, the weight distribution tended to become further imbalanced, rising to 75% or more over the rear wheels, resulting in unsafe handling characteristics on <b>slippery</b> <b>roads.</b> Spring rates {{in the rear of}} traditional vehicles were, therefore, necessarily higher, and passengers were subjected to a harsher ride.|$|R

The {{situation}} is comparable to a racecar on a banked circuit with an extremely <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> surface. If the racecar is going too fast then the car will drift wide. For an airship in flight that means a reduction of the weight, compared to the weight when stationary {{with respect to the}} Earth.|$|R
40|$|SRIS (<b>Slippery</b> <b>Road</b> Information System) is a Swedish {{project that}} will be {{accomplished}} during 2006 - 2008. The project aims to develop a system to evaluate winter road conditions in real-time. Information about the road condition is received both from the road weather information stations that are located along the roads and from ordinary vehicles running on the roads. The road friction is estimated from the vehicle's existing sensors and the information is sent to a central unit that merges all information and calculates a low friction index, which is presented on a web page. Further development of the system could {{make it possible to}} send information about low friction to drivers, when they are driving. Information about slipperiness could potentially also be useful for the winter maintenance workforce. In order to investigate professional drivers' and winter maintenance workers' attitudes towards <b>slippery</b> <b>road</b> information systems, two focus groups were conducted. Five winter maintenance workers participated in the first focus group, while the second group consisted of eight professional drivers of heavy vehicles...|$|R
