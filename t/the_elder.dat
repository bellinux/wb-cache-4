5|$|Gian Gastone was {{descended from}} both Cosimo <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> and Lorenzo <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> through the {{marriage}} between Maria Salviati, grandchild of Lorenzo the Magnificent, and Giovanni de' Medici, great-grandson of Lorenzo <b>the</b> <b>Elder.</b> This becomes clearer when one understands their common ancestor: Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici, father to both Lorenzo <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> and Cosimo de' Medici. Thus {{the kings of}} France from Louis XIII and on, are descended from the 'cadet' branch, confirming that Gian Gastone was not the last Medici.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in 586 {{as a general}} serving under Philippicus during the Roman–Persian War of 572–591.

Following the battle, he was sent on a scouting mission to confirm the rumour of the arrival of Persian reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> is {{mentioned}} again circa 595 as magister militum per Armeniam, probably succeeding John Mystacon. The history of Sebeos provides the main {{account of his}} term. He was sent by Maurice to face Armenian rebels led by Samuel Vahewuni and Atat Khorkhoruni. Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> was assisted by Hamazasp Mamikonian.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> is next {{mentioned}} in 608 as Patrician and Exarch of Africa. According to Patriarch Nikephoros, Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> {{had been appointed}} to the position by Maurice prior to the latter's deposition and death in 602. He might have replaced Innocentius, a temporary exarch appointed between 598 and 600. The appointment suggests that Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> enjoyed the favor of Maurice and would have reason to remain loyal to him. Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> and his African court notably lamented the death and execution of Maurice and posthumously praised the fallen emperor.|$|E
25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} Eldad and Medad {{thought that they}} were not worthy to be among <b>the</b> 70 <b>elders,</b> and in reward for their humility, God gave them several rewards more than the elders: (1) Whereas <b>the</b> <b>elders</b> prophesied only for the next day, Eldad and Medad prophesied what would happen for 40 years. (2) Whereas <b>the</b> <b>elders</b> did not enter the Land, Eldad and Medad did. (3) Whereas the Torah does not tell the names of <b>the</b> <b>elders,</b> it does tell the names of Eldad and Medad. (4) Whereas the prophecy of <b>the</b> <b>elders</b> ended, as it came from Moses, the prophecy of Eldad and Medad came from God.|$|R

5|$|Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> resurfaces a year later, {{under the}} command of Comentiolus, in the Battle of Sisarbanon (autumn 589), in the {{vicinity}} of Nisibis. According to the account of Theophylact, Comentiolus supposedly fled towards Theodosiopolis (modern Ra's al-'Ayn) while the battle was still ongoing. Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> took charge of the remaining troops and led them to victory. Theophylact, however, lived and wrote during the reign of Heraclius the Younger, and is strongly biased in favour of his father. His account is thus suspect of exaggerating or even inventing Comentiolus' cowardice with the aim of glorifying Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder.</b> The contemporary Evagrius Scholasticus, for instance, credits Comentiolus with being in the thick of combat, and does not mention Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> at all.|$|E
5|$|John of Antioch and the Patriarch Nikephoros both {{report that}} Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> {{maintained}} correspondence with Priscus, the Count of the Excubitors and former {{commander of the}} army. By that time, Priscus was the son-in-law of Phocas but reportedly held a grudge against the emperor. He allegedly promised Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> support {{in case of a}} rebellion and confirmed it once the rebellion had started. The story is somewhat suspect. While there was major dissension in Constantinople and Priscus did in time defect to Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder,</b> there is nothing to suggest that Priscus helped incite the revolt. Patriarch Nikephoros reports that Heraclius <b>the</b> <b>Elder</b> held council with his brother Gregoras before proclaiming his revolt, possibly indicating that Gregoras was acting as his advisor. He also reports that Gregoras hoped to promote his own son Nicetas to the throne, although this is considered unlikely at best by modern historians.|$|E
