25|$|To {{alleviate}} this fundamentally flawed {{state of}} affairs, Skidmore {{argued for the}} end of the right of inheritance and for the strict leveling of property among adults. His program was straightforward: all property in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> divvied up and redistributed, in equal shares, to American citizens. From that point on, Americans would own their share as private property, and would relinquish it only when they died. Private inheritance would be abolished, and the wealth of the deceased would be pooled into a fund and reserved, in the future, for young people when they reached the age of 18. Upon reaching that age, all Americans would inherit a generous sum of money, understood as their birthright, to get them started in adult life.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{system of}} the {{division}} of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down.... Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising {{as a result of the}} desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is not directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Any government that is willing to assist in recovery will find full co-operation on the part of the USA. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.|$|E
500|$|The {{danger is}} perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to do so {{seems to me to be}} intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.|$|E

As part of the promotion of democracy, Gingrich has said that he wants to re-think the current model of foreign aid.

The executive order remained in force until December when Roosevelt released the Japanese internees, except for those who announced their intention to return to Japan.|$|E

2500|$|After McKenzie's {{resignation}} as President of Fisk on April 10, 1925, he {{rejoined the}} faculty of Juniata College as Professor of Sociology. Former Pennsylvania Governor Martin Grove Brumbaugh and friend assumed the Presidency of Juniata in 1924. Brumbaugh was also an educator who undertook challenging posts to uplift marginalized minorities, He implemented an American-style educational system in Puerto Rico, and held lecturer positions at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University. In 1906, Brumbaugh became superintendent of the Philadelphia Public Schools and gained statewide recognition for his performance in this role. Upon McKenzie's return {{with his family to}} Juniata, Brumbaugh immediately granted McKenzie a six-month leave of absence, and Fayette traveled in France {{with his wife and two}} daughters. In Spring 1926, McKenzie returned to teach, and thereafter served in various capacities as Dean of Men and Director of Extension Services at the Altoona Center, in Altoona, Pennsylvania, which later became part of the Extension System of Pennsylvania State University In 1931, McKenzie was named Director of the Community Center of Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. After retiring from Juniata College in 1941, McKenzie continued his advocacy for marginalized groups. During World War II, McKenzie wrote Pennsylvania Senator James J. Davis that the U.S. Congress [...] "could well afford to set up a commission to deal solely with the task of bringing aid to the Jews of Europe," [...] and that [...] "restrictions on immigration of Jews to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> lifted." [...] A few years later he wrote Pennsylvania Governor Edward Martin seeking commutation of woman on death row who had the mentality of an eight-year-old child. McKenzie wrote that [...] "executing her would be contrary to ethical and legal principles." [...] In June 1954, Professor emeritus McKenzie was awarded a certificate for [...] "distinguished service to adult education in Pennsylvania", the first presentation of such an award in the state. On September 1, 1957, Fayette Avery McKenzie died at the age of 85 in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. McKenzie was survived his two daughters Mrs. William H. (Mary) Ross and Mrs. Harry E.

2500|$|In 2004, Hanson gave {{a mostly}} {{favorable}} review {{to the book}} Colossus by the British historian Niall Ferguson, where Ferguson argued that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> an imperial power {{in the sense of}} preserving the post war order of global free trade, communications, and commerce, and the principal problem with Americans was that they were unwilling to embrace global leadership {{in the same way that}} people in 19th century Britain did. Hanson found much to approve of in Ferguson's book, writing: [...] "In reality, we should be natural imperialists, given our wealth and expertise. Americans are also endowed with an exceptional moral sense. We are a generous people, whose checkered imperial interventions in the past rarely proved profitable or exploitive." [...] Hanson agreed with Ferguson that the principle problem with Americans was an unease at playing the role of an imperialistic power, argued that post-1945 histories of Germany and Japan proved the beneficial results of American occupation and predicted that Iraq under American occupation would become just as much a prosperous and democratic society as Germany and Japan are. Hanson praised Ferguson for his defense of the British Empire as a benevolent force and his thesis that the United States should play the same role in the world as the British Empire, writing: [...] "Does Ferguson propose a new American liberal empire? In fact, he does almost, but not before noting that the British Victorians themselves got a bad rap as exploitive colonialists. In fact, the record of the 18th and 19th centuries prove exactly the opposite: Former and once-prosperous colonies, following autonomy, quickly turned into self-induced miseries, while Britain itself thrived as never before once free of these costly obligations. Empire turns out not to be a means of making money, but instead an idealist pursuit to keep sea lanes open, bullies at bay and nations trading rather than fighting. The world has been lucky to have the Americans fill this vacuum, inasmuch as the British once did a pretty good job of it as well." [...] Hanson, well before the immigration and financial crises of the EU, also praised Ferguson for his very negative picture of the European Union as being both [...] "busy triangulating with our enemies" [...] and [...] "running huge trade deficits with us as we supply their own security needs." [...] He cites appears to agree with Ferguson that Europe is undemocratic, and statist, but that with a population in decline and even worse entitlement overspending than the US, a more broken melting pot, and socialist response to these issues ensuring Europe will be unable generate the unity or idealism required to supplant the US.|$|E
