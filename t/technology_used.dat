Self-directed learning, which is crucial for lifelong learning, can be enhanced by the <b>use</b> <b>technology</b> particularly beyond the classroom settings. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the difference between the perceptions of 5 - 8 graders in low and high income groups about their <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> skills and their English teachers’ <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> skills. It also tested the correlation between their perceptions of their self-directed language learning behaviors and their <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> skills as well as their English teachers’ <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> skills. The population of the study consisted of 145 students. Inter group comparisons and correlational research methods were adopted. The results indicated that the low and high income students’ perceptions did not differ regarding their own <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> skills, and similarly their English teachers’ <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> skills. There was no correlation between the perceptions of the low/high income group combination regarding their <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> skills and their English teachers’ <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> skills. And lastly, their perceptions on their self-directed learning behaviors did not correlate with their perceptions on their <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> skills and their English teachers’ <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> skills.

Previous research had suggested a link between higher levels of <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> and hearing aid success. Design: General <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> was evaluated using a purposefully developed 25 -item questionnaire. Twelve items related to everyday <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> (e. g.

However, there was no evidence that emotional intelligence moderated the relationship between communication <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> and the number of face-to-face interactions. The results for extroversion are converse to those examining emotional intelligence. There is support that extroversion moderated the relationship between communication <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> and the quantity of face-to-face interactions, but not the quality of face-to-face interactions.

5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, the <b>technology</b> <b>used</b> {{to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands and improves the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E

Additionally, research has not adequately addressed the effects among emerging adults who are of particular interest because they <b>use</b> <b>technology</b> at the greatest rates and are at a significant developmental phase for learning to navigate their relationships. The current study used data that was collected at East Carolina University, including 614 total participants. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the connections between patterns of <b>technology</b> <b>use,</b> jealousy, and relationship satisfaction among an emerging adult sample using attachment theory as the theoretical foundation. The research questions being addressed include: 1) Are patterns of <b>technology</b> <b>use,</b> and patterns of <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> with one's romantic partner predicted by one's attachment style? 2) What is the nature of the connection between technology and attachment, and experiences of jealousy in emerging adults' romantic relationships? 3) In what ways are attachment, <b>technology</b> <b>use,</b> <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> with one's romantic partner, and experiences of jealousy predictive of relationship satisfaction during emerging adulthood? Regarding the first research question, the results indicate that increased attachment insecurity was related to higher frequency of <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> and <b>technology</b> <b>use</b> with romantic partner.

5|$|Common battery {{technologies}} used in today's home PV systems include, {{the valve}} regulated lead-acid battery– {{a modified version}} of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries. Lead-acid batteries are currently the predominant <b>technology</b> <b>used</b> in small-scale, residential PV systems, due to their high reliability, low self discharge and investment and maintenance costs, despite shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, lithium-ion batteries have the potential to replace lead-acid batteries in the near future, as they are being intensively developed and lower prices are expected due to economies of scale provided by large production facilities such as the Gigafactory 1. In addition, the Li-ion batteries of plug-in electric cars may serve as a future storage devices in a vehicle-to-grid system. Since most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time, their batteries could be used to let electricity flow from the car to the power lines and back.

Specifically, when participants perceived that their partner <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> often, they reported lower relationship satisfaction.
