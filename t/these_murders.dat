5|$|After the {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, Hitler ordered that the Polish leadership and intelligentsia should be destroyed. The Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen (Special Prosecution Book Poland)—lists of people to be killed—had been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939. The Einsatzgruppen (special task forces) performed <b>these</b> <b>murders</b> {{with the support of}} the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz (Germanic Self-Protection Group), a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland. Members of the SS, the Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces), and the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police; Orpo) also shot civilians during the Polish campaign. Approximately 65,000 civilians were killed by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, they killed Jews, prostitutes, Romani people, and the mentally ill.|$|E

50|$|A {{significant}} {{element of}} the controversy surrounding Gross' activities is that after the children had been murdered, parts of their bodies, particularly their brains, were preserved and retained for future study for decades after the murders.

25|$|Having {{previously}} {{arranged the}} murder of mafia boss Joe Masseria on 15 April 1931 in order to consolidate organized crime in New York City under Salvatore Maranzano, mafia boss Lucky Luciano then ordered the murders of Maranzano and those cappos of Maranzano and Masseria whom Luciano saw as threats. <b>These</b> <b>murders</b> allegedly occurred on September 10, 1931 which {{marked the end of}} the Castellammarese War in New York City and in mafia parlance is known as the Night of the Sicilian Vespers. This was later proved to be mostly a myth in mafia culture as no hard evidence exists that all <b>these</b> <b>murders</b> – outside of Maranzano and a few others – actually occurred.|$|E
25|$|June 8, 1980: Franklin {{confessed to}} killing cousins Darrell Lane (14) and Dante Evans Brown (13) in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Forty naked bodies of children were discovered in Machecoul in 1437.|$|E
25|$|Chikatilo {{confessed to}} three {{additional}} murders which police {{were unable to}} verify. According to Chikatilo, these three murders were committed {{in and around the}} city of Shakhty between 1980 and 1982. Despite his confessions, police were unable to either match his descriptions of these victims to any missing persons reports, or locate any human remains, despite thoroughly searching the locations where Chikatilo stated he had committed <b>these</b> <b>murders.</b> Therefore, he was never charged with these three further killings he claimed to have committed.|$|E
25|$|At 17 {{years of}} age, Rita decided in November 1991 {{to follow in}} her sister-in-law's footsteps, hoping to obtain justice for <b>these</b> <b>murders</b> from the legal system.

She also named the men who had killed her father and her brother.|$|E

25|$|Bonin {{and three}} of his four known accomplices were convicted of 14 murders {{committed}} between August 5, 1979, and June 2, 1980; Bonin was also charged with two additional murders {{for which he was}} acquitted at his first trial in Los Angeles County. Of <b>these</b> <b>murders</b> for which Bonin was convicted, 10 were committed in Los Angeles County and four in nearby Orange County.

25|$|Bonin was {{not brought}} to trial for the murders of Mark Shelton, Robert Wirostek, John Kilpatrick, Michael McDonald, or the John Doe whose body was found close to a Kern County {{reservoir}} in November 1979 because police did not find sufficient evidence upon any of the victims' bodies which could conclusively link Bonin alone to the crimes. Police did charge Bonin and Butts {{with the murder of}} the John Doe, and those of Mark Shelton and Robert Wirostek (alongside that of Darin Lee Kendrick) in October and November 1980. Bonin was formally charged with <b>these</b> <b>murders</b> at a pretrial hearing held on January 2, 1981.|$|E

25|$|In 1987 Chikatilo {{killed three}} times. On each {{occasion}} the murder took place {{while he was}} on a business trip far away from the Rostov Oblast, and none of <b>these</b> <b>murders</b> were linked to the manhunt in Rostov. Chikatilo's first murder in 1987 was committed on 16 May, when he encountered a 12-year-old boy, named Oleg Makarenkov, at a train station in the Urals town of Revda. Makarenkov was lured from the station with the promise of sharing a meal with Chikatilo at his dacha; he was murdered in woodland close to the station, although his remains would remain undiscovered until 1991. In July, he killed a 12-year-old boy, named Ivan Bilovetsky, in the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhia, and on 15 September, he killed a 16-year-old vocational school student, named Yuri Tereshonok, in woodland on the outskirts of Leningrad.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, 2011 one full-patch member, one prospect, and one sympathizer of the Belgium Outlaws MC {{were shot}} and killed by rival bikers of the Belgian Hells Angels. The killings took place in Eisden, not far from Maasmechelen where the Outlaws had opened a new clubhouse just several days earlier. Two days after the murders several Hells Angels were linked to the murder and arrested, {{including}} the president of the 'Zwartberg' chapter. The funeral of the full-patch member, Freddy Put, was joined by some 200 Outlaws from across Europe. The investigation concerning the murders in Eisden is ongoing and is made difficult because within both the Hells Angels and the Outlaws there is a code of silence called 'omerta'. In a response to <b>these</b> <b>murders</b> the Belgian Army is investigating the possibility of removing members of criminal MC's from their ranks since two of the primary suspects were paracommandos.|$|E
