500|$|During {{a review}} in webcomic podcast Digital Strips, {{commentator}} Daku describes Kevin and Kell as [...] "one {{of the few}} anthropomorphic strips <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> like," [...] saying that [...] "this is as if animals had a society." [...] Zampzon praises {{the quality of the}} artwork, but complains that the strip relies on too many animal jokes.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.0/10, ("Impressive") writing, [...] "For an episode that began ho-hum, things certainly got interesting {{in the last}} half, with two surprise introductions." [...] Goldman praised the fight sequences {{as well as the}} unveiling of Tombstone and Mary Jane. Goldman concluded his review by writing, [...] "It's a testament to this show that it has it exactly right that Peter Parker's everyday, unmasked persona is so integral to the story, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> am very curious how this dance goes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{wedding dress}} was a Vera Wang {{original}} dress from {{a while ago}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> wore on a certain occasion and had it in storage and when {{we came up with}} the concept for the video that had the element of a wedding in it, I said, ‘well, I do have my old wedding dress,’. 'It’s still worth [...] for me ’cause I can’t believe I was ever married but whatever, end of story. And I knew that we wouldn’t {{be able to get a}} fabulous dress like in two days so I just took that dress out of the storage – it has a 27-foot train and it was just all hand-beaded and stuff and so I figured we might as well get a use out of it.' ...|$|E

60|$|A {{while later}} I {{ran over to}} {{announce}} to the amazed Tom Peters <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was <b>actually</b> going to Harvard with him. He stood in the half-lighted hallway, {{his hands in his}} pockets, blinking at me.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, my dear, {{that these}} Irish have the strongest imaginations in the world; and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>actually</b> persuaded poor Mac <b>that</b> he and <b>I</b> were friends in Spain. Everybody knew Mac, {{who was a}} {{character}} in his way, and believed him.|$|R
500|$|The episode {{features}} cultural {{references to}} many American and British films. Woods becoming {{a convenience store}} clerk {{to prepare for a}} film is similar to Nick Lang (Michael J. Fox) becoming a police officer in the 1991 film The Hard Way, which Woods also starred in (interestingly, this is a reversal of roles: Woods played the cop that Lang was saddled with in the film). When Kent asks Homer if he is willing to go undercover to [...] "nail" [...] Apu, Homer replies: [...] "No way, man, get yourself another patsy!" [...] This is a reference to a line in the 1991 film JFK. The scene of Homer and Apu riding on mules to the Springfield Airport, with their luggage strapped to the mules' backs, is similar to a scene from the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia. In his Kwik-E-Mart job interview, the interviewer asks Woods why he would want to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, to which he replies: [...] "To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, I kind of like to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, in True Believer I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then, the film Chaplin I had a little cameo in <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> traveled back in time, back to the twenties, where... Well, I've said too much," [...] referencing the 1989 film True Believer and the 1992 film Chaplin.|$|E
500|$|In a retrospective, Paul Mallinson of Computer & Video Games (CVG) {{wrote that}} the game's {{production}} was [...] "speedy, focused and fun". Castle said that, because the company was creating other titles at the time, development of Command & Conquer was not a [...] "working party"; but lead programmer Joe Bostic later {{said that it was}} [...] "so much fun that I would sometimes marvel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> got paid as well." [...] The game's playtesters were enthusiastic about the game during development, which Castle later said had encouraged the team to work harder. The team created live-action FMV cutscenes for the game. These cutscenes contain no professional actors aside from Kucan, who played Kane and was heavily involved in their production. The cast is made up of Westwood team members, and a low budget meant that filming took place in [...] "spare rooms" [...] and warehouses. Castle later said that the team [...] "had no illusions that we were as good as TV or film," [...] but that the cutscenes were not intentionally campy. He credited Kucan with [...] "taking ragtag group of people who had no business {{in front of a camera}} and making something reasonably good." [...] To replace the spice from Dune II, the team introduced Tiberium, which was inspired by the 1957 B-movie The Monolith Monsters. Castle said that the team's goal in both cases was to create [...] "a central resource that everybody was fighting over." [...] As with Dune II, the soundtrack was composed by Frank Klepacki.|$|E
2500|$|In their {{feature on}} Goldman, IGN said [...] "It's a {{testament}} to just how truly great William Goldman is at his best <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> had to think hard about what to select as his 'Must-See' cinematic work". [...] The site described his script for All the President's Men as a [...] "model of storytelling clarity... and artful manipulation".|$|E
6000|$|But he {{softened}} when {{he looked}} at the accounts and saw <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>actually</b> booked the unparalleled number of thirty-three new subscribers, and had the vegetables to show for it, cordwood, cabbage, beans, and unsalable turnips enough to run the family for two years! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They're good! They're damned good! They'll go like flame! I {{shall have}} an {{exhibition}} of them on my own brazen hook. And that man would have cheated me out of it! Do you know that I'm sorry now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>actually</b> hit him?' ...|$|R

2500|$|On October 18, 2011, Wolf {{was arrested}} in New York during the Occupy Wall Street protests, and spent {{about half an hour}} in a cell. [...] Speaking about her arrest, Wolf said, [...] "I was taken into custody for disobeying an {{unlawful}} order. [...] The issue is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> know New York City permit law ... I didn’t choose to get myself arrested. I chose to obey the law and that didn’t protect me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{songs that}} were {{recorded}} early in production remained {{close to their}} demo counterparts, while others were changed drastically. Originally, [...] "Never Tear Us Apart" [...] was a piano ballad having no orchestral structure at all; the song's original arrangement is featured on Kicks 25th anniversary reissue. The demo of [...] "Mediate" [...] was also longer; when Andrew first played its demo in the studio, [...] "Need You Tonight" [...] was playing in the background. [...] Upon hearing both tracks being played simultaneously, Nicholas labored to have the two tracks combined. Nicholas said in the band's official autobiography, [...] "I rewound his tape and hit play just as [...] "Need You Tonight" [...] ended and synced up so perfectly <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> thought something was wrong".|$|E
2500|$|Becker and Fagen {{began playing}} in local groups. One such group, {{known as the}} Don Fagen Jazz Trio, the Bad Rock Group and later the Leather Canary, {{included}} future comedy star Chevy Chase on drums. They played covers of songs by the Rolling Stones ("Dandelion"), Moby Grape ("Hey Grandma"), and Willie Dixon ("Spoonful"), {{as well as some}} original compositions. Terence Boylan, another Bard musician, remembered that Fagen took readily to the beatnik life while attending college: [...] "They never came out of their room, they stayed up all night. They looked like ghosts— black turtlenecks and skin so white that it looked like yogurt. Absolutely no activity, chain-smoking Lucky Strikes and dope." [...] Fagen himself would later remember it as [...] "probably the only time in my life <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> had friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! I {{must not}} attempt to {{describe}} my own state of mind. When <b>I</b> tell you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am <b>actually</b> afraid of dying before I can give my sweet love the first kiss, you will understand and pity me. When night comes, I feel sometimes half mad.|$|R
5000|$|Quentin Tarantino {{said the}} film {{was one of his}} inspirations for Kill Bill. [...] "Why I love Hannie Caulder so much is Robert Culp. He is so {{magnificent}} in <b>that</b> movie. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> think there's a bit of similarity between Sonny Chiba and Uma (in Kill Bill) and Raquel Welch and Robert Culp in Hannie Caulder." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Sad Girl" [...] {{was written}} about being [...] "the other woman" [...] in an affair. Del Rey wrote [...] "Money Power Glory" [...] as a {{reaction}} to her rise to fame. About writing it, she says, [...] "I was in more of a sardonic mood. Like, if all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was <b>actually</b> going to be allowed to have by the media was money, loads of money, then fuck it... What <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> wanted was something quiet and simple: a writer's community and respect".|$|R
2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel {{beginning}} to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going {{to a place of}} calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E
2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote [...] "Kim" [...] {{at a time in}} which {{he and his wife were}} separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. [...] " [...] The song [...] "Stan" [...] was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for [...] "Stan" [...] differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: [...] "'Stan' was one of the few songs <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. [...] " [...] Dido later heard [...] "Stan" [...] and enjoyed it, and observed, [...] "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it. ' When they sent [...] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing. '" ...|$|E

60|$|Who that dwells in America has {{not heard}} of the bright fields and green hedges of England, and longed to behold them? Even so had it been with me; and now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was <b>actually</b> in England, <b>I</b> {{resolved}} not to go away without having a good, long look at the open fields.|$|R
60|$|Just {{after noon}} we entered these narrow, crooked streets, {{by the ancient}} and the famed Damascus Gate, and now for several hours I {{have been trying to}} {{comprehend}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am <b>actually</b> in the illustrious old city where Solomon dwelt, where Abraham held converse with the Deity, and where walls still stand that witnessed the spectacle of the Crucifixion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I builded {{better than}} I knew, Torp," [...] he said, without {{stopping}} the dance. [...] "They're good! They're damned good! They'll go like flame!

Do you know that I'm sorry now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>actually</b> hit him?" ...|$|R
60|$|I now {{thought that}} the general ridicule would {{overwhelm}} me. Two or three came closer, as if in pity or curiosity; and, at last, one cried out <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> wore clothes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I dreamed {{last night}} that this unhappy wife of mine was dead. The dream was so vivid <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> got out of my bed {{and opened the door}} of her room and listened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite to <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> turned {{tail and}} ran away from him;--not as we ordinarily do in society when we sneak off under some pretence, leaving the pretender {{to think that he}} has made himself very pleasant; but with a full {{declaration}} of my opinion and intention." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{worst of}} it was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was <b>actually</b> typing my manuscripts {{at the same time}} I was trying to master that machine.

3000|$|When I {{went to a}} conference, I {{was given}} a chance to test my lung {{capacity}} of my lung age.

30|$|<b>Actually</b> <b>I</b> {{would have}} liked to have pursued it a bit but we had already spent more than the allotted amount of time on this {{demonstration}} and I had shown them periodicity for shorter periods already so I think they had grasped the concept quite well so the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn’t <b>actually</b> get a period of 16 bugged me a bit but not enough to ruin the rest of the lecture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Ralph," [...] {{said the}} girl, {{looking up at}} him with {{moistened}} eyes, [...] "she talked to me so sweetly and gave me such good advice <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> cried. And never before, dear Ralph, did good advice make me feel so happy that I had to cry." ...|$|E
60|$|At last I tried a big alder, {{and with}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> touched a few, and even landed several on the {{shelving}} bank.

60|$|My comrades took it {{for granted}} that I was equally eager with them to be where I could do my share of {{fighting}} the Britishers, and so stirred up was I by the game of fisticuffs ashore <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> forgot to be frightened by the prospect of taking part in a battle.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{finally got}} this opportunity," [...] said Michael Jaffe. [...] "I had chased the rights {{numerous}} times. One {{of the reasons}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never <b>actually</b> {{tried to make it}} as a series was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't believe a network would ever let us make it the right way. Then A came along, and Allen Sabinson. I've known him for years and years. He swore he'd let me make it the right way.|$|R
60|$|He saw {{everything}} he related.

6000|$|... "I don't mean {{to imply}} {{that we have been}} {{intimate}} lately," [...] she said. [...] "I came to Europe nine years ago, and since then, of course, I have not seen him often.
