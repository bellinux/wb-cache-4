40|$|We {{consider}} the main and essential legislative and applicative issues of metrological assurance of thread joints in the Russian Federation and international practice. Basic {{limitations of the}} existing measuring methods of the main <b>thread</b> <b>gage</b> parameter - the pitch diameter of thread - are represented. We give {{the description of the}} first echelon state working calibration standard for linear unit, placed in service in D. I. Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM), including the general field of applications and metrological characteristics according to the state verification schedule. The possibilities of etalon application in the field of measurements of thread gages parameters are shown. Technical solutions for reducing the components of uncertainty of measurements of the pitch diameter using the etalon are described: temperature stability; reducing of external vibration effects on measuring procedure; developing of the special software for minimizing human factor and increasing automation level of the measuring procedure. The solutions described have enabled to achieve expanded uncertainty value about 0. 7 - 1. 0 microns. As a result, we also propose further ways for development and improvement of the system of metrology assurance in the field of thread joints...|$|E
