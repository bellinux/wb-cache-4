40|$|The {{malformation}} of {{sheet metal}} tapping screw threads in the screw threading process increases {{the cost of}} screw threading dies and their maintenance. Die factories do not reveal their screw <b>threading</b> <b>die</b> design techniques, so production and maintenance processes are established by trial-and-error or worker experience and passing down such techniques and documenting quality control is difficult. In this study, screw thread forming design and process analysis were carried out by combining computer-aided design software with computer-aided metal forming analysis software. Simulation results were verified in an actual forming process. The sheet metal tapping screw forging size error was less than 0. 90 %, except at a sharp angle, which was associated with an error of 3. 075 %, thereby demonstrating {{the accuracy of the}} simulated forming process. The numerical analysis process can be utilized to shorten forming development time; {{to reduce the number of}} die tests, and to improve product quality and die service life, reducing the cost of development and promoting the overall competitiveness of the company...|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} trapezoidal thread form, {{and still}} probably {{the one most}} commonly encountered worldwide, is the Acme thread form ( [...] ). The Acme thread was developed in 1894 as a profile well suited to power screws that has various advantages over the square thread, which had been the form of choice until then. It is easier to cut via either single-point <b>threading</b> or <b>die</b> than the square thread is (because the latter's shape requires tool bit or die tooth geometry that is poorly suited to cutting); it wears better than square (because the wear can be compensated for); it is stronger than a comparably sized square thread; and it makes for smoother engagement of the half nuts on a lathe leadscrew than square does.|$|R
2500|$|All {{threading}} could feasibly be done using a single-point tool, {{but because}} of the high speed and thus low unit cost of other methods (e.g., tapping, <b>die</b> <b>threading,</b> and thread rolling and forming), single-point threading is usually only used when other factors of the manufacturing process happen to favor it (e.g., if only a few threads need to be made, if an unusual or unique thread is required, or if {{there is a need for}} very high concentricity with other part features machined during the same setup.) ...|$|R

40|$|Ancient luxury fabrics, {{preserved}} from {{as early}} as the seventh century, testify to the long history of Japanese fascination with symbolic images on cloth. By the nineteenth century Japanese society had developed a complex vocabulary of symbols that was easily identified by both commoners and elites. This paper will explore sophisticated, implied messages expressed in this symbolic language in e-gasuri, a textile technique that came to full flower during the same century. E-gasuri is the Japanese term for the process of resist <b>dying</b> <b>thread</b> (ikat) which skilled artisans used to create pictures – sometimes simple, sometimes intricate-in fabric. Since the threads are dyed before weaving the woven images have blurred outlines which the Japanese find an appealing aspect of the e-gasuri esthetic. All echelons of Japanese society treasured the cloth made with this labor-intensive method and used e-gasuri into the early to mid-twentieth century. Subtlety and erudition are widely honored Japanese values. The paper will demonstrate how both traits can be discovered in the symbolism of e-gasuri textiles. Examples of nineteenth and twentieth century kimono, jackets and futon (bedding) covers will be used in decoding clever visual interpretations of Japanese celebratory phrases. Complicated combinations of common symbols will range from brooms, rakes and pine park signaling wishes for a long and loving marriage to eggplants intrinsic to a New Year’s greeting. E-gasuri textiles, with their indistinct illustrations, provided a medium well suited for expressing ingenious variations of everyday symbols that inferred familiar sayings and concepts...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} into Pressure Assisted Macrosegregation during the squeeze casting of an aluminium alloy, LM 25, and an aluminium based silicon carbide particulate metal matrix composite. The squeeze casting process is particularly prone {{to this type of}} segregation which results in large areas of solute rich material in the final casting. The fundamental causes of the segregation have, until now, not been fully understood. This has restricted the use of squeeze casting as it was believed that the cause was a fundamental manufacturing weakness. An existing squeeze casting facility at Warwick was used to produce cast samples for study. The facility produces simple tensile test bars. Inserts for the die were designed to specifically produce the segregation within the castings. Thermocouples were <b>threaded</b> through the <b>die</b> wall and placed within the casting to enable the recording of the thermal history during solidification. Samples were taken from the castings, mounted, ground and polished for study via an optical microscope. A mechanism for the formation of the segregation is proposed. The primary causes of the segregation are shown to be surface tension, of the molten alloy, and the design of the component. The widespread belief that this form of segregation is a fundamental weakness of the squeeze casting process is therefore shown to be false. A theoretical model to a first approximation of the segregation, using the Young and Laplace equation is given. Using the pressure difference across a thin film the minimum web width, or radius of a corner, for no significant segregation can be found. The model is expanded and presented in a graphical form which is easy to understand and provides the designer with some tools to enable a sound casting to be produced. By sensible design the segregation phenomenon can be significantly reduced and in some cases eliminated completely. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} elegant indirectness that certain e-gasuri {{patterns}} exhibit while using traditional symbols to express familiar Japanese sayings and concepts. E-gasuri is the Japanese word for fabrics patterned with pictures created with the ikat resist dying technique. Kasuri essentially means ikat. Kasuri becomes gasuri {{in the compound}} word e-gasuri. E means picture. The ikat technique of <b>dying</b> <b>threads</b> before they are woven produces images with blurred outlines. This blurred appearance is a treasured aspect of the e-gasuri aesthetic. E-gasuri is usually (but not exclusively) associated today with indigo resist dyed blue and white cotton and bast fabrics. The following three paragraphs describe the techniques that were most often used to create {{the majority of the}} Japanese picture ikat textiles that survive today. By the early 19 th century Japanese weavers were creating e-gasuri using yet unwoven warp threads, weft threads or both which were tightly wrapped by hand at predetermined intervals with a material that protected the wrapped areas of thread from absorbing dye when submerged in dye vats, usually filled with indigo. When woven with painstaking care the precisely calculated predetermined white resist segments produced pictures in the finished cloth. By the 1830 ’s e-gasuri warp or weft threads were being patterned, again before being woven, with pairs of wooden boards carved with mirror images of a design that created a resist when clamped together over the threads. The clamped blocks could be submerged in dye vats. Often, holes were drilled into the blocks to allow dye into selected areas. Sometimes dyes were poured directly into the holes. Wax could also be poured into the holes to create a resist for subsequent dye baths. These textiles are called itajime-gasuri but they often include hand tied resist design elements as well...|$|R
6000|$|In civilisation, on {{the other}} hand, we owe {{comparatively}} little to the direct Teutonic influence. The native Anglo-Saxon culture was low, and even before its transplantation to Britain it had undergone some modification by mediate mercantile transactions with Rome and the Mediterranean states. The alphabet, coins, {{and even a few}} southern words, (such as [...] "alms") had already filtered through to the shores of the Baltic. After the colonisation of Britain, the Anglo-Saxons learnt something of the higher agriculture from their Romanised serfs, and adopted, as early as the heathen period, some small portion of the Roman system, so far as regarded roads, fortifications, and, perhaps buildings. The Roman towns still stood in their midst, and a fragment, at least, of the Romanised population still carried on commerce with the half-Roman Frankish kingdom across the Channel. The re-introduction of Christianity was {{at the same time the}} re-introduction of Roman culture in its later form. The Latin language and the Mediterranean arts once more took their place in Britain. The Romanising prelates,–Wilfrith, Theodore, Dunstan,–were also the leaders of civilisation in their own times. The Norman Conquest brought England into yet closer connection with the Continent; and Roman law and Roman arts still more deeply affected our native culture. Norman artificers supplanted the rude English handicraftsmen in many cases, and became a dominant class in towns. The old English literature, and especially the old English poetry, died utterly out with Piers Plowman; while a new literature, based upon Romance models, took its origin with Chaucer and the other Court poets. Celtic-Latin rhyme ousted the genuine Teutonic alliteration. With the Renaissance, the triumph of the southern culture was complete. Greek philosophy and Greek science formed the starting-point for our modern developments. The ecclesiastical revolt from papal Rome was accompanied by a literary and artistic return to the models of pagan Rome. The Renaissance was, in fact, the throwing off of all that was Teutonic and mediæval, the resumption of progressive thought and scientific knowledge, at the point where it had been interrupted by the Germanic inroads of the fifth century. The unjaded vigour of the German races, indeed, counted for much; and Europe took up the lost <b>thread</b> of the <b>dying</b> empire with a youthful freshness very different from the effete listlessness of the Mediterranean culture in its last stage. Yet it is none the less true that our whole civilisation is even now the carrying out and completion of the Greek and Roman culture in new fields and with fresh intellects. We owe little here to the Anglo-Saxon; we owe everything to the great stream of western culture, which began in Egypt and Assyria, permeated Greece and the Archipelago, spread to Italy and the Roman empire, and, finally, now embraces the whole European and American world. The Teutonic intellect and the Teutonic character have largely modified the spirit of the Mediterranean civilisation; but the tools, the instruments, the processes themselves, are all legacies from a different race. Englishmen did not invent letters, money, metallurgy, glass, architecture, and science; they received them all ready-made, from Italy and the Ægean, or more remotely still from the Euphrates and the Nile. Nor is it necessary to add that in religion we have no debt to the Anglo-Saxon, our existing creed being entirely derived through Rome from the Semitic race.|$|R
