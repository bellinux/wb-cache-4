5|$|Stegosaurus {{made its}} major public debut as a papier mache model {{commissioned}} by the U.S. National Museum of Natural History for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition. <b>The</b> <b>model</b> <b>was</b> based on Knight's latest miniature with the double row of staggered plates, and was exhibited in the United States Government Building at the exposition in St. Louis before being relocated to Portland, Oregon for the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in 1905. <b>The</b> <b>model</b> <b>was</b> moved to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History (now the Arts and Industries Building) in Washington, D.C. along with other prehistory displays, and to the current National Museum of Natural History building in 1911. Following renovations to the museum in the 2010s, <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>was</b> moved once again for display at the Museum of the Earth in Ithaca, New York.|$|E

5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>was</b> popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s {{in his book}} Peddling Prosperity. In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, the Talbot Group was {{merged into}} Peugeot within PSA, and {{responsibility}} for <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>was</b> devolved to France. The Whitley design studio was dissolved, {{and some of the}} designers crossed over to British Leyland, where they joined their former boss Roy Axe. PSA had by then already started work on a replacement for the Samba, based on the Citroën AX, a few prototypes of which—essentially rebadged AXs—were created in 1983/84. The Samba sold reasonably well throughout 1982 and 1983, after which sales began to suffer, partly because of the model's aging and partly because of competition from the very popular Peugeot 205, which created powerful (and successful) internal competition within PSA for the little Talbot.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Smithsonian Institution {{commissioned}} {{aeronautical engineer}} Paul MacCready {{to build a}} half-scale working model of Quetzalcoatlus northropi.

The coaster-crash scenes were filmed with the actors performing {{in front of a}} green screen with a CGI background. Several of the roller coaster's cars were suspended with bungee cords to film the crash, and the deaths required CGI onscreen effects; each actor had a corresponding CGI double.|$|E

5|$|In 1890 Lilly {{and other}} civic leaders founded the Commercial Club; Lilly was elected {{as its first}} president. The club, renamed the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce in 1912, was the primary vehicle for Lilly's city {{development}} goals. It was instrumental in making numerous advances for the city, including citywide paved streets, elevated railways to allow vehicles and people to pass beneath them, and a city sewage system. The companies that provided these services were created through private and public investments and operated at low-cost; in practice they belonged to the companies' customers, who slowly bought each company back from its initial investors. <b>The</b> <b>model</b> <b>was</b> later followed other regions of Indiana to establish water and electric utility companies. The Commercial Club members also helped fund the creation of parks, monuments, and memorials, as well as successfully attracted investment from other businessmen and organizations to expand Indianapolis's growing industries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the Swedish Air Force saw {{the need for}} an {{interceptor}} that could reach enemy bombers at a higher altitude than the J 29 Tunnan that formed the backbone of the fighter force. A contract for 120 Hawker Hunter Mk 50s (equivalent to the Mk 4) was therefore signed on 29 June 1954 and the first aircraft was delivered on 26 August 1955. <b>The</b> <b>model</b> <b>was</b> designated J 34 and was assigned to the F 8 and F 18 wings that defended Stockholm. The J 34 was armed with four 30mm (1.18in) cannon and two Sidewinders. The Swedish Air Force's aerobatic team Acro Hunters used five J 34s during the late 1950s. The J 34s were gradually replaced by supersonic J 35 Draken and reassigned to less prominent air wings, F 9 in Gothenburg and F 10 in Ängelholm, during the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Shots {{where the}} {{spacecraft}} had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>was</b> stationary and camera was driven along a track {{on a special}} mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked to the camera motor—making it possible to repeat camera moves and match speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same shot. In moving shots of the long Discovery One spacecraft, {{in order to keep}} the entire model in focus, multiple passes had to be made with the lighting on it blocked out section by section. In each pass the camera would be focused on the one lit section. Many matting techniques were tried to block out the stars behind the models, with film makers sometimes resorting to hand tracing frame by frame around the image of the spacecraft (rotoscoping) to create the matte.|$|E
5|$|The Bird-of-Prey's {{travel through}} time {{was one of}} the most {{difficult}} effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to <b>the</b> <b>model</b> <b>was</b> accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a moire pattern as its position shifted. Animator John Knoll added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.|$|E
