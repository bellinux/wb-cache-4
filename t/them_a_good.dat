They are often fed to cephalopods, fish larvae, and {{commercial}} farmed shrimp due to their small size and low cost.

Mucinous endometrial carcinomas are most often stage I and grade I, giving <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> prognosis. They typically have well-differentiated columnar cells organized into glands with the characteristic mucin in the cytoplasm. Mucinous carcinomas must be differentiated from cervical adenocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Cecil and Noirin Carmody {{met with}} Sean Brennan, then-head of {{publishing}} at Virgin Interactive, and spoke {{about how the}} Knights Templar would make an ideal subject to base a game on. Later, Virgin agreed to issue the game. In a September 1992 interview for French magazine Génération 4, Charles Cecil stated that he had begun working on a scenario for Revolution's third game, after 1992's Lure of the Temptress and 1994's then-upcoming Beneath a Steel Sky. The game would be set in Paris with a Templar story line. The following month, Cecil visited Paris to research the Templars; after reading The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, he was certain there was enough known about the Templars to make <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> subject for a game. Cecil, Dave Cummins, and Jonathan Howard began work on the story and design. Cecil and Cummins attended a film-writing course and their script was read by Alan Drury, a senior BBC scriptwriter and dramatist. Revolution artist Steve Ince created initial location sketches for the game before working on Beneath a Steel Sky. He was promoted to producer halfway through the project.|$|E

25|$|Quartets are trees {{consisting}} of four leaves. In bifurcating (fully resolved) trees, each internal branch induces a quartet whose leaves are either subtrees {{of the original}} tree or actual leaves of the original tree. If the topology of a quartet extracted from the reference species tree {{is embedded in the}} gene tree, the quartet is compatible with the gene tree. Conversely, incompatible strongly supported quartets indicate potential HGT events. Quartet mapping methods are much more computationally efficient and naturally handle heterogeneous representation of taxa among gene families, making <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> basis for developing large-scale scans for HGT, looking for highways of gene sharing in databases of hundreds of complete genomes.|$|E

In case (b), the energy of the transition state is close to neither the reactant nor the product, making none of <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> structural model for the transition state. Further information would be needed in order to predict the structure or characteristics of the transition state. Case (c) depicts the potential diagram for an endothermic reaction, in which, according to the postulate, the transition state should more closely resemble that of the intermediate or the product.|$|E
25|$|Those mining {{communities}} {{had good}} working class values {{and a sense}} of family values. The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were able to deal with the few troublesome kids. If they had any problems they would take the kid round the back and give <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> clip round the ear {{and that would be the}} end of that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous as a result of the strike.|$|E

25|$|After the disappointing {{performance}} in the 2009 Série A, when Palmeiras almost won the league and after some bad results {{in the end of}} the championship, finished in 5th qualifying only to the Copa Sudamericana and not to the major South American tournament, the Copa Libertadores, the team started the competition playing against Brazilian rivals, Vitória in Salvador. Palmeiras played well but couldn't stop Vitória from scoring two goals, one of <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> free-kick by Ramon, the club's captain, and the other in the stoppage time. The final result was not good, because the team had to win by a 3-goal margin to qualify to the Round of 16, or face the penalties if a 2-goal win happened to come. The 2nd leg in São Paulo, saw a marvelous 3-0 win with very good performances from the whole squad, mainly from Tadeu, who scored twice and Marcos Assunção who commanded the team's victory with an outstanding match and a beautiful free-kick goal from 35 meters in the dying minutes, assuring a qualification to the next round with the aggregat score of 3-2.|$|E
25|$|Loneliness is {{a common}} theme in Fassbinder's work, {{together}} {{with the idea that}} power becomes a determining factor in all human relationships. His characters yearn for love, but seem condemned to exert an often violent control over those around <b>them.</b> <b>A</b> <b>good</b> example is The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (Die bitteren Tränen der Petra von Kant, 1972) which was adapted by Fassbinder from his plays. The title character is a fashion designer who lives in a self-created dreamland and the action is restricted mostly to her lavish bedroom. After the failure of her second marriage, Petra falls hopelessly and obsessively in love with Karin, a cunning working-class young woman who wants a career in modeling. The model's exploitation of Petra mirrors Petra's extraordinary psychological abuse of her silent assistant, Marlene. Fassbinder portrays the slow meltdown of these relationships as inevitable, and his actresses (there are no men in the film) move in a slow, trance-like way that hints at a vast world of longing beneath the beautiful, brittle surface.|$|E

500|$|The exact {{relationship}} between Fielding's The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling and Richardson's The History of Sir Charles Grandison cannot be known, but the character Charles Grandison {{was designed as}} a morally [...] "better" [...] hero than the character Tom Jones. In 1749, a friend asked Richardson [...] "to give the world his idea of a good man and fine gentleman combined". Richardson hesitated to begin such a project, and he did not work on it until he was prompted the next year (June 1750) by Mrs. Donnelland and Miss Sutton, who were [...] "both very intimate with one Clarissa Harlowe: and both extremely earnest with him to give <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> man". [...] Near the end of 1751, Richardson sent a draft of the novel to Mrs. Donnellan, and the novel was being finalised in the middle of 1752.|$|E

[...] Lipa also had the idea of including a group of flamingos into the clip, as she considered <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> representation of female friendship. The director contacted Teresa Barcelo to choreograph the dance routine and bring that [...] "narrative of togetherness and empowerment" [...] into it. Barcelo also took inspiration from the flamingos' movements while planning the choreography. More than 200 women auditioned for the video, with eight being selected.|$|E
500|$|Soule rarely gets to see {{the game}} he is {{composing}} for in any sort of completed state before he begins work; as a result he bases many of his musical decisions on the company's previous games. He credits his success with this strategy {{to the fact that}} many of the games he works on come from studios that have created several successful games in the past. He finds it much easier to compose a soundtrack to a game that is very visual in nature, such as a role-playing game. He also likes {{to see the}} storyboards and concept art for the game, as he considers <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> provider of [...] "pure emotional intent" [...] for the game. When composing a soundtrack, the first thing that he decides is the tempo and the amount of energy the music will have; this decision is as much based on the genre of the game as it is the artistic style of the game. After that, Soule starts composing smaller tracks in the soundtrack, to make sure that they match up with the vision of the game before he starts on the major themes. Soule tries to compose all of a game's soundtrack himself rather than in a team, though he sometimes collaborates with his brother.|$|E

[...] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that Avatar would need significant [...] "repeat business" [...] just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed Avatar could inspire the same [...] "sharing" [...] reaction as Titanic.
