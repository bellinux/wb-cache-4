5|$|Another {{strategic}} Croatian {{foreign policy}} {{goal for the}} 2000s was NATO membership. Croatia {{was included in the}} Partnership for Peace in 2000, invited <b>to</b> <b>NATO</b> membership in 2008 and formally joined the alliance on 1 April 2009. Croatia {{became a member of the}} United Nations Security Council for the 2008–2009 term, assuming presidency in December 2008. The country is preparing to join the Schengen Area.|$|E
5|$|Since its founding, the {{admission}} of new member states has increased the alliance from the original 12 countries to 29. The most recent member state to be added <b>to</b> <b>NATO</b> is Montenegro on 5 June 2017. NATO currently recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Macedonia as aspiring members.|$|E
5|$|The FN P90, {{also known}} as the FN Project 1990, is a {{personal}} defense weapon (PDW) designed and manufactured by FN Herstal in Belgium. Created in response <b>to</b> <b>NATO</b> requests for a replacement for 9×19mm Parabellum firearms, the P90 was designed as a compact but powerful firearm for vehicle crews, operators of crew-served weapons, support personnel, special forces, and counter-terrorist groups.|$|E

5|$|Greece and Turkey {{also joined}} the {{alliance}} in 1952, forcing {{a series of}} controversial negotiations, in which the United States and Britain were the primary disputants, over how to bring the two countries into the military command structure. While this overt military preparation was going on, covert stay-behind arrangements initially made by the Western European Union to continue resistance after a successful Soviet invasion, including Operation Gladio, were transferred <b>to</b> <b>NATO</b> control. Ultimately unofficial bonds began to grow between NATO's armed forces, such as the NATO Tiger Association and competitions such as the Canadian Army Trophy for tank gunnery.|$|E
5|$|In early March 2008, Abkhazia and South Ossetia {{submitted}} formal {{requests for}} their recognition to Russia's parliament {{shortly after the}} West's recognition of Kosovo to which Russia was opposed. Dmitry Rogozin, Russian ambassador <b>to</b> <b>NATO,</b> warned that Georgia's NATO membership aspirations would cause Russia to support the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Russian State Duma adopted a resolution on 21 March, in which it called on the President of Russia and the government to consider the recognition.|$|E
5|$|Like any alliance, NATO is {{ultimately}} governed by its 29 member states. However, the North Atlantic Treaty and other agreements outline how decisions {{are to be}} made within NATO. Each of the 29 members sends a delegation or mission to NATO's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. The senior permanent member of each delegation {{is known as the}} Permanent Representative and is generally a senior civil servant or an experienced ambassador (and holding that diplomatic rank). Several countries have diplomatic missions <b>to</b> <b>NATO</b> through embassies in Belgium.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Infantry Brigade, {{the only}} one trained <b>to</b> <b>NATO</b> standards, was serving in Iraq at the {{beginning}} of the war; on 11 August, the United States Air Force airlifted it to Georgia. The elite Georgian troops were overdue from Iraq and could not participate in the fighting. The presence of prime 2,000 Georgian military and the most Georgian high-level government officials abroad before the war meant that Georgia did not intend to attack.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} {{was designed}} in response <b>to</b> <b>NATO</b> requests {{for a replacement}} for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. According to the NATO requirement, the new cartridge was to have greater range, accuracy, and terminal performance than the 9×19mm cartridge. Additionally, {{it was to be}} capable of penetrating body armor. FN Herstal responded to the NATO requirement by developing the 5.7×28mm cartridge and two associated weapons: the FN P90 personal defense weapon (PDW) and FN Five-seven pistol.|$|E
5|$|The RNLAF Apaches' first {{deployment}} was in 2001 to Djibouti, Africa. They {{were also}} deployed alongside U.S. AH-64s {{in support of}} NATO peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2004, six Dutch AH-64s were deployed {{as part of the}} Netherlands contribution to Multinational force in Iraq to support the Dutch ground forces. The Apaches performed close combat support and display of force missions, along with providing reconnaissance information to ground forces. In February 2006, the Netherlands contribution <b>to</b> <b>NATO</b> forces in Afghanistan was increased from 600 to 1,400 troops and 6 AH-64s were sent in support.|$|E

5|$|The {{alliance}} showed unity: On 16 April 2003, NATO {{agreed to}} take command of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which includes troops from 42 countries. The decision came {{at the request of}} Germany and the Netherlands, the two nations leading ISAF {{at the time of the}} agreement, and all nineteen NATO ambassadors approved it unanimously. The handover of control <b>to</b> <b>NATO</b> took place on 11August, and marked the first time in NATO's history that it took charge of a mission outside the north Atlantic area.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} three referendums in modern Croatia: Croatian {{independence}} referendum, Croatian European Union membership referendum and Marriage definition referendum, and in all three majority voted in favor. There have been four other public initiatives to collect the support of 10 percent of voters for a referendum, none of which were successful: concerning Croatian cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, concerning accession of Croatia <b>to</b> <b>NATO</b> in 2008, concerning Arbitration Agreement on Croatian-Slovenian border issues in 2009, and concerning Labour Act in 2010.|$|E
5|$|This article poses {{two general}} limits to {{non-member}} states. First, only European states {{are eligible for}} new membership, and second, these states not only need the approval of all the existing member states, but every member state can put some criteria forward {{that have to be}} attained. In practice, NATO formulates a common set of criteria, but for instance Greece blocks the Republic of Macedonia's accession <b>to</b> <b>NATO,</b> due to the disagreement over the use of the name Macedonia. Turkey similarly opposes the participation of the Republic of Cyprus with NATO institutions as long as the Cyprus dispute is not resolved.|$|E

5|$|After its {{formation}} in 1949 with twelve founding members, NATO grew by including Greece and Turkey in 1952 and West Germany in 1955, {{and then later}} Spain in 1982. After the Cold War ended, and Germany reunited in 1990, there was a debate in NATO about continued expansion eastward. In 1999, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic joined the organization, amid much debate within the organization and Russian opposition. Another expansion came with the accession of seven Central and Eastern European countries: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. These nations were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit, and joined NATO shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit. Albania and Croatia joined on 1 April 2009, prior to the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit. The most recent member state to be added <b>to</b> <b>NATO</b> is Montenegro on 5 June 2017.|$|E
5|$|At noon on May 6, 1955, Conant, {{along with}} the high commissioners from Britain and France, signed the {{documents}} ending Allied control of West Germany, admitting it <b>to</b> <b>NATO,</b> and allowing it to rearm. The office of the United States High Commissioner was abolished and Conant became instead the first United States Ambassador to West Germany. His role was now to encourage West Germany to build up its forces, while reassuring the Germans that doing so would not result in a United States withdrawal. Being fluent in German, Conant {{was able to give}} speeches to German audiences. He paid numerous visits to German educational and scientific organizations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Ramsey {{returned}} to Columbia as a professor and research scientist. Rabi and Ramsey picked up where they had left off before the war with their molecular beam experiments. Ramsey and his first graduate student, William Nierenberg, measured various nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments.With Rabi, he helped establish the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. In 1946, he became the first head of the Physics Department there. His time there was brief, for in 1947, he joined the physics faculty at Harvard University, where he would remain for the next 40 years, except for brief visiting professorships at Middlebury College, Oxford University, Mt. Holyoke College and the University of Virginia. During the 1950s, he was the first science adviser <b>to</b> <b>NATO,</b> and initiated a series of fellowships, grants and summer school programs to train European scientists.|$|E

5|$|In October and November 1994, {{during the}} Siege of Bihać, the Muslim-Croat Federation {{launched}} a large offensive {{around the town}} of Bihać, in far northwestern Bosnia. The Serbs soon launched a counterattack, and in support of their operations, launched air strikes with aircraft based at a former JNA military airport in Udbina, south of Bihać, located in the Republic of Serbian Krajina. The Serb aircraft dropped napalm and cluster bombs. Although most of the ordnance came from old, unreliable stocks and failed to explode, the attacks were a clear violation of the no-fly zone, and a challenge <b>to</b> <b>NATO.</b> NATO immediately looked for ways to respond, but its forces were not permitted to carry out operations in Croatian airspace, and due to Bihać's proximity to the border, Serb aircraft could attack into Bosnia, then cross back into Croatia before being intercepted. As such, NATO was powerless to stop the incursions.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to stop Slobodan Milošević's Serbian-led {{crackdown}} on KLA separatists and Albanian civilians in Kosovo, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23September 1998 to demand a ceasefire. Negotiations under US Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke broke down on 23March 1999, and he handed the matter <b>to</b> <b>NATO,</b> which started a 78-day bombing campaign on 24March 1999. Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of {{what was then the}} Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the crisis, NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces, the ACE Mobile Force (Land), to Albania as the Albania Force (AFOR), to deliver humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo.|$|E
5|$|In late October, the 102d {{departed}} Logan for Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base, Phalsbourg, France.

During the crisis, the wing controlled the 102d Tactical Fighter Group, the 104th Tactical Fighter Group, and the 174th Tactical Fighter Group from New York. The 102d's primary {{mission was to}} provide close air support <b>to</b> <b>NATO</b> ground forces, including the Seventh Army, and air interdiction. During the blockade, the 102d did not incur any losses. Starting on 5 December 1961 the 102d began deploying to Wheelus Air Base, Libya for gunnery training.|$|E
