40|$|The {{partition}} {{function of}} the ABJM theory receives non-perturbative corrections due to instanton effects. We study these non-perturbative corrections, including bound states of worldsheet instantons and membrane instantons, in the Fermi-gas approach. We require that the total non-perturbative correction should be always finite for arbitrary Chern-Simons level. This finiteness is realized quite non-trivially because each bound <b>state</b> <b>contribution</b> naively diverges at some levels. The poles of each contribution should be canceled out in total. We use this pole cancellation mechanism to find unknown bound state corrections from known ones. We conjecture a general expression of the bound <b>state</b> <b>contribution.</b> Summing up all the bound <b>state</b> <b>contributions,</b> {{we find that the}} effect of bound states is simply incorporated into the worldsheet instanton correction by a redefinition of the chemical potential in the Fermi-gas system. Analytic expressions of the 3 - and 4 -membrane instanton corrections are also proposed. Comment: 24 pages, v 2 : minor correction...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analysis}} {{the phenomenon}} of treaties establishing objective regimes. The latter are international agreements setting up ‘objective rules’, which define the sole international regime applicable to a given territory or area (e. g. the seabed {{beyond the limits of}} national jurisdiction) or to a given class of individuals (e. g. refugees). From a traditional point of view, extending the effects of these international agreements to <b>third</b> <b>States</b> would run counter of the principle according to which a treaty cannot create either obligations or rights for a <b>third</b> <b>State</b> without its consent. Objective regimes, however, do in practice affect <b>third</b> <b>States</b> even without their consent. Not always may this be explained by relying on the alleged customary nature of the rules contained in the treaty. Even when they do not embody general rules of international law, treaties establishing objective regimes limit the freedom previously enjoyed by <b>third</b> <b>States,</b> forcing them to take into account rules that have been established for the protection of interests perceived as common to the entire international community...|$|R
