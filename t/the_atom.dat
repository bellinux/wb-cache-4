5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape <b>the</b> <b>atom,</b> {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its binding energy to <b>the</b> <b>atom.</b> This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the motion of}} the end mirror of a cavity in whose standing wave mode pattern <b>atoms</b> are trapped. <b>The</b> <b>atoms</b> and <b>the</b> light field strongly couple to each other because <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> form a distributed Bragg mirror with a reflectivity that can be fairly high. We analyze how the dipole potential in which <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> move is modified due to this backaction of <b>the</b> <b>atoms.</b> We show that the position of <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> can become bistable. These results are of a more general nature and can be applied to any situation where atoms are trapped in an optical lattice inside a cavity and where the backaction of <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> on <b>the</b> light field cannot be neglected. We analyze the dynamics of the coupled system in the adiabatic limit where the light field adjusts to the position of <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> and <b>the</b> light field instantaneously and where <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> move much faster than the mirror. We calculate the side band spectrum of the light transmitted through the cavity and show that these spectra can be used to detect the coupled motion of <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> and <b>the</b> mirror.

5|$|A {{convenient}} {{means of}} determining {{the order of a}} given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> of <b>the</b> bond being broken as atom 1, and then count <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> in each direction from the broken bond to <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> that form <b>the</b> new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively.

5|$|In 1909, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Ernest Rutherford, bombarded a metal foil with alpha particles to observe how they scattered. They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection, because Thomson's model said that the charges in <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much. However, Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90°, which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson's model. To explain this, Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center of <b>the</b> <b>atom.</b> Rutherford compared his findings to one firing a 15-inch shell at a sheet of tissue paper and it coming back to hit the person who fired it.|$|E

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{the process of}} entanglement creation between two distant atoms coupled to a single mode cavity. We consider the optical frequency regime and include a possible variation of the coupling strength of <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> to <b>the</b> cavity field with the location of <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> inside <b>the</b> cavity mode. We show {{that the degree of}} entanglement between <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> is a sensitive function of the position of <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> inside <b>the</b> mode. It is found that the entanglement exhibits an interesting phenomenon of diffraction when <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> are located between the nodes and antinodes of the cavity mode. The entanglement diffraction pattern varies with time and we explain this effect in terms of the quantum property of complementarity, which is manifested as a tradeoff between the knowledge of energy of the exchanged photon versus the evolution time of the system. Entangled states of the system are identified and the entanglement properties of the system are interpreted in terms of the coherence between <b>the</b> <b>atoms...</b>|$|R

5|$|The model's first hurdle was the Pickering series, lines {{which did}} not fit Balmer's formula. When {{challenged}} on this by Alfred Fowler, Bohr replied that they were caused by ionised helium, helium atoms with only one electron. The Bohr model was found to work for such ions. Many older physicists, like Thomson, Rayleigh and Hendrik Lorentz, {{did not like the}} trilogy, but the younger generation, including Rutherford, David Hilbert, Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Max Born and Arnold Sommerfeld saw it as a breakthrough. The trilogy's acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models, and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments. Today, the Bohr model of <b>the</b> <b>atom</b> has been superseded, but is still the best known model of <b>the</b> <b>atom,</b> as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts.|$|E
5|$|This feat was {{popularly known}} as {{splitting}} <b>the</b> <b>atom.</b> For this accomplishment, Cockcroft and Walton were awarded the Hughes Medal in 1938, and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1951.

They demonstrated that they had produced radioactive isotopes, including carbon-11 and nitrogen-13.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the radiative coupling between two two-level atoms with arbitrarily polarized dipoles {{in the vicinity}} of a nanofiber. We present a systematic derivation for the master equation, the single- and cross-atom decay coefficients, and the dipole-dipole interaction coefficients for <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> interacting with <b>the</b> vacuum of the field in the guided and radiation modes of the nanofiber. We study numerically the case where the atomic dipoles are circularly polarized. In this case, the rate of emission depends on the propagation direction, that is, the radiative interaction between <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> is chiral. We examine the time evolution of <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> for different initial states. We calculate the fluxes and mean numbers of photons spontaneously emitted into guided modes in the positive and negative directions of the fiber axis. We show that the chiral radiative coupling modifies the collective emission of <b>the</b> <b>atoms.</b> We observe that the modifications strongly depend on the initial state of the atomic system, the radiative transfer direction, the distance between <b>the</b> <b>atoms,</b> and <b>the</b> distance from <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> to <b>the</b> fiber surface.

50|$|In {{an ideal}} conductor, where atoms are {{arranged}} in a perfect lattice structure, the electrons moving through it would experience no collisions and electromigration would not occur. In real conductors, defects in the lattice structure and the random thermal vibration of <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> about their positions causes electrons to collide with <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> and scatter, which {{is the source of}} electrical resistance (at least in metals; see electrical conduction). Normally, the amount of momentum imparted by the relatively low-mass electrons is not enough to permanently displace <b>the</b> <b>atoms.</b> However, in high-power situations (such as with the increasing current draw and decreasing wire sizes in modern VLSI microprocessors), if many electrons bombard <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> with enough force to become significant, this will accelerate the process of electromigration by causing <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> of <b>the</b> conductor to vibrate further from their ideal lattice positions, increasing the amount of electron scattering. High current density increases the number of electrons scattering against <b>the</b> <b>atoms</b> of <b>the</b> conductor, and hence the speed at which those atoms are displaced.|$|R
