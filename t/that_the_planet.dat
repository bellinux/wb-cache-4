5|$|By {{the period}} of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonian astronomers were making {{systematic}} observations of the positions and behavior of the planets. For Mars, they knew, for example, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> made 37 synodic periods, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets. This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars rose above the horizon, rather than from the less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere.|$|E

In the film, a joint European-NASA mission to investigate a planet in a position parallel to Earth, behind the Sun, ends in disaster {{with the death of}} one of the astronauts (Hendry).

5000|$|Ludovico Ariosto, in his epic Orlando Furioso (1513), jestingly {{sent his}} hero to a Moon where {{everything}} lost on Earth eventually turns up; {{but it was}} not until Galileo discovered (1609-1610) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Moon had surface features, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> other <b>planets</b> could, at least, be resolved into disks, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> were real physical bodies came to be taken seriously.

Public expression of such concepts could be dangerous, however; Giordano Bruno was martyred in 1600 for, among other things, imagining an infinite number of other worlds, and claiming that [...] "Innumerable suns exist; innumerable Earths revolve about these suns ... Living beings inhabit these worlds" [...] in De l'infinito universo e mondi ("Concerning the Infinite Universe and Worlds", 1584).|$|R

5|$|The {{amplitude}} of the radial velocity oscillations means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> has a mass at least 5.7 {{times that of}} Jupiter in the Solar System.

5|$|In Roman Egypt {{during the}} 2nd century CE, Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) {{attempted}} {{to address the}} problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Observations of Mars had shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> appeared to move 40% faster on one side of its orbit than the other, in conflict with the Aristotelian model of uniform motion. Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a point offset from the center of the planet's circular orbit about which the planet moves at a uniform rate of rotation. He proposed that the order of the planets, by increasing distance, was: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection Almagest, which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.|$|E

5|$|It is {{probable}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> {{is composed of}} hydrogen and helium. The planet orbits on the same plane as Kepler-9b, a second and larger gas giant located in the Kepler-9 system. While observing the planet, the Kepler team noticed that Kepler-9b and c orbited in a 1:2 ratio, where Kepler-9b orbits its star every 19 days and Kepler-9c orbits every 38 days. The gravitational pull that each planet has on the other, known as orbital resonance, keeps the planets in a stable orbit. This phenomenon {{is the first of}} its kind seen outside the Solar System. Every time Kepler-9c completed an orbit during the observation period, its orbital period decreased by about 39 minutes. At some point, however, this trend will reverse and its orbit will increase. The lengths of its orbit will oscillate slightly above and below the 2:1 ratio.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner, because of its immense gravity well and {{location}} near the inner Solar System. It receives the most frequent comet impacts of the Solar System's planets. It was thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment. However, recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter does not cause a net {{decrease in the number of}} comets that pass through the inner Solar System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them. This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt while others think that Jupiter protects Earth from the alleged Oort cloud. Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.|$|E

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover 55 Cancri d is that only a lower limit on <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> mass can be obtained. In the case of 55 Cancri d, this lower limit was around 3.835 times the mass of Jupiter. In 2004, astrometric measurements with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> orbit is inclined by around 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. If this measurement is confirmed, it implies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> true mass is 25% greater than the lower limit, at around 4.8 Jupiter masses; and it will not be coplanar with <b>the</b> innermost <b>planets</b> e and b (both 85°).|$|R
5|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a magnetic field indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of electrically conducting material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change {{the interaction of the}} planet and solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect the planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{best fit}} for the shape of HAT-P-33b's orbit {{suggests}} that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148. However, because the star HAT-P-33 has such {{a high level of}} jitter, it is difficult to constrain the planet's eccentricity with accuracy. Most of the planet's defined characteristics are {{based on the assumption that}} HAT-P-33b has an elliptical orbit, although the planet's discoverers have also derived HAT-P-33b's characteristics on the assumption <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> has a circular orbit.

5|$|The {{origin of}} this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but it {{probably}} did not form where it is found today.

It is more likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> formed in orbit around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the neutron star.|$|E

5|$|Using {{a program}} called Blendanal, similar to the Blender {{technique}} used to verify the planets discovered by Kepler, the astronomers observing HAT-P-33 hoped to rule out false positive alternatives that could explain the planet-like signal seen in HAT-P-33's light curve and radial velocity. The use of Blendanal ruled out the possibilities that the signal was caused by that of a hierarchical triple star or a mixture between a bright star and a binary star in the background. The possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star whose secondary companion is too dim to be distinguishable from the brighter star could not be ruled out. However, the data indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> HAT-P-33b did indeed exist.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{believe that}} much of the low {{northern}} plains of the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep, though this remains controversial. In March 2015, scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean. This finding was derived from the ratio of water to deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth. The amount of Martian deuterium is eight times the amount that exists on Earth, suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the Curiosity rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in Gale Crater, though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean. Other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed, and point out that Martian climate models have not yet shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water.|$|E
