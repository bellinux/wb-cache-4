30|$|With the {{widespread}} availability of image editing software, digital images have been becoming easy to manipulate and edit even for non-professional users. For a <b>tampered</b> Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) image, the <b>tampered</b> region usually has different JPEG compression {{history from the}} authentic region, {{which can be used}} to detect and locate the <b>tampered</b> region. In this article, we propose to apply the statistical features of the first digits of individual alternate current modes and support vector machine to detect and locate the <b>tampered</b> region. Experimental results show that our proposed method is effective for detecting three popularly used image manipulations. Its expectation of the percentage of overlap between the detected <b>tampered</b> region and the truth <b>tampered</b> region is higher than the existing algorithms.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{efficient}} and effective digital watermarking method for image <b>tamper</b> detection and recovery. Our method is efficient as it only uses simple operations such as parity check and comparison between average intensities. It is effective because the detection {{is based on a}} hierarchical structure so that the accuracy of <b>tamper</b> localization can be ensured. That is, if a <b>tampered</b> block is not detected in level- 1 inspection, it will be detected in level- 2 or level- 3 inspection with a probability of nearly 1. Our method is also very storage effective, as it only requires a secret key and a public chaotic mixing algorithm to recover a <b>tampered</b> image. The experimental results demonstrate that the precision of <b>tamper</b> detection and localization is 99. 6 % and 100 % after level- 2 and level- 3 inspection, respectively. The <b>tamper</b> recovery rate is better than 93 % for a less than half <b>tampered</b> image. As compared with the method in Celik et al. [IEEE Trans. Image Process. 11 (6) (2002) 585], our method is not only as simple and as effective in <b>tamper</b> detection and localization, it also provides with the capability of <b>tamper</b> recovery by trading off the quality of the watermarked images about 5 dB.

40|$|The {{existing}} compressed-domain fragile watermarking scheme cannot effectively discriminate <b>tampers</b> on {{the image}} contents or the embedded watermark or both <b>tampered</b> by attackers; hence, a novel compressed-domain fragile watermarking scheme with the discrimination of <b>tampers</b> {{on the image}} content or watermark based on a chaotic system is proposed in this paper. The quantized discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of seven most significant bits (MSBs) after decoding are mapped to the initial values of the chaotic system, and then a content-based fragile watermark is generated by chaotic motion. After watermark permutation by the chaotic sequence, the operations of embedding and extracting the improved security watermark {{are all in the}} compressed domain. During authentication, the proposed method is able to detect the <b>tampered</b> location and discriminates <b>tampers</b> on the image content or watermark from the distribution density of nonzero elements in the <b>tamper</b> detection matrix. The quantized DCT coefficients after decoding are used directly for watermark embedding, which avoids the quantization effect on the detection of watermarks. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is very suitable for the JPEG image authentication. Furthermore, thanks to the high sensitivity to initial values and the good randomness of the chaotic system, the very accurate localization is not only realized for the malicious <b>tampers</b> to JPEG images, but also indicates whether the modification made to the watermarked image is on the image contents or the embedded watermark or both. Simulation results show the abilities of <b>tamper</b> discrimination and <b>tamper</b> localization of this technique...|$|R
