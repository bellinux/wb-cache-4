5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Bjorøy Tunnel, the geology of the area was thought to consist entirely of metamorphic basement rocks similar to those exposed on the surrounding islands. The Jurassic sediments encountered in the tunnel included breccia and conglomerate in contact with the underlying gneisses and a sandstone with coal fragments, some of which was quite unconsolidated. Spore and pollen samples gave an Oxfordian age (Late Jurassic) for the sequence. The sedimentary rocks appear to have been deposited into an eroded depression caused by a fault zone, which later reactivated, disrupting <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> and causing steep dips.|$|E

5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. <b>The</b> <b>bedding</b> on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E

25|$|Rhizocorallium {{is a type}} of burrow, the {{inclination}} of which is typically within 10° of <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> planes of the sediment. These burrows can be very large, over a meter long in sediments that show good preservation, e.g. Jurassic rocks of the Yorkshire Coast (eastern United Kingdom), but the width is usually only up to 2nbsp&cm, restricted {{by the size of the}} organisms producing it. It is thought that they represent fodinichnia as the animal (probably a nematode) scoured the sediment for food.|$|E
25|$|Early paleobotanists misidentified a {{wide variety}} of {{structures}} they found on <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> planes of sedimentary rocks as fucoids (Fucales, a kind of brown algae or seaweed). However, even during the earliest decades of the study of ichnology, some fossils were recognized as animal footprints and burrows. Studies in the 1880s by A. G. Nathorst and Joseph F. James comparing 'fucoids' to modern traces made it increasingly clear that most of the specimens identified as fossil fucoids were animal trails and burrows. True fossil fucoids are quite rare.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, {{an object}} {{with a higher}} density than <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> will sink, whereas an object with a lower density than <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> will float, thus <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> can be {{considered}} to exhibit the fluid behavior expected of Archimedes' principle. As the [...] "density", (actually the solid volume fraction of the suspension), of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> can be altered by changing the fluid fraction, objects with different densities comparative to <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> can, by altering either the fluid or solid fraction, be caused to sink or float.|$|R
30|$|In {{the field}} of combustion, the air flow rate plays a number of {{important}} roles; primarily providing a cushion of air which <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> will sit upon as well as mixing <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> material. This high mixing is the key factor in achieving a uniform combustion temperature {{as well as in the}} oxidation of combustion materials. In practice, the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> materials in <b>the</b> combustor is almost controlled and limited by the pressure drop across <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> hydrodynamic properties such as <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> pressure drop and minimum fluidization velocity are the most important parameters studied in the numerical modelling of fluidized beds. To achieve and maintain a stable fluidization, knowledge about the pressure drop across <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and minimum fluidization velocity of the gas flow introduced from the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> are required. Therefore the minimum fluidization air velocity to fluidize the sand particles and pressure drop are crucial hydrodynamic parameters for analysing the operation and design of fluidized <b>bed</b> combustors. <b>The</b> minimum fluidization velocity was determined experimentally by measuring the pressure drop through <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of particles. <b>The</b> pressure drop is defined as the difference of absolute pressure under <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to that of the area above <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> which is called the freeboard [16, 17].|$|R

In Canberra, the Acton Shale appears in several outcrops in Acton, in two bands through Aranda, through Bruce near the Calvary Hospital, on the Bruce Ridge behind Lyneham. Also another band starts under the University of Canberra in Belconnen, and heads north east through Lawson and Giralang and folded and faulted into several bands in Crace on Gungahlin Hill.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Presentation date: 1973 - 05 - 03 Sediment {{transport}} in a gravel-bottomed stream {{located in}} the Oregon Coast Range was studied {{to determine the effects}} of a single layer of large particles (the armour layer) located at the surface of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> material. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> load transport system was studied jointly with suspended sediment transport to understand the total transport system. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> load was sampled using a vortex trough in <b>the</b> stream <b>bed</b> which transported <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> load material into a sampling pit adjacent to the stream.

The houses of Cresswell and Page were a target for the 1668 Bawdy House Riots that swept London. Starting on Shrove Tuesday, the rioting lasted for five days, as young apprentices burnt and smashed the royally supported brothels.

500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining <b>the</b> <b>bedding.</b> Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face.
