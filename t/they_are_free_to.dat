5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E

25|$|I don't {{see how we}} can refuse these applicants; but I will steadfastly refuse {{any more}} grants once a Gymkhana has been {{established}} under respectable auspices by each nationality, and tell applicants that ground having been set apart for their nationality <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of it by joining that particular club.|$|E
25|$|While {{the weather}} is not harsh, the mares and foals at Tersk Stud live a rugged life {{outdoors}} most of the time. There are no fences around the stud, so mounted watchmen follow and monitor the herds night and day. The horses are brought into the barn twice each day to be fed and checked, but otherwise <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> enjoy the open spaces.|$|E
25|$|From 2015, {{the safety}} car is not {{required}} to wait until all backmarkers have caught back up to the queue. When the safety car is ready to leave the circuit, it will turn off its orange lights to indicate that it will enter the pit lane {{at the end of the}} lap. Drivers must continue in formation until they cross the first safety car line, where circuit green lights and flags will indicate <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> race again.|$|E

25|$|In Michigan, sheriffs are constitutionally mandated, elected county officials. All sheriff's offices have {{general law}} {{enforcement}} powers throughout their entire county, {{as well as}} traditional judicial-process, court-protection (bailiff) and jail-operation powers. Sheriff's offices may primarily patrol areas of their county without municipal police services; however, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> patrol anywhere in their county, including cities, villages and charter townships that have their own police services. Occasionally, this results in conflict over jurisdiction between municipal police agencies and sheriff's offices.|$|E
25|$|Babin et al. {{carried out}} some of the {{earliest}} investigations into shopper motivations and identified two broad motives: utilitarian and hedonic. Utilitarian motivations are task-related and rational. For the shopper with utilitarian motives, purchasing is a work-related task that is to be accomplished in the most efficient and expedient manner. On the other hand, hedonic motives refer to pleasure. The shopper with hedonic motivations views shopping as a form of escapism where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> indulge fantasy and freedom. Hedonic shoppers are more involved in the shopping experience.|$|E
25|$|Existential psychotherapies, an {{application}} of humanistic psychology, applies existential philosophy, which emphasizes the idea that humans {{have the freedom to}} make sense of their lives. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> define themselves and do whatever it is they want to do. This is a type of humanistic therapy that forces the client to explore the meaning of their life, as well as its purpose. There is a conflict between having freedoms and having limitations. Examples of limitations include genetics, culture, and many other factors. Existential therapy involves trying to resolve this conflict.|$|E

25|$|Le Villaret, {{located in}} the Cevennes National Park in {{southern}} France and run by the Association Takh, is a breeding site for Przewalski's horses that was created to allow the free expression of natural Przewalski's horse behaviors. Eleven zoo-born horses were brought to LeVillaret in 1993. Horses born there are adapted {{to life in the}} wild: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> choose their own mates and must forage on their own. Such a unique breeding site was necessary to produce the individuals that were reintroduced to Mongolia in 2004 and 2005. In 2012 there were 39individuals at Le Villaret.|$|E
25|$|Two main defense lines {{following}} each other, first (stronger) at outer {{and second}} (slightly weaker) at inner {{periphery of the}} impassable zone, {{in a few cases}} a third belt has been built {{in the middle of the}} area. Since fortress line operated by relatively small staff, most of the army form infantry and mobile corps, thus <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> be used in offensive operations. The flexible method based on and depends upon common counterattacks and infiltrator assaults. The effectiveness of the attacks of rapid units and main forces intensified by the advantage of strong rearguard (the line) where they can retreat to at any time.|$|E
25|$|While in the Landmaster, {{the player}} has {{complete}} freedom {{to move about}} the level. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> shoot or run over enemies and assisting their wingmates when necessary. Playing on foot essentially turns the game into a 3D third-person run 'n' gun shooter; the player starts armed with the blaster, a type of gun, and can acquire {{a variety of other}} weapons, including but not limited to a machine gun and a homing launcher. In two shooting gallery levels, the player rides on the wing of an Arwing or a Wolfen fighter, shooting enemies on the ground and in the air with a plasma cannon.|$|E

25|$|In hand-to-hand combat, {{the player}} has three main attacks; light attack, heavy attack, and grapple. When the player grapples an opponent, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> throw them, or hit {{them with a}} number of light and/or heavy attacks. At certain points during combat, the enemy will be stunned, and a meter will appear {{on-screen}} prompting the player to press either the heavy attack or light attack button as much as possible within a set time. The more times the player presses the button, the more devastating the resulting special attack. The player can also toggle between different fighting styles, and switch to using a melee weapon at any time.|$|E
25|$|The Beard is a notably {{controversial}} modern play, that {{explores the}} nature of seduction and attraction, as it portrays an explosive confrontation between two legendary figures, Jean Harlow, the platinum blonde movie star, and Billy the Kid, the baby-faced outlaw with a hair trigger. They are attracted to each other, but their egos get in the way. She mocks his masculinity, and he tells her she is envious of his beauty. This battle diminishes as they realize that since they are alone together <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> shuck their burdening facades, and give in to what they’re truly feeling. The torrent of their unleashed passions leads to a final scene of great controversy, as the play comes to a climax with an act of explicit sexual intimacy between the cowboy and the starlet.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way, Stewart centers {{the first half}} of Earth Abides on the forces of natural and {{artificial}} selection. In freeing the landscape from humans, half of the book is devoted to looking at how the world would change in their absence. Stewart chose to make his main human character an ecologist, and sends him on a cross-country tour, to see what the world is like without people. As animals and plants no longer have humans taking care of them or controlling them, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> breed uncontrolled and to prey upon one another. The main character sees that some have been under humans so long that they are helpless in the face of change, while others are still able to adapt and survive. Stewart shows that humans have routinely influenced the lives of almost every plant and animal around them.|$|E
30|$|Before the study, {{participants}} {{read and}} {{signed an agreement}} to participate. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> informed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> withdraw at any time. All materials and forms were approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects of both universities.|$|R

50|$|Uber let its {{employees}} know that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> take {{the day off}} {{to participate in the}} protest. Microsoft, MTV News, Teen Vogue, Bustle, Jezebel, Fusion, the Cut, The A.V. Club, and Twitter also allowed women employees to take the day off.|$|R
25|$|Living {{conditions}} degenerate further when a clique of ward-3 men, {{armed with}} one handgun held by an ex-barman who declares himself {{the king of}} ward, gains control over the food deliveries. The MRE rations are distributed only {{in exchange for the}} other wards' valuables, and then for sex with the women of the other wards. When one of the women is beaten to death by the man having the coerced sex with her, the doctor's wife has had enough and soon kills the king with scissors to the neck. His death initiates a chaotic war confrontation between the wards, which culminates with ward-3 and then most of the building being burned down and some inmates dying in the fire. The survivors discover that the guards have abandoned their posts and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> venture into the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{differences}} between alternative views of economic freedom have been {{expressed in terms}} of Isaiah Berlin's distinction between positive freedom and negative freedom. Classical liberals favour a focus on negative freedom as did Berlin himself. By contrast Amartya Sen argues for an understanding of freedom in terms of capabilities to pursue a range of goals. One measure which attempts to assess freedom in the positive sense is Goodin, Rice, Parpo, and Eriksson's measure of discretionary time, which is an estimate of how much time people have at their disposal during which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> choose the activities in which they participate, after taking into account the time they need to spend acquiring the necessities of life. In his book, Capitalism and Freedom, Milton Friedman explains the preservation of freedom is the reason for limited and decentralized governments. It creates positive freedom within the society allowing for freedom of choice for an individual in a free society.|$|E
25|$|In {{hand-to-hand combat}} in Streets of LA, the player {{has four main}} attacks; high kick, low kick, punch, and grapple. After hitting an enemy {{a certain number of}} times, the enemy will be stunned, at which point the player can perform a combo by {{pressing}} a series of buttons. In hand-to-hand combat in New York City, the player has three main attacks; light attack, heavy attack, and grapple. When the player grapples an opponent, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> throw them, or hit them with a number of light and/or heavy attacks. At certain points during combat, the enemy will be stunned, and a meter will appear on-screen prompting the player to press either the heavy attack or light attack button as much as possible within a set time. The more times the player presses the button, the more devastating the resulting special attack. The player can also toggle between different fighting styles, and switch to using a melee weapon at any time.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature of}} the {{covenant}} requires that the two participants be one man and one woman, that <b>they</b> <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> marry, that <b>they</b> willingly and knowingly enter into a valid marriage contract, and that they validly execute {{the performance of the}} contract.|$|R
