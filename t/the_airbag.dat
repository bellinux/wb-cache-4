5|$|Mulder investigates <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> on Skinner's car, {{which was}} the one used to hit Sharon. Scully defends Skinner to the Office of Professional Responsibility, but it does no good and he is fired. Mulder {{believes}} this was done to weaken the X-Files. Mulder, {{with the help of}} Agent Pendrell finds a face imprint in <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> which is not Skinner's. He goes to see the prostitute's boss again but discovers that she has been murdered. The agents hope to use Judy, an employee who saw the man who actually hired the prostitute and use her to set up another meeting with him. They agree to meet at the Ambassador Hotel in an hour. Skinner goes to see his wife, telling her why he could not sign the divorce papers. An alarm on Sharon's vital sign monitor starts sounding, but as Skinner is about to run for help, the old woman once again takes the place of Sharon, beckoning him to come closer. As Skinner leans in, he sees his wife again, now awakened from the coma; she says something inaudible to him.|$|E
5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E
5|$|The Blu-ray and DVD were {{released}} on October 29, 2007, in the United Kingdom, on October 31 in Hungary, November 20 in the United States, and December 12 in Australia. The DVD topped rental and sales charts in its opening week of release in the U.S. and Canada. There is an unrated version, which retains {{much of the}} original 'R-rated' dialogue, and a theatrical version of the film. However, the unrated version has a branching error resulted {{in one of the}} unrated changes to be omitted. The film briefly switches to the PG-13 version in <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> scene; McClane's strong language is missing from this sequence (although international DVD releases of the unrated version are unaffected). The Blu-ray release features the PG-13 theatrical cut which runs at 128 minutes, while the Collector's Edition DVD includes both the unrated and theatrical versions. Time magazine's Richard Corliss named it one of the Top 10 DVDs of 2007, ranking it at #10.|$|E

40|$|How to {{make the}} effect of the airdrop {{equipments}} affected by the turbulent airflow minimum, and realize the fixed-point and precise airdrop, is a problem that has been plagued by the domestic and foreign experts. The article makes the mesh generation of <b>the</b> airdrop <b>airbag</b> model, builds <b>the</b> finite element simulation models, and uses finite element analysis software ANSYS/LS-DYNA to study the falling process of the punching quick airdrop <b>airbags.</b> Through <b>the</b> simulation of the falling process, the paper gets the status parameters of <b>the</b> <b>airbags,</b> and analyzes whether <b>the</b> <b>airbags</b> meet <b>the</b> falling demands or not. Then this article researches the airdrop trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>airbags</b> with gust and no gust, and researches the airdrop trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>airbags</b> under horizontal and vertical gust. In order to reduce {{the effect of the}} gust on the airdrop trajectory, the paper puts forward the controlling strategy...|$|R

25|$|In March 2014, Nissan is recalling {{nearly one}} million {{vehicles}} for {{a problem with}} the airbags. The occupant classification system (OCS) may incorrectly think that the passenger seat is empty when it is occupied by an adult, failing to activate <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> in a collision. Cars affected include the 2013–14 model year Leaf, Altima, Pathfinder and Sentra, as well as the 2013 NV200, 2013 JX35, 2014 QX60 and the 2014 Q50. Recall documents say that due to the sensitivity of the OCS software calibration, the system may not sense a passenger. That combined with high-engine vibration at idle when the seat is empty and then becomes occupied, or unusual occupant seating postures, can cause the system to fail. If the car crashes during this time, <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> won't deploy. Nissan will notify owners, and dealerships will fix the OCS software free of charge.|$|E
25|$|The Nissan Leaf's {{battery pack}} is {{shielded}} from crash damage by structural steel reinforcement. To prevent shock and fire hazards, the Leaf has a battery safety {{system that is}} activated in a crash that involves the airbags. <b>The</b> <b>airbag</b> control unit sends a signal which mechanically disconnects the high voltage from the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} lander is {{a protective}} shell {{that houses the}} rover, and together with <b>the</b> <b>airbags,</b> protects it from the forces of impact.|$|R
5000|$|On July 17, 2015, Ferrari {{issued a}} recall for their lineup from the 2014-15 model years due to <b>the</b> driver's side <b>airbags</b> being {{improperly}} installed and the leather covering them improperly glued. This was discovered {{when the company}} was conducting tests on a 458 Italia and <b>the</b> <b>airbags</b> would deploy at a rotated orientation, potentially causing injuries.|$|R
50|$|Some 2008-2009 Honda Accords - both coupe and sedan - {{have been}} {{reported}} to have sudden airbag deployment problems, in which <b>the</b> side curtain <b>airbags</b> on <b>the</b> passenger side deploy unexpectedly either by closing the passenger side doors, or while the vehicle is in motion. Honda initially refused to cover the issue under warranty or issue any recalls, claiming to customers that there was no defect in <b>the</b> <b>airbags,</b> and that <b>the</b> system worked properly (despite customers' counterclaims), forcing customers to pay for <b>the</b> <b>airbags</b> themselves. At least 14 injuries were reported by such unexpected deployments. In January 2014, Honda agreed to cooperate with an engineering analysis launched by the NHTSA after receiving 300 complaints regarding the inadvertent deployments. On August 4, 2014, the NHTSA upgraded their analysis to a preliminary investigation of at least 335,195 2008 Accords to see if Honda should issue a recall. In October 2015, Honda agreed to recall 300,000 Accords after discovering that the unexpected deployments were caused by a software problem in <b>the</b> vehicle <b>airbag</b> control unit.|$|R
25|$|Additional vehicle-specific {{diagnostic}} and control circuits {{are also available}} on this connector. For instance, on the Corvette there are interfaces for the Class 2 serial data stream from the PCM, the CCM diagnostic terminal, the radio data stream, <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> system, the selective ride control system, the low tire pressure warning system, and the passive keyless entry system.|$|E
25|$|The Air Force 5 was {{introduced}} in 1990. The Air Force V was the first model to make <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> visible on the side heels of the shoe. The most popular colorway was white/medium grey/black/orange. Just like the previous version it was slightly higher than the first three versions. This was also the last original Air Force model to be made.|$|E
25|$|The 1997–2001 model {{tested by}} the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) was the LX model with {{standard}} driver and passenger airbags. Even though the car's structure received an acceptable rating, the overall car received a marginal rating as the dummy's left leg would have been broken. Its head went through <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> which would have caused a minor concussion. The chest was well protected.|$|E
5000|$|Some car {{models have}} an SOS button that connects {{them to the}} car company's {{emergency}} center. If the car crashes, and <b>the</b> <b>airbags</b> inflate, then <b>the</b> emergency phone inside the car activates, even if the occupant(s) cannot reach it.|$|R
50|$|The Acura RDX is {{the second}} Acura vehicle to feature the Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body {{structure}} {{which is designed to}} absorb energy from a collision. The RDX comes standard with six airbags, including dual front airbags, front side airbags and dual side curtain <b>airbags.</b> <b>The</b> front <b>airbags</b> use a dual-threshold, dual-stage technology that can adjust the timing and speed of each airbag deployment depending on the degree of impact and the driver's or front passenger's seat belt usage. If sensors deem the front passenger too small (less than 65 lb), <b>the</b> front <b>airbag</b> is designed not to deploy. The front passenger's side airbag is also designed to shut off if a child or small-statured adult is leaning into <b>the</b> <b>airbag's</b> deployment path. In the event of a sufficient side impact or roll-over, <b>the</b> side curtain <b>airbag</b> deploys from above the door frames of the affected side, with coverage for both the front and rear occupants on that side, and stays inflated longer than if there were a collision.|$|R
40|$|Tunnel safety {{has long}} been a concern for {{transportation}} and government entities. Fires, noxious fumes, deadly gasses, and flooding threats have occurred in major transportation systems from Madrid to Chicago to Tokyo. The current paper presents the Resilient Tunnel System (RTS). This is a passive protection system developed to mitigate the effects of a hazardous event in the tunnel and the connected infrastructure, by compartmentalizing it. This is achieved by adapting an existing concept: an <b>airbag.</b> <b>The</b> RTS consists of inflating at least two large <b>airbags</b> inside <b>the</b> tunnel, within a specific strategic location, to seal the compromised tunnel section. The seal provided by <b>the</b> <b>airbags</b> must be tight and conform to the tunnel geometry, so whatever occurs between <b>the</b> <b>airbags</b> does not affect the external sections of the tunnel. This paper describes the first prototype of the RTS developed, as well as the tests performed to validate its performance...|$|R
25|$|The R33 Skyline was {{introduced}} in August 1993. Slightly heavier than the R32, it was available in coupe and sedan body configurations. The R33 was the safest of the models with a rating of 3.8 out of 5.5 accordingly; <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> system and internal crash bars made this vehicle significantly safer than previous models. All models now used a six cylinder engine. Nissan took {{the unusual step of}} down-grading the GTS model to have only the RB20E, while the twin-cam of the R32 GTS was discontinued along with the 2.0L turbo RB20DET.|$|E
25|$|However, in July 2017, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) {{found that}} during front crash tests, the Model S safety belts let the driver's torso move too far forward, {{resulting}} in the head striking the steering wheel hard through <b>the</b> <b>airbag.</b> This problem was already pointed out {{in one of the}} IIHS's earliers tests, to which Tesla responded they would improve their safety belt design, which, according to the IIHS's latest tests, has not been done. The IIHS also gave the Model S the worst possible rating for its headlights. The report caused Tesla to lose 6.4% of its stock value.|$|E
25|$|The entry-descent-landing (EDL) system {{differs from}} those {{used for other}} {{missions}} in {{that it does not}} require an interactive, ground-generated mission plan. During the entire landing phase, the vehicle acts autonomously, based on pre-loaded software and parameters. The EDL system was based on a Viking-derived aeroshell structure and propulsion system for a precision guided entry and soft landing, in contrasts with <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> landings that were used by the mid-1990s by the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rover missions. The spacecraft employed several systems in a precise order, with the entry, descent and landing sequence broken down into four parts—described below as the spaceflight events unfolded on August 6, 2012.|$|E

50|$|This kind of ship {{launching}} {{method has}} {{the advantages of}} requiring less permanent infrastructure, risk, and cost. <b>The</b> <b>airbags</b> provide support to the hull of the ship,air bags rolling motion take a vessel launch into water, thus it is arguably safer than other options like sideways launching.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{advances}} {{were made in}} the safety features available for the Lincoln Town Car, with ABS becoming an optional feature in 1990. Following the return of 4-wheel disc brakes to the Town Car in 1991 (for the first time since 1979), ABS became standard in 1992. As {{with the rest of the}} Panther-platform vehicles, the Town Car was fitted with a driver's side airbag in 1990, although the Town Car was technically designed to be fitted with dual <b>airbags</b> (<b>the</b> first American-produced luxury vehicle to be fitted with them). However, due to supply problems with <b>the</b> passenger <b>airbag</b> module, <b>the</b> passenger <b>airbag</b> essentially became a delete option, with a credit on the window sticker issued for the price of <b>the</b> missing <b>airbag.</b> Upon owner request, for the price of the issued credit, <b>the</b> passenger <b>airbag</b> would be installed. By the beginning of the 1992 model year, all Town Cars come equipped with dual <b>airbags</b> from <b>the</b> factory.|$|R
25|$|In 1998, Volvo {{installed}} a head-protecting airbag, {{which was made}} standard in all new models {{as well as some}} existing models. The IC head-protecting airbag was not available on the 1997 C70 since the initial design deployed <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> from the roof, and the C70, being a convertible, could not accommodate such an airbag. A later version of the C70 featured a head-protecting airbag deploying upwards from the door, avoiding this problem. It has been stated by many testing authorities that side head protecting curtain airbags can reduce the risk of death in a side impact by up to 40% and brain injury by up to 55%, as well as protect occupants during a rollover. In 1998, Volvo introduced its Whiplash Protection System (WHIPS), a safety device to prevent injury to front seat users during collisions.|$|E
25|$|The lander {{arrived at}} night at 2:56:55 Mars local solar time (16:56:55 UTC) on July 4, 1997. The lander {{had to wait}} until sunrise to send its first digital signals and images to Earth. The landing site was located at 19.30° north {{latitude}} and 33.52° west longitude in Ares Vallis, only 19 kilometres southwest of the center of the 200km wide landing site ellipse. During Sol 1, the first Martian solar day the lander spent on the planet, the lander took pictures and made some meteorologic measurements. Once the data was received, the engineers realized that one of the airbags hadn't fully deflated and could be a problem for the forthcoming traverse of Sojourners descent ramp. To solve the problem, they sent commands to the lander to raise one of its petals and perform additional retraction to flatten <b>the</b> <b>airbag.</b> The procedure was a success and on Sol 2, Sojourner was released, stood up and backed down one of two ramps.|$|E
500|$|To {{simulate}} {{the police officer}} falling in the opening scene, the special effects department had the stunt double fall 52feet onto an 18x24feet airbag, which they referred to as [...] "old-fashioned" [...] because they used <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> rather than wires. Trevor Jones, the stuntman doing the scene, commented during shooting that his fall had a small margin of error, {{because of the small}} airbag and cement walls surrounding the area, [...] "if you land off center maybe three or four feet, then you're going to get pitched in that direction". To aid Jones, a large X was placed on <b>the</b> <b>airbag.</b> A scene later in the episode involves a car fleeing through a garage door, only to hit a concrete wall, flip over, and burst into flames. To create the scene, the crew used two externally identical cars; one was drivable, and the other was a shell of car, and was hooked to a cable rig. After taking a week to get everything set up, the crew used a nitrogen cannon to launch the second, undrivable car through the garage door via wires.|$|E
50|$|In Mid October 2014 the Vibe {{along with}} the Saab 9-2x was {{recalled}} due to <b>the</b> faulty Takata <b>airbags</b> supplied from <b>the</b> large <b>airbag</b> supplier company. It is undetermined how many Vibes have been recalled.|$|R
50|$|Also in April 2014, federal safety {{regulators}} {{testified before}} Congress {{that they had}} expected <b>the</b> <b>airbags</b> in <b>the</b> defective cars {{to be able to}} deploy for 60 seconds after the engine stalled, but General Motors later told the Associated Press that they actually can only do so for 150 milliseconds.|$|R

500|$|On {{their second}} date, Harmony {{suggests}} that they have sex, but Keith declines the proposal. On the way back, Keith’s becomes involved in a traffic collision, but <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> catches him. This traumatic experience makes him go back to Harmony, and they sleep together. Veronica talks to Tim Foyle, who made her follow the trail of [...] "Rory Finch" [...] deliberately in order for her to discover the professor’s affair. Tim was the professor’s protégé, and he wants Veronica to discover Hank's flaws before she becomes more involved with him. Logan runs up to Veronica and tells her that Mercer has been arrested for the rapes on campus, {{despite the fact that}} he believes that Mercer is innocent. Logan begs Veronica to defend Mercer, as he was with him the night of one of the rapes. However, he refuses to tell Veronica what they were doing.|$|E
2500|$|At 16:56 CEST (UTC+2) on 17 August, Younes Abouyaaqoub drove a white Fiat Talento van {{onto the}} {{pavement}} of Barcelona's La Rambla, crashing into pedestrians for about [...] between Plaça de Catalunya and Liceu before stopping at a Joan Miró mosaic. Witnesses said the vehicle zigzagged at high speed down the street, ramming pedestrians and cyclists. The numerous impacts the van had received caused <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> to inflate and the driver protection system to automatically shut down the electrical system of the van, causing it to halt. In the confusion, the driver {{was able to get}} away. He fled on foot and {{made his way to the}} university district before hijacking a car and stabbing the driver to death.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the F-111 and B-1A {{introduced}} {{the method of}} jettisoning the entire front fuselage {{as a means of}} crew escape. The crew remains strapped in the cabin, unencumbered by a parachute harness, while 27,000 lbf (120 kN) of thrust from rockets accelerates the module away {{from the rest of the}} aircraft. A single, large parachute retards the descent of the capsule. On landing, an airbag system cushions the landing. [...] In the event of a water landing <b>the</b> <b>airbag</b> acts as a flotation device. Additional airbags could be activated to right the capsule in the event of a water landing (similar to the Apollo capsule), or an additional airbag could be selected for auxiliary flotation. [...] With a movement of a pin at the base of the pilot's control stick, a bilge pump could be activated and extra air pumped into the airbags.|$|E
