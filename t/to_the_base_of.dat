50|$|Acanthochondria limandae is {{a species}} of copepods in the genus Acanthochondria.

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is insectivorous {{and climbs}} up tree trunks like a mouse, {{to search for}} insects which it picks from crevices in the bark with its fine curved bill.

5|$|As part of Luminosity, several {{enhancements}} to {{the midway}} and rides were made. A new LED lighting package, {{similar to the}} park's WindSeeker, was installed on Millennium Force, Power Tower and the Giant Wheel. Towers with LED graphics and a new sound and light system were installed along the main midway from the front gate to Corkscrew. Gobo patterns are projected from the towers onto the midway and buildings. More than one million lights, including {{the lights on the}} stage, rides and buildings were added. Chauvet Professional supplied 700 lights for Luminosity. They also added 36 wash lights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> Millennium Force and 16 lights to the base and top of Power Tower.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched {{but in the case of}} Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the plant.|$|E

5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded the continuous use of South Stoneham Tower and in 1997 a large wooden collar was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the tower to prevent crumbling concrete falling onto staff and students below. The tower's construction and its {{extensive use of}} asbestos mean that decommission and deconstruction has provided a technical stumbling block to redevelopment of the South Stoneham site. Physical disassembly would be hugely expensive, while explosives cannot {{be used due to}} the proximity of private houses and the Grade II* listed original building. Indeed, because the tower and kitchen/dining hall complex are physically linked to the original house by a glazed connection, the whole site, including the tower, shares the listed building status.|$|E
5|$|Only the {{serrated}} {{and often}} keratinized {{tip of the}} sublingua is free to move small distances along {{the underside of the}} tongue, while the majority of its length adheres to the underside of the tongue. These free-moving folds or filaments are called the plica fimbriata and attach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the sublingua and are supported at the midline by the plica mediana. The plica fimbriata is highly developed and specialized in lemurs, and makes up the majority of the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} typically seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks, starting {{near the}} tree base and {{working its way}} up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a nuthatch, it does not come down trees head first, but flies <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, bare ground, or amongst fallen pine needles, and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.|$|E

5|$|The Jugal Region, or Neala, is {{a region}} of the wing that is usually a small {{membranous}} area proximal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the vannus strengthened by a few small, irregular veinlike thickenings; but when well developed it is a distinct section of the wing and may contain one or two jugal veins. When the jugal area of the forewing is developed as a free lobe, it projects beneath the humeral angle of the hindwing and thus serves to yoke the two wings together. In the Jugatae group of Lepidoptera it bears a long finger-like lobe. The jugal region was termed the neala ("new wing") because it is evidently a secondary and recently developed part of the wing.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreskin}} extends {{out from}} the base of the glans and covers the glans when the penis is flaccid. Proposed theories for the purpose of the foreskin are that it serves to protect the penis as the fetus develops in the mother's womb, that it helps to preserve moisture in the glans, and that it improves sexual pleasure. The foreskin may also be a pathway of infection for certain diseases. Circumcision removes the foreskin at its attachment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the glans.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of a}} {{millipede}} {{is typically}} rounded above and flattened below and bears a pair of large mandibles {{in front of a}} plate-like structure called a gnathochilarium ("jaw lip"). The head contains a single pair of antennae with seven or eight segments and a group of sensory cones at the tip. Many orders also possess a pair of sensory organs known as the Tömösváry organs, shaped as small oval rings posterior and lateral <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the antennae. Their function is unknown, but they also occur in some centipedes, and are possibly used to measure humidity or light levels in the surrounding environment.|$|E

5|$|The {{preferred}} habitats of the Bengal slow loris range across tropical and subtropical regions, {{and include}} evergreen and semi-evergreen rainforests with forest edges and continuous, dense canopies. It {{can also be}} found in bamboo groves. It prefers habitats with larger diameter, tall trees with a large crown depth (defined as the length along the main axis from the tree tip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the crown); these areas are typically associated with greater food abundance, and decreased risk of predation. Because of its preference for dense forests, it acts as a good indicator of the ecosystem's health.|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from transverse and longitudinal steel frames, and {{were divided into}} nine watertight compartments, with a double bottom that extended for 60percent {{of the length of}} the hull. Both vessels had two pole masts fitted with spotting tops. Nautilus and Albatross had different bows; Nautilus received a clipper bow, while Albatross had a ram bow like contemporary German light cruisers. Albatross also had a higher forecastle that extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> the main mast, while Nautilus was completed with a superstructure deck that began just aft of the fore mast.|$|E
