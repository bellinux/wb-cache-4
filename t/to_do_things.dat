5|$|Homer {{returns to}} {{apologize}} but is turned {{away by a}} fearful Burns. With no one around, Burns learns <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> himself and soon becomes completely self-reliant. After thanking Homer for making him learn that he can fend for himself, Burns fires Smithers when he returns from his vacation. Smithers and Homer engage in a fight within Burns' office which ends when Burns accidentally falls out the window. Burns is seriously injured and becomes reliant on Smithers once again. In gratitude, Smithers sends Homer a fruit basket.|$|E
5|$|Secondary School {{is a big}} {{waste of}} time. What are French {{teachers}} doing? None of us can speak French. How much maths can you do? Do you know any history? What is the point in training people <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> {{that none of us}} can do? The system seems designed to qualify you for the Indian Civil Service in 1911. We all leave school unable to drive! Now that would be quite handy.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body on how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things,</b> such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected {{to a lesser degree}} than new facts or memories.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{every action}} (or lack thereof) affects how the player is judged by their followers: the player {{may be seen}} as a good god, an evil one, or {{in-between}} the two. The land, interface (including the hand), and music change according to that alignment. A good god's temple is brightly coloured, while an evil god's is designed to look intimidating. It is not necessary to consistently perform acts of either alignment and a mixture of the two can be used to stay neutral. The player has two advisors, one good and the other evil, who try to persuade the player <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> their according to their alignment.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family {{to go back to}} the bench and resume their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they agree that it is better to watch things than <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things,</b> and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money he took from Sampras' wallet.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} combat, the game allows players {{to create and}} {{customise}} their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen moves are Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will {{be made available to}} the player {{over the course of the}} game: the moves enable them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> like stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.|$|E
50|$|Season four {{began on}} September 25, 2008. Greg Garcia {{said in a}} press {{interview}} that Season 4 would have Earl get back <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> on the list since season 3 had Earl go through prison, coma, and relationship.|$|R

5|$|Nynaeve, {{under the}} {{instruction}} of Cadsuane, locates Tam al'Thor, Rand's father, who meets with Rand {{in an attempt to}} break his emotional isolation. Rand becomes angry when he learns that Tam was sent by Cadsuane, nearly killing his father before fleeing in horror at what he had almost done. Rand Travels to the Seanchan-held city of Ebou Dar, intending to destroy their entire army, but he becomes reluctant to act after seeing how peaceful the city is. Nearly mad with rage and grief, he Travels to the top of Dragonmount, the location where he killed himself in a past life. Angry at the futility of life bound to the Wheel, he uses the Choedan Kal to draw enough power to destroy the world. Lews Therin, a voice in Rand's head from his past life, suggests that by being reborn one has the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> right. Agreeing, Rand turns the power of the Choedan Kal against itself, destroying it. Rand is finally able to laugh again.|$|E
25|$|Three unique {{markers of}} frailty have been proposed: (a) loss of {{any notion of}} invincibility, (b) loss of ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> {{essential}} to one's care, and (c) loss of possibility for a subsequent life stage.|$|E
25|$|It's misapplied {{constantly}} by {{the country}} to get states <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> they don't want to do. Most importantly to me, 45 million babies have been murdered since judges forced Roe v. Wade down the throats of citizens.|$|E

25|$|For {{standing}} competitors, outrigger skis {{can be used}} in some classifications. These are {{ski poles}} with small skis on the end. They assist a skier balancing as they ski down the slopes, and in moving uphill for short distances, enabling skiers <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> like a climb a slope to get on a chair lift.|$|E
25|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} {{often has}} no early warning signs. Even macular edema, {{which can cause}} rapid vision loss, may not have any warning signs for some time. In general, however, a person with macular edema {{is likely to have}} blurred vision, making it hard <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> like read or drive. In some cases, the vision will get better or worse during the day.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{layout of}} what is carried on an engine is decided by {{the needs of the}} department. For example, fire {{departments}} which cover metropolitan areas are more likely to assist with non-fire-related cases such as hazardous material removal/cleanup and technical rescues of people from traffic collisions or structural collapses, while rural departments may need <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> like access remote areas or extinguish forest fires.|$|E

25|$|People who are poor, perhaps homeless, without {{dependable}} transportation cannot {{afford to}} run {{all over town}} seeking such services, and often they don’t know where to begin. Despite being aware of the overwhelming needs many students face, we force all children—regardless of interest or aptitude—into academic courses and then fight an uphill battle to motivate them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> {{they do not want}} to do.|$|E
25|$|The {{authorities}} of the Talmud {{seem to be}} particularly influenced by popular conception {{in the direction of}} folk medicine. A belief in the Evil eye was also prevalent in Talmudic times, and occasionally omens were taken seriously, though in some cases recognized as being merely popular beliefs. Thus, while it is declared to be unlucky <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> twice, as eating, drinking, or washing, Rabbi Dunai recognized that this was an old tradition.|$|E
25|$|Emotional {{blackmail}} and FOG, terms {{coined by}} psychotherapist Susan Forward, are about controlling people in relationships {{and the theory}} that fear, obligation and guilt ("FOG") are the transactional dynamics at play between the controller and the person being controlled. Understanding these dynamics is useful to anyone trying to extricate from the controlling behavior of another person, and deal with their own compulsions <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> that are uncomfortable, undesirable, burdensome, or self-sacrificing for others.|$|E

25|$|In {{the words}} of soprano Montserrat Caballé:She opened a new door for us, for all the singers in the world, a door that had been closed.

She has given us the chance, those who follow her, <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> that were hardly possible before her. That I am compared with Callas is something I never dared to dream. It is not right. I am much smaller than Callas.|$|E
25|$|Thompson {{continued}} to be mentioned as a potential candidate, but did not officially declare his candidacy. On June 12, Thompson told Jay Leno on The Tonight Show that while he did not crave the presidency itself, he would like <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> that he could only do by holding that office. A New York Times article cited Thompson's aides as saying on July 18 {{that he planned to}} enter the race just after Labor Day, followed by a national announcement tour.|$|E
25|$|The {{premise of}} many {{role-playing}} games tasks the player with saving the world, or whichever level of society is threatened. There are often {{twists and turns}} as the story progresses, such as the surprise appearance of estranged relatives, or enemies who become friends or vice versa. The game world tends to be set in a fantasy or science fiction universe, which allows players <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>things</b> they cannot do in real life and helps players suspend their disbelief about the rapid character growth. To a lesser extent, settings closer {{to the present day}} or near future are possible.|$|E
