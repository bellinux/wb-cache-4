30|$|Glutamate decarboxylase, a pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, is a {{key factor}} for the bioconversion. Due to its role in {{bacterial}} glutamate-based acid resistance system, most natural GADs exhibited their highest decarboxylase activity only under the acidic conditions (De Biase and Pennacchietti 2012; Kanjee and Houry 2013). This characteristic of pH-response was disadvantageous to GAD used in producing GABA, because the pH increase as the reaction proceeded would inactivate GAD and limited <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> (Gut et al. 2006). Since the crystal structures of E. coli GADs revealed the structural basis for its optimal activity at acidic pH, several mutants with high activity toward more alkaline pH values have been constructed to improve GABA production (Choi et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2014; Thu Ho et al. 2013). On the other hand, hydrochloric acid, sodium acetate buffer and acidic cation-exchange resins were used to maintain the acidic condition during reaction from MSG into GABA, and <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> efficiency were <b>remarkably</b> <b>improved</b> (Dinh et al. 2014; Park et al. 2013; Plokhov et al. 2000). However, these methods were also unsatisfactory for the following separation and purification of GABA due {{to the introduction of}} the high amount of salts or resins. In recent years, l-Glu was widely applied as substrate for keeping the acidic pH in non-buffered reaction with purified or immobilized GAD (Kang et al. 2013; Lammens et al. 2009; Yamano et al. 2013). Despite of <b>the</b> high <b>conversion</b> yield and <b>the</b> simple downstream separation, it was not suitable for industrial scale because of the tedious preparation of purified GAD and the requirement of expensive cofactor PLP.|$|R

40|$|SummaryRecent {{studies have}} shown that defined factors could lead to <b>the</b> direct <b>conversion</b> of {{fibroblasts}} into induced hepatocyte-like cells (iHeps). However, reported conversion efficiencies are very low, and the underlying mechanism of the direct hepatic reprogramming is largely unknown.

Through screening for additional factors that could potentially enhance <b>the</b> <b>conversion</b> kinetics, we have found that c-Myc and Klf 4 (CK) dramatically accelerate conversion kinetics, resulting in <b>remarkably</b> <b>improved</b> iHep generation. Furthermore, we identified small molecules that could lead to the robust generation of iHeps without CK.

40|$|Cruciferous vegetables, such as Brassica, {{which contain}} {{substantial}} quantities of glucosinolates, {{have been suggested}} to possess anticarcinogenic activity. Cutting and chewing of cruciferous vegetables releases the thioglucosidase enzyme myrosinase, which degrades glucosinolates to isothiocyanates and other minor metabolites. Cooking of cruciferous vegetables inactivates the myrosinase enzyme, allowing intact glucosinolates to reach the large intestine, {{where they can be}} degraded by the indigenous microflora into isothiocyanates. This local release of isothiocyanates may explain the protective effect of cruciferous vegetables on the colon epithelium. However, {{little is known about the}} amounts and identities of glucosinolate metabolites produced by the human microflora. The production of allyl isothiocyanate from sinigrin was investigated in a dynamic in vitro large-intestinal model, after inoculation with a complex microflora of human origin. Sinigrin and allyl isothiocyanate concentrations were analysed in the lumen and dialysis fluid of the model. Peak levels of allyl isothiocyanate were observed between 9 and 12 h after the addition of sinigrin.
