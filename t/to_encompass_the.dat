5|$|The first {{cladistic}} analysis <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> <b>the</b> interrelationships of Hadrosauridae {{was conducted}} by Weishampel and Horner (1990). They found Saurolophinae synonymous with Hadrosaurinae, but only separated the subfamily into two groups. The first group included Gryposaurus, Aralosaurus, Maiasaura, and Brachylophosaurus. The other contained Edmontosaurus, Saurolophus, Prosaurolophus, Lophorhothon, and Shantungosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Although both {{shows are}} set in the same hospital, the Casualty set in Bristol was not large enough <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> <b>the</b> {{surgical}} ward and operating theatre required for Holby City, so the series was produced at the BBC's Elstree Studios in north London. As a result, some crossover scenes had to be shot twice, first on the Casualty set and then again at Elstree, with cast members travelling between the two locations. McHale wrote the series' first episode, and served as the show's lead writer. Holby City premiered on 12 January 1999 on BBC One. Its first series ran for nine episodes of 50 minutes in length, which were broadcast first in the 8.10pm, then 8pm timeslot on Tuesdays.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{authorities}} {{had won a}} total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further draconian measures on the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> <b>the</b> countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might have been different. The city authorities were well aware of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on recent}} DNA-analysis, the genus Ploceus is almost {{certainly}} polyphyletic.

The Ploceinae {{can be divided into}} two groups. In the first group, the widowbirds and bishops (genus Euplectes) are sister to a clade in which the genera Foudia and Quelea are closest relatives and which further includes the Asiatic species of Ploceus, i.e. P. manyar, P. philippinus, P. benghalensis, P. megarhynchus, (and P. hypoxanthus, although untested). Since Georges Cuvier picked P. philippinus as the type species, these five species would logically remain assigned to the genus Ploceus.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{the ruins}} of old Phlan, the party enters the slum area—one of two quests {{immediately}} available to new parties. This quest requires the clearing of the slum block and allows a new party to quickly gain experience. The second quest is to clear out Sokol Keep, located on Thorn Island. This fortified area is inhabited by the undead, {{which can only be}} defeated with silver weapons and magic. The characters' adventure is later expanded <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> <b>the</b> outlying areas of the Moonsea region.

5|$|By November the Sixth Army had {{occupied}} most of Stalingrad, pushing the defending Red Army {{to the banks}} of the Volga River. By this stage, there were indications of an impending Soviet offensive which would target Wehrmacht forces around the city, including increased Soviet activity opposite the Sixth Army's flanks, and information gained through the interrogation of Soviet prisoners. However, the German command was intent upon finalizing its capture of Stalingrad. In fact, head of Army General Staff General Franz Halder had been dismissed in September after his efforts to warn about the danger which was developing along the over-extended flanks of the Sixth Army and the Fourth Panzer Army. As early as September the Soviet Stavka (high command) began planning a series of counteroffensives <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> <b>the</b> destruction of German forces in the south, fighting in Stalingrad and in the Caucasus, and against Army Group Center. Ultimately, command of Soviet efforts to relieve Stalingrad was put under the leadership of General Aleksandr Vasilevsky.|$|E
5|$|M-116 {{was first}} {{designated}} in May or June 1928 {{from the north}} city limit of Ludington north to the Sable River, {{but not all of}} it was built and open to traffic.

The northern end was extended in late 1935 <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> <b>the</b> Big Sable River bridge. The last change to the routing was made in 1998 when US10 was shifted to follow James Street instead of William Street to the car ferry docks. At that time, M-116 was extended east along Ludington Avenue to end at James Street.|$|E

5|$|Members of Clann Somairle seem to {{have been}} attacking parts of the Crovan dynasty's island-kingdom, {{possibly}} taking advantage of the warring between Rögnvaldr and Óláfr. It may have been that they were also lending support to Alan's destabilising incursions into the Isles. Whatever the case, {{it is clear that the}} state of affairs in the Isles was chaotic and, because of Óláfr's inability to control of the situation, the formidable Hákon decided to pacify the region using Óspakr-Hákon. In fact, the saga notes that Óspakr-Hákon was also a son of Dubgall, and it is likely that his family connections would have made him a palatable over-king of the unruly Clann Somairle. Óspakr-Hákon's kingdom was likely meant <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> <b>the</b> territories of Clann Somairle, and control of the Crovan dynasty's domain may have been retained by the dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Operation Mistral 2, {{along with}} the near-concurrent Operation Sana, created {{a large number of}} {{refugees}} from the areas previously controlled by the VRS. Their number was variously reported and the estimates range from 655 killed civilians and 125,000 refugees, reported by Radio-Television Republika Srpska in 2010, to approximately 40,000 refugees reported in 1995—both by Bosnian Serb sources. The latter figure was reported <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> <b>the</b> entire contemporary populations of the towns of Jajce, Šipovo, Mrkonjić Grad and Donji Vakuf fleeing or being evacuated. At the time, the UN spokesman in Sarajevo estimated the number of refugees at 20,000.

5|$|Xenogears {{initially}} {{takes place}} on Ignas, the largest continent of the Xenogears world, and {{the site of a}} centuries-long war between the nations of Aveh and Kislev. A church-like organization known as the Ethos has excavated gears (giant robot suits), ostensibly for the preservation of the world's culture. Although Kislev originally had the upper hand in the war, a mysterious army known as Gebler appeared and began to provide assistance to Aveh. With Gebler's help, the Aveh military not only recovered its losses, but began making its way into Kislev's territory. As the story unfolds, the setting broadens <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> <b>the</b> entire world and the two floating countries, Shevat and Solaris. Solaris, ruled by Emperor Cain and an AI collective known as the Gazel Ministry, commands the Gebler army and the Ethos and secretly uses both to dominate the land-dwellers. Shevat has been the only country to evade the control of Solaris.|$|E
5|$|Holby City and Casualty {{are both}} set in Holby City Hospital, in the fictional county of Wyvern, in the {{southwest}} of England close to the Welsh border. The city exterior is represented by Bristol, though Holby City is filmed at BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The Casualty set in Bristol was not large enough <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> <b>the</b> surgical ward and operating theatre required for Holby City, and as a result, some crossover scenes in the first episode had to be shot twice, first on the Casualty set and then again at Elstree, with cast members travelling between the two locations.

In March 2009, the BBC confirmed that Casualty would {{move to a new}} set in Cardiff, however in the following month, The Guardian announced that the BBC would retain Elstree Studios for at least another four years.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1793, amid {{mounting}} tensions {{following the}} French Revolution of 1789, the recently formed French Republic, already {{at war with}} the Austrian Empire and Prussia, declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic. This act spread the French Revolutionary Wars beyond Europe <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> <b>the</b> British, French and Dutch colonies in the Americas and the East Indies. Britain and France were already rivals in the East Indies, having fought campaigns in the Indian Ocean during both the Seven Years' War (1756–1763) and the American War of Independence (1775–1783). More recently British and French naval forces had fought the Battle of Tellicherry in 1791 as part of the Third Anglo-Mysore War, a conflict between the East India Company (EIC), which controlled British mercantile interests in the East Indies, and the French-supported Kingdom of Mysore in Southern India. The battle was a French defeat, but it had little impact on either the war itself, which saw the EIC extract significant concessions from Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore, or the worsening political climate in Europe.|$|E
