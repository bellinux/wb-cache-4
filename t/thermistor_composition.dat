40|$|NTC {{thermistor}} powder {{was made}} of a Mn, Ni, Fe and Co oxide mixture calcinated at 1050 °C / 60 min. The powder was milled in a ball mill down to an average particle diameter of 0. 9 μm. Small disc shaped pills of the powder obtained were made by pressing with a pressure of 2. 5 MPa. The pills were sintered in the temperature range of 900 - 1400 °C for 30 - 240 min. The volume and specific volume resistivity change were measured {{as a function of}} sintering conditions. Microstructure development was observed using a SEM microscope. Using the results obtained, optimization of sintering parameters was performed in order to determine optimal electrical properties of the selected <b>thermistor</b> <b>composition...</b>|$|E
40|$|CUORE is a {{calorimeter}} {{composed of}} 1000 crystals held at cryogenic temperature, whose absorbed energy is read out with semiconductor <b>thermistors.</b> The <b>composition</b> {{of the crystal}} is TeO 2 and the aim {{is the study of}} double beta decay of the 130 Te on very long and stable runs. We describe in this paper the work done to enable such study for all that concerns the electronic system, from the thermistor to the data acquisition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} an attempt {{has been made}} to trace the {{relation}} between microstructure, grain size and electrical properties of NTC <b>thermistors</b> with the <b>composition</b> (NiMnCo) 3 O 4. The results indicate that the electrical resistivity decreases as the grain size increases, but for a broad range of grain size it is relatively constant. When the grain size is very small and also when very large the change in resistivity is significant. Various microstructure parameters are also reported. # 1998 Elsevier Science Limited and Techna S. r. l. ...|$|R
