40|$|Knowledge {{transfer}} partnerships (ktps), numbering over 100 in the UK, {{form the}} background to this paper. Benefits of the partnerships are noted as follows: to the British economy, to the participating company, to the associate or <b>trainee</b> <b>employee</b> and to the University that manages the programmes. Mentoring theory and continuing professional development (cpd) are mentioned, though not extensively. The lead author has developed the unique role of the ktp mentor. The {{focus is on the}} mentor’s assistance made available to the associate. Two key strengths, checked with present associates, are identified. The first strength is the utterly confidential nature of the process of mentoring. The second strength is the absence of involvement in the day to day running of any partnership. The mentor is outside the formal management structure, not even taking part in selecting suitable associates. The mentor assists in cpd, in identifying skills, personal strengths and weaknesses, and {{towards the end of the}} contract in exploring career options with the associate. At all times the autonomy of the associate is respected. The authors conclude that the mentoring role is valuable well received and that it will continue, building on the key strengths noted above...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this master’s thesis is trainees’ {{experiences}} of being a trainee in two recognized and complex knowledge intensive companies. The main research question is «What characterizes trainee employees’ experiences of learning and learning processes in trainee programs in two knowledge intensive organizations?» This project is implemented {{within the framework of}} a sociocultural perspective on learning and has a constructivist approach to the research subject. Therefore, the research method is qualitative and the empirical material consists of eight semi structured interviews with <b>trainee</b> <b>employees.</b> The findings were categorized in four main categories with suitable sub categories. The first main category is called "Secure framework" and this category includes factors important for learning according to the trainees. Hence, the level of difficulty of work activites in which the trainees engage in and to which extend the activities are relevant for the organizations. The second category "Learning" describes the learning activities the trainees were given the opportunity to engage in and how the whole trainee program contributed to continuous learning. The topic in the third category called "Knowledge", is the different forms of knowledge the trainees learned and how they experienced the transfer of knowledge between different contexts. The last category called "The different roles of being a trainee" describes how the trainees experienced being both an ordinary employee and in a special position as a trainee at the same time. The trainees’ experiences of learning and learning processes in the trainee programs can be related to the concepts «Zone of proximal development» and «Scaffolding». Both formal and informal learning contexts can contribute to learning, but they need to complement each other. The findings indicate that the trainees experienced the trainee programs as a continuous learning process, simultaneously as they felt they could have been further challenged...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} one of three similar and {{simultaneous}} publications about current challenges to and alternative futures for academic medicine. The authors, members of the International Campaign to Revitalise Academic Medicine (ICRAM), want to stimulate discussion among colleagues who work in academic medicine, as well as practitioners and students of medicine and other health professions. They also hope to reach {{the men and women who}} set priorities for academic medicine and allocate resources to and within it. The authors define academic medicine as the “capacity” of the health sector to “think, study, research, discover, evaluate, innovate, teach, learn, and improve. ” Each country allocates responsibility for these tasks differently. In all countries, however, schools of medicine and other health professions and the hospitals, ambulatory care settings, and research units associated with them are central in carrying them out. Since the second half of the nineteenth century, the institutions of academic medicine have contributed to improving and maintaining health, to national and regional economic development, and to upward socioeconomic mobility for millions of people—students, <b>trainees</b> and <b>employees.</b> Governments and, in some countries, philanthropies generously subsidized the people and institutions of academic medicine for most of the past century because their leaders valued these contributions. The scenarios in this report suggest that some of the current instabilities in academic medicine could stimulate changes in the priority accorded to it by the public and, as a result, by policymakers—in some countries at least. ICRAM devised these scenarios in order to promote discussion about the instabilities and how they can be addressed in ways that strengthen the contribution of academic medicine to the public goo...|$|R

The Project WBLQUAL (“An Approach to Qualifications through Negotiated Work Based Learning for the EU”) is a European; Erasmus (EACEA, LLP) funded project working across five countries looking to refine a method of providing qualifications for work based learning. There are significant issues that will be researched including meeting the requirements of the students for recognized qualifications and changing the mind-set of Universities on how courses are planned, delivered and assessed. The aim of the research is to develop a deeper and Europe-wide understanding of learner needs and aspirations. Integrating this knowledge with other project’s results it is possible come to a coherent understanding of the tri-partite relationship between learner, employer and higher education institution (HEI). Results are derived working with different types of <b>employees</b> (students, graduate <b>trainees,</b> permanent <b>employees),</b> across national boundaries (Italy, Poland, Latvia, Denmark, UK), within different business areas (business, computing, tourism) and with topical economic drivers (economic, demographic, political).

40|$|This communication, through {{couple of}} studies driven since 10 years, tries {{to show how}} {{important}} is the training of authors in Computer Based Training (CBT). We submit here an approach to prepare designers mastering Interactive Multimedia modules in this domain. Which institutions are really dedicating their efforts in training authors and designers {{in this area of}} CBTs? Television devices and broadcast organisations offered since year 60 s' a first support for Distance Learning. New media, New Information and Communication Technologies (NICT) allowed several public and private organisations to start Distance Learning projects. As usual some of them met their training objectives, other of them failed. Did their really failed? Currently, nobody has the right answer. Today, we do not have enough efficient tools allowing us to evaluate trainees' acquisition in a short term view. Training evaluation needs more than 10 to 20 years of elapsed time to bring reliable measures. Nevertheless, given the high investments already done in this area, we cannot wait until the final results of the pedagogical evaluation. A lot of analyses showed relevant issues which can be used as directions for CBTs authors and designers training. Warning - Our studies and the derived conclusions are mainly based on projects driven in the field. We additionally bring our several years experience in the training of movie film authors in the design of interactive multimedia products. Some of our examples are extracting from vocational training projects where we were involved in all development phases from the analysis of needs to the evaluation of the acquisition within the <b>trainee's</b> / <b>employee</b> job's.

40|$|The Industrial Training and Technical Internship Program {{is often}} {{portrayed as a}} system through which firms can use foreign {{nationals}} from developing countries as substantive low-wage workers. The program is often criticized for functioning as a life-prolonging mechanism for low-productivity firms that should probably withdraw from the market. The overall picture of firms using this program, however, is unclear. Therefore, whether such criticism is valid or not should be considered carefully through a field survey and quantitative analysis. In this paper, I focus {{on the level of}} wages offered to Japanese workers by firms using the program and compare it to the average wage of firms not using the program. Productivity differences between the two are then measured to reveal the characteristics of firms using the program. Analysis results indicate that, in the manufacturing industry, there is a tendency for firms using trainees to offer lower wages for Japanese workers than those without trainees in the same industry or area. In other words, I was able to confirm that firms that lack competitive wages have a strong tendency to use the program. On the other hand, more than 30 % of firms with trainees offer above average wages compared to firms without trainees. It is likely that these firms share workloads efficiently between foreign <b>trainees</b> and Japanese <b>employees</b> leading to higher productivity. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhere to get {{qualified}} {{project managers}} {{who understand the}} specifics of business is relevant question for any large project-oriented company. Especially this problem is becoming more acute in terms of dynamic changes in the business environment and intensifying the processes of labour migration between competing companies. We should not forget the continuous development of the discipline of project management, {{the emergence of new}} areas of knowledge, technique and new professional Standards. In this situation, the Corporate University is becoming an important tool for organising of a process of sustainable development of organization project culture taking into account the interests of various internal and external stakeholders. An innovative model of sustainable development of IBS project culture is based on three principles. First, for the trainees, who are coming into the company directly from a University bench, it is an organisation of fundamental training on project management. Secondly, to consultants, who showed themselves as a potentially project managers, it is the ability to change the trajectory of career growth. And finally, for professional project managers, coming from other companies it is their adaptation and further personal development based on the business specifics of IBS Company. Main components of the Programme are considered in the paper - from training of Master students on the position of a graduate <b>employee</b> (<b>trainee),</b> till coaching for the Project Directors; from the study of the Project Management methodology, till practical case studies, formed on the basis of real projects of the company...|$|R
40|$|Local {{authorities}} in many {{free market economy}} – based countries as well as welfare economy - based countries, experience acute fiscal distress and ongoing cut- offs in the workforce. For years, many of the local {{authorities in}} Israel have been coping with ongoing acute fiscal distress, which has {{had a significant impact}} on their capability to create, sustain and deliver public value to their residents. This dissertation aimed to provide suggested potential remedies for improving local authorities' and other organizations' performance. The suggested course of action was to leverage training and its transfer to work settings, although it was clearly noted that training and its successful application in the workplace are not a panacea to all the issues that the local authorities are confronting. An attempt was made to paint a picture of the key factors which may facilitate or prevent the use of training outcomes as a tool which can contribute to the abilities of an organization, acting in a turbulent environment, to accomplish its goals in the most efficient manner. A total of 420 employees, participating in training courses, from three different sectors in various local authorities in Israel, were surveyed. However, due to missing data the usable sample was 272 <b>trainees.</b> Two <b>employee</b> - related constructs (trainee characteristics and motivation to improve work through learning - MTIWL) and two organization related constructs (work environment and training design) were captured for 272 trainees in an attempt to predict their impact on training transfer. Additionally, the impacts of trainee characteristics, work environment and training design on MTIWL were examined, along with the mediating role of MTIWL between the three above mentioned constructs and training transfer. The results partially supported the predicted links. Evidence for the impact of MTIWL on transfer of training was found while, in turn, rather surprisingly, the research findings revealed that trainee characteristics, work environment and training design had no influence on transfer of training. Additionally, trainee personal characteristics and work environment were found to be predictors of MTIWL. The respondents scored higher than average on all the variables, indicating above – average perceptions regarding the examined constructs. These were mapped as important factors in a work setting. The implications of the results were discussed and several practical recommendations were made. Additionally, the limitations of this research were noted, along with suggested avenues for future research. 158 ismeretle...|$|R

Inside are four pleasant offices, decor circa 1950, and they were occupied by three people; Louise J. about to retire, who joined the Rock Company in the late forties; Joanne H. who had been counseling about three years after working for twelve years in the medical department; Papa L., retired, who came to help out. They were fine strong, caring human beings, highly respected by managers and employees and obviously capable. In June 1971 I was hired to be trained to join the counseling staff.

I was a part-time counselor responsible for approximately 800 people, while doing the work of two employment interviewers hiring about fifty people a month and administering the college recruitment program on the side. The workload was less onerous than the nature of some of my assignments.

40|$|In {{examining}} {{the history of}} Australian apprentices, the paper finds that the term ‘Australian apprentices’ can encompass employees {{in a wide variety}} of occupations and training with differing qualifications. It finds however, that from a wage-setting perspective, wage arrangements still distinguish between what are ‘traditional trades’ employees (apprentices) from non traditional trades <b>employees</b> (<b>trainees).</b> The report thus distinguishes between these two groups. In relation to apprentices, the paper finds that take up rates of apprenticeships have tended to increase over ten years to 2009, although attrition occurrences were higher than completions in the same time frame. In {{examining the}} 122 modern awards in the national system the paper finds that 46 contain rates of pay and provisions for apprentices, typically expressed as a percentage of the tradespersons rate. Provisions for competency-based wage and training progression for apprentices were also examined and it was found that competency-based training progression is facilitated by wage arrangements in some select modern awards in the national system. Findings from qualitative research into competency-based wage progression for apprentices indicated that its operation varied according to the level of cooperation and communication between the employer, apprentice and the registered training organisation. The application of competency-based wage progression arrangements differed among employer participants according to a range of factors, with the research indicating that accelerated progression through training and wage levels was greatly influenced by the employer participant’s assessment of performance in the workplace. In respect of trainees the report finds that commencements in traineeships either increased or remained steady over the ten years to 2009. Completions overtook attrition occurrences in 2004 and the gap widened in the years to 2009. Trainees in the national system typically rely on the National Training Wage schedule for their wage rates which is attached to 100 of the 122 modern awards. The paper finds some modern awards set wages for trainees which are separate from the National Training Wage schedule and  some trainees who are trained under state developed qualifications may not have coverage under the National Training Wage schedule. The report also identifies an issue concerning changing relativities in the National Training Wage schedule due to the application of a historical adjustment method over time.
