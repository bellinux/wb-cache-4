5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> the subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present {{in up to}} 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E

Study Design <b>TRAP</b> <b>in</b> situ and immunomercial antibody (NCL-hTERT) was performed on 54 body cavity effusions. The results were compared and correlated to diagnosis. Results Thirty-four effitsions from patients with verified malignant disease contained cytologically malignant cells. Both methods were positive in 33 of the cases, whereas only hTERT was positive in I case. Twenty effusions, all containing mesothelial cells, came from patients with benign conditions. In 2 fluids atypical, hyperplastic mesothelial cells were both <b>TRAP</b> <b>in</b> situ and hTERT positive. All remaining 18 fluids were <b>TRAP</b> <b>in</b> situ negative, whereas 12 of 18 were hTERT positive. Thus the results of <b>TRAP</b> <b>in</b> situ and hTERT immunohistochemistry disagreed in 1 of 34 (3 %) malignant and 12 of 20 (60 %) benign cases. Conclusion The sensitivities for malignancy were similar for <b>TRAP</b> <b>in</b> situ and hTERT immunobistochemistry.

5|$|A later model {{suggested}} that confinement {{resulted from a}} co-rotational eccentricity resonance (CER).

A third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case are <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> its stable Lagrangian points. However Voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, making such a theory unlikely. Some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets are <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> co-rotational resonances with Galatea, providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen <b>trapped</b> <b>in</b> ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: We {{previously}} found telomere repeat amplification protocol (<b>TRAP)</b> <b>in</b> situ {{helpful in}} the diagnosis of malignancy in effusions, whereas varying sensitivities and specificities for malignancy were reported by investigators using extract-based TRAP. OBJECTIVE: To compare the 2 methods and to elucidate the discrepancies between them. DESIGN: Twenty-three effusions were analyzed. Telomerase activity of whole cell lysate was measured with a Telo TAGGG telomerase polymerase chain reaction ELISA PLUS kit with modifications to exclude polymerase chain reaction inhibitors. <b>TRAP</b> <b>in</b> situ was performed on cytospins. An estimate of total <b>TRAP</b> activity <b>in</b> the specimen was made based {{on the amount of}} positive cells, their fluorescence intensity, and the proportion of different cell types in the specimen. The estimate was compared with the level of telomerase activity <b>in</b> cell lysate-based <b>TRAP.</b> RESULTS: <b>TRAP</b> <b>in</b> situ: Thirteen of 14 malignant cases and 2 of 2 equivocal cases showed moderate/strong reactivity. Five of 7 benign effusions were negative; in 2 of 7, mesothelial cells showed weak reactivity. Cell lysate-based <b>TRAP</b> assay: <b>In</b> 4 cases no internal standard was detected, indicating the presence of polymerase chain reaction inhibitors. The relative telomerase activities were 33. 1 to 72. 7 with a considerable overlap between malignant (48 +/- 9, mean +/- SD) and benign (43 +/- 9) cases. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>TRAP</b> <b>in</b> situ results correlated to final diagnoses, whereas the cell lysate-based TRAP assay did not differentiate between malignant and benign cases. The varying proportions of positive cells and the variation in fluorescence intensity <b>in</b> the <b>TRAP</b> <b>in</b> situ slides explained some of the discrepancies. The problems encountered with TRAP performed on cell lysates are partly overcome using <b>TRAP</b> <b>in</b> situ...|$|R
