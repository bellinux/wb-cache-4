[...] Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana was also cited on the Columbia report: [...] "It's not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things." [...] Jill Geisler in the Columbia Journalism Review reacted to Dana's statement by saying, [...] "At a time when humility should guide a leader's comments, that quote carries the aroma of arrogance." ...|$|E

The lines [...] "No more {{going to the}} dark side with your flying saucer eyes / No more falling down a wormhole that I have to pull you out", from the track [...] "Atoms for Peace", were inspired by an [...] "admonition" [...] from Yorke's partner Rachel Owen. According to the Globe and Mail, [...] "The Clock", influenced by Arabic music, is a [...] "gliding, droning song about losing control while pretending 'that you are still in charge'." [...] "Analyse" [...] was inspired by a blackout Yorke experienced in his hometown Oxford: [...] "The houses were all dark, with candlelight in the windows, which is obviously how it would have been when they were built. It was beautiful." [...] The song [...] "Atoms for Peace" [...] references a 1953 speech by American President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The album title was inspired by [...] "these huge elephants <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the room at the moment, in the west, and people are desperately trying to erase them from public consciousness." ...|$|E

In an {{interview}} with Stephen Colbert on the satirical news show The Colbert Report, Fiasco stated his credo on political philosophy: [...] "You should criticize power even if you agree with it." [...] In another interview in June 2011 on the CBS program What's Trending, Fiasco discussed the political content of his music, stating, [...] "My fight against terrorism, to me, the biggest terrorist is Obama and the United States of America. I'm trying to fight the terrorism that's actually causing the other forms of terrorism. You know, {{the root cause of}} terrorism is the stuff the U.S. government allows to happen. The foreign policies <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> place in different countries that inspire people to become terrorists." [...] He additionally criticized Obama for his stance on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. [...] In keeping with his anti-establishment views, Fiasco does not vote in U.S. elections. On January 20, 2013, he was removed from the stage by the security for refusing to move onto the next song after performing a 30-minute version of [...] "Words I Never Said", which contains anti-Obama lyrics, in Washington D.C., during Obama's second presidential inauguration. In June 2015, Lupe Fiasco wrote an open letter about white supremacy.|$|E
500|$|The casting {{directors}} for Obsessed were Ron Digman and Valorie Massalas. According to Packer, Elba and Larter {{were the}} favorite actors for their respective lead roles; {{he stated that}} [...] "they both brought {{the right amount of}} depth and sex appeal" [...] to the film. He emphasized the need for actors [...] "who were relatable and who can handle that type of human interplay <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the film." [...] Packer showed the film script to Beyoncé's talent agent, who suggested that Beyoncé play the role of Sharon. The producers [...] "immediately ... fell in love with that idea; once she suggested Beyoncé, nobody else could play the role." [...] Packer said that Beyoncé became interested in working on Obsessed because the film was not focused on the music industry, and that {{it was the first time}} she played a non-singer. Packer also reported that [...] "she was looking for that challenge and welcomed this opportunity". Beyoncé stated that she found it challenging to concentrate purely on [...] "the emotion and the psychology of the relationship". Beyoncé had never taken part in a fight scene, but she was able to learn how to perform the scenes quickly because they were similar to dance choreography, with which she was familiar. Larter was inspired by Rita Hayworth, Barbara Stanwyck and Faye Dunaway, all of whom had previously portrayed femmes fatale. Obsessed was filmed over the summer of 2008, and the final fight scene between Sharon and Lisa was shot over one week.|$|E
500|$|Framestore {{was chosen}} {{to work on the}} Cloak of Levitation, due to their work {{creating}} Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy. Ceretti called Cloak's actions [...] "kind of scripted but not as deeply" [...] as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process [...] "we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film". Framestore also worked on environment shots, the Mandelbrot set sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form [...] "one of the hardest effects we’ve had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful." [...] Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a geode. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence {{at the beginning of the}} film. In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as [...] "it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [...] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff… these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [...] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [...] of the entire space." [...] On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, [...] "We tried to make it alive all the time—the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment," [...] with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit [...] "with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [...] colors, crazy blacklight colors." [...] He continued, [...] "It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [...] we really tried to be faithful to." ...|$|E

And I’m not an advocate for that. However, I {{think that we need to}} prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the country." ...|$|E

50|$|By far, {{the most}} {{frequent}} biblical argument against Christian naturism is that if God approved of people being nude, {{he would not have}} clothed Adam and Eve after they sinned, thus making it a reminder to man <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had,</b> <b>in</b> fact, sinned. The counter-argument is Adam and Eve had already clothed themselves upon sinning, and God merely replaced the fig leaves with animal skins in granting them free will.|$|R

2500|$|One {{response}} {{to this kind of}} criticism is to argue that no inconsistencies exist. As theologian John Barton explains, some Christians read the Bible with the assumption that [...] "Scripture is self-consistent", and that if there appear to be contradictions between two texts, they believe that [...] "more careful reading is required to show that they really cohere". Barton states that [...] "this is not the Bible <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> fact got". He also points out that Judaism understands that texts [...] "may sometimes be in dialogue with each other" [...] and [...] "something positive may emerge from a kind of creative tension".|$|E

Mr. Fernandez added that, [...] "the high quality of water is also a result of the rigorous process of water treatment <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have.</b> <b>In</b> fact, people in many other countries do not drink the water that is provided from their municipal service.

2500|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} to make desecration of the Australian flag a crime. In 1953, during the second reading debate on the Flags Act, {{the leader of the}} Opposition, Arthur Calwell, unsuccessfully called for provisions {{to be added to the}} bill to criminalise desecration. Michael Cobb introduced private member's bills in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992 to ban desecration, but on each occasion the bill lapsed. In 2002, the leader of the National Party, John Anderson, proposed to introduce laws banning desecration of the Australian flag, a call that attracted support from some parliamentarians both in his own party and the senior Coalition partner, the Liberal Party. The Prime Minister, John Howard, rejected the calls stating that [...] "...in the end I guess it's part of the sort of free speech code <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> this country". In 2003, the Australian Flags (Desecration of the Flag) Bill was tabled in Parliament by Trish Draper without support from Howard and subsequently lapsed. In 2006, following a flag-burning incident during the 2005 Cronulla riots and a burnt flag display by a Melbourne artist, Liberal MP Bronwyn Bishop introduced the Protection of the Australian National Flag (Desecration of the Flag) Bill 2006. This bill sought to make it [...] "a criminal offence to wilfully destroy or otherwise mutilate the Flag in circumstances where a reasonable person would infer that the destruction or mutilation is intended publicly to express contempt or disrespect for the Flag or the Australian Nation." [...] The bill received a second reading but subsequently lapsed and did not go to vote in the House of Representatives.|$|E
