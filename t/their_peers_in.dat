5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. <b>Their</b> <b>peers</b> <b>in</b> the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examines the}} role of students' home and school variables in producing the achievement gap between second-generation Turkish students and <b>their</b> native <b>peers</b> <b>in</b> Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. Using the data from PISA 2006, this study supports past findings that both home and school resources affect the educational outcomes of immigrant students in their host society's school system. Specifically, the findings reveal that in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, second-generation Turkish students had significant disadvantages in terms of allocated resources {{at home and in}} school. More often than not, these disadvantages were found to have significantly negative effects in terms of second-generation Turkish students' test outcomes relative to <b>their</b> native <b>peers.</b> <b>In</b> all three countries, however, the differences between the second-generation Turkish students and <b>their</b> native <b>peers</b> <b>in</b> terms of <b>their</b> family/home resources were found to explain more of the achievement gap than the differences in their schooling resources.

40|$|The German reunification, {{which several}} economists have called a natural experiment, {{provides}} the unique possibility to inquire {{the impact of}} migration on subjective well-being (SWB). The main goal of the research is to assessing the impact of adaptation, social comparison and relative deprivation on the change in SWB associated with moving from Eastern to Western Germany after the German reunification in 1989. We suspect that the gains or losses in subjective well-being after migration {{are affected by the}} way migrants adapt to their new economic conditions, by with whom migrants compare themselves (that is, their reference group), <b>their</b> former <b>peers</b> <b>in</b> the East or <b>their</b> new <b>peers</b> <b>in</b> the West, and how well they integrate into the new society, that means whether they are relatively deprived with respect to earnings or not. We estimate fixed- and random-effects Generalized Least Square panel regression models. Our results indicate a positive and lasting effect of migration on SWB, although it is strongly suppressed by dissatisfaction resulting from the comparison of migrants' income with the incomes of <b>their</b> former <b>peers</b> <b>in</b> East Germany and the relatively higher earnings of <b>their</b> new <b>peers</b> <b>in</b> West Germany. Moreover, our analyses provide an explanation for the increase of SWB associated with an increase in income found in East Germany after the reunification; a deviation from the Easterlins' paradox...|$|R

We use three years of student level discipline data for an entire state to assess whether non-white students are receiving different disciplinary consequences from <b>their</b> white <b>peers</b> <b>in</b> the same schools, for similar infractions and with similar behavioral history. We find that Black students received more severe (longer) punishments than <b>their</b> White <b>peers</b> <b>in</b> the state for the same types of infractions.

25|$|In 1862 {{the oldest}} polo club still in existence, Calcutta Polo Club, was {{established}} by two British soldiers, Sherer and Captain Robert Stewart. Later they spread the game to <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> <b>in</b> England. The British are credited with spreading polo worldwide in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. Military officers imported the game to Britain in the 1860s. The establishment of polo clubs throughout England and western Europe followed after the formal codification of rules. The 10th Hussars at Aldershot, Hants, introduced polo to England in 1834. The game's governing body in the United Kingdom is the Hurlingham Polo Association, which drew up {{the first set of}} formal British rules in 1874, many of which are still in existence.|$|E
25|$|Most Waldorf-inspired {{schools in}} the United States are {{elementary}} schools established as either magnet or charter schools. The first Waldorf-inspired high school was launched in 2008 with assistance from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. While these schools follow a similar developmental approach as the independent schools, Waldorf-inspired schools must demonstrate achievement on standardized tests {{in order to continue}} receiving public funding. Studies of standardized test scores suggest that students at Waldorf-inspired schools tend to score below <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> <b>in</b> the earliest grades and catch up or surpass their peers by middle school. One study found that students at Waldorf-inspired schools watch less television and spend more time engaging in creative activities or spending time with friends. Public Waldorf schools' need to demonstrate achievement through standardized test scores has encouraged increased use of textbooks and expanded instructional time for academic subjects.|$|E

25|$|A {{distinguishing}} feature {{that marks the}} Star Sapphires as unique among <b>their</b> <b>peers,</b> <b>in</b> Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps, is their use of conversion crystals. While other Corps exclusively recruit their members by sending out their rings in search of sentient beings, the Star Sapphires are also shown as being able to convert other Corps members into Star Sapphires. By encasing the members of other Corps within violet rehabilitation crystals on Zamaron, the light of their rings is slowly transformed into violet, whereupon they emerge as newly formed Star Sapphires, such as Yrra Cynril (Fatality). Similarly, violet power rings also momentarily encase new members to the Corps in crystal before granting them their Star Sapphire abilities and uniform. Those imprisoned within the crystals can be freed by an outside force, or free themselves if sufficiently motivated, interrupting the transformation process before it's complete.|$|E
25|$|At a young age, {{children}} can already utilize {{their knowledge of}} different social categories to form stereotypes about what they understand about men and women. Interaction with peer groups will often shape people’s behavior to fit normative expectations. Children often group together with other children of the same-gender. Belonging in a group that shares the same gender identity will often endorse more gender appropriate traits. An {{example of this is}} the fact that girls have more expressive traits than boys. Research also show that children often engage in play with same-sex peers, and exclude others who are different from the norm. For example, children who want to join a group will only be allowed to engage in play if they are a same-gender peer who has had prior experience with the activity, or an opposite-gender peer who has not had prior experience. The desire to engage in play can influence a child to behave like to <b>their</b> <b>peers.</b> <b>In</b> later life, as children starts to move away from their parents, the role of friendship becomes much more influential.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{political}} impacts of the massive infusion into the South Vietnamese economy was to expand the urban middle-class and ease {{the pressure on the}} government to collect taxes. This was because the government had set high import duties, which were effectively 50% of the cut-price exchange rate used under the CIP; these funds were also part of normal revenue, and were not subject to American oversight, unlike the proceeds of the counterpart fund. As a result of the proceeds of the import duty, income tax was very low, and without the progressive income tax rate in most countries, the upper-class were not affected by taxation as much as <b>their</b> <b>peers</b> <b>in</b> other nations, and thus supported Diem strongly. The effective income taxation rate was no more than 5%, and the South Vietnamese president privately told an adviser from the Michigan State University Group that he was happy that the CIP had allowed him to build a large support base among the newly created middle and upper class. American economic aid administrators were also aware {{of the effects of the}} CIP on urban political support for Diem and his successors. They were aware that the CIP had not been yielding substantial gains in economic development, and noted this in their reports, but said that the program should be continued regardless, as it was effective in enriching the urban middle class and ensuring their political support, thereby gaining loyalty from military officers, business leaders and public servants. A 1959 report concluded that if the CIP was absent or diluted to equilibrium economic levels, the resulting fall in living standards would create [...] "serious political problems" [...] due to erosion of the government's support among the urban minority.|$|E
