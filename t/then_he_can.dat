25|$|If the General Counsel {{believes}} that there is cause to issue complaint, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> seek injunctive relief from a federal district court under Section 10(j) of the Act. Injunctive relief is usually ordered when necessary to preserve the status quo pending the Board's decision on the complaint or to prevent employees from suffering irreparable harm. Any injunction lapses once the NLRB issues its decision.|$|E

For, if God enforces the consequences of actions <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> do so without karma. If however, he is assumed to be within the law of karma, then karma itself would be the giver of consequences {{and there would be no}} need of a God.|$|E

25|$|The game {{is divided}} into three steps. The player has firstly access to {{information}} about the vent and its context, using timelines and maps. <b>Then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> play successively as the different protagonists of the event. He is asked to make a decision, following what he thinks the stakeholder should do. Finally, the player predicts shich decision the protagonist will make. When the player comes again later, he is informed of the decisions that were made in the real world. Play the News is built around a community, where every player has a profile. He may read statistics on the accuracy of his predictions and the tendency of his opinions (mainstream or fringe within the community).|$|E
25|$|Arachne {{is upset}} that Spider-Man {{has not taken}} her bait, and she visits him in another dream {{in which the two}} of them get married. When that does not work, she uses a {{headline}} in the Daily Bugle about 50 stolen pairs of shoes to weasel her way into the office of J. Jonah Jameson. Her furies steal the shoes for themselves and descend upon Jameson ("Deeply Furious"). Arachne convinces him to run a headline pronouncing Spider-Man a needed hero, and he does. After enjoying the blackout and its intimacy, MJ and Peter come to a standstill: because of the dreams and the added pressure of needing Spider-Man, Peter doesn't think he can be good enough for MJ anymore. She assures him that he is all she needs in the world ("If the World Should End"). On a path of soul-searching, Peter realizes that if MJ loves him <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> go on being Spider-Man; he finds his inner hero and vanquishes the Sinister Six ("The Boy Falls From the Sky").|$|E
500|$|As {{established}} by the Constitution of Australia, the Parliament of Australia is composed of two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate, together with the Queen. The monarch is represented through the Governor-General, who has executive powers granted in the Constitution, as well as rarely exercised reserve powers. The reserve powers are the legal authorities remaining in the Crown after most of its historic powers were transferred to Parliament or to officials. The Governor-General ordinarily acts only upon {{the advice of the}} government, but can act independently and against advice in exercising the reserve powers. The Governor-General is removable by the Queen on the advice of the Australian Prime Minister. As Liberal Party leader Malcolm Fraser, who would play a large part in the crisis, put it, [...] "The Queen has tenure, and she couldn't be sacked. But a Governor-General holds office at pleasure, and if he ceases to please <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be removed by a Prime Minister." ...|$|E

[...] The Los Angeles Times characterizes him as [...] "charming but complicated", while others publications have described him as a villain, as well as an evil, powerful and ruthless character. Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote that Victor is a male chauvinist. Although he is often considered malicious, Braeden stated that [...] "Bill Bell was a very wise man" [...] and that [...] "he created someone in Victor who is a very lonely man yet also a man who can be affectionate and loving and forgiving".

500|$|The comic {{efficacy}} of Homer's personality lies in his frequent bouts of bumbling stupidity and laziness, and his explosive anger. He {{has a low}} intelligence level and is described by director David Silverman as [...] "creatively brilliant in his stupidity". Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and [...] "is devoted to his stomach". His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to [...] "change ... his mind when things go badly". Homer often spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern, and was shown in the episode [...] "Duffless" [...] (season four, 1993) as a full-blown alcoholic. He is very envious of his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family, and is easily enraged by Bart. Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse in a cartoonish manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short [...] "Family Portrait". According to Matt Groening, the rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with pre-meditation, because doing so [...] "seems sadistic. If we keep it that he's ruled by his impulses, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> easily switch impulses. So, even though he impulsively wants to strangle Bart, he also gives up fairly easily." [...] Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would [...] "always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back", but this was dropped. Homer shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family.|$|E

2500|$|The longer {{poems are}} inevitably less {{abstract}} and impersonal {{but they do}} not show any real break with his approach to poetry. [...] In place of the concentrated focus on one object or small group of objects, the longer poems have scope for a more comprehensive assessment of exterior reality. [...] Instead of flashes of ecstasy, the pursuit of plenitude and essence is an ongoing quest. [...] The poetry continues to avoid anecdotal narrative but the greater circumstantial and temporal definition of the longer poems gives this edition an enhanced awareness of human contact with the real world. [...] There is in addition a far more detailed examination of big themes such as love – [...] "Salvación de la primavera" [...] – and death – [...] "Muerte a lo lejos" [...] – although {{it should be noted that}} the poet takes a very detached view of death. [...] It will happen one day and until <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> enjoy life in the present.|$|E

He took control of Kabul and the central government, declaring war against Nasrullah. [...] Nasrullah did not want any blood shed in order {{for him to be}} king. [...] He told Amanullah that he can have the kingdom, and he will take exile in Saudi Arabia. [...] Amanullah Khan swore upon the Quran that no harm would come to Nasrullah if he returned to Kabul and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> do as he pleased. [...] Fearing that Nasrullah's supporters would rise against Amanullah, he went against his word and imprisoned Nasrullah and his supporters. On February 28, 1919, Amanullah proclaimed himself Emir, and on March 3, 1919 Nasrullah was arrested by Amanullah's forces.|$|E

2500|$|Toronto {{lost their}} home opener July 11 versus Saskatchewan by {{a score of}} 46–36. The Argonauts {{committed}} 12 penalties for 124yards, 109yards of which were in the first half. The Argonauts opened the game strongly by scoring a touchdown on their opening drive and scoring a field goal after blocking a Luca Congi field goal try to take an early 10–0 lead. Toronto penalties assisted a Saskatchewan drive for a touchdown to make it 10–7. Then, Toronto kicker Justin Medlock made another field goal to end the first quarter with a 13–7 lead. In the second quarter, Toronto allowed Saskatchewan to score thirty unanswered points. Toronto came {{back in the second}} half scoring three touchdowns and a field goal and holding Saskatchewan to three field goals but ended up losing by 10. After the game, an angry coach Andrus said that players needed to control the penalties. Adriano Belli in particular, who took 4 penalties for 44yards in the first half including a head butt that continued the Roughriders first drive for a touchdown, took some criticism: [...] "If he wants to be a WWE wrestler, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> go do that, but he is not going to do on my football team", said Andrus.|$|E
