5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hemolytic anemia (anemia due {{to the destruction of}} red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E

The novel features Asian-Canadian characters in these lesbian relationships, incorporating {{racial and ethnic}} identity into a queer understanding of speculative fiction. Salt Fish Girl engages queer ideas in regards to procreation and bodies, as characters are able to give birth without sperm by eating the durian fruit. It was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. award in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Many other botanists echoed Lindley's earlier {{concerns}} about the phylogeny of the Liliaceae, but various schemes to divide the family gained little traction. Dahlgren (1985) suggested there were in fact forty – not one – families distributed over three orders (predominantly Liliales and Asparagales). In <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> general review of the classification of angiosperms, the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. Considerable progress in plant phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabled a phylogenetic tree to be constructed {{for all of the}} flowering plants, as elaborated by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (1998).|$|E

5|$|On October 26, 1996, a {{well-known}} gaming clan, the Rangers, surprised the Quake community with Diary of a Camper, the first widely known machinima film. This short, 100-second demo file contained {{the action and}} gore of many others, but in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brief story, rather than the usual deathmatch. An example of transformative or emergent gameplay, this shift from competition to theater required both expertise in and subversion of the game's mechanics. The Ranger demo emphasized this transformation by retaining specific gameplay references in its story.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{had already}} experimented with filming outside <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{standard}} rock concert, including an hour-long performance in KQED TV studios in April 1970. Adrian Maben had {{become interested in}} combining art with Pink Floyd's music, and during 1971, he attempted to contact the band's manager, Steve O'Rourke, to discuss the possibilities of making a film to achieve this aim. After his original plan of mixing the band with assorted paintings had been rejected, Maben went on holiday to Naples in the early summer.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Justice started {{keeping a}} list of {{organizations}} that it deemed subversive beginning in 1942. This list was first made public in 1948, when it included 78 items. At its longest, it comprised 154 organizations, 110 of them identified as Communist. In <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> loyalty review, membership in a listed organization was meant to raise a question, but not to be considered proof of disloyalty. One {{of the most common}} causes of suspicion was membership in the Washington Bookshop Association, a left-leaning organization that offered lectures on literature, classical music concerts and discounts on books.|$|E

5|$|The Thousand-Year Door {{is set in}} {{the town}} of Rogueport, in the Mushroom Kingdom. The {{majority}} of locations are not featured in previous Mario games. Most locations consist of a set theme; Glitzville, for example, is a floating city centered around a fighting arena known as the Glitz Pit. The enemies and town inhabitants in the game range from recurring Mario characters, like Boo, to characters exclusive to the game, such as the X-Nauts. For many stages in the game, the story is presented in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> novel, and is divided into eight chapters (nine counting the prologue).|$|E
5|$|The {{activities}} and structures of proteins may {{be examined in}} vitro, in vivo, and in silico. In vitro studies of purified proteins in controlled environments are useful for learning how a protein carries out its function: for example, enzyme kinetics studies explore the chemical mechanism of an enzyme's catalytic activity and its relative affinity for various possible substrate molecules. By contrast, in vivo experiments can provide information about the physiological role of a protein in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cell or even a whole organism. In silico studies use computational methods to study proteins.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{methodology}} {{was developed}} in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the Methodenstreit. Weber's position was close to historicism, as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors). Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis. Therefore, Weber {{was more interested in}} explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future.|$|E

The SOM-PCA, a collaborative-based data mining approach, is shown to be reusable for all three purposes above, enabling fast, objective implementations without requiring much intensive data collection.

By 1994, it had become more conservative, stressing law and order as well as traditional morals and values. Over the years, it also sought to make divorce more difficult, particularly for families with children. The party also lent much space to discussing the AIDS virus, which it put in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> moral crisis and moral relativism that it considered to only be solvable by returning to traditional morality.|$|E
5|$|Bold {{experiments}} in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: Lady in the Lake, for example, is shot entirely {{from the point}} of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors. The Chase (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent in <b>the</b> <b>context</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both Sunset Boulevard and D.O.A. are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and Memento.|$|E

The level of connection to the mythos varies between each title. The series title translates from Latin as 'The New Tale of the Crystal'.
