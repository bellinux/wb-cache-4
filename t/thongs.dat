5|$|Friends <b>Thongs</b> and Octopus evade {{security}} guards in a hospital, having stolen money and cancer medication from the safe. Meanwhile, {{a newborn baby}} to the wealthy Lee family is snatched by Max, the mother's ex-boyfriend, prompting the {{security guards}} give chase, ignoring the burglars, and corner Max on an escalator. Following a violent struggle, Max and the baby fall over the side—the baby is caught by <b>Thongs,</b> while Max plummets to his death. While the guards are distracted, <b>Thongs</b> and Octopus leave in the Landlord's minivan.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thongs</b> and Octopus {{are taken}} to the triad boss, who insists the baby is his grandson, only to be proven wrong by the blood test. Driven mad, the boss places the baby in a deep freeze room next to Max's corpse so the baby can be with his son, {{prompting}} <b>Thongs</b> and Octopus {{to fight for the}} baby. The two end up trapped in the room with two minions, but are saved when Inspector Mok arrives with the Landlord, who swiftly cracks the lock to the room. <b>Thongs</b> and Octopus run to the garage with the comatose baby, where <b>Thongs</b> attempts to revive him with a makeshift defibrillator powered by a car battery from a Pagani Zonda. Despite his efforts, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an ambulance, where his heart is found to be beating weakly. Imprisoned for kidnapping, <b>Thongs,</b> Octopus and the Landlord volunteer for a mock capital punishment demonstration during an open day, using the opportunity to apologise to their loved ones. After the demonstration, Inspector Mok informs the three that their sentences have been further reduced by the Department of Justice. <b>Thongs,</b> Octopus, and the Landlord then see the baby alive and well with his parents. As a token of appreciation for saving the baby's life, <b>Thongs,</b> Octopus and the Landlord are offered jobs by the Lee family as a bodyguard, chauffeur and head of security respectively.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} release, the Landlord {{is brought to}} the triad boss, who {{increases}} his offer to HK$30 million for the baby. He finds <b>Thongs</b> and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is being treated for fever. The Landlord informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but <b>Thongs</b> and Octopus {{are more concerned about}} the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them {{with the rest of the}} money. They reach the triad boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly. As the trio are about to leave, they hear the baby crying for them as a blood sample is taken from his arm. <b>Thongs</b> and Octopus experience a flashback of the days they spent with the baby. Overcome by their feelings, they fight their way into the triad boss' private amusement park to recover the baby while the Landlord leaves with the money. <b>Thongs</b> almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.|$|E

5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people should avoid jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing <b>thongs</b> or sandals will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised {{to stay away from}} all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|E

The seafront area was also used for the film Angus, <b>Thongs</b> and Perfect Snogging directed by Gurinder Chadha. The Langham Hotel was a filming location for Made in Dagenham, which also featured the seafront and pier.

25|$|Perforated antler objects {{discovered}} at Dereivka and other sites contemporary with Suvorovo {{have been identified}} as cheekpieces or ‘’psalia’’ for horse bits. This identification is no longer widely accepted, as the objects in question have not been found associated with horse bones, and could have had a variety of other functions. However, through studies of microscopic wear, it has been established that many of the bone tools at Botai were used to smooth rawhide <b>thongs,</b> and rawhide <b>thongs</b> might have been used to manufacture of rawhide cords and ropes, useful for horse tack. Similar bone thong-smoothers are known from many other steppe settlements, but it cannot be known how the <b>thongs</b> were used. The oldest artifacts clearly identified as horse tack—bits, bridles, cheekpieces, or any other kind of horse gear—are the antler disk-shaped cheekpieces associated with the invention of the chariot, at the Sintashta-Petrovka sites.|$|E
