5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Blyth {{was first}} {{recorded}} from 1138, when monks at Newminster Abbey exported salt, having created it from pans {{on the north}} side of the river and evaporated using the copious supplies of local coal. Coal exports started from the 14th century, with local mines recorded from the 16th century. In 1609 21,571 tons of coal were shipped from Blyth. The first large quay - Bishop's Quay, which still exists today - was developed by 1682. But the port was not dredged at this time, necessitating the use of Northumbrian keel boats to transfer <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> to ships moored offshore. By 1730 specific coaling and ballast quays existed, and by 1765 the ports facilities included a pilot house and lighthouse, to facilitate the newly built first breakwater, North Dyke. The High Lighthouse came into operation soon afterwards, operating until July 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{completed}} in 1928 by the NSW Department of Public Works and, although opened as a traffic bridge, {{it was designed to}} carry <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> required for a railway, once the Mildura railway line had been extended over the bridge. The line was never extended beyond Yelta, where the terminus remains to this day. The location of the bridge was thought to be convenient, as it provided a link to the Sturt Highway without travelling farther upstream to Mildura. It is the only remaining steel truss bridge with a lift span on the Murray, although other lifting bridges still exist along the river. The bridge was built after the decline in commercial river traffic on the Murray. Due to its significance to the local area, it has been listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.|$|E
30|$|As a {{harmonic}} <b>load</b> {{moves along}} <b>the</b> rail, vibration wave are {{generated in the}} rail ahead and behind <b>the</b> <b>load.</b> Due to <b>the</b> <b>load</b> speed, <b>the</b> wave ahead <b>the</b> <b>load</b> {{is different from that}} behind <b>the</b> <b>load,</b> not only in amplitude, but also in wavelength and decay rate.

5|$|Using these {{metal frames}} for taller buildings, however, meant exposing them to {{increased}} wind pressure. As a consequence, protective wind bracing {{had to be}} introduced, enabled {{by the work of}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel who produced equations for calculating <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> and moments on larger buildings. Metal-framed buildings were also vulnerable to fire and required special fireproofing. French engineers had made advances in this area in the early 19th century, and major breakthroughs came with the work of architect Peter Wight in the 1860s. Spurred on by the catastrophic fires in Chicago in 1871 and Boston in 1872, his findings were turned into a wide variety of patented fireproofing products during the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|All {{available}} lorries and camels were organised in convoys moving {{north from}} the railhead along the Gaza to Junction Station road from Deir el Belah to El Mejdel {{and then on}} to Julis, where the 26 and 27 Depot Unit of Supply (DUS) set up advanced supply dumps to serve the Australian Mounted Division and the Anzac Mounted Division. From these dumps the Transport Sections of 5 Company (New Zealand Army Service Corps) and the 32nd, 33rd, and 34th Companies (Australian Army Service Corps) served the Anzac Mounted Division, and the 35th, 36th, and 37th Companies served the Australian Mounted Division. These companies of horse- and mule-drawn wagons could operate to serve their brigades during brigade operations and when required could form into divisional trains during divisional operations. A forward lorry-head was established at Ramleh, where <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> were dumped and the Transport Companies distributed the supplies to the forward units. Members of the Egyptian Labour Corps (as second drivers) worked alongside the Australian Army Service Corps transporting, loading, and unloading the General Service and Limber wagons of supplies ordered by the brigades. The huge endeavour was administered by the supply sections in a similar fashion to the divisional ammunition columns which also worked to supply ammunition to the fighting units in a similarly continuous operation.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) armour plating was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E
50|$|The FWD is {{designed}} to impart a <b>load</b> pulse to <b>the</b> pavement surface which simulates <b>the</b> <b>load</b> produced by a rolling vehicle wheel. <b>The</b> <b>load</b> is produced by dropping a large weight, and transmitted to the pavement through a circular load plate - typically 300 mm diameter on roads and 450 mm on airports. A load cell mounted on top of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> plate measures <b>the</b> <b>load</b> imparted to <b>the</b> pavement surface. <b>The</b> <b>load</b> plate can be solid or segmented. The advantage of a segmented load plate is that it adopts {{to the shape of}} the pavement, giving an even distribution of <b>the</b> <b>load</b> on uneven surfaces. Typically, <b>the</b> <b>load</b> for road testing is about 50 kN giving about 700 kPa pressure under <b>the</b> <b>load</b> plate.|$|R

5|$|The balloon {{had carried}} {{a lot of}} food, of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andr√©e had {{reasoned}} that {{they might as well}} throw excess food overboard as sand, if losing weight was necessary; and if it was not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become necessary. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767kg (1690lb) altogether, including 200liters of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk. By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200kg (440lb). This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> down to 130kg per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.|$|E

25|$|VNAs {{designed}} for the simultaneous measurement of the S-parameters of networks with more than two ports are feasible but quickly become prohibitively complex and expensive. Usually their purchase is not justified since the required measurements can be obtained using a standard 2-port calibrated VNA with extra measurements followed by the correct interpretation of the results obtained. The required S-parameter matrix can be assembled from successive two port measurements in stages, two ports at a time, on each occasion with the unused ports being terminated in high quality loads equal to the system impedance. One risk {{of this approach is}} that the return loss or VSWR of <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> themselves must be suitably specified to be {{as close as possible to}} a perfect 50 Ohms, or whatever the nominal system impedance is. For a network with many ports there may be a temptation, on grounds of cost, to inadequately specify the VSWRs of <b>the</b> <b>loads.</b> Some analysis will be necessary to determine what the worst acceptable VSWR of <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> will be.|$|E
25|$|Baumann was {{an early}} expert in {{light-weight}} construction techniques and placed the four engines in nacelles mounted between {{the upper and lower}} wing decks to distribute <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> to save weight in the wing spars.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of this design was that the main landing gear, which retracted through an 85-degree angle, {{was attached to the}} fuselage, making it possible to completely remove the wings for servicing without additional equipment to support the fuselage. It also allowed simplification of the wing structure, since it did not have to bear <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> imposed during takeoff or landing. The one major drawback of this landing gear arrangement was its narrow wheel track, making the aircraft unstable while on the ground. To increase stability, the legs were splayed outward somewhat, creating another problem in that <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> imposed during takeoff and landing were transferred up through the legs at an angle.|$|E
30|$|Load at {{failure was}} lowest for <b>the</b> {{laterally}} <b>loaded</b> specimens (995 ¬†N) and highest for <b>the</b> vertically <b>loaded</b> specimens (7, 273 ¬†N). <b>The</b> <b>load</b> set-up in <b>the</b> present model resulted primarily in a tensile <b>load</b> over <b>the</b> epiphyseal plate in <b>the</b> laterally <b>loaded</b> specimens, a shear <b>load</b> in <b>the</b> anteriorly <b>loaded</b> specimens and a compressive load in those <b>loaded</b> vertically. <b>The</b> highest strength was therefore {{to be expected}} in <b>the</b> vertically <b>loaded</b> specimens, where <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> direction is comparable to <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> direction in vivo [[18]‚Äì[21]].|$|R

25|$|The {{wind loading}} on a {{skyscraper}} is also considerable. In fact, the lateral wind load imposed on super-tall structures is generally the governing {{factor in the}} structural design.

25|$|Structural {{engineering}} {{is concerned with}} the structural design and structural analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, aerostructure and other structures. This involves identifying <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. <b>The</b> <b>loads</b> can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be serviceable). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including wind engineering and earthquake engineering.|$|E
