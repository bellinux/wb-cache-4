5|$|A boy {{known as}} Musashi, reincarnated from the legendary Brave Fencer Musashi who saved the Allucaneet Kingdom from a monster called the Wizard of Darkness 150 years before, is summoned to Allucaneet by its ruler Princess Fillet {{to save it}} from the invading Thirstquencher Empire. Musashi is given the blade Fusion, and is charged {{with the task of}} obtaining Brave Fencer Musashi's sword — Lumina, the Sword of Luminescence — before the Thirstquencher Army does. Although Musashi has no {{intention}} of saving the kingdom, he agrees to do so in order to return to his homeland. After Musashi recovers Lumina, he finds <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> from the Allucaneet kingdom, including Fillet, have been kidnapped by the Thirstquencher Empire. In order to rescue all the residents from Allucaneet and defeat the Empire, Musashi starts searching for the Five Scrolls; each one holding an elemental power able to greatly augment the sword Lumina's powers.|$|E

500|$|Riz Ahmed {{was one of}} seventy-five {{actors to}} {{audition}} {{for the role of}} Rick. The British actor was attending a friend's wedding in Los Angeles, when his talent agent suggested he meet Gilroy to discuss the film's script. Gilroy told Ahmed that he had seen his previous work; he was not fit for the role, but still allowed him to audition. Within the first minute of his audition tape, however, Gilroy felt confident in the actor's abilities. To prepare for the role, Ahmed met with homeless people in Skid Row, and researched homeless shelters to [...] "understand the system". He found <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> dealt with abandonment issues, and attempted to replicate this in Rick's abusive relationship with Lou. Additionally, Gilroy, Gyllenhaal, and Ahmed rode with the Raishbrook brothers at night to accurately portray their lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|Patton {{attracted}} controversy {{as military}} governor {{when it was}} noted that several former Nazi Party members continued to hold political posts in the region. When responding to the press about the subject, Patton repeatedly compared Nazis to Democrats and Republicans in noting <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> with experience in infrastructure management had been compelled to join the party in the war, causing negative press stateside and angering Eisenhower. On September 28, 1945, after a heated exchange with Eisenhower over his statements, Patton was relieved of his military governorship. He was relieved of command of the Third Army on October 7, and in a somber change of command ceremony, Patton concluded his farewell remarks, [...] "All good things must come to an end. The best thing that has ever happened to me thus far is the honor and privilege of having commanded the Third Army." ...|$|E
500|$|Pickens {{prepared}} for this role by observing several of Kersh's real-life counterparts at the FBI's Los Angeles office, where, according to the actor, the most useful thing he learned was <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> at Kersh's level {{had been with the}} Bureau for twenty or twenty-five years and had not reached their positions in the FBI hierarchy by taking their work less than seriously or bucking the system without good reason. Robert Patrick, who portrayed John Doggett, recognized that his own character and Kersh were [...] "both military men – Air Force, Marines". Kersh was depicted as a United States Navy A-6 Intruder weapons officer during the Vietnam War. Both Patrick and director Kim Manners thought that, as Kersh, Pickens would [...] "come in each week and just nail his stuff" [...] regardless of what else was going on. Similarly, Frank Spotnitz thought that [...] "Robert Patrick and James Pickens really had a chemistry, loved playing scenes together. And I think their scenes together were some of the finest ones {{in the last two years}} of the show." ...|$|E

500|$|Mario Kart DS is {{the first}} Mario Kart {{iteration}} to support online play. Konno remarked that although both Mario Kart DS and the Halo series of games feature online play, he noted <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who use the feature in Halo games were [...] "hardcore gamers". With Mario Kart DS, Konno wants [...] "everyone to go online, and the technology and time is right for that to happen". Continuing with the tradition of introducing a new gameplay mechanic in each Mario Kart game, Mario Kart DS {{is the first}} in the series to support up to eight players at the same time with game cartridges. New to the series, the game also includes a single-player Battle Mode, which does not require that there be at least two human participants. As the first Mario Kart game for the Nintendo DS, the developers tested several features that took advantage of the device's bottom touchscreen. They considered letting players place items anywhere on the track instead of just behind their kart. However, the developers found it too confusing because the game already had too many distractions, making it difficult to control where to place items while racing.|$|E
500|$|The London Quarterly Review {{began with}} the {{observation}} that [...] "When an intelligent man tells us that he has spent eleven of {{the best years of}} his life in any district, we may be pretty sure he has something to say about it which will interest even those who generally find travels dull reading". The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable, and free of the usual [...] "personal twaddle" [...] of travel and adventure books. The reviewer also remarks on Bates's subtitle [...] "...of the origin of species", that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully. In the reviewer's opinion, Bates says little about [...] "the Darwinian hypothesis", focusing instead steadily on natural history, while making [...] "very shrewd remarks" [...] about human society and giving [...] "most glowing" [...] descriptions of tropical scenery. The reviewer notes <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> Bates meets [...] "had a tinge of colour" [...] but made the [...] "lonely Englishman" [...] comfortable with their [...] "winning cordiality", and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist, complete with insect-net, hunting-bag, pincushion, and an old pair of spectacles. As for nature, the reviewer considers that [...] "in Brazil man is oppressed, crushed, by the immensity of nature".|$|E
2500|$|Waterhouse also {{published}} a {{detailed discussion of}} beliefs expressed in the interviews. She noted that although most people [...] "hold their belief in reincarnation quite lightly" [...] and were unclear {{on the details of}} their ideas, personal experiences such as past-life memories and near-death experiences had influenced most believers, although only a few had direct experience of these phenomena. Waterhouse analyzed the influences of second-hand accounts of reincarnation, writing <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> in the survey had heard other people's accounts of past-lives from regression hypnosis and dreams and found these fascinating, feeling that there [...] "must be something in it" [...] if other people were having such experiences.|$|E

Irving {{made much of}} the statement by the American historian Arno J.

2500|$|While on the Warner Bros. lot, Reubens noticed <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> rode {{around on}} {{bicycles}} and asked {{when he would}} get his. Warner Bros. presented him with a refurbished 1940s Schwinn; Reubens then abandoned the Pee-wee Herman script he had been writing, which {{was to have been}} a retelling of Pollyanna. He began writing about Herman's love for his bike and his efforts to locate it once it was stolen. Hartman, Reubens and Michael Varhol co-wrote the script for Pee-wee's Big Adventure, basing the story loosely on Vittorio De Sica's The Bicycle Thief. The film would be directed by a young Tim Burton, as his feature film debut, and scored by Danny Elfman. It was released on August 9, 1985, and, while receiving mixed reviews, performed well at the box office and would become a cult film. Reubens was the originator of the [...] "Pee-wee dance" [...] in the movie, and he had performed it publicly many times prior to making the film.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on 24 September 2002 on CD and vinyl formats, the latter containing bonus track [...] "Chloroform" [...] after [...] "The Creator Has a Mastertape." [...] A few weeks prior to the album's release, a sampler containing [...] "Blackest Eyes" [...] and shortened versions of [...] "Trains" [...] and [...] "Strip the Soul" [...] was released. The opening track, [...] "Blackest Eyes", was picked up for airplay by major rock radio stations, but the song was not officially released as a single, nor did it chart. The band toured {{in support of the}} album with the band Yes. This is something Wilson would later regret doing, stating that the audiences of the two bands were too different, stating [...] " [...] the problem was <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> who came to see Yes had stopped caring about new music many years before and were really there just to hear their favourite Yes oldies." [...] The band would later do a second tour in support of the album with Opeth as well. [...] During this tour, in July and August 2003, the band released the Futile EP, which included songs recorded during the In Absentia recording sessions.|$|E

6000|$|As I {{have already}} said, {{it must be}} judged as {{something}} more than a literary diversion. [...] "You do not suspect, Sir Philosopher," [...] says Rameau, [...] "that at this moment I represent {{the most important part of}} the town and the court." [...] As the painter of the picture says, Rameau confessed the vices that he had, and <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> about us have; but he was no hypocrite. He was neither more nor less abominable than they; he was only more frank and systematic and profound in his depravity. This is the social significance of the dialogue. This is what, apart from other considerations, makes Rameau's Nephew so much more valuable a guide to the moral sentiment of the time than merely licentious compositions like those of Louvet or La Olos. Its instructiveness is immense to those who examine the conditions that prepared the Revolution. Rameau is not the [Greek: akolastos] of Aristotle, nor the creature of [Greek: aponoia] described by Theophrastus--the castaway by individual idiosyncrasy, the reprobate by accident. The men whom he represented, the courtiers, the financiers, the merchants, the shopkeepers, were immoral by formula and depraved on principle. Vice was a doctrine to them, and wretchlessness of unclean living was reduced to a system of philosophy. Any one, I venture to repeat, who realises the extent to which this had corroded the ruling powers in France, will perceive that the furious flood of social energy which the Jacobins poured over the country was not less indispensable to France than the flood of the barbarians was indispensable for the transformation of the Roman Empire.|$|E
60|$|I {{will now}} ask the {{attention}} of the House for a moment while I examine a group of communications from officers of the Indian Government, and if the House will allow me I will tell them what to my mind is the result of all these communications as to the general feeling in India. That, after all, is what most concerns us. For this unrest in the Punjab and Bengal sooner or later--and sooner, rather than later, I hope--will pass away. What is the situation of India generally in the view of these experienced officers at this moment? Even now when we are passing through all the stress and anxiety, it is a mistake not to look at things rather largely. They all admit that there is a fall in the influence of European officers over the population. They all, or nearly all, admit that there is estrangement--I ought to say, perhaps, refrigeration--between officers and people. There is less sympathy between the Government and the people. For the last few years--and {{this is a very important}} point--the doctrine of administrative efficiency has been pressed too hard. The wheels of the huge machine have been driven too fast. Our administration--so shrewd observers and very experienced observers assure me--would be a great deal more popular if it was a trifle less efficient, a trifle more elastic generally. We ought not to put mechanical efficiency at the head of our ideas. I am leading up to a practical point. The district officers representing British rule to the majority of the people of India, are overloaded with work in their official relations, and I know there are highly experienced gentlemen who say that a little of the looseness of earlier days is better fitted than the regular system of latter days, to win and to keep personal influence, and that we are in danger of creating a pure bureaucracy. Honourable, faithful, and industrious the servants of the State in India are and will be, but if the present system is persisted in, there is a risk of its becoming rather mechanical, perhaps I might even say rather soulless; and attention to this is urgently demanded. Perfectly efficient administration, I need not tell the House, has a tendency to lead to over-centralisation. It is inevitable. The tendency in India is to override local authority, and to force administration to run in official grooves. For my own part I would spare no pains to improve our relations with native Governments, and more and more these relations may become of potential value to the Government of India. I would use my best endeavours to make these States independent in matters of administration. Yet all evidence tends to show we are rather making administration less personal, though evidence also tends to show that the Indian people are peculiarly responsive to sympathy and personal influence. Do not let us waste ourselves in controversy, here or elsewhere, or in mere anger; let us try to draw to our side the men who now influence the people. We have every good reason to believe <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of India are on our side. I do not say for a moment that they like us. It does not come easy, in west or east, to like foreign rule. But in their hearts they know that their solid interest is bound up with the law and order that we preserve.|$|E
