500|$|Jackie's {{academic}} performance reportedly declined, {{and she became}} socially withdrawn due to emotional distress. In May 2013, Jackie reported a sexual assault to dean and head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board, Nicole Eramo, who, according to a recap in New York magazine, offered three options: [...] "file a criminal complaint with the police, file {{a complaint with the}} school, or face her attackers with Eramo present to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>how</b> she feels". The university would not take further action unless Jackie disclosed the names of the individuals or the fraternity involved. In September 2013, Eramo connected Jackie with Emily Renda, a UVA staff member, recent graduate and leader in the college's sexual assault support group One Less. Two years later, in search of a college student to feature in a story about sexual assaults that occur at a prestigious university, Erdely interviewed Renda, who suggested Jackie for the story and made the introduction.|$|E

500|$|In the film, Carey's {{character}} Billie Frank argues {{with her}} boyfriend and producer Dice (Max Beesley) and they break-up. Her emotional pain leads her to solo songwriting. Dice also misses Billie, and also begins writing a song. Billie goes to Dice's apartment {{in an attempt to}} reconcile. He was not home, but the music he has written is and Billie realizes they wrote the same song: [...] "Never Too Far". She kisses the sheet music, leaving a lipstick imprint, which Dice later discovers. Dice plans a reconciliation, but is killed by Billie's former producer Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) after Dice did not pay the US$100,000 from their agreement to release Billie from Walker's contract. At Billie's first show at Madison Square Garden, her management and support crew see a report of the murder on television. They wonder if Billie was with him, they see that she is there and has seen the report. Billie onstage commands the band to stop playing [...] "Loverboy", tells the crowd never to take someone for granted, and that if you love them, you should tell them, because you might never have the chance to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>how</b> you really feel.

500|$|Several critics {{wrote that}} [...] Portal 2 excels in {{teaching}} the player to solve puzzles; {{in a review}} for the New York Times, Seth Schiesel wrote, [...] "Somewhere out there an innovative, dynamic high school physics teacher will use Portal 2 as the linchpin of an entire series of lessons and will immediately {{become the most important}} science teacher those lucky students have ever had." [...] Mathematics and science teachers wrote e-mails to Valve to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>how</b> they had included Portal in their classroom lessons as part of a project to promote the [...] "gamification of learning". Portal developers Joshua Weier and Yasser Malaika led a team within Valve to explore ways of using Portal 2 for education. This {{led to the development of}} Puzzle Maker, a level editor for Portal 2 players, built from the professional tools used to develop the game. Weier and Malaika did not want to design curricula themselves, but wanted to provide educators with tools for creating lesson plans. Hammer, the only tool freely available before the release of the built-in level editor in 2012, was difficult for educators to learn and understand. Valve gave Puzzle Maker an easy-to-learn interface and the ability to share puzzles and lesson plans. The tools were developed with a mathematics teacher and her students. This formed the basis of a new [...] "Steam for Schools" [...] initiative launched in June 2012, under which educators could acquire Portal 2 and the Puzzle Maker software free of charge for classroom use through its [...] "Teach with Portals" [...] program. , Valve estimates that over 2,500 educators are using the [...] "Teach with Portals" [...] software within their lesson plans.|$|E
500|$|The game's audio {{was created}} by Martin Stig Andersen, a {{graduate}} from the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus. Andersen's specialisation was in acousmatic music, non-traditional music created from generated sounds that have no apparent visual source. He was drawn to work with Jensen on the game after seeing the initial trailer, having been drawn in by the expressions of the boy character; Andersen compared the early visuals to his acousmatic music: [...] "you have something recognizable and realistic, {{but at the same}} time it's abstract". Andersen sought to create acousmatic music exclusively incorporating the sound effects of the game's environments. Two examples he pointed to was the use of electricity noises while in the presence of a ruined neon [...] "HOTEL" [...] sign, and silencing the wind sound as the spider approached the boy in the forest. Andersen avoided the use of easily recognizable sounds, distorting them when needed as to allow players to interpret the sounds' meanings for themselves. Andersen constructed most of the game's sounds through a number of [...] "grains" [...] instead of longer sound loops, allowing him to adjust the playback to give better feedback to the player without sounding repetitious; one example he cites was the use of separate sounds for the boy's toe and heel when they make contact with the ground, giving a more realistic sound for movement. Many reviews for the game stated that there was no music in Limbo, but Andersen countered that his sound arrangements helped to evoke emotions; the acousmatic music was intended to leave room for interpretation by the player in the same manner as the game's art and story. Andersen noted that this helps with immersion within the game by making no attempt to control the emotional tone; [...] "if [...] scared it will probably make them more scared when there's no music to take them by the hand and <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>how</b> to feel". Due to fans' requests, Playdead released the game's soundtrack on iTunes Store on 11 July 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Maalin {{remained}} in the Merca area, where he was employed {{in a range of}} roles. In the mid-1990s, he was selling medicines in a nearby small town. Maalin was among the 10,000 volunteers who participated in the effort to eradicate poliomyelitis from Somalia, which succeeded in 2008. He explained his motivation for volunteering: [...] "Somalia was the last country with smallpox. I wanted to help ensure that we would not be the last place with polio too." [...] Maalin worked for WHO as a local coordinator with responsibility for social mobilisation, and spent several years travelling across Somalia, vaccinating children and educating communities. The Boston Globe described him as one of the [...] "most valuable" [...] local coordinators for WHO. He encouraged people to be vaccinated by sharing his experiences with smallpox: [...] "Now when I meet parents who refuse to give their children the polio vaccine, I tell them my story. I <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>how</b> important these vaccines are. I tell them not to do something foolish like me."

2500|$|In July 2009, McCaughey {{claimed that}} a {{section in the}} pending {{healthcare}} legislation, [...] "Advance Care Planning Consultation", actually prescribed [...] "euthanasia for the elderly" [...] because it included provisions that:would make it mandatory — absolutely require — that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>how</b> to end their life sooner [...] decline nutrition, how to decline being hydrated, how to go in to hospice care ... all to do what's in society's best interest or in your family's best interest and cut your life short.McCaughey's choice of words and analysis were described by The Atlantics James Fallows as inaccurate and sensationalistic. Politifact responded that the end-of-life counseling was voluntary, calling McCaughey's claim a [...] "ridiculous falsehood" [...] and giving it their lowest accuracy rating, [...] "pants on fire". Factcheck.org called the claims [...] "nonsense" [...] and stated that what that section of the bill would actually do is [...] "require Medicare to pay for voluntary counseling sessions helping seniors to plan for end-of-life medical care, including designating a health care proxy, choosing a hospice and making decisions about life-sustaining treatment." [...] During an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart which aired on August 20, 2009, McCaughey repeated these assertions about the counselling sessions and referred to the Factcheck.org as [...] "spot-check dot org", claiming they failed to adequately read the House health care bill. In a rebuttal, Factcheck.org stood by their analysis and provided further analysis, which led them to conclude that McCaughey had misinterpreted the bill.|$|E
