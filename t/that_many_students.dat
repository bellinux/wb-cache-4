When Gao discovers that Wei {{does not have a}} high school education and has no special talents, he instructs her to teach by copying his texts onto the board and then making the students copy them into their notebooks; he also tells her not to use more than one piece of chalk per day, because the village is too poor to afford more.

5|$|In 1951, {{the school}} adopted the General Certificate of Education, but {{students}} {{were barred from}} taking any exams {{before the age of}} 16, which meant <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>students</b> left school without any qualifications because of the sheer necessity of leaving school to contribute to household income. The system became more rational in time, but often pupils were taking O-levels and A-levels simultaneously. As of 2010, the school offers GCSEs to students in the lower school, and AS/A-levels to students in the sixth form. Under Rendall, exam pass rates at A-level increased from 67.5percent in 1970, peaking at 95percent in 1984 before decreasing slightly to 92percent in 1987. O-level/GCSE results have similarly improved, reaching a peak of 88percent pass rate in 1978. League tables published by the BBC based on 2008 A-level results rank Judd as the fourth best school in Kent. According to the BBC, in 2009 A-level students achieved an average of 999.2 QCDA points, against a national average of 739.1 and 100percent of students achieved five or more grade C results (or equivalent) at GCSE, including Maths and English. In its league table of the 500 best state secondary schools in the United Kingdom, The Sunday Times ranked The Judd School 27th.|$|E

The committee was chaired by Lord Aberdare and consisted of Viscount Emlyn, Reverend Prebendary H. G. Robinson, Henry Richard, John Rhys and Lewis Morris. The Aberdare report, as it came to be known, took evidence from a wide range of sources and over 250 witnesses and recommended a college for North and South Wales each, the southern to be located in Glamorgan and the Northern to be the already established University College of Wales in Aberystwyth (now Aberystwyth University). The committee cited the unique Welsh national identity and <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>students</b> in Wales could not afford to travel to University in England or Scotland. Furthermore, it advocated for a national degree-awarding university for Wales, composed of the regional colleges. It also recommended that the colleges should be unsectarian in nature and that they should exclude the teaching of theology.|$|E

She graduated at the age of 22 from this university and earned the bachelor's degree in Physics. Because she was the best one in her class and this university wanted to hire some women, she got the chance to stay in this university and work for 8 years. For the first four years, she worked as an assistant to teach some fundamental courses such as mechanism. She taught so well <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>students</b> who were not in this class wanted to listen to her courses. After that she wrote a book named Course for Experiments in Optics and got the certification as a professor. Fukien Christian University had many exchange programs with New York University at that time and many teachers who worked more than 2 years could get the chance to study abroad. However, because she was not a Christian, the person in charge of this program didnâ€™t give her the chance. So she applied for Dickinson College and got a full scholarship by the help of her workmate named Lairong Li.|$|E

2500|$|... "Student syndrome" [...] {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} where a student will begin to fully apply himself or herself to a task only immediately before a deadline.

These self-imposed binding deadlines are correlated with a better performance than without binding deadlines though performance is best for evenly spaced external binding deadlines. Finally, students have difficulties optimally setting self-imposed deadlines, with results suggesting a lack of spacing before the date at which results are due.|$|E

2500|$|The New Brunswick Campus (or Rutgersâ€“New Brunswick) is {{the oldest}} and largest campus of Rutgers; it {{is the site of}} the {{original}} Rutgers College. It is spread across six municipalities in Middlesex County, New Jersey, chiefly in the City of New Brunswick and adjacent Piscataway. It resides right along Route 18. It is composed of five smaller campuses, and a few buildings in downtown New Brunswick. The original and historic College Avenue Campus is adjacent to downtown New Brunswick, and includes the seat of the University, Old Queens and other nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century buildings that constitute the Queens Campus and Voorhees Mall. This campus is the main campus <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>students</b> tend to hang out on due to the proximity to New Brunswick's train station as well as its proximity to the numerous food options located downtown. In addition, the large amount of off-campus housing as well as fraternities and sororities sitting on this campus makes it the most active with groups of students flocking to this hot destination on Friday nights. On {{the other side of the}} city, Douglass Campus and Cook Campus are adjacent and intertwined with each other, and are often referred to collectively as the Cook/Douglass Campus. Cook Campus has extensive farms and woods that reach into North Brunswick and East Brunswick. Separated by the Raritan River are Busch Campus, in Piscataway, and Livingston Campus, also mainly in Piscataway but including remote sections of land extending into Edison and the Borough of Highland Park. The Busch Campus is noted to be the home for Rutgers' highly ranked Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, as well the other biological and engineering majors. On this campus is the golf course as well as the football stadium. The Livingston campus is home to Rutgers' Basketball team as well as many other sports teams at the RAC, a trapezoidal building which currently acts as home for most notably the Men's Basketball Team. Additionally, this campus has undergone many renovations to be regarded as the most [...] "modern" [...] campus. The entrance into this campus is well-stated by an all-glass business building known as the [...] "100 Rock". From this building's fifth floor lounge, one can see the Manhattan Skyline in the heart of New York City on many clear days.
