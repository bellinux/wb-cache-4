500|$|Anthony Benigno of the Daily News commented {{positively}} on {{the arrangement}} of Monteith's song, grading the performance [...] "A". His lowest grade went to [...] "Papa, Can You Hear Me?", which he gave a [...] "C". Benigno felt that both Michele and Colfer's solos were damaged {{by the fact that}} the songs' only link to the episode's plot were their titles, finding it particularly jarring to hear Kurt singing [...] "I wanna be your man" [...] about his father. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff felt that the music was the worst aspect of the episode, similarly criticizing song selections based on their [...] relationship to religion. He felt that Kurt's performance was the only number which worked even slightly, commenting, [...] "it genuinely grows out of the moment, although the fact that Kurt is singing it <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>dad</b> never stops being kind of weird." [...] Both Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV's Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] brought new meaning to the song, with Semigran naming it her favourite number of the episode. She felt that [...] "I Look to You" [...] was the episode's weakest song, preferring Riley's [...] "more powerful" [...] rendition of [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times expressed disappointment in both of Riley's songs, which left her [...] "strangely unmoved". She suggested that, [...] "Mercedes sang admirably, beautifully even, but she didn’t seem truly transported by the music; so we weren't." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry Mitchell — Age 32, [...] Dennis' {{father is}} a workaday {{aerospace}} engineer. Henry seems to understand Dennis more than his wife does, especially in affairs of the heart. One example was when a furious Dennis stormed in, saying, [...] "Wimmin can say some of the stupidest things!"; Henry knowingly said to Alice, [...] "Margaret." [...] Another time, while Dennis was watching Gina, he confided <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>dad,</b> [...] "There's somethin' about Gina that I can't figger out." [...] Henry wisely advised his son, [...] "Wait." [...] Again, Henry and Alice overhear Dennis tell Gina that she [...] "smelled better than a plateful of peanut butter samwiches". Henry remarks, [...] "The ultimate compliment." [...] Like his creator Hank Ketcham, Henry served in the US Navy; his position was [...] as a quartermaster (Helmsman) 2nd class on a battleship. Sometimes, he and Alice will get into arguments (which even show his chauvinistic side at times); however, they remain devoted to each other. Among his hobbies are golf, taking naps, fishing, and playing the ukulele and singing old songs with George Wilson. A running gag is that Henry often plays the straight man dupe — either resulting from Dennis's pranks, or because of his own foolishness; once he tried to save money on a Christmas tree by cutting one down in the country — and ended up paying $20.00 ($10.00 for a fine and $10.00 for the owner charging him for the tree).|$|E

[...] "My sister wrote that mother was not very well and kind o' grievin' about me, so, as I was making good money, I thought I could afford to surprise the old man by slapping him on the back. You see, when I left, I told him I'd never darken his door again--you know the line of talk a boy hands out <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>dad</b> when he's mad--and for over ten years I never so much as wrote a line {{to any of the}} family." ...|$|E
