Comparison between the zonal winds from <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>images</b> and the vertical profile of zonal winds from the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) shows that the zonal winds from the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>images</b> are from a pressure level that is 0. 2 scale heights higher than the pressure level of the zonal winds from continuum-band images. Deeper zonal winds at different latitudes of the equatorial region are measured by tracking cloud features observed within hot spots on continuum-band images. The deeper zonal winds in this study extend the measurement of the Galileo probe to different latitudes of the equatorial region. Comparison between the Galileo probe and this study suggests that these fast-moving clouds within hot spots are deeper than 3 bars and are therefore probably water clouds...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>images</b> {{of several}} galaxies were {{obtained}} during the ASTRO- 1 shuttle mission in December, 1990. The images have a FWHM angular resolution of approximately 3 arcsecond and are of circular fields approximately 40 arcminutes in diameter. Most galaxies {{were observed in}} at least two and sometimes as many as four broad bands. A very few fields were observed with narrower band filters. The most basic result of these observations is that most systems look dramatically different in the UV from their well-known optical appearances. Preliminary results of these studies will be presented. Information will be available on fields observed by the UTI during the ASTRO 1 mission; when that data becomes public it can be obtained from the NSSDC. The ASTRO observatory is expected to fly again in 1994 with approximately half of the observing time from that mission devoted to guest observers. The <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>Imaging</b> telescope is extremely well suited for galaxy studies, and the UIT term is interested in encouraging a wide range of scientific studies by guest observers. <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>Imaging</b> telescope is extremely well suited for galaxy studies, and the UIT team is interested in encouraging a wide range of scientific studies by guest observers...|$|R

A median-Ðltering technique that rejects features varying with time is used to isolate background corona. The coronal hole boundaries, polar plumes, and polar rays in the inner corona are clearly seen in Extreme <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>Imaging</b> Telescope data over 5 months during the last solar minimum (1996 January through May). For the Ðrst time, we provide physical evidence for coronal hole boundaries in the inner corona. The observations show clearly that the polar coronal holes expand divergently with height.

A methodology is presented for processing <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>images</b> based on linear responses and the sensitivity of the respective color channels. The methodology is applied to a FujiS 3 UVIR camera, and a modified Nikon D 70 s camera, to reconstruct their respective spectral sensitivity curves between 320 and 400 nm.
