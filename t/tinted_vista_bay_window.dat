Behind the <b>bay</b> <b>window</b> is the boardroom of the NSR, while {{the remainder of the}} upper floor was designed as office space.

25|$|In a <b>bay</b> <b>window</b> caboose, {{the crew}} {{monitoring}} the train {{sits in the}} middle of the car in a section of wall that projects from the side of the caboose. The windows set into these extended walls resemble architectural <b>bay</b> <b>windows,</b> so the caboose type is called a <b>bay</b> <b>window</b> caboose. This type afforded a better view of the side of the train and eliminated the falling hazard of the cupola. It is thought to have first been used on the Akron, Canton and Youngstown Railroad in 1923, but is particularly associated with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which built all of its cabooses in this design starting from an experimental model in 1930. The <b>bay</b> <b>window</b> gained favor with many railroads because it eliminated the need for additional clearances in tunnels and overpasses.|$|R
