5|$|In September 2010, Volvo Cars and Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, {{issued a}} report {{regarding}} {{the results of the}} first phase of the Volvo V70 Plug-in Hybrid demonstration program. Among other findings, before the trial drivers participating in the field testing were concerned about being a danger to pedestrians and cyclists due to the quietness of the electric-drive vehicle. After the test several of them change their opinion and said <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> was less of a problem than expected. Nevertheless, some test drivers said they experienced incidents of not being noticed while others said they had taken extra care in their driving with regard to this issue.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposed}} merger did not generate significant controversy {{within the}} AWSA. The call to its {{annual meeting in}} 1887, the one that authorized Stone to explore the possibility of merger, did not even mention <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> {{would be on the}} agenda. This proposal was treated in a routine manner during the meeting and was approved unanimously without debate.|$|E
25|$|The {{judgement}} of {{the district}} court was unanimously upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in March 2009. However, appellate court Judge Stephen Williams admonished the city government's attorneys for conducting such sub-par legal work that the appellate court {{had no choice but}} to affirm the district court's ruling. Williams wrote that the scientific literature clearly supported the city's grooming regulation, but <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> had not been raised by city attorneys in a timely manner.|$|E
500|$|The United States Department of State (the federal {{government}} {{agency responsible for}} international relations) considers U.S.-born children of illegal aliens {{to be subject to}} U.S. jurisdiction, and thus to have citizenship at birth.

500|$|The Queensland Government, {{which has}} {{constitutional}} responsibility for land tenure, holds the position <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> is extremely complex {{and that it}} will not be bullied by the Commonwealth. [...] The former state Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Warren Pitt, in 2007 said that all parties have matured since Native Title was introduced and can recognise that while the issues are complex, the betterment of Aboriginal people can be realised.|$|E
500|$|Sadler {{also wrote}} about race: {{he had an}} {{interest}} in eugenics, likely owing to Kellogg's interest in the concept, and Madison Grant's book The Passing of the Great Race. Sadler wrote several works about eugenics, endorsing and heavily borrowing from Grant's views, which posited that the [...] "Nordic race" [...] was superior to others. In his writings, Sadler contended that some races were at a lower stage of evolution—closer to Neanderthals than were other races—and were consequently less civilized and more aggressive. [...] Sadler argued that alcoholism and [...] "feeblemindedness, insanity, and delinquency" [...] were hereditary traits and that those who possessed them were breeding at a much faster rate than [...] "superior human beings". He feared <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> could threaten the [...] "civilization we bequeath our descendants". He also believed that the majority of criminals were mentally ill.|$|E
500|$|The 2012 Southern Lord Records re-issue {{was also}} praised. On Metacritic, {{it has a}} score of 94 out of 100, based on 9 reviews. Exclaim! noted <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> was [...] "cleaner and more powerful, the guitars sound heavier, with a much larger presence, and the mesmerizing {{complexity}} of the track has been reinvigorated." [...] Pitchfork Media gave the album an 8.5 out of 10 and listed {{it as one of}} [...] "the best new reissues" [...] noting that [...] "It's an hour of adventure and momentum, where the lumber and the repetition somehow always push ahead." [...] Consequence of Sound gave the album three and a half stars out of five, stating that [...] "It's not for everybody, certainly; all but the biggest potheads/metalheads may burn out after so much grinding. It's no showcase for songwriting, either, but it makes up for that with heady atmosphere." ...|$|E

500|$|Touchscreen control {{components}} on iPhone 6 logic boards have insufficient support, including {{a lack of}} underfill—which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits, {{and a lack of}} rigid metal shielding on the logic board unlike previous iPhone models; the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible [...] "sticker". Normal use of the device can cause the logic board to flex internally, which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality. A symptom that has been associated with this type of failure is a flickering grey bar {{near the top of the}} display. iFixit reported <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue,</b> nicknamed [...] "touch disease", was a byproduct of the previous [...] "Bendgate" [...] design flaw because of the device's demonstrated lack of rigidity. As such, the larger iPhone 6 Plus is more susceptible to the flaw, but it has also been reported on a small percentage of iPhone 6 models. The devices' successor, the iPhone 6S, is not afflicted by this flaw due to changes to their internal design, which included the strengthening of [...] "key points" [...] in the rear casing, and the re-location of the touchscreen controllers to the display assembly from the logic board.|$|E

2500|$|In a January 2007 {{interview}} with the Financial Times, Calderón said, [...] "We have received very encouraging results.

2500|$|In a {{statement}} {{released to the}} media, Rowling responded favorably to the verdict: [...] "I took no pleasure at all in bringing legal action and am delighted <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> has been resolved favorably. I went to court to uphold the right of authors everywhere {{to protect their own}} original work. The court has upheld that right. The proposed book took an enormous amount of my work and added virtually no original commentary of its own. Many books have been published which offer original insights into the world of Harry Potter. The Lexicon just is not one of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are claims <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> is {{now being}} used by Japanese nationalists, {{including}} Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, to [...] "further militarize", push for revision of the Constitution to reduce constitutional limits on the army, revise the Basic Education Law, and pursue other political goals. Such claims have been criticized by Kyoko Nakayama, the special adviser in Tokyo to the Japanese prime minister on the abduction issue, who said [...] "This is about rescuing our citizens (from ongoing abduction). They deserve all possible support to regain their freedom and dignity. It is our duty to retrieve them." [...] (See Norimitsu Onishi.) ...|$|E
2500|$|While the Court {{notes that}} it could still {{consider}} these arguments even though council for Pyett, O’ Connell and Phillips had not raised them in the lower courts, it chose not to, citing a precedent set in Heckler v. Campbell. [...] In that decision, the Court stated that it would address arguments {{that had not been}} raised in the lower courts “only in exceptional cases.” [...] The 14 Penn Plaza majority followed with “This is not an “exceptional case,” and added <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> “was not fully briefed to this or any court.” [...] Consequently, the Court “hesitat to invalidate arbitration agreements on the basis of speculation.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The Indian players {{released}} few {{statements about}} the issue. Kumble wrote in his column in the Hindustan Times that Ponting {{was not willing to}} listen to his pleas that the issue should remain on the field. Kumble claimed that he knew through experience that such an allegation would have major ramifications {{both on and off the}} field. Tendulkar reportedly sent a text message to the BCCI saying [...] "Harbhajan is innocent and I can assure you on this... In this hour of crisis, the board should stand by him". Tendulkar has reportedly denied sending an SMS to Sharad Pawar. Both teams have expressed hope <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> would not overshadow the cricket.|$|E
2500|$|... "I only {{deemed it}} lawful to kill whoever {{claims that the}} sun is static (thābita la jāriya) and refuses to repent of this after clarification. This is because denying the {{circulation}} of the sun constitutes a denial of Allah (Glorified be He), His Great Book, and His Honorable Messenger. It is well established in the Din (religion of Islam) by way of decisive evidence and Ijma` (consensus) of scholars that whoever denies Allah, His Messenger or His Book is a Kafir (disbeliever) and their blood and wealth become violable. It {{is the duty of}} the responsible authority to ask them to repent of this; either they repent or be executed. Thanks to Allah <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> is not debatable among scholars.".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Architecture and Archaeology" [...] series also {{included}} a number of larger format airmail stamps (1950–1976) with common design, although some specialists treat the two series separately.

[...] Pulver has stated <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> [...] "is made to order for a modern specialist, with collecting challenge comparable to a 19th-century classic issue." [...] Some of the later issues in this series were printed on light-active paper, [...] coated with optical brighteners causing it to fluoresce under ultraviolet light, or which had phosphorescent tagging added. [...] These coatings were used for security purposes and to facilitate high speed machine sorting.|$|E
