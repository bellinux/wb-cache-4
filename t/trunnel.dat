5000|$|A treenail, also trenail, trennel, or <b>trunnel,</b> is {{a wooden}} peg, pin, or dowel used to fasten {{pieces of wood}} together, {{especially}} in timber frames, covered bridges, wooden shipbuilding and boat building. Many such buildings and bridges are still in use. [...] Locust is a favorite wood when making trunnels in shipbuilding due to its strength and rot resistance and red oak is typical in buildings.|$|E
50|$|Another {{blow to the}} Presbyterian Burying Ground {{occurred}} in 1848, when 12.5 acre Oak Hill Cemetery opened just five blocks to the northwest. This garden cemetery with beautiful landscaping, terraces, spacious grounds, and magnificent chapel—created and financed by the city's richest businessman, William Wilson Corcoran—deeply appealed to the residents of Georgetown and Washington. Over the next several years, Oak Hill became not only the cemetery of choice for new burials, but many families disinterred their loved ones at the Presbyterian Burying Ground and reburied them at Oak Hill. Oak Hill quickly expanded, and by 1867 had more than 25 acre of space for burials. Bounded by city streets and existing homes, Presbyterian Burying Ground was limited in size. A large increase in burials at Presbyterian Burying Ground occurred during a cholera epidemic of 1834. Georgetown resident Charles H. <b>Trunnel,</b> who lived during the period, said that the dead {{were brought to the}} cemetery in cartloads. The dead arrived in such numbers so quickly that cemetery officials did not keep accurate records as to where corpses were buried. Many bodies were buried {{in the middle of the}} streets surrounding the cemetery, because church officials worried about filling the cemetery with cholera victims. Another upsurge in burials occurred during the American Civil War, as they did at all regional cemeteries, but otherwise the number of burials at the cemetery remained fairly constant and low.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally <b>trunnels</b> and pegs {{were made}} by {{splitting}} bolts of wood with a froe and shaping them with a drawknife on a shaving horse.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame and}} {{planking}} are of white oak trees {{cut on the}} Benedict estate across the harbor from Brush Island. They were hauled to Buttery Sawmill in Silvermine to be cut into lumber. The hull is all white oak, double planked and put together by <b>trunnels.</b> The deck is Douglas fir, 2 in thick.|$|R
5000|$|Town and Howe truss {{designs were}} {{patented}} by Ithiel Town in 1820 and William Howe in 1840, respectively. [...] The Shushan Bridge employs [...] "the patented Town lattice truss, consisting of {{top and bottom}} chords of laminated wood plank, and a web of diagonal wood planks connected by wood <b>trunnels</b> at each point of intersection".|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1886 by Horace King's son Washington King and Johnathan H. Burke. The bridge spans 138 feet. The lattice trusses consist of planks crisscrossing at 45- to 60-degree angles and are {{fastened}} with wooden pegs, or <b>trunnels,</b> at each intersection. Traffic finally stopped across the bridge in 1980 when a new two-lane bridge was built.|$|R

[...] The Eagleville Bridge employs [...] "the patented Town lattice truss, consisting of {{top and bottom}} chords of laminated wood plank, and a web of diagonal wood planks connected by wood <b>trunnels</b> at each point of intersection".|$|R
50|$|The bridge uses a Ithiel Town's truss design {{including}} authentic wooden <b>trunnels.</b> Lengthwise planks {{cover the}} roadway area with macadam filling the gaps. The entire deck area {{is supported by}} six I-beam stringers. The bridge rests on concrete abutments which extend to form road-level wing walls. Each side has one diamond-shaped opening. A heavy curb-high timber runs along {{each side of the}} bridge, presumably to prevent vehicles from damaging the trusses.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of splitting wood along its grain, rather than sawing {{it is that}} the wood is much stronger. Due to this, it was historically used for building ships (e.g. drekars) and traditional skis. A defining feature of shakes, which are like shingles, are that they are split rather than sawn and because the cell structure of the wood remains intact may be more durable, and similarly <b>trunnels</b> when split are stronger than when sawn.|$|R
50|$|The actual date of {{construction}} is unknown, but it is built on the 1820 lattice design of Ithiel Town. The bridge was built by Joseph Goddard. Originally located about one mile south of Goddard, the bridge was moved to its present location in 1933 when Highway 32 was rebuilt. Steel braces sunk into the creek bank near the abutments provide additional support for the span. The bridge is in regular use and is open to traffic with a gross weight under 4 tons. The bridge was restored in 1968 with the replacement of some lateral bracing, siding, roofing and the wooden pins or <b>trunnels</b> used as fasteners instead of nails.|$|R
50|$|Howard's Covered Bridge is a {{historic}} covered bridge outside of Smithonia, Georgia in Oglethorpe County, Georgia. It {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places on July 1, 1975. The bridge is located 3 miles southeast of Smithonia on SR S2164. The bridge was built in 1905 in a Town lattice design and is 168 feet (51 m) long. The span travels over Big Clouds Creek. The site is marked by {{a historic}}al marker posted by the Georgia Historical Society. The bridge was named for the pioneer family that settled in the area in the late 1700s. It was built with convict labor and is fastened with wooden <b>trunnels.</b> The timber used was transported on the Smith and Dunlap Railroad, connecting James Monroe Smith (Georgia farmer)'s farm with the Georgia Railroad at Dunlap, Georgia.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{different}} kinds of wood {{are used in the}} construction of the Luna. White Oak is a strong, dense wood used for outboard hull planking, pilothouse planking, keels and keelsons, hull structure and frames, and knees to connect right angles. Cypress is a highly rot-resistant wood used for main deckhouse planking, boat deck (also called the [...] "Texas") and pilothouse decking, and bulwark planking (original). It is being replaced by cedar during restoration. Douglas Fir is a straight-grained and strong wood used for main deck planking, and fore and aft masts. Live Yellow Pine is rot-resistant and flexible; it is used for inboard hull [...] "ceiling" [...] planking, deck beams, deckhouse coamings, and deckhouse studs. Locust is a tough wood that expands. It is used for wooden treenails, also called <b>trunnels,</b> to fasten wooden planks to frames in drilled holes.|$|R
40|$|Elder 2 ̆ 7 s Mill Covered Bridge Marker, GA. This marker {{is located}} on Elder 2 ̆ 7 s Mill Rd south of Watkinsville. Georgia. It was erected by The Georgia Historical Society, Georgia Department of Transportation, and the Federal Highway Administration. The text on the marker reads as : 2 ̆ 2 Built in 1897 by Nathaniel Richardson, this 99 -foot-long bridge {{originally}} carried the Watkinsville-Athens Road over Calls Creek. It was moved here to Rose Creek in 1924 and the road was relocated to its present site. The nearby c. 1900 grist mill ceased operations in 1941. Constructed in the Town lattice design, the bridge’s web of planks crisscrossing at 45 - to 60 -degree angles are fastened with wooden pegs, or <b>trunnels,</b> at each intersection. It {{is one of the}} few covered bridges in Georgia continuing to carry traffic without underlying steel beams. 2 ̆ 2 [URL]...|$|R
50|$|From 2006 to 2009 the Onrust Project, a {{non-profit}} organization, directed by Don Rittner and Greta Wagle, built {{a replica of}} the Onrust at the Schenectady County Historical Society's Mabee Farm Historic Site in Rotterdam Junction, NY. Master shipwright and naval architect Gerald DeWeerdt of the Netherlands, and shipwright Howard Mittleman of North River Restorations in Schenectady, N.Y. led the team of volunteers. Construction used both modern power tools and traditional hand tools to build the ship, employing authentic 17th century Dutch ship building techniques rediscovered by ship archeologists in the Netherlands. The material is mostly white oak with pine decking, most of which was sawn nearby by one of the volunteers. The replica is held together by more than 4,000 hand-made black locust tree nails called <b>trunnels</b> and iron rivets. Much of the metal fittings and rivets were hand-made by local blacksmiths of wrought iron; others, as well as cannon, use authentic bronze.|$|R
50|$|Louis Agricola Bauer, {{the first}} {{director}} of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution, wanted to focus on acquiring oceanic magnetic data to improve {{the understanding of the}} Earth's magnetic field. After an experiment in which the brigantine Galilee was adapted by removing as much magnetic material as possible, it became clear that a new entirely non-magnetic ship was needed. After convincing the institution's board, Bauer set about getting such a vessel built. The Carnegie was designed by naval architect Henry J. Gielow and built at the Tebo Yacht Basin Company yard in Brooklyn, New York. Gielow's design minimised the amount of magnetic materials used in its construction and fittings. Locust <b>trunnels</b> were used to hold together the timbers with the help of some bronze or copper bolts. The anchors were made of bronze and were attached to 11 in hemp cables. A reserve engine was required to increase manoeuvrability and allow passage through the doldrums, so Carnegie was fitted with a producer gas engine, made mainly of copper and bronze, using coal as a fuel. She cost $115,000 (about 10 million dollars today) to build.|$|R
50|$|As {{the planks}} reached the desired height, the {{interior}} frame (futtocks) and cross beams were added. Frames were placed close together, {{which is an}} enduring feature of thin planked ships, still used today on some lightweight wooden racing craft such as those designed by Bruce Farr. Viking boat builders used a spacing of about 850 mm. Part {{of the reason for}} this spacing was to achieve the correct distance between rowing stations and to create space for the chests used by Norse sailors as thwarts (seats). The bottom futtocks next to the keel were made from natural L-shaped crooks. The upper futtocks were usually not attached to the lower futtocks to allow some hull twist. The parts were held together with iron rivets, hammered in from the outside of the hull and fastened from the inside with a rove (washers). The surplus rivet was then cut off. A ship normally used about 700 kg of iron nails in a 18 m long ship. In some ships the gap between the lower uneven futtock and the lapstrake planks was filled with a spacer block about 200 mm long. In later ships spruce stringers were fastened lengthwise to the futtocks roughly parallel to the keel. Longships had about five rivets for each yard (90 cm) of plank. In many early ships treenails (trenails, <b>trunnels)</b> were used to fasten large timbers. First, a hole about 20 mm wide hole was drilled through two adjoining timbers, a wooden pegs inserted which was split and a thin wedge inserted to expand the peg. Some treenails have been found with traces of linseed oil suggesting that treenails were soaked before the pegs were inserted. When dried the oil would act as a semi-waterproof weak filler/glue.|$|R
