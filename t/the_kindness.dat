This doctrine could be accomplished if one treated his enemy with peace as he would treat a friend. <b>The</b> <b>kindness</b> of one person should be shared with all people, regardless of personal conflict. By following the moral that lies within “Cultivo Rosa Blanca”, Martí’s vision of Cuban solidarity could be possible, creating a more peaceful society that would emanate through future generations.|$|E
