50|$|This section {{discusses}} {{the interaction of}} transverse electric (TE)and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light with the DBR structure, over severalwavelengths and incidence angles. This reflectivity of the DBR structure (described below)was calculated using the transfer-matrix method (TMM), wherethe <b>TE</b> <b>mode</b> alone is highly reflected by this stack, while the TM modes are passed through. This also shows the DBR acting as a polarizer.|$|E
5000|$|Longitudinal-section {{electric}} (LSE) modes and longitudinal-section magnetic (LSM) modes are {{hybrid modes}} {{that can occur}} in planar formats with non-homogeneous transmission media. When determining whether a structure can support a particular <b>TE</b> <b>mode,</b> one sets the electric field in the [...] direction (the longitudinal direction of the line) to zero and then solves Maxwell's equations for the boundary conditions set by the physical structure of the line. One can just as easily set the electric field in the [...] direction to zero and ask what modes that gives rise to. Such modes are designated LSE{x} modes. Similarly there can be LSE{y} modes and, analogously for the magnetic field, LSM{x} and LSM{y} modes. It {{turns out that the}} LSE modes are a linear superposition of the corresponding TE and TM modes. In other words, in general, they have a longitudinal component of both electric and magnetic field. Likewise the LSM modes are found by setting one of the transverse components of magnetic field to zero with analogous results.|$|E

Even <b>TE</b> 210 <b>mode</b> has electric field significantly more confined near pipe radius compared to <b>TE</b> 110 <b>mode,</b> which has a more homogeneous electric field distribution. This can be exploited tomographically, since <b>TE</b> 210 <b>mode</b> field pattern penetrates less radially inwards than the <b>TE</b> 110 <b>mode.</b> Thus, the <b>TE</b> 210 <b>mode</b> is {{more sensitive to the}} presence of an outer concentric dielectric layer than the <b>TE</b> 110 <b>mode.</b>|$|R

40|$|Different {{applications}} of TE modes in accelerator physics are discussed. In this discussion, the Fourier transform of the squared axial component of magnetic field, B_{z}^{ 2 }(z), {{plays an important}} role. If {{it turns out to}} be zero, the rf field-particle energy transfer is negligible and the focal length of the <b>TE</b> <b>mode</b> lens is phase independent. Such rf lens focuses continuous beams just as a solenoid. In order to compensate spherical aberrations and emittance growth caused by field nonlinearities of a focusing solenoid, the rf focusing is used also even if the beam space charge is taken into account. If the transform has its maximum, excitations of <b>TE</b> <b>mode</b> resonances and electron beam self-focusing are possible. Furthermore, the rf field of the <b>TE</b> <b>mode</b> can be used to expand the radial acceptance of a FEL for the THz region...|$|E

CONCLUSIONS To study {{effectively}} study magnetized PPCs, first, a modified FDTD {{has been proposed}} {{to deal with the}} megnetoplasma. The approach introduce the current J instead of the displacement D, then based on the LT principle, solve analytically the constitu-tive relation equation to keep more accurate for large values of xp, v, and/or xb. Second, numerical simulation results by our FDTD algorithm demonstrated that the modified FDTD algo-rithm is correct and efficient. Finally, our FDTD algorithm is applied to investigate bandgap characteristics of 2 D magneto PPC while adjusting plasma parameters and structure parame-ters. The following conclusions have been obtained, i. e., increas-ing the plasma frequency can more broaden the bandwidth for TM mode than that of <b>TE</b> <b>mode,</b> whereas the plasma collision frequency plays no role in broadening the bandwidth for both TM and <b>TE</b> <b>mode,</b> and also the electron gyrofrequency cannot broaden the bandwidth for <b>TE</b> <b>mode...</b>|$|E

The very interesting result of this study is that the correction from the <b>TE</b> <b>mode</b> is dominated by low frequencies, for which the dielectric description of the metal is invalid. However, their analysis of the problem, based on more appropriate low-frequency metallic boundary conditions, uses an incorrect form of boundary conditions for TE modes. We repeat their analysis, using the correct boundary conditions. Our computations confirm their most important result: contrary to the result of the dielectric model, the thermal <b>TE</b> <b>mode</b> correction leads to an increase in the <b>TE</b> <b>mode</b> force of attraction between the plates. The magnitude of the correction has a value about twenty times larger than that quoted by them. Comment: 3 pages, 2 figures. In press on Phys. Rev. ...|$|E

30|$|As well known, the {{two modes}} of {{electromagnetic}} inductions {{are available for}} 2 -D cases: the transverse magnetic (TM) mode and the transverse electric (<b>TE)</b> <b>mode</b> (e.g., page 37 in Chave and Jones 2012). In the TM mode, the magnetic field points in the strike of 2 -D structure and the electric field lies in the plane orthogonal to strike. The <b>TE</b> <b>mode</b> has the complementary set, with electric field in the strike direction and the magnetic field orthogonal to the strike. In this study, I focus the TM mode induction for evaluation of the coastal effect on GIE. As typically shown in Vozoff (1972), the apparent resistivity at a frequency rapidly changes at a vertical contact of conductivity heterogeneity, similar to coastline. Since the amplitude of magnetic field is common at the earth’s surface in the TM mode theoretically, the rapid change means less-continuous electrical field across the vertical contact. On the contrary, in the <b>TE</b> <b>mode,</b> the apparent resistivity gradually changes across the vertical contact. It means that the TE-mode electrical field can be approximately inferred by interpolation of calculated results on the 1 -D models. Therefore, the GIE estimation in the TM mode is more meaningful for the 2 -D studies.|$|E
