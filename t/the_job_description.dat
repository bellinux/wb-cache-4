25|$|Feminist history {{combines}} {{the search for}} past female scholars with a modern feminist perspective on how history is affected by them. While many mistake it as women’s history, feminist history does not solely focus on the retelling of history from a woman’s perspective. Rather, it is interpreting history with a feminist frame of mind. It is also {{not to be confused}} with the history of feminism, which recounts the history of the feminist movements. Feminist historians, instead, include “cultural and social investigations” in <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>description.</b> Feminist history came into being as women began writing accounts of their own and other women’s lives. A few of these, such as Susan B. Anthony and Audre Lorde, documented histories of their feminist movements. Afterword, a fever drove women onward to be historically minded and create women’s archives.|$|E

(The street is listed as being off George Street, which was in turn off Great Ancoats Street. It is now called George Leigh Street.) His entry in the {{directory}} is an early {{use of the term}} [...] "engineer" [...] found in Mancunian documents, <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>description</b> at that time being a relatively new one.

500|$|At the {{invitation}} of his cousin John Amory Lowell, James Russell Lowell was asked to deliver a lecture at the prestigious Lowell Institute. Some speculated the opportunity {{was because of the}} family connection, offered as an attempt to bring him out of his depression. Lowell chose to speak on [...] "The English Poets", telling his friend Briggs that he would take revenge on dead poets [...] "for the injuries received by one whom the public won't allow among the living". The first of the twelve-part lecture series was to be on January 9, 1855, though by December, Lowell had only completed writing five of them, hoping for last-minute inspiration. His first lecture was on John Milton and the auditorium was oversold; Lowell had to give a repeat performance the next afternoon. Lowell, who had never spoken in public before, was praised for these lectures. Francis James Child said that Lowell, whom he deemed was typically [...] "perverse", was able to [...] "persist in being serious contrary to his impulses and his talents". While his series was still in progress, Lowell was offered the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages at Harvard, a post vacated by Longfellow, at an annual salary of $1,200, though he never applied for it. <b>The</b> <b>job</b> <b>description</b> was changing after Longfellow; instead of teaching languages directly, Lowell would supervise the department and deliver two lecture courses per year on topics of his own choosing. Lowell accepted the appointment, with the proviso that he should have a year of study abroad. He set sail on June 4 of that year, leaving his daughter Mabel in the care of a governess named Frances Dunlap. Abroad, he visited Le Havre, Paris, and London, spending time with friends including Story, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Leigh Hunt. Primarily, however, Lowell spent his time abroad studying languages, particularly German, which he found difficult. He complained: [...] "The confounding genders! If I die I shall have engraved on my tombstone that I died of der, die, das, not because I caught them but because I couldn't." ...|$|E

40|$|The Problem: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyze the evaluation criteria of the instruments used to evaluate superintendents, <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> for those superintendents, and the goals written as part of their Individual Administrator Professional Development Plans (IAPDPs) to determine whether superintendents are being held accountable for serving as instructional leaders. Procedure: <b>The</b> <b>job</b> <b>descriptions,</b> evaluation instruments, and goals contained in IAPDPs provided by superintendents were coded using content analysis to identify those that describe instructional leadership as part of Standard 2 of the Iowa Standards for School Leaders (ISSL). The criteria were disaggregated and further sorted by district size. An analysis was conducted from the sampling units representing 20 of the 86 eligible superintendents in certain school districts with large high school enrollments, indicated by their membership in Class 3 A or 4 A for football during the 2009 – 2010 school year. Of the 20 randomly selected superintendents, 18 provided the three documents to be analyzed. A total of 52 sampling units were analyzed as part of this study. Findings: There was little congruence between <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> and <b>the</b> criteria associated with instructional leadership in Standard 2. Only 17 % of the 518 recording units were coded as Standard 2 in the ISSL. Additionally, there was little congruence between the goal...|$|R

A qualitative case {{study was conducted in}} order to understand how journalistic <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> and competencies change with digitalization and how these changes are experienced in terms of the quality of working life. The results suggest that changes in <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> can occur in different ways: by transferring tasks from one <b>job</b> <b>description</b> to another, by fusing two or more <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> or by adding new tasks to <b>the</b> traditional <b>job</b> <b>descriptions.</b> Changes in competencies were brought about by the digitalization of production technology, changes in <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> and <b>the</b> emergence of new media and new working practices. <b>The</b> <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> of journalists became more post-bureaucratic, whereas those of editors remained bureaucratic.

Citing Givhan, Souter said that under the majority’s view, the English schoolteacher is protected when complaining to the principal about discriminatory hiring policy, as such policy {{is not part of}} <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>description</b> of the teacher; however, if a school personnel office made that same complaint, he or she would not be entitled to that same protection.

2500|$|Other {{research}} suggests that some employees perform OCBs to influence how they are viewed within the organization. While these behaviors are not formally part of <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>description,</b> performing them can influence performance appraisals. Researchers have advanced the view that employees engage in OCBs {{as a form of}} [...] "impression management," [...] a term coined by Erving Goffman. Goffman defined impression management as [...] "the way in which the individual ... presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and the kinds of things he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them. Some researchers have hypothesized that OCBs are not performed out of good will, positive affect, etc., but instead as a way of being noticed by others, including supervisors.|$|E

40|$|Given {{the advent}} of new forms of {{schooling}} in American education, specifically, integrated social-service schools (ISS), a radical rethinking of traditional leadership models is needed. This paper suggests a new role for K- 12 public school leaders [...] that of the school president. Data were derived from a review of <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> of <b>the</b> presidency in 40 Jesuit college-preparatory high schools nationwide. Findings indicate that a congruence exists between <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>descriptions</b> and <b>the</b> emerging needs of public ISS schools.
