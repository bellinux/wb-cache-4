5|$|An Australian naval vessel, HMAS Swan, {{under the}} command of Commander Arthur Bond (RN), {{conducted}} a reconnaissance and intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea and territory of the Don Cossacks in December 1918, in conjunction with the French destroyer Bisson. The mission, conducted on behalf of the British military mission then advising the White Russian forces under General Denikin, was detailed to report to the true state of the Cossack forces and was carefully circumscribed by the British Foreign Office. Indeed, although the Cossacks fêted Commander Bond as a comrade-in-arms he had <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that they were purely on an information gathering mission with the Australian vessel in no way intended to render military or naval aid to the Cossacks. After inspecting anti-Bolshevik forces in the area, as well as numerous military facilities and factories, Swan subsequently carried out anti-Bolshevik guard duties in Sevastopol, with the ship's guns helped protect the railway station {{at the head of the}} Inkerman valley. These duties were completed without incident and Swan subsequently sailed for Plymouth on 3 January 1919.|$|E
500|$|The {{first edition}} {{sold out in}} six weeks. It was only some months {{afterward}} that the voice of Francis Jeffrey, the highly respected editor of The Edinburgh Review, was heard. Jeffrey began by expressing reservations: {{this is not a}} book of great learning and less a book of criticism than of appreciation. And yet, Jeffrey concedes, the [...] "appreciation" [...] is of the highest kind, and he is [...] "not [...] much inclined to disagree with" [...] Hazlitt [...] "after reading his eloquent exposition" [...] of the points he makes about Shakespeare. [...] "The book [...] is written less to tell the reader what Mr. H. knows about Shakespeare or his writings, than <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> what he feels about them—and why he feels so—and thinks that all who profess to love poetry should feel so likewise." [...] While Characters does not [...] "show extraordinary knowledge of [...] production" [...] it nevertheless shows [...] "very considerable originality and genius." ...|$|E

So, anecdotal evidence involves all your subjectivity—if we do it like this we don't have that anymore. Why, surely do you understand how powerful that is?" [...] And if they don't, then that's what you have <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> It's an extremely powerful thing and a very basic thing.|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, {{voters were}} asked about two amendments. One was the Victims' Rights Amendment, which {{required}} prosecutors {{to stay in touch}} with crime victims and their families, <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> how purported offenses involving them were to be prosecuted, and to notify them when persons who had committed crimes against them were being scheduled for parole or release, among other provisions. The other amendment removed the word [...] "comfortable" [...] from the requirements for minimum standards for prisons. Both of these amendments passed by overwhelming margins in an election marked by a very light turnout. The amendments represented the first changes to the constitution in 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|In the Anguttara Nikaya, Maudgalyāyana {{is called}} {{foremost}} in psychic powers. In teaching, Maudgalyāyana relies much on such powers. Varying accounts in the Pali Canon show Maudgalyāyana travelling to and speaking with pretas (spirits in unhappy destinations) in order <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> their horrific conditions. He helped them understand their own suffering, {{so they could}} be released from it or come to terms with it. He then reported about this to the Buddha, who used these examples in his teachings. Similarly, Maudgalyāyana is also depicted as conversing with devas and brahmas (heavenly beings), and asking devas what deeds they did to be reborn in heaven. In summary, Maudgalyāyana's meditative insights and psychic powers were not only to his own benefit, but benefited the public at large. In the words of historian Julie Gifford, he guided others [...] "by providing a cosmological and karmic map of samsara".|$|E
2500|$|The {{slaughter}} of the headquarters guard corps shocked and angered the other Tianxiong troops, despite Luo's attempt <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> the reasons. [...] A {{group of soldiers}} supported the officer Shi Renyu (史仁遇), who took over Gaotang (高唐, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong) and claimed the title of acting military governor. [...] He sought aid from Hedong and Yichang. [...] However, he was quickly defeated and killed by Zhu's officers Li Zhouyi (李周彝) and Fu Daozhao (符道昭), before those circuits could aid him. [...] Still, even with Zhu's aid, it took Luo half a year to quell all of the mutinies. [...] During that period, with the Xuanwu army present and Luo forced to supply it well, the Tianxiong supplies were exhausted. [...] It was aid that {{the destruction of the}} headquarters guard corps ended much of the threat against Luo's rule, but the fighting abilities of the Tianxiong army was thereafter permanently damaged. [...] Luo, in regret, stated, [...] "Even with all the iron from the six prefectures and 43 counties of this circuit, I could not have forged a greater error." ...|$|E

2500|$|During their negotiations, {{both sides}} {{agreed that the}} opening act from the inaugural show until their {{scheduled}} performance on April 4 in Philadelphia would be Manson's option, stoner rock band Monster Magnet. A dispute arose on who would take over. According to Erlandson and Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur, the two groups had a two-hour meeting {{to arrive at a}} resolution. Manson and his band voted for early 1980s Brit-pop groups like Fun Boy Three and Fine Young Cannibals, while members of Hole wanted [...] "more modern" [...] bands. Auf der Maur noted that [...] "we want romance and they want theater. We want love and they want shtick. We had <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that those kinds of bands make them look good, but us look silly". Eventually, Manson's band ceded the selection of the subsequent opening act to Love, who chose Imperial Teen. During their negotiations, both bands agreed to split the cost of producing each show, which resulted in Hole unwittingly financing most of Manson's disproportionately higher production costs at their own expense. The revenue earned at each show would be split 50/50 between the two bands.|$|E

30|$|Judge B: Of course not. We {{ask them}} from which angle {{they would do}} their cases.

30|$|The professor’s role {{is indeed}} changing. We don’t believe lectures will disappear. But we do hope profs don’t “lecture from the book.” There {{is too much}} {{information}} on the Internet, much of it erroneous. A good role for faculty is to sort through the online drivel and select what’s most important for students to see and <b>to</b> have <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> This function alone justifies tuition. However, professors should be mentors and role models as well.|$|R
