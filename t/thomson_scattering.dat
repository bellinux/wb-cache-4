25|$|The {{anisotropy}} of {{the cosmic}} microwave background on different angular scales {{can also be used to}} study reionization. Photons undergo scattering when there are free electrons present, in a process known as <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering.</b> However, as the universe expands, the density of free electrons will decrease, and scattering will occur less frequently. In the period during and after reionization, but before significant expansion had occurred to sufficiently lower the electron density, the light that composes the CMB will experience observable <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering.</b> This scattering will leave its mark on the CMB anisotropy map, introducing secondary anisotropies (anisotropies introduced after recombination). The overall effect is to erase anisotropies that occur on smaller scales. While anisotropies on small scales are erased, polarization anisotropies are actually introduced because of reionization. By looking at the CMB anisotropies observed, and comparing with what they would look like had reionization not taken place, the electron column density at the time of reionization can be determined. With this, the age of the universe when reionization occurred can then be calculated.|$|E

25|$|A sister {{process to}} the {{synchrotron}} radiation is the inverse-Compton process, {{in which the}} relativistic electrons interact with ambient photons and <b>Thomson</b> <b>scatter</b> them to high energies.

This has been used to argue that many powerful sources are actually quite near the minimum-energy condition.|$|R
25|$|Refractive {{processes}} {{take place}} in the physical optics limit, where the wavelength of light is similar to other distances, as a kind of scattering. The simplest type of scattering is <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> which occurs when electromagnetic waves are deflected by single particles. In the limit of <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering,</b> in which the wavelike nature of light is evident, light is dispersed independent of the frequency, in contrast to Compton scattering which is frequency-dependent and strictly a quantum mechanical process, involving the nature of light as particles. In a statistical sense, elastic scattering of light by numerous particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light is a process known as Rayleigh scattering while the similar process for scattering by particles that are similar or larger in wavelength is known as Mie scattering with the Tyndall effect being a commonly observed result. A small proportion of light scattering from atoms or molecules may undergo Raman scattering, wherein the frequency changes due to excitation of the atoms and molecules. Brillouin scattering occurs when the frequency of light changes due to local changes with time and movements of a dense material.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} Big Bang, the {{universe}} was a hot, dense plasma of photons, electrons, and quarks: the Quark epoch. At 0.000001 seconds, the Universe had expanded and cooled sufficiently {{to allow for the}} formation of protons: the Hadron epoch. This plasma was effectively opaque to electromagnetic radiation due to <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> by free electrons, as the mean free path each photon could travel before encountering an electron was very short. This is {{the current state of the}} interior of the Sun. As the universe expanded, it also cooled. Eventually, the universe cooled to the point that the formation of neutral hydrogen was energetically favored, and the fraction of free electrons and protons as compared to neutral hydrogen decreased to a few parts in 10,000.|$|E
25|$|The cosmic {{microwave}} background is polarized {{at the level of}} a few microkelvin. There are two types of polarization, called E-modes and B-modes. This is in analogy to electrostatics, in which the electric field (E-field) has a vanishing curl and the magnetic field (B-field) has a vanishing divergence. The E-modes arise naturally from <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> in a heterogeneous plasma. The B-modes are not produced by standard scalar type perturbations. Instead they can be created by two mechanisms: the first one is by gravitational lensing of E-modes, which has been measured by the South Pole Telescope in 2013; the second one is from gravitational waves arising from cosmic inflation. Detecting the B-modes is extremely difficult, particularly as the degree of foreground contamination is unknown, and the weak gravitational lensing signal mixes the relatively strong E-mode signal with the B-mode signal.|$|E
