5|$|Although most methamphetamine users {{lived in}} Asia {{in the early}} 2000s, the use of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> {{increased}} dramatically {{in other parts of}} the world in that decade. In areas where use of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> has become common, meth mouth is often widespread. The condition is expensive to treat and has strained public health resources, prompting concerns among dental authorities in several countries about the burden of treatment.|$|E

5|$|Bolander (Ned Beatty) and Munch (Richard Belzer) {{investigate}} a double shooting {{in which a}} drug dealer was killed and another man was badly injured. During the investigation they find a high-class prostitute hiding in a nearby doghouse. After making unsuccessful advances on Bolander, she admits <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> dealer was killed by his own bodyguard, Newton Stuart (Richard Pelzman). After arresting him, Stuart says the other shooting victim used <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> dealer as a human shield. In a misguided attempt to follow his employer's orders to kill anyone who threatens him, Stuart said he shot through <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> dealer to ensure the man threatening him would also be shot.|$|E

5|$|Hydrochloric acid {{is used in}} methamphetamine's {{manufacturing}} process, but academic reviews {{have not}} supported {{the idea that the}} acid contributes to dental decay. Speculation that oral consumption of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> causes tooth decay by raising the acidity of users' mouths is also unsupported. Meth mouth is generally most severe in users who inject <b>the</b> <b>drug,</b> rather than those who smoke, ingest or inhale it.|$|E
5|$|Methamphetamine users {{sometimes}} experience soreness in {{the joint}} of the jaw and dental attrition (tooth wear), owing to bruxism (grinding of the teeth) caused by <b>the</b> <b>drug.</b> This bruxism can occur continuously. Chronic use of <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> might also cause trismus, the inability to open the jaw. Long-term users often experience xerostomia (dry mouth).|$|E

5|$|Not all {{withdrawal}} {{effects are}} evidence of true dependence or withdrawal. Recurrence of {{symptoms such as}} anxiety may simply indicate that <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> was having its expected anti-anxiety effect and that, {{in the absence of}} <b>the</b> <b>drug,</b> the symptom has returned to pretreatment levels. If the symptoms are more severe or frequent, the person may be experiencing a rebound effect due to the removal of <b>the</b> <b>drug.</b> Either of these can occur without the person actually being drug-dependent.|$|E

5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> reported using more per session than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of people on a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E
