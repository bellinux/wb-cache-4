50|$|What {{then makes}} some {{generalization}} lawlike and other accidental? This, for Goodman, becomes {{a problem of}} determining which predicates are projectable (i.e., {{can be used in}} lawlike generalizations that serve as predictions) and which are not. Goodman argues that this is where the fundamental problem lies. This problem, known as Goodman's paradox, is as follows. Consider the evidence that all emeralds examined thus far have been green. This leads us to conclude (by induction) that all future emeralds will be green. However, whether this prediction is lawlike or not depends on the predicates used in this prediction. Goodman observed that (assuming <b>t</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> to pass) it is equally true that every emerald that has been observed is grue. Thus, by the same evidence we can conclude that all future emeralds will be grue. The new problem of induction becomes one of distinguishing projectable predicates such as green and blue from non-projectable predicates such as grue and bleen.|$|E

Further, by using high field intensity magnetic resonance microimaging, we reveal white matter lesions in these animals comparable to those observed in RNASET 2 -deficient infants. This correlates with accumulation of Amyloid precursor protein and astrocytes at sites of neurodegeneration.

Both phages have five early mRNA's, numbered 0. 3, 0. 7, 1, 1. 1 and 1. 3 from left to right, although no T 3 protein that corresponds to the 1. 1 protein of <b>T</b> 7 <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> been identified.

Thus, both in vivo and in vitro, it appears that IgE may be crucial for induction of allergen-specific T-cell responses. Indeed, the cloning of infiltrating T cells from a positive 12 -h EPT produced allergen-specific T cells, whereas no in vivo activated bystander <b>T</b> cells <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> been cloned.

We show that autologous CD 40 -activated B cells represent a readily available source of highly efficient APC that appear to have several important advantages over other APCs for ex vivo T cell expansion including: (a) methodological simplicity necessary to generate continuously large numbers of APCs from just 50 cm 3 of peripheral blood without loss of APC function; (b) capacity to induce high peak T cell proliferation and interferon-gamma production without IL- 10 production; (c) ease in cryopreservation; and (d) markedly reduced cost.

The shear elastic modulus G increased monotonously upon increasing temperature. In contrast, but in qualitative agreement with previous experiments on macroscopic pNIPAM hydrogels, we found that the compressive elastic modulus K of our microgels exhibits a dip close to the LCST. Remarkably, this dip is less sharp and deep than that observed in macroscopic hydrogels. The Poisson ratio of the particles also exhibits a pronounced dip close to the LCST, reaching unusually low minimum values of s ˜ 0. 15. To rationalize this behavior, we compared our experimental data to Flory–Rehner theory; the theory is able to qualitatively predict the general mechanical behavior observed, thus indicating that the observed dip in the Poisson ratio can be accounted for by simple thermodynamic arguments...|$|R

In this study, we used cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) to identify the RNA binding sites of hnRNP L within the transcriptomes of human CD 4 and cultured Jurkat T cells. We find that hnRNP L binds preferentially to transcripts encoding proteins involved in RNA processing and inWnt and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. This binding is largely conserved across both quiescent and activated T cells, {{in agreement with the}} critical role of hnRNP L throughout T cell biology. Importantly, based on the binding profile of hnRNP L, we validate numerous instances of hnRNP L-dependent alternative splicing of genes critical to T cell function.

Together, these data provide the first transcriptome-wide analysis of the RNA targets of hnRNP L in lymphoid cells and add to the functional understanding of hnRNP L in human biology.

Quantitative differences in cytokine gene expression between CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells were confirmed and higher levels of cytokine mRNAs were induced in CD 4 + than in CD 8 + T cells. Early induction of IL- 2 mRNA was observed in both T cell subsets.
