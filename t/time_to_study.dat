5|$|After a fortnight, Kumar met Balachander in Chennai {{and watched}} Uyarndha Manithan {{again for a}} second <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> his character. This time, however, Kumar hesitated to portray Ganesan's role and {{requested}} Balachander to direct the remake of Babu (1971). Balachander showed concern with Kumar's change of heart and refused the offer, leading to both the remakes of Uyarndha Manithan and Babu being shelved.|$|E
5|$|Besides meditation, Luang Pu Sodh {{promoted}} {{the study of}} Buddhism as well. In this combination {{he was one of}} the pioneers in Thai Buddhism. In 1939, Luang Pu Sodh set up a Pali Institute at Wat Paknam, which is said to have cost 2.5 million baht. Luang Pu Sodh financed the building through the production of amulets, which is common in Thai Buddhism. The kitchen which he built was the fulfillment of an intention which he had since his first years at Wat Pho, when he experienced difficulty in finding food. It also resulted in monks having more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the Dhamma.|$|E
5|$|In Zürich, Vermigli succeeded Konrad Pellikan as {{the chair}} of Hebrew, a {{position}} he would hold until his death. He married his second wife, Catarina Merenda of Brescia, Italy, in 1559. Vermigli was able to share his teaching duties with fellow Hebraist Theodor Bibliander, allowing him <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> and prepare the notes from his previous lectures for publication. He began lecturing on the books of Samuel and Kings. While in Zürich, Vermigli declined invitations to desirable positions in Geneva, Heidelberg, and England.|$|E
25|$|In September 1813 the American calculating prodigy Zerah Colburn {{was being}} {{exhibited}} in Dublin. Colburn was 9, {{a year older}} than Hamilton. The two were pitted against each other in a mental arithmetic contest with Colburn emerging the clear victor. In reaction to his defeat, Hamilton dedicated less <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> languages and more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> mathematics.|$|R

5|$|To {{supplement}} {{his income}} and {{help pay for}} his legal training, Druitt worked as an assistant schoolmaster at George Valentine's boarding school, 9 Eliot Place, Blackheath, London, from 1880. The school had a long and distinguished history; Benjamin Disraeli had been a pupil there in the 1810s, and boys from the school had been playmates of a younger son of Queen Victoria, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, who as a boy in the 1860s had lived nearby at Greenwich Park. Druitt's post came with accommodation in Eliot Place, and the long school holidays gave him <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the law and to pursue his interest in cricket.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, {{commodity}} prices for copper and nickel, which make up the five-cent coin, rose dramatically, pushing the cost of manufacturing a nickel from 3.46 cents in fiscal year 2003 to 10.09 cents in fiscal year 2012. By comparison, a Canadian nickel (which is primarily made of steel) still costs less than its face value to produce as of 2013. In response, Mint Director Henrietta Fore in 2004 asked Congress to fund research into lower-cost alternatives to present coinage metals. Although the initiative lapsed when she left office in 2005, in 2010, Congress passed the Coin Modernization, Oversight, and Continuity Act (CMOCA), directing the Mint to explore alternatives to the present compositions of the six denominations, from cent to dollar. In 2011, the Mint awarded a contract to study the issue to Concurrent Technologies Corporation of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The report in response to the legislation declared that there is no material that would reduce the one-cent coin's manufacturing cost to below one cent, so it was removed from consideration. The report requested additional <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the issue, ensuring the continuation, for the present, of the existing coinage metals. The Mint expected demand for nickels in commerce to increase from 840 million needed in Fiscal Year 2011 to 1.08 billion in 2015.|$|E

25|$|A {{party to}} a {{proceeding}} {{should have the}} right to access documentation which had been produced by the other party to the proceedings. It would be wrong if such documents were not shown to the other party at all. If a party to the proceedings needs <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> or make copies of the documents, he or she should be allowed to do so. However, as the High Court opined in Teng Cheng Sin v. Law Fay Yuen (2003), if a party does not request for copies of documents or for <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the documents, a complaint of this nature will carry much less weight.|$|E
25|$|After six years, Meagher left Ireland for {{the first}} <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> in Lancashire, England, at Stonyhurst College, also a Jesuit institution. Meagher's father {{regarded}} Trinity College, the only university in Ireland, as being both anti-Irish and anti-Catholic.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{graduating from}} school, he {{studied at the}} Escuela de Artes Decorativos and the Escuela Industrial with an {{architectural}} career in mind. He became so interested in sculpture, however, that he soon devoted his entire <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>studies</b> in that field.|$|R
50|$|After leaving Boston, {{his father}} {{exhibited}} Zerah for money {{throughout the middle}} {{and part of the}} southern states and, in January 1812, sailed with him for England. In September 1813 Colburn was being exhibited in Dublin. Colburn was pitted against the 8-year-old William Rowan Hamilton in a mental arithmetic contest, with Colburn emerging the clear victor. In reaction to his defeat, Hamilton dedicated less <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> languages and more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> mathematics. After traveling over England, Scotland, and Ireland, they spent 18 months in Paris. Here Zerah was placed in the Lycée Napoléon, but was soon removed by his father, who, at length, in 1816, returned to England in the deepest penury.|$|R

25|$|The Massachusetts General Court {{called for}} a synod to meet in Cambridge to craft such a statement.

While the Platform was legally nonbinding and intended only to be descriptive, it soon became regarded by ministers and lay people alike as the religious constitution of Massachusetts, guaranteeing the rights of church officers and members.|$|E

25|$|Columbia University Professor John McWhorter {{has pointed}} out that Shakespeare’s {{language}} is no longer entirely ours. Granted, he says, with the help of notes and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> them, you can work out the sense of some of the obscure dialogue, but not in a theatre {{in a matter of seconds}} while the action speeds by and the actors deliver the lines with all the urgency of the moment then move on. Its time, goes the argument of many scholars, for versions that will do for a contemporary English-speaking public what has been done for much of the world where Shakespeare is performed in the native language of the audience—make every word intelligible.|$|E
25|$|Minkowski {{had been}} {{concerned}} {{with the state of}} electrodynamics after Michelson's disruptive experiments at least since the summer of 1905, when Minkowski and David Hilbert led an advanced seminar attended by notable physicists of the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the papers of Lorentz, Poincaré et al. However, {{it is not at all}} clear when Minkowski began to formulate the geometric formulation of special relativity that was to bear his name, or to which extent he was influenced by Poincaré's four-dimensional interpretation of the Lorentz transformation. Nor is it clear if he ever fully appreciated Einstein's critical contribution to the understanding of the Lorentz transformations, thinking of Einstein's work as being an extension of Lorentz's work.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets {{had been}} working on early warning radar for their anti-ballistic missile systems through the 1960s, but most of these had been {{line-of-sight}} systems that were useful for raid analysis and interception only. None of these systems had the capability to provide early warning of a launch, within seconds or minutes of a launch, which would give the defences <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the attack and plan a response. At the time, the Soviet early-warning satellite network was not well developed, and there were questions about their ability to operate in a hostile environment including anti-satellite efforts. An over-the-horizon radar sited in the USSR would not have any of these problems, and work on such a system for this associated role started in the late 1960s.|$|E
50|$|None of {{the methods}} of {{identifying}} b-jets are foolproof, and modern particle physics experiments must devote significant <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>studying</b> how often they successfully identify b-jets and how often they misidentify other jets.
