Differential scanning calorimetric thermograms proved the occurrence of conformational changes in the soy protein during processing. Furthermore, the developed soy protein-based thermoplastics showed a thermal stability up to 100 Â°C, as confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis. The reinforcement of the soy protein matrix with a ceramic filler (tricalcium phosphate) was shown to be effective for amounts above 10 % w/w. The introduction of an amino-coupling agent led to a plasticizing effect, detected in the mechanical and dynamic-mechanical properties of the resulting materials.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The micromorphology and properties of injection moulded semi-crystalline polymers can be significantly modified by changes in the injection moulding parameters and the design of mould. Further modifications to the microstructure and properties occur following the incorporation of additives into a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>compound,</b> such as stabilisers, pigments, nucleants, etc. Many published papers refer to these changes in microstructure, but very {{little attention has been}} devoted to the detailed characterisation of the outer surfaces of injection mouldings, which play an important part in determining impact properties. The main objective of this research project was to carry out a systematic examination of the micromorphology of a range of isotactic polypropylene injection mouldings, paying particular attention to the outer layers which are difficult to characterise and to then relate the micromorphology revealed to the impact properties. Models which relate the mechanism of impact failure to microstructure and processing route have been developed as a result. Particular attention was given to the careful production of injection mouldings to ensure reproducible micromorphologies and mechanical properties for set processing conditions. This was carried out prior to very comprehensive characterisation of micromorphology using a range of analytical techniques including, straightforward microtomy and optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and the application of a new etching and replication method for transmission electron microscopy studies. The impact properties of mouldings were determined by instrumented falling-weight and instrumented Izod impact test methods. Injection mouldings revealed a complex skin-core morphology, the width, degree of orientation, crystal form (α or β) and spherulite size of the various layers were found to be strongly dependent on the moulding parameters and additives incorporated.

In many trials good results have been achieved and the procedures developed are characterized not only by the efficiency of the reactions, but also by chemoselective processes, by a good stereochemical control, by reacting available and inexpensive reagents and in some cases, from the possibility of recovering the catalytic promoter system used through simple procedures of work-up.

The system CeCl 3 · 7 H 2 O-NaI is inexpensive, non-toxic, very stable when exposed to water and air, it is able to work under solvent-free conditions and it can be recycled. This means that it is an excellent catalyst in various reactions, contributing in this way to the development of green chemistry, in response to the problem of environmental pollution caused by the difficulty eliminating of the organic solvents.

40|$|Natural fiber {{reinforced}} composites {{have established}} themselves {{due to their}} good mechanical properties, their low production costs, and the good environmental properties. Due to their low density (approx. 1. 5 g/cm), natural fibers {{have a very good}} lightweight potential [1]. Other features of natural fiber composites are the very good process related and acoustic properties. Additional advantages like good life cycle assessment and easier processability compared to glass fiber material can also be taken into account. Nevertheless, their potential use is greatly reduced because of their high hydrophility and their low chemical compatibility with hydrophobic polymers. This leads to higher water absorption of natural fiber reinforced composites having a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the composites [2, 3]. Tensile properties of natural fiber composites with a high fiber fraction can decrease up to 65 % after immersion in water for 24 hours. In order to improve the adhesion between the fiber and the matrix for both <b>thermoplastic</b> and thermoset <b>compounds</b> and to reduce the water absorption coupling agents like silane can be added [4, 5].
