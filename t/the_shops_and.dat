5|$|Within 20 {{years of}} its construction, {{alterations}} were made that expanded <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> <b>and</b> changed the façades. By {{the end of the}} 18th century it had been damaged by floods, but it was rebuilt to a similar design. Over the next century alterations to the shops included cantilevered extensions on the bridge's north face. In the 20th century several schemes were carried out to preserve the bridge and partially return it to its original appearance, enhancing its appeal as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the above}} sites, several {{domestic}} sites existed within Cheadle Hulme. These provided sleeping, eating and washing facilities for the Airmen and women stationed at RAF Handforth. Grove Lane park {{was the site of}} an Officers' mess, Cinema, NAAFI, Post Office, chapel and bath house among other buildings. The Grove, near the junction of Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, was Nissen hut accommodation, as were the flats on Gillbent Road opposite <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> <b>and</b> the large field at the junction of Longsight Lane and Stanley Road. The remains of the air raid shelters can still be seen at this location to this day. The wooded area to the rear of numbers 48–64 Hall Moss Lane also housed an officers' mess, NAAFI, post office, chapel and bath house.|$|E
5|$|George Mason {{began to}} build his home, Gunston Hall, likely {{beginning}} in 1755. The exterior, typical of local buildings of that time, was probably based on architectural books sent from Britain to America {{for the use of}} local builders; one of these craftsmen, perhaps William Waite or James Wren, constructed Gunston Hall. Mason was proud of the gardens which still surround the house. There were outbuildings, including slave quarters, a schoolhouse, and kitchens, and beyond them four large plantations, forests, and <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> <b>and</b> other facilities that made Gunston Hall mostly self-sufficient.|$|E

The city council bought several of <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> <b>and</b> made plans {{for the restoration of}} the original façade, which was completed in time for the Festival of Britain in 1951. Further work was carried out in the 1960s to repair the underside soffits of all three arches. More restoration of the southern street facade was needed in 1975. The status of the bridge as an ancient monument was replaced in 1955 with its designation as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|The Warden of the Fleet Prison, who {{was also}} keeper of Westminster Hall, was tasked with keeping it clean and letting <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> <b>and</b> booths along the sides. Despite acting as gaoler to the Exchequer of Pleas, Court of Chancery and Star Chamber {{as part of his}} duties the Warden was {{considered}} an officer of the Court of Common Pleas. All court officers were appointed for life, and could only be removed for misbehaviour. Despite this, the sheer number of positions meant that several came up for reappointment in each Chief Justice's tenure, and selling them could be very profitable.|$|E

Prominent settings on the show include the local elementary school, bus stop, various neighborhoods and the surrounding snowy landscape, actual Colorado landmarks, and <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> <b>and</b> businesses along the town's main street, all of which are based on the appearance of similar locations in Fairplay.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, clothes were mostly sold by {{individual}} shopkeepers who were often the artisans {{who made the}} goods. Customers usually {{lived in the same}} neighborhood as <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> <b>and</b> the shops would gain popularity by their customers’ word-of–mouth recommendation, with the exception of warehouses (i.e., any retail on wholesale), where goods being sold were not necessarily made in the shop. However, things started to change during the transition to the 19th century. People sought efficiency and variety; {{under the influence of the}} Industrial Revolution, improved transportation and introduction of machines in manufacturing allowed fashion to develop at an even faster pace.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{contemporary}} {{study by the}} Enlightenment-era chemist Lavoisier, Parisians spent about twice as much on meat as they did on bread, which accounted for only about thirteen percent of their food budget. Butcher shops all around the city provided the meat; the animals were slaughtered in the courtyards behind <b>the</b> <b>shops,</b> <b>and</b> the blood often flowed out into the streets. The better cuts of meat went to aristocracy and the merchant class; poorer Parisians ate mutton and pork, sausages, andouilles, brains, tripe, salted pork, other inexpensive cuts. The uneaten meat from the tables of the upper class was carefully collected and sold by regrattiers who specialized in this trade.|$|E

25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the railway in Brixton in the 1870s a {{building}} boom set in and Brixton developed into a major shopping centre. The first purpose-built department store, Bon Marché, was opened on Brixton Road in 1877 and Electric Avenue {{was one of the first}} shopping arcades to have electric lighting. The now famous Brixton Market began in Atlantic Road and was moved to Station Road in the 1920s to ease traffic congestion. Brixton Market is open every day, selling a range of Afro-Caribbean products and reflects other communities in the local area with Indian and Vietnamese supermarkets and South American butchers amongst <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> <b>and</b> stalls.. London Farmers' Markets opened a farmers market on Brixton Station Road in September 2009. It is open every Sunday from 10am-2pm.|$|E
