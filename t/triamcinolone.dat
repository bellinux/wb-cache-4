25|$|<b>Triamcinolone</b> is a {{long acting}} steroid preparation. When {{injected}} in the vitreous cavity, it decreases the macular edema (thickening of the retina at the macula) caused due to diabetic maculopathy, and results {{in an increase in}} visual acuity. The effect of <b>triamcinolone</b> is transient, lasting up to three months, which necessitates repeated injections for maintaining the beneficial effect. Best results of intravitreal <b>Triamcinolone</b> have been found in eyes that have already undergone cataract surgery. Complications of intravitreal injection of <b>triamcinolone</b> include cataract, steroid-induced glaucoma and endophthalmitis. A systematic review found evidence that eyes treated with the intravitreal injection of <b>triamcinolone</b> had better visual acuity outcomes compared to eyes treated with macular laser grid photocoagulation, or sham injections.|$|E
25|$|It is {{injected}} into the heel when treating plantar fasciitis, sometimes in conjunction with <b>triamcinolone</b> acetonide.|$|E
25|$|Several anti-itch {{medications}} are commercially available, {{including those}} taken orally, such as diphenhydramine, or topically applied antihistamines and, for more severe cases, corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone and <b>triamcinolone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although these {{treatments}} are very successful (in slowing or stopping further vision loss), {{they do not}} cure diabetic retinopathy. Caution should be exercised in treatment with laser surgery since it causes a loss of retinal tissue. It is often more prudent to inject <b>triamcinolone</b> or anti-VEGF drugs. In some patients it results in a marked increase of vision, especially {{if there is an}} edema of the macula.|$|E
25|$|Reassurance {{that the}} {{condition}} is benign, elimination of precipitating factors and improving oral hygiene are considered initial management for symptomatic OLP, and these measures are reported to be useful. Treatment usually involves topical corticosteroids (such as betamethasone, clobetasol, dexamethasone, and <b>triamcinolone)</b> and analgesics, or if these are ineffective and {{the condition is}} severe, the systemic corticosteroids may be used. Calcineurin inhibitors (such as pimecrolimus, tacrolimus or cyclosporin) are sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, Russian hackers hacked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ADAMS {{anti-doping}} {{system and}} released {{data on a}} number of athletes, including Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins. Therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) are medical exemptions athletes can be given when they need treatment for pre-existing medical conditions where the drugs used in the treatment are on the WADA prohibited compound list. The leak demonstrated that Wiggins had received TUEs for <b>triamcinolone</b> acetonide in June 2011, June 2012 and April 2013, a number of days {{before the start of the}} 2011 Tour de France, 2012 Tour de France, and 2013 Giro d'Italia respectively. Wiggins also received TUEs for salbutamol, fluticasone, formoterol and budesonide whilst at Team Highroad. Froome had received TUEs for prednisolone in May 2013 and during the 2014 Tour de Romandie.|$|E
25|$|Given its rarity, {{the optimal}} {{treatment}} for acute optic neuropathy in Behçet's disease {{has not been}} established. Early identification and treatment is essential. Response to ciclosporin, periocular <b>triamcinolone,</b> and IV methylprednisone followed by oral prednisone has been reported although relapses leading to irreversible visual loss may occur even with treatment. Immunosuppressants such as interferon alpha and tumour necrosis factor antagonists may improve though not completely reverse symptoms of ocular Behçet's disease, which may progress over time despite treatment. When symptoms are limited to the anterior chamber of the eye prognosis is improved. Posterior involvement, particularly optic nerve involvement, is a poor prognostic indicator. Secondary optic nerve atrophy is frequently irreversible. Lumbar puncture or surgical treatment {{may be required to}} prevent optic atrophy in cases of intracranial hypertension refractory to treatment with immunomodulators and steroids.|$|E
25|$|Doping {{controversy}} has surrounded Lance Armstrong. In August 2005, {{one month after}} Armstrong's seventh consecutive victory, L'Équipe published documents it said showed Armstrong had used EPO in the 1999 race. At the same Tour, Armstrong's urine showed traces of a glucocorticosteroid hormone, although below the positive threshold. He said he had used skin cream containing <b>triamcinolone</b> to treat saddle sores. Armstrong said he had received permission from the UCI to use this cream. Further allegations ultimately culminated in the United States Anti Doping Agency (USADA) disqualifying him from all his victories since 1 August 1998, including his seven consecutive Tour de France victories, and a lifetime ban from competing in professional sports. He chose not to appeal the decision and in January 2013 he admitted doping in a television interview conducted by Oprah Winfrey, despite having made repeated denials throughout his career. On 1 August 2013, Jan Ullrich—arguably Armstrong's biggest Tour de France rival—reportedly said that Armstrong should have his seven stripped wins reinstated, due to the prevalence of doping at the time. Ullrich had won the 1997 Tour and finished second to Armstrong three times—in 2000, 2001 and 2003—but declined to stake a claim for his rival's stripped titles.|$|E
500|$|Tricyclics {{and other}} pre-1980s {{antidepressants}} had several side effects {{due to their}} non-selective interference with neurotransmitters other than the serotonin target; the fluorinated fluoxetine was selective {{and one of the}} first to avoid this problem. Many current antidepressants receive this same treatment, including the [...] citalopram, its isomer escitalopram, and fluvoxamine and paroxetine. Quinolones are artificial broad-spectrum antibiotics that are often fluorinated to enhance their effects. These include ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Fluorine also finds use in steroids: fludrocortisone is a blood pressure-raising mineralocorticoid, and <b>triamcinolone</b> and dexamethasone are strong glucocorticoids. The majority of inhaled anesthetics are heavily fluorinated; the prototype halothane is much more inert and potent than its contemporaries. Later compounds such as the fluorinated ethers sevoflurane and desflurane are better than halothane and are almost insoluble in blood, allowing faster waking times.|$|E
500|$|In a 2004 article {{published}} in Dermatology Online Journal, authors reported on use of the Magic Wand to help alleviate pain before cosmetic and dermatologic techniques performed by clinicians. The authors described use of the device to decrease discomfort before procedures including supplementing anesthesia with the injection of <b>triamcinolone</b> acetonide into the proximal nail fold for psoriasis, decreasing discomfort during a Restylane injection of the nasolabial fold, making an intense pulsed light (IPL) facial treatment easier by reducing pain during the procedure, and throughout axillary hyperhidrosis treatment with botulinum toxin. They recommended use of the device with the [...] "Wonder Wand" [...] attachment to provide vibration to a decreased surface area on the patient. Lead researcher Kevin C. Smith explained to Skin & Allergy News that the vibrations when delivered {{to the area of}} the patient's mandible can give relief from discomfort by negating feelings of pain from being sent through the sensory system. Smith and Francisco Perez-Atamoros further elaborated on use of the Magic Wand in Chapter 7 [...] "Other Dermatologic Uses of Botulinum Toxin" [...] of the 2006 compilation book Botulinum Toxin in Clinical Dermatology. They emphasized the beneficial uses of the Magic Wand with the [...] "Wonder Wand" [...] attachment and showed how its vibrations can reduce pain if given just before an injection of Restylane within [...] from the injection site.|$|E

50|$|Over the years, Cyanamid {{scientists}} developed numerous {{important new}} chemical, pharmaceutical, and medical products. Perhaps {{the most significant}} is Tetracycline, discovered by a Lederle researcher in 1945. The Davis & Geck branch developed the first synthetic absorbable suture, trademarked Dexon, during the 1970s, based on an ingenious glycolic acid polymer (thus utilizing a natural body protein, which reduced inflammation and scarring). Also of particular note, Cyanamid research scientists employed at Lederle Laboratories developed <b>Triamcinolone</b> and Methotrexate. <b>Triamcinolone</b> is a widely used corticosteroid, sold both generically and under many brand names, including Cyanamid's Aristocort brand.
