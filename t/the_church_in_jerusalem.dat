25|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} disputes between the Arab and the Greek leadership of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>in</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> from the Mandate onwards. Jordan encouraged the Greeks to open the Brotherhood to Arab {{members of the community}} between 1948 and 1967 when the West Bank was under Jordanian rule. Land and political disputes have also been common since 1967, with the Greek priests portrayed as collaborators with Israel. Land disputes include the sale of St. John's property in the Christian quarter on April 11, 1990, the transfer of fifty dunams near Mar Elias monastery, and the sale of two hotels and twenty-seven stores on Omar Bin Al-Khattab square near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. A dispute between the Palestinian Authority and the Greek Patriarch Irenaios led to the Patriarch being pushed aside because of accusations of a real estate deal with Israel.|$|E

25|$|Acts and the Gospel of Luke make up {{a two-part}} work, Luke–Acts, by the same {{anonymous}} author, usually dated to around 80–90 AD. The first part, the Gospel of Luke, tells how God fulfilled his plan for the world's salvation through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, the promised Messiah. Acts continues the story of Christianity in the 1st century, beginning with Jesus's Ascension to Heaven. The early chapters, set in Jerusalem, describe the Day of Pentecost (the coming of the Holy Spirit) {{and the growth of}} <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>in</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b> Initially, the Jews are receptive to the Christian message, but soon they turn against the followers of Jesus. Rejected by the Jews, under the guidance of the Apostle Peter the message is taken to the Gentiles. The later chapters tell of Paul's conversion, his mission in Asia Minor and the Aegean, and finally his imprisonment in Rome, where, as the book ends, he awaits trial.|$|E

Paul was informed that many thousands of Jews [...] "believed," [...] yet remained zealous for the law, the old order.
