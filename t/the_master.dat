5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Master</b> Apartments' name {{derives from}} <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> Institute of United Arts, an art {{institute}} founded in 1920 by Nicholas and Helena Roerich. The institute's name, in turn, {{may have come}} either from Master Morya, a non-corporeal spiritual leader from whom Helena Roerich received guidance via automatic writing, or from Nicholas Roerich, a theosophist master. In 1925, wealthy financier Louis L. Horch, who funded the Roeriches' institutes and some other expenses, began purchasing lots to build the apartment building, and in 1928, secured a bond to fund its construction. Harvey Wiley Corbett; Helmle, Corbett & Harrison; and Sugarman & Berger constructed <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> Apartments, which opened in 1929 to generally positive acclaim. As built, the building's lower floors consisted of a museum; a school for the fine and performing arts; and an international art center.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Master</b> Apartments, officially {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> Building, is a {{landmark}} 27-story Art Deco skyscraper at 310 Riverside Drive, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City. It {{sits on the}} northeast corner of Riverside Drive and West 103rd Street. <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> Apartments is one of the city's first mixed-use structures as well as the tallest building on Riverside Drive. It was the first skyscraper in New York City to feature corner windows and the first to employ brick in varying colors for its entire exterior.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Master</b> Institute of United Arts {{came into}} being in 1920 as <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> School of United Arts. It {{struggled}} to survive until, in 1922, Louis Horch financed its transfer from a single-room, all-in-one studio at 314 West 54th Street to a mansion he bought on the site where <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> Building would later be constructed. Horch's wife, Nettie Horch, {{was a friend of}} Frances Grant who directed <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> School for the Roeriches. Nettie and Louis were patrons of the arts and ardent believers in art education as an indirect means of promoting harmony among the peoples of the world. They were attracted to the spiritual quest in which the Roeriches were engaged and participated in sessions during which Helena Roerich would receive instructions from Master Morya (or other esoteric beings) and Nicholas Roerich would record them on scrolls of paper that were later transcribed into a series of texts, the Leaves of Morya's Garden. Their teachings became the core of a spiritual and cultural movement known as Roerichism.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Master</b> {{spends most}} of his time {{drinking}} alcohol, and people begin trying to convince him to move into a nursing home, where no dogs are allowed. One summer, an outbreak of rabies spreads through the fox population. After one infected fox attacks a group of human children, the same people approach <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> and ask his help in killing the foxes. He uses traps and poison to try to kill as many foxes as possible; however, the poison also kills domestic animals. After a human child dies from eating it, the humans remove all of the poison, then <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> organizes a hunt in which large numbers of people line up and walk straight into the woods, flushing out foxes to be shot. The aging Tod escapes all three events, as well as an attempt at coursing him with greyhounds.|$|E
