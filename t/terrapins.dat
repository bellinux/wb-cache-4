5|$|When the NCAA {{abolished}} the one-platoon system in 1965, the ACC began naming separate all-conference {{offensive and defensive}} teams. In 1974, Maryland won its first ACC championship since 1955, and a school record six <b>Terrapins</b> were named to the conference's first team. Maryland secured the title again in 1975 and 1976, and surpassed the previous mark when seven <b>Terrapins</b> were named first-team All-ACC for each of those seasons. The 2001 squad set a new benchmark when eight players made the first team, and the 2002 <b>Terrapins</b> equaled that feat.|$|E

5|$|The AP preseason poll ranked Maryland {{second in}} the nation. The <b>Terrapins</b> {{recorded}} a 37-point shutout of 19th-ranked Georgia and defeated 20th-ranked Navy, 38–7.

Their loss at Mississippi ended a 22-game winning streak for the <b>Terrapins.</b> Tatum blamed the Terrapins' late season slide to injuries suffered by star quarterback Scarbath and weariness from the grueling road schedule.|$|E
5|$|After the 1947 season, the <b>Terrapins</b> {{participated in}} their first bowl game, the 1948 Gator Bowl, in which they tied Georgia, 20–20. NCAA season-scoring leader Lu Gambino {{recorded}} all three Maryland touchdowns. In 1949, Maryland again played in the Gator Bowl, where they defeated 20th-ranked Missouri, 20–7. The <b>Terrapins</b> finished the season ranked 14th by the Associated Press.

50|$|Similarly to {{regulation}} of snapping turtles, diamondback <b>terrapin</b> turtles are only {{allowed to be}} hunted during specific months of the year. The hunting season for Diamondback <b>Terrapin</b> turtles is August 1 - April 30. In order to hunt diamondback <b>terrapin</b> turtles, individuals must possess a hunting license specific to the species of turtle called the Diamondback <b>terrapin</b> license. Shells of the turtle must be between 4 and 7 inches long, and must be released if the shell size is any different.

5|$|After the 1952 season, Maryland and {{six other}} schools left the Southern Conference to form the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The {{following}} year, the conference honored its inaugural season's best players with an All-ACC team. In that initial class, five <b>Terrapins</b> were selected to the first team and two to the second team. Since 1953, Maryland players have received first-team All-ACC honors a total of 132times. <b>Terrapins</b> have been named to All-ACC second or third teams an additional 61times, although those teams have not been published continuously and there currently is no third team.|$|E
5|$|Against Georgia, most critics thought Maryland faced {{its first}} true test. In the first quarter, the <b>Terrapins</b> {{took a quick}} 14–0 lead and held the Bulldogs to six {{offensive}} plays, two of which were punts. In the second quarter, Georgia quarterback Zeke Bratkowski led his team to two consecutive touchdown drives, and the score was 21–13 in favor of Maryland at halftime. Two minutes into the third quarter, Faloney intercepted a Bratkowski pass and returned it for a touchdown. Bratkowski {{was taken out of}} the game after numerous sacks by Stan Jones and Bob Morgan. The 40–13 final result would be the most points the <b>Terrapins</b> allowed during the entire season.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Maryland routed Hopkins {{during the}} regular season, 17–4. That year's <b>Terrapins,</b> led by future Hall of Fame inductee and four-time All-American Frank Urso, are {{considered}} one of the all-time best college lacrosse teams and averaged almost 18goals a game. When the teams met in the championship game, however, the Blue Jays employed a possession game to offset Maryland's offensive firepower, and the first shot on goal did not take place until 8:38. At halftime, Johns Hopkins had taken a 5–2 lead. Time expired with the score tied, 9–9, which forced the game into overtime. Urso scored for the <b>Terrapins</b> to take a 10–9 lead and Maryland goalie Bill O'Donnell made several impressive saves to secure the win.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half, Chris Turner hit Darrius Heyward-Bey {{for a short}} bubble screen pass behind the line of scrimmage, and Heyward-Bey ran it 63yards for the score. During the next series, the <b>Terrapins</b> were held three-and-out, but the punt was fumbled and {{recovered}} by Maryland on the Hokies 11-yard line. However, the <b>Terrapins</b> were again forced {{to settle for a}} field goal, which made it a one-possession lead for VT at 20–13with 2:29left in the third quarter. In the final quarter, the Hokies managed another field goal and held onto the lead for a final result of 23–13.|$|E
5|$|Ron Vanderlinden {{was hired}} as head coach for the 1997 season under a five-year contract. Vanderlinden had helped {{engineer}} turnarounds at Northwestern as defensive coordinator and at Colorado as a defensive assistant. The 1995 Northwestern team in particular had shocked observers when it recorded a 10–2 season and the Big Ten championship. In 1999, Maryland showed signs of significant improvement, and a winning season appeared certain when Maryland possessed a 5–2 record. The <b>Terrapins,</b> however, then suffered a three-game losing streak. In their finale against Virginia, the <b>Terrapins</b> needed a win to garner a likely invitation to either the Aloha Bowl or Oahu Bowl—a Maryland alumnus was {{the chief executive officer}} of both events. The <b>Terrapins</b> came from behind and held the lead, 30–27, with 5:18 left to play. They regained possession with 1:40 remaining, but an inexperienced quarterback unintentionally stopped the clock by going out of bounds. After the ensuing punt, Virginia mounted a touchdown drive to win the game and end Maryland's bowl hopes. Despite narrowly missing a winning season, Vanderlinden was granted a two-year contract extension. In 2000, Maryland again fell short of a winning season and bowl game. The <b>Terrapins</b> entered their season closer with a 5–5 record, and again fell, this time in a rout by 24th-ranked Georgia Tech. Vanderlinden was fired the following day.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland <b>Terrapins</b> {{football}} team represents the University of Maryland in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).

Between 1930 and 1934, the Blue Jays won three national championships and lost only two games, both of which were to the <b>Terrapins.</b> Maryland captured national titles in 1936, 1937, and 1939. That year, however, Hopkins managed to break a four-game losing streak against them. The <b>Terrapins</b> won the 1940 title by beating the undefeated Blue Jays, 7–6, in the series' first game decided by one goal. Maryland finished the season with a perfect 10–0 record. The following year, Hopkins finished 12–0 and captured the national championship after a convincing victory over Maryland, 10–3.

The magazine Inside Lacrosse called the <b>Terrapins</b> a talented team that had underachieved during the regular season. The first-ranked Notre Dame defense frustrated Maryland, but the Terps still managed to gain a 6–1 lead in the third quarter. Maryland's defense effectively shut-down Notre Dame and the leading Irish scorer Ryan Hoff was unable to make a single shot on goal.
