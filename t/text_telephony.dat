40|$|Text {{telephone}} {{devices are}} text-based terminals {{that allow the}} users to communicate by text via fixed-line telephone networks. Since cellular phone systems are sometime subject to severe radio channel impairments and the modem signals of these text telephones are therefore not always transmitted reliably, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has required a solution to guarantee a reliable transmission of text telephone data for emergency calls via cellular phone systems. For the North American PCS- 1900 cellular phone systems recently the Standards Committee T 1 has standardized a solution for this requirement, {{which is based on}} a new modem protocol, the Cellular Text Telephone Modem (CTM), whose signals can be reliably transmitted via the speech channel of cellular phone systems. After a short introduction into <b>text</b> <b>telephony,</b> this contribution provides a description of this solution for PCS- 1900 systems using CTM signals.

Solutions involving web page <b>text</b> chat, <b>telephony</b> and video support prove problematic when seeking to remotely guide customers in their sales processes, especially with configurations of physically complex artefacts. Recently, {{there has been}} great interest {{in the application of}} virtual worlds and augmented reality to create synthetic environments for remote sales of physical artefacts.

We extend our previous work with the detailed design of configuration context services to support the management of an interactive sales session using augmented reality. We detail the context and configuration services required, presenting a novel data service streaming configuration information to the vendor for business analytics. We expect that a fully implemented configuration management service, based on our design, will improve the remote sales experience for both customers and vendors alike via analysis of the streamed information...|$|R
50|$|Computer-aided {{dispatch}} (CAD), {{also called}} computer-assisted dispatch, {{is a method}} of dispatching taxicabs, couriers, field service technicians, mass transit vehicles or emergency services assisted by computer. It can either be used to send messages to the dispatchee via a mobile data terminal (MDT) and/or used to store and retrieve data (i.e. radio logs, field interviews, client information, schedules, etc.). A dispatcher may announce the call details to field units over a two-way radio. Some systems communicate using a two-way radio system's selective calling features. CAD systems may send text messages with call-for-service details to alphanumeric pagers or wireless <b>telephony</b> <b>text</b> services like SMS. The central idea is that persons in a dispatch center are able to easily view and understand the status of all units being dispatched.

40|$|This thesis {{looks in}} depth at {{telephony}} server clusters, the modern switchboards {{at the core}} of a packet-based telephony service. The most widely used de facto standard protocols for telecommunications are the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Real Time Protocol (RTP). SIP is a signaling protocol used to establish, maintain, and tear down communication channel between two or more parties. RTP is a media delivery protocol that allows packets to carry digitized voice, video, or <b>text.</b> SIP <b>telephony</b> server clusters that provide communications services, such as an emergency calling service, must be scalable and highly available. We evaluate existing commercial and open source telephony server clusters to see how they differ in scalability and high availability. We also investigate how a scalable SIP server cluster can be built on a cloud computing platform. Elasticity of resources is an attractive property for SIP server clusters because it allows the cluster to grow or shrink organically based on traffic load. However, simply deploying existing clusters to cloud computing platforms is not good enough {{to take full advantage of}} elasticity. We explore the design and implementation of clusters that scale in real-time. The database tier of our cluster was modified to use a scalable key-value store so that both the SIP proxy tier and the database tier can scale separately. Load monitoring and reactive threshold-based scaling logic is presented and evaluated. Server clusters also need to reduce processing latency. Otherwise, subscribers experience low quality of service such as delayed call establishment, dropped calls, and inadequate media quality. Cloud computing platforms do not guarantee latency on virtual machines due to resource contention on the same physical host. These extra latencies from resource contention are temporary in nature. Therefore, we propose and evaluate a mechanism that temporarily distributes more incoming calls to responsive SIP proxies, based on measurements of the processing delay in proxies. Availability of SIP server clusters is also a challenge on platforms where a node may fail anytime. We investigated how single component failures in a cluster can lead to a complete system outage. We found that for single component failures, simply having redundant components of the same type are enough to mask those failures. However, for client-facing components, smarter clients and DNS resolvers are necessary. Throughout the thesis, a prototype SIP proxy cluster is re-used, with variations in the architecture or configuration, to demonstrate and address issues mentioned above. This allows us to tie all of our approaches for different issues into one coherent system that is dynamically scalable, is responsive despite latency varations of virtual machines, and is tolerant of single component failures in cloud platforms...|$|R
40|$|The most {{immediately}} striking {{challenge in}} designing wearable computers is creating appropriate interfaces. However, {{the issues of}} power use, heat dissipation, networking, and privacy provide a necessary framework in which to discuss interface. Part 1 of this article covers the first two of these issues; Part 2 begins with the networking discussion. Networking As with any wireless mobile device, the amount {{of power and the}} type of services available can constrain networking. Wearable computers could conserve resources through improved coordination with the user interface. For example, the speed at which a given information packet is transferred can be balanced against latency, energy costs, and financial costs. Often, bits per second per watt is a more meaningful measure of a particular wireless networking technology than maximum throughput. Another serious issue is open standards to enable interoperability between different services. For example, only one longrange radio should be necessary to provide <b>telephony,</b> <b>text</b> messaging, Global Positioning System (GPS) correction signals, and so on. For wearable computers, networking involves communication off body to the fixed network, on body among devices, and near body with objects near the user. Each of these three network types requires different design decisions. Designers must also consider possible interference between the networks. Off-body communications. Wireless communication from mobile devices to fixed infrastructure is the most thoroughly researched of these issues. On the consumer side, analog cellular phones and digital amateur-radio repeaters provided the first glimpse of future problems; these systems would often drop connections as the user moved.
