5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even {{in areas where the}} ground is colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storage,</b> solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity {{or other forms of}} grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E

The ADN operator may use Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units to supply its Industrial Customers (ICs) and can transact electricity with the upstream wholesale electricity market. The OSCHP problem is a Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming (MINLP) problem with many variables and constraints. However, the optimal operation of CHP units, Electrical and <b>Thermal</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Storages</b> considering LC programs and contingency scenarios, may highly complicate this problem. In this paper, linearization techniques are adopted to linearize equations and a two-stage Stochastic Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (SMILP) model is utilized to solve the problem. The first stage models the behavior of operation parameters and minimizes the operation costs, verifies the feasibility of the ICs' requested power exchanges and the second stage considers LC programs and the system's stochastic contingency scenarios.

Moreover, domestic water heating systems represent insulated <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>storages</b> that continually supply hot water even during periods of power interruption.

The fluid flows through the heat exchangers and the storage tank are represented by a cascade of Continuous Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs). Switching procedures between different model configurations associated to phase transitions within heat exchangers and PCM storage tank are mathematically performed by matrix operations. The compressor, the expansion valve and the pressure drop across the evaporator are represented by static models based on empirical correlations.

Thermochemical <b>energy</b> <b>storages</b> can make a decisive contribution because of their low material cost, high energy densities and heat transformation possibility. For an appropriate temperature range (~ 500 °C) the reversible gas-solid reaction of calcium oxide with water vapor to calcium hydroxide is investigated: CaO(s) + H 2 O(g) ⇌ Ca(OH) 2 + ΔHR In order to release a constant power level {{over a long period}} of time (night cycle), it is necessary to separate the power from the capacity of the storage unit. For this purpose, the gravity-induced flow of the reaction material through small reactor geometry is highly promising. However, due to its cohesive characteristic, the material tends to agglomerate during cycling and shows poor flow behavior leading to plugging within the reactor. Approaches of the bulk industries have demonstrated improvements of flowability of organic materials by adding nanoparticles to bulk material in order to decrease the Van-der-Waals forces. However, this enhancement is not established for high temperatures, reacting conditions and inorganic materials.

In this thesis project the economic viability of implementing load-shifting control systems was investigated. A dynamical building model was created based on data collected by Göteborg Energi. Control systems were designed that minimised the overall building heating cost under the assumption that district heating prices were proportional to the marginal generation cost. It was found that, when only focusing on temperature stabilisation, a 10 % reduction in heat use leads to less than 7 % reduced heating costs due to naturally high indoor temperatures coinciding with low marginal costs. When applying a combination of temperature stabilisation and load shifting however, savings above 13 % were achieved without negatively impacting thermal comfort...|$|R
