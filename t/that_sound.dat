5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic <b>that</b> <b>sound.</b> I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
5|$|There's {{something}} special about that first single, we were never quite able to recapture <b>that</b> <b>sound.</b> I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it {{had more to do with}} the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.|$|E
500|$|To {{facilitate}} a large range of timbres, organ stops exist at different pitch levels. A stop <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> at unison pitch when a key is depressed {{is referred to}} as being at 8 (pronounced [...] "eight-foot") pitch. This refers to the length of the lowest-sounding pipe in that rank, which is approximately eight feet. For the same reason, a stop <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> an octave higher is at 4 pitch, and one <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> two octaves higher is at 2 pitch. Likewise, a stop <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> an octave lower than unison pitch is at 16 pitch, and one <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> two octaves lower is at 32 pitch. Stops of different pitch levels are designed to be played simultaneously.|$|R

5|$|Unlike many celebrities Sheldon has met, James Earl Jones welcomes his company, {{and the two}} {{spend the}} night doing various activities; they go to an ice-cream parlor, a carnival, a strip club, and a sauna. Sheldon asks Jones {{questions}} about himself and he confirms that he was functionally mute for eight years, he was a pre-med in college, and <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> designer Ben Burtt used scuba equipment to create the sound of Darth Vader's breathing. They also sing at a karaoke club and prank Carrie Fisher by knocking on her door and running away. At {{the end of the}} night, James Earl Jones learns that Sheldon and his friends failed to get Comic-Con tickets and invites them along as his guests.|$|E
5|$|Kishi {{specifically}} requested <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> {{and music}} director Satoki Iida {{work on the}} project, who also helped with the proofreading of the script due to Maeda's fixation on the music production. Iida was interviewed in the April 2010 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where it was stated that Maeda and the group Anant-Garde Eyes received Iida's approval to employ a minimalist approach to the background music (BGM) used throughout the anime. Iida admitted that it was uncustomary to use this music genre in anime {{and that he had}} to go through various trials and errors with Maeda and Anant-Garde Eyes to get the music right. Maeda and Anant-Garde Eyes strove to create individual quality music tracks, while Iida pursued the goal of having music that would be useful as BGM tracks, which caused problems during the creation process. Iida realized that it was important for the music and the visuals to combine together to create a synchronization between the two. Toba first took notice of Angel Beats! character designer and chief animator Katsuzō Hirata during the production of Gurren Lagann (2007) with his skill as an artist and ability to finish work quickly, but thoroughly. It was after Toba saw Hirata's work as chief animator of Strike Witches (2008), however, that he pursued Hirata to join the Angel Beats! staff; Maeda also gave his seal of approval for Hirata.|$|E

5000|$|The {{pitch of}} a single bank of reeds is {{traditionally}} defined {{in a similar manner}} to the organ stops of a pipe organ. A bank <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> at unison pitch when keys are depressed is called 8′ (pronounced [...] "eight-foot") pitch: alluding to the length of the lowest-sounding organ pipe in that rank, which is approximately eight feet. For the same reason, a stop <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> an octave higher is at 4′ pitch, and one <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> an octave lower than unison pitch is at 16′ pitch.|$|R

25|$|Other {{potential}} sources of the sounds normally associated with tinnitus should be ruled out. For instance, two recognized sources of high-pitched sounds might be electromagnetic fields common in modern wiring and various sound signal transmissions. A common and often misdiagnosed condition that mimics tinnitus is radio frequency (RF) hearing, in which subjects have been tested and found to hear high-pitched transmission frequencies <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> similar to tinnitus.|$|E
25|$|The acoustoelastic {{effect was}} {{investigated}} {{as early as}} 1925 by Brillouin. He found that the propagation velocity of acoustic waves would decrease proportional to an applied hydrostatic pressure. However, a consequence of his theory was <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> waves would stop propagating at a sufficiently large pressure. This paradoxial effect was later shown {{to be caused by}} the incorrect assumptions that the elastic parameters were not affected by the pressure.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} that blockers act more like retrieval cues is mainly {{supported by the}} idea of phonological similarities between the target word and the blocker word. Phonological blockers are words <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> similar to the target word. According to Bown & Harley, “phonological neighbours (of blockers) usually act as support in lexical retrieval rather than as a hindrance”. In contrast, there is also an argument that phonological blockers hinder the ability to retrieve the target word causing a tip of the tongue state.|$|E

25|$|The end lead in music, a short {{emotional}} piece {{building up}} to the credits, harked {{back to the original}} music which was used between series 1–15. There were a few variations used in episodes between 2014 and 2016. An emotional version using strings and violin, A version using trumpet and beeps and a much basic sounding version just using beeps, those <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> like medical machinery. This package was used mostly until towards the end of Series 30 when a new package was slowly introduced. The original pack is still used occasionally.|$|E
25|$|The case of BCIs {{today has}} {{parallels}} in medicine, as will its evolution. Much as pharmaceutical science {{began as a}} balance for impairments and is now used to increase focus and reduce need for sleep, BCIs will likely transform gradually from therapies to enhancements. Researchers are well aware <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> ethical guidelines, appropriately moderated enthusiasm in media coverage and education about BCI systems will be of utmost importance for the societal acceptance of this technology. Thus, recently more effort is made inside the BCI community to create consensus on ethical guidelines for BCI research, development and dissemination.|$|E
25|$|In the SOFAR channel, {{the speed}} of sound is lower than that in the layers above and below. Just as light waves will refract towards a region of higher index, sound waves will refract towards a region where their speed is reduced. The result is <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> gets {{confined}} in the layer, much the way light can be confined in a sheet of glass or optical fiber. Thus, the sound is confined in essentially two dimensions. In two dimensions the intensity drops in proportion to only the inverse of the distance. This allows waves to travel much further before being undetectably faint.|$|E

25|$|Some {{textbooks}} mistakenly {{state that}} {{the speed of sound}} increases with increasing density. This is usually illustrated by presenting data for three materials, such as air, water and steel, which also have vastly different levels compressibilities which more than make up for the density differences. An illustrative example of the two effects is <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> travels only 4.3 times faster in water than air, despite enormous differences in compressibility of the two media. The reason is that the larger density of water, which works to slow sound in water relative to air, nearly makes up for the compressibility differences in the two media.|$|E
25|$|The Metrodome was {{recognized}} as one of the loudest venues in which to view a game, due in part to the fact <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> was recycled throughout the stadium because of the fabric domed roof. Stadium loudness is a sports marketing issue, as the noise lends the home team a home advantage against the visiting team. Until its demolition, the Metrodome was the loudest domed NFL stadium. During the 1987 World Series and 1991 World Series, peak decibel levels were measured at 125 and 118 respectively comparable to a jet airliner—both close to the threshold of pain.|$|E
25|$|Cochlear {{implants}} bypass most of {{the peripheral}} auditory system which receives sound and converts <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> into movements of hair cells in the cochlea; the inside-portion of these hair cells release potassium ions {{in response to the}} movement of the hairs, and the potassium in turn stimulates other cells to release the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which makes the cochlear nerve send signals to the brain, which creates the experience of sound. Instead, the devices pick up sound and digitize it, convert that digitized sound into electrical signals, and transmit those signals to electrodes embedded in the cochlea. The electrodes electrically stimulate the cochlear nerve, causing it to send signals to the brain.|$|E
