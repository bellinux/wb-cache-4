5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, Houston had a {{population}} boom as people from <b>the</b> <b>Rust</b> Belt states moved to Texas in large numbers. The new residents came for numerous employment {{opportunities in the}} petroleum industry, created {{as a result of}} the Arab oil embargo. With the increase in professional jobs, Houston has become a destination for many college-educated persons, including African Americans in a reverse Great Migration from northern areas.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012 a team {{of specialists}} financed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines that {{launched}} Apollo 11 into space.

5000|$|The {{order was}} {{established}} in 1889 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter to accommodate species of fungi having [...] "auricularioid" [...] basidia (more or less cylindrical basidia with lateral septa), including many of <b>the</b> <b>rusts</b> and smuts. In 1922, British mycologist Carleton Rea recognized the order as containing the families Auriculariaceae and Ecchynaceae, as well as <b>the</b> <b>rusts</b> (Coleosporiaceae and Pucciniaceae) and the smuts (Ustilaginaceae). Many subsequent authors, however, separated out <b>the</b> <b>rusts</b> and smuts and amalgamated the remaining Auriculariales with the Tremellales. Jülich (1981) also separated out <b>the</b> <b>rusts</b> and smuts, but recognized the remaining Auriculariales as an independent order, placing within them the families Auriculariaceae, Cystobasidiaceae, Paraphelariaceae, Saccoblastiaceae, Ecchynaceae, Hoehnelomycetaceae, and Patouillardinaceae.|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of heavy industry attracted thousands of European {{immigrants in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as internal migrants, both black and white, from the rural and small town South. These developments dramatically altered {{the demographics of the}} state. Indiana industrial cities were among the destinations of the Great Migration. After World War II, industrial restructuring and the shifts in heavy industry resulted in Indiana's becoming part of <b>the</b> <b>Rust</b> Belt.|$|E

The opportunity would not arise again, as Menza {{died of a heart}} attack in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|White pine blister rust, a {{fungal disease}} that infects conifer trees, was accidentally {{introduced}} in British Columbia in 1910 and had reached California by the 1920s.

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in <b>the</b> <b>Rust</b> Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike <b>the</b> <b>rust</b> that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
5|$|White pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) needs two {{alternate}} hosts {{to complete}} its lifecycle. One host is {{plants in the}} genus Ribes. On the blackcurrant, it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves. The fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year. The other host is any of the white pines, in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the North American species that have not co-evolved with <b>the</b> <b>rust.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ohio is {{commonly}} noted as the Nation's Industrial Capital, dating to {{its roots in}} <b>the</b> <b>Rust</b> Belt and Ohio's present-day intelligence and scientific dominance. Ohio {{was one of four}} states in the U.S. to have areas make the Intelligent Community Forum's list of global Smart 21 Communities for 2014, with Columbus, Ohio receiving the honors. The state has 5 of the top 115 colleges in the nation, according to U.S. News and World Report's 2010 rankings, while the Ohio State University was ranked #10 by the same magazine for awarding degrees to Fortune 500 CEOs. The state was ranked #8 by the same magazine in 2008 for best high schools, while overall, in 2010 the state's schools were ranked #5 in the country by Education Week. However, by 2016 the state's high school rankings had slipped to #11 according to U.S. News and World Report, and #22 overall in quality by Education Week in 2017. It was second only to Texas in having the most U.S. cities in the top 30 best places for new college graduates, according to BusinessWeek in 2010. The year ending July 2011 saw the state ranked fourth in the nation in job creation behind Texas, California, and New York. By 2016 the state wasn't in the top 10 for job growth, and between 2015-2016, the state saw a decrease in job creation of 38,800. Since February 2010 state was 2.5% below the national average.|$|E
