5|$|The {{relevance}} of Strype's reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> {{was more than}} geographical. The East End was the major part of an area called the Tower Division, which had {{its roots in the}} Bishop of London's historic Manor of Stepney and owed military service <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London. Later, as the East End grew and the Tower Division contracted, the East End became, arguably, conterminous with the Tower Division.|$|E

5|$|As {{they make}} their way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> Nicholai disappears and is presumed dead, while Nemesis corners the {{remaining}} members of the group on the cable car headed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> Mikhail sacrifices himself with a grenade, causing the car to crash into the tower's main courtyard and separating Jill and Carlos briefly. At the Clock Tower, Jill summons the helicopter by ringing the Clock Tower's bell before being confronted by Nemesis, which destroys the helicopter and infects Jill with the T-virus. Jill manages to temporarily defeat Nemesis but falls unconscious due to the T-Virus. Carlos finds Jill and takes her to safety within the Clock Tower. Three days later, he manages to find a cure for Jill's T-Virus infection in the Raccoon City General Hospital. He returns to Jill and injects her with a vaccine, saving her.|$|E

5|$|After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre-war {{owners of}} the {{property}} laid claim to Clifford's Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property. Repairs were made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> {{and it became a}} magazine for storing gunpowder and shot. Attempts were made to restore the condition of the moat, which had become badly silted. Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period, including George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends.|$|E
5|$|An {{area was}} set aside within {{the grounds for}} athletics, aptly named the Tower Athletic Ground. It {{consisted}} of a stadium opened in 1896; the hope was to provide additional entertainment for visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> in the winter months. The capacity of the grounds varied, but at one point was as high as 100,000, although attendances rarely, if ever, approached that figure.|$|E
5|$|Between 2007 and 2012 {{an average}} of 30,000 {{visitors}} came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> each year, with non-English speaking visitors making up a high proportion. The architecture of the tower has made it a challenging site to operate as a tourist attraction; the fluctuating heat and humidity, and capacity constraints, have prevented it being adapted to house more delicate historical artefacts or accommodate additional visitor numbers.|$|E

5|$|Cow Tower formed part of {{the city}} defences during the 15th century, with the Crown {{occasionally}} issuing instructions that it should be repaired. In 1450 St Giles Hospital formally transferred any rights they had <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> and the immediately surrounding land to the city. The population of Norwich grew significantly from 1500 onwards and the city continued to maintain the urban defences; like other towers and gatehouses belonging to the city, however, by this period the Cow Tower was probably leased out to a merchant or craftsman when not in military use.|$|E
5|$|During the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the city's priory, nunnery {{and three}} friaries were closed. St Augustine's Abbey, the 14th richest in England at the time, was {{surrendered}} to the Crown, and its church and cloister were levelled. The rest of the abbey was dismantled over the next 15years, although part of the site was converted to a palace. Thomas Becket's shrine in the Cathedral was demolished and all the gold, silver and jewels were removed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London, and Becket's images, name and feasts were obliterated throughout the kingdom, ending the pilgrimages.|$|E
5|$|From Beckford's {{house in}} Lansdown Crescent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> {{a series of}} {{interlinked}} gardens were laid out which became known as Beckford's Ride. Nearest the crescent was a terraced Italianate garden and then a plantation of conifers. Above the plantation was a quarry garden and dyke garden before entering a grotto tunnel under a track. The tunnel lead into the tower garden. Specialist planting included: Pinus arborea, Royal Fern (Osmunda regalis) and Cistus alpina. These were to encourage bird species including nightingales, linnets and thrushes. The old quarry {{was made into a}} walled garden with fruit and vegetables.|$|E
5|$|On {{the roof}} of the FootTown {{building}} is a small amusement park that contains several small rides and hosts live performances for children. On weekends and holidays, visitors can use <b>the</b> roof <b>to</b> access <b>the</b> <b>tower's</b> outside stairwell. At approximately 660steps, the stairwell is an alternative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower's</b> elevators and leads directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Main Observatory.|$|R

5|$|Henry had Anne {{investigated}} for high treason in April 1536. On 2 May {{she was arrested}} and sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London, where she was tried before a jury of peers – which included Henry Percy, her former betrothed, and her own uncle, Thomas Howard – and found guilty on 15 May. She was beheaded four days later. Modern historians view the charges against her, which included adultery, incest and plotting to kill the king, as unconvincing. Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments make no mention of this charge.|$|E
5|$|In 1553, {{orders were}} issued for the {{artillery}} pieces {{to be removed}} from Gravesend Blockhouse and taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London, although the historian Victor Smith casts doubt on whether this was actually carried out. In 1588, however, there was a renewed threat of invasion, this time from Spain; the Spanish Armada sailed from A Coruña, while a separate invasion force was prepared in Flanders, threatening London; Rober Dudley, the Earl of Leicester was put in charge of the defences along the Thames.|$|E
5|$|In 1553, {{orders were}} issued for the {{artillery}} pieces {{to be removed}} from the blockhouse and taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of London; the fort was then demolished between 1557 and 1558, the brick and stone from the site being reused to repair the Tower. The former site was probably rediscovered during excavations in 1826, but was destroyed during the building of the Gravesend Canal Basin, Canal Road and the Gordon Pleasure Gardens later in the 19th century. Archaeological investigations between 1973 and 1978 uncovered the foundations of the blockhouse, now protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E

25|$|After a phase (1990–2001) of {{structural}} strengthening, <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> is currently undergoing gradual surface restoration, {{in order to}} repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening.

5|$|In the {{south-east}} {{corner of}} the walls is God's House tower. This is architecturally important as {{it was one of}} the first urban buildings to be built to hold gunpowder artillery – in this respect, it closely resembles Cow Tower in Norwich. The tower was built alongside God's House Gate and is three storeys high. The gunports designed for handcannon can be seen on the outside, and the roof was designed to hold larger cannon. Adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> is God's House Gate, a two-storey building also equipped with a gun-port.|$|E
5|$|On the airship, Kain appears {{and demands}} Cecil {{retrieve}} the final crystal {{in exchange for}} Rosa's life, which the party obtains with assistance from a bedridden Edward. Kain then leads the party <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> of Zot, where Rosa is imprisoned. At the tower's summit, Golbez takes the crystal and attempts to flee. Tellah casts Meteor to stop Golbez, sacrificing his own life in the process. However, the spell only weakens Golbez, ending his mind control of Kain. Kain helps Cecil rescue Rosa, who teleports the party out of the collapsing tower to Baron.|$|E

5|$|Several {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the number of LIMs on the Robin tower. From opening day to 2004, Robin operated with 7 LIMs {{on each side of the}} track. Before the 2004 season, 3 LIMs were taken off on both sides of the Robin tower, leaving 4 LIMs per side. Then two more LIMs were taken off (one per side) the Robin side's tower, leaving three per side before the 2005 season began. A few weeks after the Chiller re-opened in 2007, two more LIMs were added back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> bringing the total back to 4 per side.|$|E
5|$|Since the Blackheath {{negotiations}} had failed, {{the decision}} was taken that the King himself should meet the rebels, at Greenwich, {{on the south side}} of the Thames. Guarded by four barges of soldiers, Richard sailed from the Tower on the morning of 13 June, where he was met on the other side by the rebel crowds. The negotiations failed, as Richard was unwilling to come ashore and the rebels refused to enter discussions until he did. Richard returned across the river <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since {{the launch}} of Trump's presidential {{campaign}} in 2015, the number of visits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> had risen drastically, {{with many of the}} visitors being supporters of Trump's candidacy. The tower gained popularity among New York City tourists in 2016, especially after Trump was elected as U.S. president. There are stores selling Trump merchandise that are located in the atrium. During Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, the stores sold campaign memorabilia such as hats, with the proceeds going toward funding his campaign. In 2017, the city ordered the removal of two unauthorized kiosks in Trump Tower that were selling Trump's merchandise.|$|E
