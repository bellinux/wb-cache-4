25|$|On February 7, 1981, the Beechcraft Bonanza A36TC Wozniak was {{piloting}} crashed {{soon after}} takeoff from the Sky Park Airport in Scotts Valley, California. The plane stalled while climbing, then bounced down the runway, went through two fences, {{and crashed into}} an embankment. Wozniak and his three passengers—then-fiancée Candice Clark, his brother, and his girlfriend—were injured. Wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries, including losing a tooth, and also suffered for five weeks after the crash from anterograde amnesia, the inability to create new memories. He had no memory of the crash, and did not remember {{his name in the}} hospital or <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> after he was released. He would later state that Apple II computer games are what helped him regain his memory. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation report cited premature liftoff and pilot inexperience as probable causes of the crash.|$|E
500|$|Friday's {{behaviour}} on Reading away trips was {{unpredictable and}} erratic: {{in the words}} of teammate John Murray, [...] "Some of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> were funny but other times they were just mad". On the way back from one away match, the team bus pulled over and Friday noticed that they were beside a cemetery. Friday jumped over the wall and stole some stone angels from a grave, intending to place them beside the club chairman Frank Waller, who was sleeping on the coach. When he returned, Hurley sternly told him that [...] "you must never ever desecrate a graveyard"—Friday dutifully returned the statues. On another occasion, Friday reacted to the news that a teammate had smuggled a girl into his hotel room by kicking the door in. Later on the same night he walked into the bar carrying a swan that he had found in the hotel grounds.|$|E

500|$|In 1951, with secret {{means of}} {{communications}} established, Wolters sent his first letter to Speer in five years. [...] He suggested that Speer move ahead with his memoirs. [...] In January 1953, Speer {{began work on}} his draft memoirs, {{and over the next}} year lengthy missives, sometimes written on tobacco wrappings or candy wrappers but most often on toilet paper, made their way to Wolters' office in Coesfeld. [...] Marion Riesser, who had continued as Wolters' secretary as he began private architectural practice, transcribed these notes into as many as forty closely typed pages per missive, and the draft totalled 1,100 pages. [...] Wolters objected that Speer called Hitler a criminal in the draft, and Speer presciently observed that he would likely lose a good many friends were the memoirs ever to be published. [...] Wolters had come to believe that reports of Nazi genocide were exaggerated by a factor of at least ten, that Hitler had not been given credit for <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> right and that Germany had been harshly treated by the Allies.|$|E
500|$|Jesse is apprehended by {{the police}} under {{suspicion}} of murdering Kris, and is killed by Krueger when he falls asleep in his jail cell. With her friends dying, Nancy begins to question what everyone's connection is to each other, given {{that none of them}} can remember each other before their teenage years. Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith (Kyle Gallner) discover that all of them attended Badham Preschool. Nancy's mother, Gwen (Connie Britton), reluctantly tells Nancy and Quentin that there was a gardener at the preschool, Fred Krueger, who was accused of abusing Nancy {{and the rest of the}} kids. Gwen explains that Nancy was his favorite, and that she came home one day telling her mother about a hidden space in Krueger's room and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> to her there. Gwen claims Krueger skipped town before he was arrested. Nancy does not believe her and attempts to track down the remaining kids from the school. She discovers that all of the other kids have been killed, most of them in their sleep.|$|E

Jean-Luc is considering a position on earth with an underwater research project called Atlantis. Robert has always been jealous of his brother's success and is concerned that Jean-Luc's presence will drive René to also join Starfleet. The two have a bitter argument and end up wrestling each other in a mud puddle, eventually culminating in an emotional reunion, with Jean-Luc admitting his sense of powerlessness and guilt at <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> while {{under the influence of the}} Borg. Robert states that Jean-Luc will have to learn to live with what he did, regardless of where he goes. [...] Jean-Luc decides to go back to the Enterprise. The two spend the night getting drunk as they resolve their differences. After Jean-Luc leaves, Robert decides to let René follow his dream to join Starfleet as René sits under a tree and looks up at space.|$|E

500|$|In Things Fall Apart, Okonkwo's furious manhood overpowers {{everything}} [...] "feminine" [...] in his life, {{including his}} own conscience. For example, when he feels bad after being forced to kill his adopted son, he asks himself: [...] "When did you become a shivering old woman?" [...] It is also argued that one’s chi, or personal god, is the ‘mother within’. This understanding further demonstrates how Okonkwo’s hypermasculinity corrupts his conscience, as his contempt for his own mother and other women prevents him from being in harmony with his chi. He views all things feminine as distasteful, {{in part because they}} remind him of his father's laziness and cowardice. His father was considered an agbala—a word that refers to a man without title, but is also synonymous with ‘woman’. Thus, Okonkwo not only regrets his father’s lack of success, but attributes it to a lack of masculinity. Okonkwo’s feminization of all things lacking success or power is a common theme throughout the novel. His obsession with maleness is fuelled by an intense fear of femaleness, which he expresses through physical and verbal abuse of his wives, his violence towards his community, his constant worry that his son Nwoye is not manly enough, and his wish that his daughter Ezinma had been born a boy. The women in the novel, meanwhile, are obedient, quiet, and absent from positions of authority– despite the fact that Igbo women were traditionally involved in village leadership. Nevertheless, the need for feminine balance is highlighted by Ani, the earth goddess, and the extended discussion of [...] "Nneka" [...] ("Mother is supreme") in chapter fourteen. Ekwefi’s perseverance and love for Ezinma, despite her many miscarriages, is seen as a tribute to Igbo womanhood, which is typically defined by motherhood. Okonkwo's defeat is seen by some as a vindication of the need for a balancing feminine ethos. Some have also argued that all of Okonkwo’s failures are tied to his contempt and fear of women and his inability to form quality personal relationships with the women in his life—his wives, his children, and his own mother. Achebe has expressed frustration at frequently being misunderstood on this point, saying that [...] "I want to sort of scream that Things Fall Apart {{is on the side of}} women... And that Okonkwo is paying the penalty for his treatment of women; that all his problems, all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> wrong, can be seen as offenses against the feminine." [...] Indeed, it is argued that Okonkwo’s violent and vehement anti-women position is the exception, not the norm, within his community of Umuofia and the wider Igbo society. Still, post-colonial African writing is intensely male-centred, a phenomenon that is not alleviated by the frequent trope of the African woman as the [...] "embodiment of the male writer’s vision for the new Africa". It is argued that even when women and their lives are more centrally depicted in literature, the male writer continues to be the visionary while the woman is the [...] "sign" [...] of changes to come.|$|E

While admitting in the interview to <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> he also said it was [...] "absolutely not" [...] true that he was doping in 2009–10, and that the last time he [...] "crossed the line" [...] was in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Phillips, {{a native}} of the North Central section of Detroit, Michigan, grew up in a rough neighborhood. His father, Virgil, wanted to keep him off the streets, so he created a program called REACH (an acronym for religion, education, athletics, {{character}} and hope) where Rashad and others could go to play basketball and stay out of trouble. Later, when he was a senior at college, Phillips said, [...] "I thank God every day for giving me a father who did <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> for me... I've seen a lot of people fall victim to the streets, but that was never an option for me. I always had a gym to go to. What my father has done has saved so many lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{understood}} by Skinner, ascribing dignity to individuals involves giving them {{credit for their}} actions. To say [...] "Skinner is brilliant" [...] means that Skinner is an originating force. If Skinner's determinist theory is right, he is merely the focus of his environment. He is not an originating force {{and he had no}} choice in saying the things he said or doing <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Skinner's environment and genetics both allowed and compelled him to write his book. Similarly, the environment and genetic potentials of the advocates of freedom and dignity cause them to resist the reality that their own activities are deterministically grounded. J. E. R. Staddon (The New Behaviorism, 2nd Edition, 2014) has argued the compatibilist position; Skinner's determinism is not in any way contradictory to traditional notions of reward and punishment, as he believed.|$|E
2500|$|I'd place Pollock {{along with}} Hofmann and Morris Louis {{in this country}} among the very {{greatest}} painters of this generation. I actually don't think there was anyone in the same generation in Europe quite to match them. Pollock didn't like Hofmann's paintings. He couldn't make them out. He didn't take the trouble to. And Hofmann didn't like Pollock's allover paintings, nor could most of Pollock's artist friends make head or tail out of them, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> from 1947 to '50. But Pollock's paintings live or die in the same context as Rembrandt's or Titian's or Velázquez's or Goya's or David's or ...or Manet's or Ruben's or Michelangelo's paintings. There's no interruption, there's no mutation here. Pollock asked to be tested by the same eye that could see how good Raphael {{was when he was}} good or Piero when he was good.|$|E
