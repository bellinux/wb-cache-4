5|$|Botanical {{gardens are}} often run by {{universities}} or other scientific research organizations, and often have associated herbaria and research programmes in plant taxonomy {{or some other}} aspect of botanical science. In principle, their role is to maintain documented collections of living plants {{for the purposes of}} scientific research, conservation, display, and education, although this will depend on <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available</b> and the special interests pursued at each particular garden.|$|E
5|$|Communities with {{demonstrated}} {{loyalty to}} Rome retained their own laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation. Legal privileges and relative independence were {{an incentive to}} remain in good standing with Rome. Roman government was thus limited, but efficient in its use of <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available</b> to it.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available</b> to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E

25|$|Avoiding Self-Exploration - In {{common with}} most brief therapy practitioners, Erickson was entirely uninterested in {{analysing}} the patient's early psychological development. Occasionally {{in his case}} histories, he will briefly discuss the patient's background, but {{only as much as}} it pertains to <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available</b> to the patient in the present.|$|E
25|$|Immigrants to the United States {{vary widely}} {{in terms of}} their {{citizenship}} status. Some immigrants may lack documentation altogether. An individual’s legal status in the United States determines many of <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available</b> to him or her.

25|$|The {{classical}} period {{began when}} the disease was first recognized in the Middle Ages. The term lupus is attributed to 12th-century Italian physician Rogerius Frugard, who used it to describe ulcerating sores on the legs of people. No formal treatment for the disease existed and <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available</b> to physicians to help people were limited.|$|E
25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available</b> are not {{fixed or}} not perishable, {{the problem is}} limited to logistics, i.e. {{inventory}} or production management. If all customers would pay the same price for using {{the same amount of}} resources, the challenge would perhaps be limited to selling as quickly as possible, e.g. if there are costs for holding inventory.|$|E
25|$|Practices and {{procedures}} of episcopal inquisitions could vary from one diocese to another, depending on <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available</b> to individual bishops and their relative interest or disinterest. Convinced that Church teaching contained revealed truth, the first recourse of bishops {{was that of}} persuasio. Through discourse, debates, and preaching, they sought to present a better explanation of Church teaching. This approach often proved very successful.|$|E
50|$|The {{tragedy of}} the commons {{is a type of}} {{replenishing}} <b>resource</b> management dilemma. <b>The</b> dilemma arises when members of a group share a common good. A common good is rivalrous and non-excludable, meaning that anyone can use <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> but there is a finite amount of <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> <b>available</b> and it is therefore prone to overexploitation.|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation is to study how the presence of phenotype markers affects the model's range of evolving cooperative strategies. In addition, as <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> <b>available</b> in this 2D environment is capped, the simulation also serves {{to determine the effect}} of environmental carrying capacity on their emergence.|$|R

25|$|The Trulaske Consulting Association {{was started}} in 2009. It is a {{relatively}} new student organization and is open to students of all departments. However most members are MBA and undergrad business students. The association aims to increase awareness, provide exposure, and facilitate networking between students and professionals in the consulting industry. The growing popularity of the association has been attributed to <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available</b> to student members. Workshops by management consultants and case studies on strategy form {{an integral part of the}} activities organised by TCA.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, the Stop TB Partnership {{was created}} {{along with the}} UN's {{formulation}} of the Millennium Development Goals. In 2001 the measles initiative was formed, and credited with reducing global deaths from the disease by 68% by 2007. In 2002, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to improve <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available.</b> In 2006, the organisation endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for Zimbabwe, which {{formed the basis for}} a global prevention, treatment and support plan to fight the AIDS pandemic.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} effort surpassed <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available</b> to the Romanian {{economy in}} the 1950s. The canal was assigned inferior machinery, part of which had already been used on the Soviet Volga-Don Canal, and building {{had to rely on}} primitive techniques (most work appears to have been carried out using shovels and pickaxes, which was especially hard in the rocky terrain of Northern Dobruja). Detainees were allocated to brigades, usually run by common criminals– encouraged to use violence against their subordinates. In parallel, the region's industrialization, destined to assist in the building effort, was never accomplished.|$|E
25|$|If a team loses <b>resource</b> at <b>the</b> {{start of}} an innings (left hand image below), {{then this is}} simple. For example, if the first 20 overs of an innings are lost, then 30 overs and 10 wickets are remaining, which is 75.1% in the Standard Edition, so this is <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> <b>available.</b>|$|R

25|$|How {{ambulances}} are staffed {{is determined}} to some extent by the location, and by <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available</b> to the community. For the most part, Italy follows the Franco-German (as opposed to Anglo-American) model of EMS service delivery. The basic model consists of Basic Life Support ambulances, Advanced Life Support ambulances, Modified Advanced Life Support ambulances, and physician response cars called automedica. BLS units are typically volunteer-based, and crews consist of {{a minimum of two}} EMTs called soccorritore (one of them is a dedicated driver); {{it is not uncommon to}} find three- or four-EMTs ambulance crews.|$|E
25|$|The {{logistic}} {{growth curve}} is initially {{very similar to}} the exponential growth curve. When population density is low, individuals are free from competition and can grow rapidly. However, as the population reaches its maximum (the carrying capacity), intraspecific competition becomes fiercer and the per capita growth rate slows until the population reaches a stable size. At the carrying capacity, the rate of change of population density is zero because the population is as large as possible based on <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available.</b> Experiments on Daphnia growth rates showed a striking adherence to the logistic growth curve. The inflexion point in the Daphnia population density graph occurred at half the carrying capacity, as predicted by the logistic growth model.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that if the court interprets a statute to impose a duty on a public authority, <b>the</b> <b>resources</b> <b>available</b> to the authority are irrelevant to deciding how the duty should be carried out. Conversely, if the court interprets a statute to confer a discretionary power on a public authority, then resources are a relevant consideration. Also, public authorities are not required to take into account people's fundamental rights arising under the Human Rights Act 1998 as relevant considerations before arriving at decisions. Their only responsibility is to ensure that the decision itself complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. At present, there are no Singapore cases on these issues.|$|E
