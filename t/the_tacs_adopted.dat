Then physical activity (ACT) will be taught through healthy exercise such as dancing and stretching. Lastly, Participants are encouraged to promote healthy exercise and knowledge in the community (Contribute) by joining <b>the</b> <b>TAC</b> Health Leaders Program. By sharing a similar mission as Tuen Mun Healthy City Limited, we cooperate and <b>adopt</b> <b>the</b> <b>TAC</b> model to spread healthy ideas in the community. Unlike ordinary exercise program, this project packaged regular exercise programs with health-related seminars and workshops. Also, Health leaders (TAC Health Leaders) trained as trainers to further promote healthy lifestyles and create a supportive environment in sustaining healthy lifestyles in Tuen Mun. In the aspect of Service-Learning, Lingnan students act as Health Leaders to create health awareness in the community such as primary and secondary schools while applying the service experience and knowledge into their academic studies...|$|R

40|$|This open, {{randomized}} (1 : 1), multicenter, 3 -month study compared a dual tacrolimus plus steroids (Tac / steroids) regimen with a steroid-free immunosuppressive {{regimen of}} tacrolimus following daclizumab induction therapy (Tac / Dac) in adult liver transplant recipients. The full analysis set comprised 347 patients in <b>the</b> <b>Tac</b> / steroids group and 351 in <b>the</b> <b>Tac</b> / Dac group. Mean tacrolimus dose during month 3 was 0. 11 mg/kg/day in both groups; mean whole-blood trough levels during month 3 were 10. 9 ng/mL (Tac / steroids) and 10. 6 ng/mL (<b>Tac</b> / Dac). <b>The</b> incidence of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection that required treatment was similar in both groups: 26. 5 % in <b>the</b> <b>Tac</b> / steroids group and 25. 4 % in <b>the</b> <b>Tac</b> / Dac group (P =. 727). However, {{the incidence of}} biopsy-confirmed corticosteroid-resistant acute rejection was higher in <b>the</b> <b>Tac</b> / steroids group than in <b>the</b> <b>Tac</b> / Dac group (6. 3 vs. 2. 8 %; P =. 027). Kaplan-Meier estimates of graft survival (92. 2 vs. 90. 5 %) and patient survival (94. 5 vs. 93. 7 %) were similar in both groups. While also the overall adverse event profiles were similar, the incidences of diabetes mellitus (15. 3 vs. 5. 7 %, respectively; P <. 001) and cytomegalovirus infection (11. 5 vs. 5. 1 %, respectively; P =. 002) were higher in <b>the</b> <b>Tac</b> / steroids group compared with <b>the</b> <b>Tac</b> / Dac group. Mean cholesterol levels increased by 16 % in <b>the</b> <b>Tac</b> / steroids group, but were unchanged in <b>the</b> <b>Tac</b> / Dac group during the study. In conclusion, tacrolimus monotherapy following daclizumab induction is an effective and safe regimen, with an advantage over concomitant steroid-maintenance therapy {{in terms of a}} lower incidence of diabetes and viral infection, and a lower incidence of steroid-resistant acute rejection...|$|R

40|$|A {{field study}} {{was carried out}} {{to assess the impact}} of {{installing}} a desktop task/ambient conditioning (TAC) system at 42 selected workstations within three San Francisco office buildings occupied by a large financial institution. In this study, field measurements, including subjective surveys and physical monitoring, were performed both before and after <b>the</b> <b>TAC</b> system installation to evaluate the impact of <b>the</b> <b>TAC</b> system on occupant satisfaction and thermal comfort, as well as the thermal environments within the office buildings. For comparative purposes within each building, a control group, consisting of workers who did not receive a desktop TAC unit, was studied concurrently. During the follow-up field tests, performed three months after <b>the</b> <b>TAC</b> system installation, measurements were repeated under three different room temperature setpoint conditions (normal, set-up, and set-down) to investigate the ability of the occupants to use <b>the</b> desktop <b>TAC</b> units to control their local environment in response to a wider range of ambient temperatures. Survey results show that among the six building assessment categories investigated, installation of <b>the</b> desktop <b>TAC</b> system provided <b>the</b> largest increases in overall occupant satisfaction for thermal quality, acoustical quality, and air quality. In terms of specific environmental factors, increased occupant satisfaction levels among <b>the</b> <b>TAC</b> group were strongly significant in comparison to changes within the control group for both temperature and temperature control. A large majority of the workers in the control group indicated a preference for higher air movement at operative temperatures of 73 Â°F (23 Â°C) and above.
