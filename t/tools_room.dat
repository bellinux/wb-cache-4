Another interesting feature one easily finds on campus is a small building that houses almost every single tool used in clearing, sweeping and keeping the school compound in good shape {{referred to as the}} <b>Tools</b> <b>Room.</b> That facility headed one tutor called Mr. Agyene Christopher.|$|E
50|$|The museum {{houses a}} large {{collection}} of artifacts {{of the local}} archaeological site and smaller sites in the neighboring area, such as Korakou, Gonia, and Acrocorinth. The artifacts, which were systematically recovered beginning in 1896 by the Corinth Excavations, illustrate much about Ancient Corinth through Greek, Roman and Byzantine rule. Exhibits include statues, mosaics, pottery and sarcophagi. The museum consists of four rooms. In room one are finds from the prehistoric installations {{in the area and}} includes pottery, figurines, and <b>tools.</b> <b>Room</b> two contains objects from the Geometric, Archaic, and Classical periods. Room three houses statues of Roman rulers, floor mosaics, wall paintings and Roman and Byzantine pottery. The Asklepieion room contains mainly votives from the Asklepieion at Ancient Corinth. With the generous donations of Mrs. William H. Moore, the American School of Classical Studies at Athens built the museum in 1931 and its expansion in 1950.|$|E
5000|$|The {{collection}} is arranged in thematic areas. [...] "In each room {{a number of}} fine and often rare objects illustrate a particular subject area, suggesting connections with other themes that enrich the overall picture".The first room explains the Middle-East roots of viticulture and how it reached the Mediterranean basin, through several pieces of archaeology from the Bronze Age to the late-ancient era, with particular attention to Etruscan culture. Among the items on display, there is the lip cup attributed to Phrynos Painter, one of the Little masters.Rooms 2 to 8 show viticulture techniques used in Umbria. Many working tools well illustrate the yearly wine cycle and traditional techniques. A varied section also illustrates places and ways of wine consumption. The basement {{is home to a}} large room dedicated to winemaking, with large presses, distillers, a bottling machine and other objects. Room 6 shows how Vin Santo is made.The itinerary follows illustrating crafts related to wine (coopers, smiths etc.) and a large collection of <b>tools.</b> <b>Room</b> 8 describes regulation about harvesting-time, usage and trade of wine, to pass to local handicraft and viniculture in rooms 9 and 10.Rooms 11 to 15 are dedicated to pottery, with a rich collection of ceramics coming from the most prestigious pottery-producing regions of Italy. The collection of pottery is arranged according to the following thematic division: “wine as food” (measures, bottles, etc.), “wine as a medicine” (jars, mortars, pharmaceutical containers, books, etc.) and finally “wine and mythology” (symbolic and story-telling decorations mainly related to Dionysos/Bacchus, including works by Mastro Giorgio Andreoli and Girolamo della Robbia). Room 16 boasts the largest existing collection of irons for wafer, in Umbria usually served with Vin Santo.Room 17 hosts a rich collection of engravings and sketches, made of about 600 pieces concerning dionysian scenes with pictures by authors like Mantegna, Piranesi, Picasso.Room 18 is dedicated to ex libris.The visit ends in room 19 where fiction and non-fiction ancient books about wine are exposed.|$|E

Despite this good property, the time-resolved photoluminescence measurements demonstrate a clear influence of non-radiative defects initiated at the GaP/Si interface. It is shown from simulations, how x-ray diffraction can be used efficiently for analysis of antiphase domains. Then, qualitative and quantitative analyses of antiphase domains, micro-twins, and stacking faults are reported using complementarity of the local transmission electron microscopy and the statistical x-ray diffraction approaches...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 years {{there has been}} {{remarkable}} progress in the specification and estimation of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. Central banks both in developed and emerging market economies have become increasingly interested in their usefulness for policy analysis and forecasting. This paper reviews some issues and chal-lenges surrounding the use of these models at central banks. It recognises that such mod-els offer coherent frameworks for structuring policy discussions. Nonetheless, they are not ready to accomplish all that is being asked of them. First, they still need to incorporate relev-ant transmission mechanisms or sectors of the economy; Second, issues remain on how to empirically validate them; and finally, challenges remain on how to effectively communicate their features and implications to policy makers and to the public. Overall, at their current stage DSGE models are likely to perform well in some dimensions but not in others. Thus, {{if they are to be}} used as policy <b>tools,</b> <b>room</b> must be left for judgement...|$|E
