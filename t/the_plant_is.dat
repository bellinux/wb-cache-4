5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, the {{government}} built a factory to manufacture high explosives at Puriton near Bridgwater. Called ROF Bridgwater, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> today owned by BAE Systems and closed after decommissioning was completed in July 2008.|$|E
5|$|IV: The Morris Plains {{address at}} 45 Hanover Avenue {{is given in}} a 1928 ad; <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> {{described}} in the New York Times as adjoining the Morristown Line, so the address must be 45 East Hanover Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, SITA {{teamed up}} with Sembcorp UK to build another waste-to-energy {{facility}} in the Teesside region. Wilton 11 on the Wilton International complex is to burn a further 400,000 tonnes of waste in the region whilst generating 35MW of electricity. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> expected to be operational by 2015.|$|E
50|$|In 1940, {{after the}} Russo-Finnish War of 1939—1940, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> built in <b>the</b> area of Sortavala, which {{became part of}} the newly created Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.In 1944 <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> reconstructed after <b>the</b> Finnish occupation.In 1970 <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{upgraded}} with new soviet equipment.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1961 to build Moto-Ski snowmobiles and <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} to railcars in 1971 (Bombardier continued to market Moto-Ski until 1985).|$|R
5000|$|It was {{the site}} of a cement clinker works - CIMAO cement. [...] <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> active from 1980 to 1984. Several {{attempts}} to restart <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>were</b> made until 1997, when WACEM (West Africa Cement) reopened it with an infusion of funds from an Indian company. In 1998 <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> sold to Scancem, a Norwegian corporation.|$|R
5|$|Mazatec shamans have a {{long and}} {{continuous}} tradition of religious use of Salvia divinorum, using it to facilitate visionary states of consciousness during spiritual healing sessions. Most of the plant's local common names allude to the Mazatecs' post-Columbian belief that <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> an incarnation of the Virgin Mary, with its ritual use also invoking that relationship.|$|E
5|$|Niger {{seed oil}} is {{obtained}} from the edible seeds of the Niger plant, which belongs to the Asteraceae family and of the Guizotia genus. The botanical name of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> Guizotia abyssinica. Cultivation for the plant originated in the Ethiopian highlands, and has since spread from Malawi to India.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> also {{parent to}} several hybrids (see table). Of these, {{the most common}} is V.×semialbum Chaub. (× V.nigrum). All occur in Eurasia, and three, V.×kerneri Fritsch, V.×pterocaulon Franch. and V.×thapsi L. (syn. V.×spurium W.D.J.Koch), have also been {{reported}} in North America.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{listed on}} <b>the</b> National Register of Historic Places in 1990, {{but despite the}} listing and local and {{national}} debate, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> demolished in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{built by}} <b>the</b> {{municipality}} of Vágur. It became operational on 18 July 1921. [...] In 1960, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> acquired by SEV from Suðuroyar Elverk.|$|R
5000|$|By 1920 <b>the</b> Bettendorf <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> largest {{railroad}} car manufacturing <b>plant</b> west of <b>the</b> Mississippi River {{and employed}} 3,000 people. [...] The company {{was affected by}} the Great Depression. [...] <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> closed in 1932, the year before J.W. Bettendorf died. At the start of World War II <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> used by <b>the</b> United States Navy to produce protective devices for ships. [...] <b>The</b> truck <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> bought by <b>the</b> United States Army in 1942 to produce tanks. In 1946 <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> sold to J.I. Case. Today it {{is the site of}} the Isle of Capri Casino.|$|R
5|$|Waste {{arriving}} at <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> checked in and weighed, before {{being delivered to}} the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for the combustion of the waste later in <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. A grab crane then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in the plant, the combustion gases and maximises {{the efficiency of the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{to energy}} plants are {{strictly}} monitored, {{and the plant}} has achieved various ISO external certificates. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> seen {{to be at the}} forefront of sustainable energy production and waste disposal. The plant not only reduces the amount of waste sent to landfill, but displaces the burning of depleting fossil fuels, and makes significant contributions to meeting the North East region's waste recovery and recycling targets.|$|E
5|$|Conservation and {{recovery}} plans for A. brownii {{have been proposed}} by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) which administers the island of Nihoa {{as part of the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. In 1996, the plant was listed by the FWS as an endangered species. In 2003, the FWS designated the island of Nihoa as a critical habitat for the plant and it was classified as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> one of 51 endangered or threatened plants in the Hawaiian Islands listed under the Endangered Species Act.|$|E
50|$|Construction of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{carried out}} with {{cooperation}} with Soviet experts. Some 50,000 workers {{took part in the}} project. First unit of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> opened in 1969.|$|R
5000|$|The Charlotte, North Carolina Mint - 1835 to 1861. After the Civil War, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> reopened in 1868 as an Assay Office until 1913, when <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> closed.|$|R
50|$|The first turbine of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} in December 1965. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> put into full operation in 1968 by launching the fourth turbine. In 1991-2001, additional six turbines {{were added to}} original four increasing the capacity to 868.5MW. The first reconstruction of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> carried out from 1999 to 2001, and the second one, {{to be completed in}} 2010, was {{launched in}} 2007.|$|R
5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
5|$|In nuclear reactors, 10B is {{used for}} {{reactivity}} control and in emergency shutdown systems. It can serve either function {{in the form of}} borosilicate control rods or as boric acid. In pressurized water reactors, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.|$|E
5|$|P.atriplicifolia is {{frequently}} propagated by cuttings. Because its woody crown is resistant to division, softwood cuttings {{are taken from}} shoots near the base, generally in late spring. Hardwood cuttings selected in mid-to-late summer also provide a viable propagation technique. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30–160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. In the commercial greenhouse or nursery setting, P.atriplicifolia relatively large size and rapid growth can adversely affect quality or make plants more difficult and expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale pruning.|$|E
50|$|On July 12, 2006 it <b>was</b> {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> would <b>be</b> sold to Entergy. On April 11, 2007, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> sold to Entergy for $380 million. <b>The</b> <b>plant's</b> original licensee <b>was</b> due {{to expire on}} March 24, 2011. An application for 20-year extension was filed in 2005 with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It was granted on January 18, 2007. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> then scheduled for decommissioning by 2031.|$|R
50|$|Construction of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> {{began in}} 2011. Though {{originally}} slated to begin producing freshwater {{by the end}} of 2013, the first freshwater produced from <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> in early 2015. Full commercial operation of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> achieved in March 2016.|$|R
5000|$|After Kiev was {{liberated from}} <b>the</b> Nazis, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{returned}} there, where {{until the end}} of the war it overhauled PO-2 aircraft and assembled Yak-3 and Yak-9 fighters from parts manufactured elsewhere. In 1944 <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> renamed [...] "Plant 473", or [...] "Organization Mailbox 11". After the end of <b>the</b> war <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> moved to <b>the</b> present location in Sviatoshin, which it had started to develop before 1941.|$|R
5|$|Quatermass {{returns to}} the Rocket Group, where Leo has reconstructed the meteorite, which can carry ammonia and other gases and travel through the {{atmosphere}} {{to the ground in}} one piece. In London, the Metropolitan Police claim they have no jurisdiction over the matter, so he goes to his contact Fowler at the ministry, who reveals that <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> a top secret project to make synthetic food, but Vincent Broadhead MP, who is conducting an inquiry into the project, reveals that there are identical plants in Brazil and Siberia. Upon gaining entry to the inquiry, Quatermass notices that one of the civil servants has 'the mark'.|$|E
5|$|Springfield is in {{the midst}} of a massive heat wave. Every {{building}} in the town has installed a large air conditioning device. However, this draws a lot of power from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite the safety measures Mr. Burns has taken (cutting power to the orphanage), <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> at full power. At home, without an air conditioning device, the Simpsons have to follow an old-fashioned fan. Homer decides to give them a taste of winter by plugging in his dancing Santa Claus. This overloads the plant and causes a town-wide blackout. Eventually, widespread rioting and looting occur. The police try to intervene, but are powerless to stop the massive crime wave.|$|E
5|$|The Bintulu {{combined}} cycle power plant {{was started in}} early 2010 with a capacity of 317 megawatts. The power plant is registered under the United Nations Clean Development Management (CDM) scheme as of 18 September 2010. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> built to ensure efficient use of energy and reduce green house gas emissions. It is the first CDM power plant in Malaysia, currently operated by Sarawak Power Generation Sdn Bhd (SPG), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sarawak Energy.|$|E
50|$|The name of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{changed from}} <b>the</b> Sunflower Ordnance Works to Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant (SFAAP) on August 1, 1963. Two years later, on August 20, 1965, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{reactivated}} {{to aid the}} Vietnam War by producing in excess of 145 million pounds (66,000,000 kg) of propellants before ceasing operations in June 1971. While operating during this time, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> employed up to 4,065 people. In 1972, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> returned to standby status.|$|R
5000|$|The terms geoponic and geoponics {{refer to}} growing plants {{in a normal}} soil. This is in {{contrast}} to hydroponics where <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> grown in water, or aeroponics where <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> grown suspended in air.|$|R
50|$|In 2000 <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{integrated}} into <b>the</b> nearby auto-assembly business of General Motors (Opel). Opel Combo minivans were assembled {{until the end}} of 2006 when <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> closed and production transferred to <b>the</b> manufacturer's <b>plant</b> near Saragossa (Spain).|$|R
5|$|The Sarawak Shell Bintulu Plant (SSBP), {{formerly}} known as Bintulu Crude Oil Terminal (BCOT), was established in 1979. It consists of three crude oil storage tanks, each with a capacity of 410,000 barrels. It has three major areas of operation: Crude Oil Operations, Condensate Stabilisation, and Gas Sales Facilities. Royal Dutch Shell started to establish the world's first Shell Middle Distillate Synthesis plant (Shell MDS) in 1993. It {{is also known as}} Bintulu Gas-To-Liquid plant (Bintulu GTL). The plant has a production capacity of 14,770 barrels per day with a total investment of over US$1billion as of the year 2010. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> staffed with 380 people, of whom 93% are Malaysians, with 80% of the staff coming from Sarawak.|$|E
5|$|The carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, {{and yellow}} cultivars exist. Carrots are a domesticated {{form of the}} wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant {{probably}} originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> the taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody-textured taproot.|$|E
5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal defense is risk: {{how likely is}} it that a plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related to the plant apparency hypothesis, which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest in small amounts of qualitative toxins that are effective against {{all but the most}} specialized herbivores.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Tihange <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} designed for 1000-yearly floods. After Fukushima the design base of <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> <b>was</b> increased 10,000 yearly floods {{by building a}} flood wall around <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|R
50|$|When wildcrafting is done {{sustainably}} {{and with}} proper respect, generally only the fruit, flowers or branches from <b>plants</b> <b>are</b> taken and <b>the</b> living <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> left, {{or if it}} is necessary to take <b>the</b> whole <b>plant,</b> seeds of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>are</b> placed in <b>the</b> empty hole from which <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> taken. Care is taken to remove only a few plants, flowers, or branches, so plenty remains to continue the supply.|$|R
50|$|Dredging {{has been}} {{underway}} {{for years to}} remove contaminants from the Pine River, which runs alongside the property where <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> located. Although <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> disassembled years ago, the land remains vacant to this day.|$|R
