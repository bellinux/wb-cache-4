500|$|Some of the Senate Ethics Committee {{members were}} {{concerned}} that letting the senators off lightly would harm their own reputations. Nevertheless, the existing Senate rules did not specifically proscribe the actions taken by DeConcini, Riegle, Glenn, and McCain. Vice-chair Rudman defended the committee's actions, saying: [...] "Given the news media frenzy surrounding , <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> <b>thing</b> for the committee to do {{would have been to}} find them guilty of something and recommend sanctions. ... The politically difficult thing, the one requiring backbone, was what we did — to review all the evidence and reach a predictably unpopular conclusion based only on fact." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruby later {{starts to}} have {{feelings}} for Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell). Of the storyline Breeds states: [...] "It's {{going to be}} <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> <b>thing</b> I've ever had to do. There's no acting involved at all. But he's got a girlfriend so Ruby has {{to find a way}} to justify going after someone who has a girlfriend. So that's kind of hard. But he's the hero. She believes he's the love of her life. I guess with that in mind you wouldn't let anything get in the way of that. Who knows, he might be." [...] However Breeds previously revealed she did not want the pair to romance each other, due to her real life relationship with Mitchell. Mitchell himself had also revealed he did not want the pair to start a romance. In comparison to her willingness to take him from Indigo, Breeds said Ruby would not have done the same whilst Romeo was with her best friend Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best).|$|E
500|$|For {{the final}} scene with Daenerys Targaryen {{emerging}} from the great fire of the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, the filming took place in two different locations, with the close ups of Emilia Clarke taking place on a closed set in Belfast, and the large-scale set shots taking place in Spain. In an interview, Clarke had previously indicated she had become reluctant to do nude scenes unless it served the plot. After the episode aired, Clarke made a point to indicate {{that it was not}} a body double in {{the final scene}} of the episode, stating, [...] "I'd like to remind people the last time I took my clothes off was season 3. That was awhile ago. It's now season 6. But this is all me, all proud, all strong. I'm just feeling genuinely happy I said 'Yes.' That ain't no body double!" [...] She continued, [...] "Taking off my clothes is not <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> <b>thing,</b> but with the magic of the effects, I don't have to do a season 1 and go on a cliff and do it, I'm in control of it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, and I knew that would be <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> <b>thing</b> to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go out and say, even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E
500|$|Meeting the Detroit Red Wings for {{the second}} {{straight}} year in the Finals, Crosby won his first Stanley Cup with the Penguins in seven games. At 21 years, 10 months, and 5 days, Crosby became the youngest NHL captain to win a Stanley Cup championship since 1895. (The youngest captain to lead his team to the Stanley Cup {{in the history of the}} trophy is Mike Grant of the 1895 Montreal Victorias, who was 21 years and 2 months at the time.) In the deciding game seven, Crosby was forced to watch all but 32 seconds of the third period from the bench after suffering a knee injury less than halfway through the second period due to a hit from Johan Franzén. Following the game, Crosby was criticized by Detroit forward Kris Draper for neglecting to shake hands with some of Detroit's players, most notably captain Nicklas Lidström. An irate Draper was quoted as saying [...] "Nick was waiting and waiting, and Crosby didn't come over to shake his hand. That's ridiculous, especially as their captain." [...] Crosby replied afterward, saying, [...] "I just won the Stanley Cup. I think I have the right to celebrate with my teammates. I know it's not easy waiting around...I understand if they don't feel like waiting around. But you know what? It's <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> <b>thing</b> to do in the world, to shake hands after you win. I had no intentions of trying to skip guys and not shake their hands. I think that was a pretty unreasonable comment." ...|$|E
