5|$|Five years later, The Boss {{has been}} elected President of the United States, with {{the other members of}} the Saints, Keith David and former Vice Kings leader Benjamin King acting as cabinet. While {{preparing}} for a press conference, <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> <b>is</b> told that Asha and Matt have arrived at the White House to warn them of what they suspect is an impending alien invasion. Just as <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> <b>is</b> informed, the invasion begins, spearheaded by the alien warlord Zinyak, who captures the entire cabinet, including the Boss.|$|E
5|$|Next, Kinzie leads a {{successful}} effort {{to drive the}} Deckers out of Steelport, causing Miller to abandon the Syndicate and return to his home country after losing a virtual fight to the Boss. Finally, alongside Muerte, the Boss enters Murderbrawl XXXI and humiliates Killbane by defeating him in physical combat. With his image shattered, Killbane goes on a rampage through Steelport. While working to contain the damage, <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> <b>is</b> informed that STAG, {{in an attempt to}} discredit the Saints, has rigged the Steelport Monument with explosives, leaving several kidnapped Saints, including Shaundi, Viola, and Mayor Burt Reynolds at the site to frame them. At the same time, Killbane is fleeing the country by private flight.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on grid-based {{self-contained}} maps and are governed by a turn-based system where units on both sides are given their chance to move and act. Once a unit has moved, depending on their position relative to allied units and enemies, they may perform actions such as attacking or supporting allied characters through statistic-enhancing abilities, or they can wait until the next turn. When attacking, the game transitions from the top-down view of the map to a side-view battlefield, where a cinematic battle plays between the player and enemy units. Each unit has access to different weapons and items, but these will break {{after a number of}} uses and must be repaired in between missions. The effectiveness of melee weapons is dictated with the series' recurring Weapons Triangle mechanic: axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Villages found during map battles will be attacked; if defended by the player, non-player characters within the village will give hints about future objectives. A map is cleared when <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> defeated. If characters fall in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of the}} game. If Roy dies, the game ends and the map must be restarted.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> street <b>boss</b> <b>was</b> a {{high-ranking}} member appointed {{to run the}} daily activities for <b>the</b> <b>boss.</b> <b>The</b> position <b>was</b> created to protect <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> by federal investigations.|$|R
5000|$|Space Fever II is an homage/sequel to {{an early}} Nintendo arcade game. In this minigame, the player {{controls}} a spaceship which fires missiles at other ships throughout three unique levels, followed by a <b>boss</b> at <b>the</b> end of each level. <b>The</b> first <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> a giant face {{of a man with}} horns, <b>the</b> second <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> a giant face of a mustachioed man, and <b>the</b> third <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Game Face". Once all three of <b>the</b> <b>bosses</b> <b>are</b> beaten, <b>the</b> cycle will start over again, only harder.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bosses</b> <b>are</b> Scratch, Dirtbag, a Triceraton, Scale Tale, and Shredder (in {{this game}} known as Cyber-Shredder).|$|R
25|$|The underboss {{is usually}} {{appointed}} by the boss. He is the boss' most trusted right-hand man and second-in-command. If <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> killed or imprisoned, he takes over as leader.|$|E
25|$|To get the Ronin's attention, Pierce, Gat, and the Boss rob {{their most}} {{profitable}} casino. Fearing disgrace, their leader, Shogo Akuji, orders his enforcer Jyunichi to use Aisha to lure Gat into a trap, ending with her death and him severely wounded. After killing Jyunichi {{in a fight}} at a restaurant and saving Johnny from Ronin goons trying to kill him at the hospital, the Boss receives {{the location of the}} Ronin's headquarters from Vogel, angered by their refusal to honor an agreement with Ultor. As a last-ditch effort, Shogo leads a group of Ronin to kill Gat at Aisha's funeral. However, Gat and The Boss kill Shogo's men and bury him alive in a coffin as revenge for Aisha's murder. His father Kazuo, after surviving an attempt on his life at Wardill Airport, orders a direct attack on The Saints, but fails. Mr. Wong, an old ally of <b>The</b> <b>Boss,</b> <b>is</b> subjected to another attack at his heritage festival in a bid to lure The Saints out. After rescuing Mr. Wong, the Boss beats Kazuo in a sword fight and leaves him to die in a burning boat.|$|E
25|$|A feature {{not found}} in {{previous}} Souls games are Chalice Dungeons. Chalice Dungeons are randomly generated dungeons that vary in depth and difficulty, and can be reformed by performing a ritual with a Chalice and other certain materials in the Hunter's Dream. Chalice Dungeons are optional and provide additional content to the player. Gameplay {{is much the same}} as the main story in that it contains various areas and enemies that the player must overcome to complete the Dungeon. Each Chalice Dungeon contains multiple bosses that the player must defeat to progress through the Dungeon's levels. Special types of lootable chests that are {{not found in}} the main story are hidden throughout the Dungeons, providing the player with the materials to generate more Dungeons. One major difference between the main story and the Chalice Dungeons is the world design. In the main story world of Yharnam, the design is open ended, more spacious, and is a mixture of indoor and outdoor environments. Chalice Dungeons are only indoors, cramped, and contain many traits of a typical dungeon. The branching paths featured in the main story are still present in the Chalice Dungeons. Another important difference are the objectives. In the main story, players journey through many different locations with many different objectives. In the Chalice Dungeons, the player's basic objective is to locate a door, then find the lever to open the door, which is located elsewhere, and then battle the boss behind the door. After <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> defeated, the player enters the next area, which will be completely different, and completes the same goal. The cycle repeats at least three times before the entire Chalice Dungeon is cleared. Chalice Dungeons, like the main story, can be played alone or cooperatively with other players.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> street <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} <b>the</b> go-to-guy for <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> and <b>is</b> {{responsible to}} pass on orders to lower ranking members. In some instances a Ruling panel (of capos) substituted <b>the</b> Street <b>boss</b> role.|$|R

500|$|The Boss asks Zinjai, Zinyak's main servant, for {{technology}} to bring Earth back. Zinjai says they cannot restore Earth, but can use time-travel technology {{to return to}} Earth, explaining that Zinyak had used this technology to collect his favorite historical figures, keeping them in suspended animation. The Boss looks at the Saints and says, [...] "Let's go on a field trip." [...] In a post-credits scene, the nineteenth century writer Jane Austen, whom <b>the</b> <b>Boss</b> <b>is</b> a fan of, is woken out of her stasis, revealing {{that she had been}} the narrator throughout the game.|$|E
500|$|The {{two primary}} antagonists {{of the game}} are Colonel Volgin (Neil Ross/Kenji Utsumi), an electricity-controlling GRU colonel {{and member of the}} extreme Brezhnev faction, who are {{attempting}} to overthrow Nikita Khrushchev to seize power for Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin, and The Boss (Lori Alan/Kikuko Inoue), former mentor to Naked Snake and co-founder of the FOX unit. The Cobra Unit, a Special Forces unit led by <b>The</b> <b>Boss,</b> <b>is</b> composed of The End (J. Grant Albrecht/Osamu Saka), a venerable expert sniper credited as the [...] "father of modern sniping"; The Fear (Michael Bell/Kazumi Tanaka), who has supernatural flexibility and agility; The Fury (Richard Doyle/Masato Hirano), a disfigured former cosmonaut armed with a flamethrower and a jetpack; The Pain (Gregg Berger/Hisao Egawa), who can control hornets to both defend himself and attack his enemies; and The Sorrow (David Thomas/Yukitoshi Hori), the spirit of a deceased medium.|$|E
500|$|Players {{dispatch}} enemies {{by either}} thrusting {{at them with}} his Dragon Sword or by defeating them using Power Boosting Items. These special items consume Ryu's [...] "ninja power", also located {{on the top of}} the screen. Power Boosting Items include the following: shurikens; [...] "Windmill Throwing Stars" [...] that move back and forth like a boomerang; [...] "The Art of the Fire Wheel" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally upwards; [...] "Fire Dragon Balls" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally downwards; and the [...] "Invincible Fire Wheel" [...] that creates a barrier of three fireballs around Ryu, destroying any enemy that touches them. These items can be found in various crystal balls scattered throughout the levels, and they can be switched out by collecting another Power Boosting Item. The amount of ninja power used depends on the type of Power Boosting Item used. At the end of each Act Ryu fights a boss which has its own strength meter, located {{on the top of the}} screen. The boss's strength meter decreases every time the player damages it, and <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> destroyed when the player completely depletes its strength meter.|$|E
50|$|A running gag in {{the game}} <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> <b>bosses</b> <b>are</b> called superships despite many of them not {{actually}} being ships.|$|R

500|$|Gameplay in the {{top-down}} perspective {{consists of}} a series of labyrinths in which players defeat enemies along the way. The player switches between the 2D platforming mode and the top-down perspective by leaving the tank and entering small doorways located throughout the game. While in the top-down perspective, players can move Jason in any direction and destroy mutants with a gun or with hand grenades. In this mode, players upgrade the gun by collecting gun capsules, but the gun degrades by one point if Jason receives damage from mutants or hazardous objects. Here players obtain additional vehicle functions by destroying bosses; these functions include weapon upgrades as well as abilities to swim freely underwater, drive on walls and ceilings, and hover above the ground. The game has a glitch – colloquially known as the [...] "grenade glitch" [...] – to easily defeat four of the game's underbosses. To exploit this glitch, the player throws a grenade at the boss, and while the grenade is exploding and causing damage on the boss, the player pauses the game. While the remainder of the action on the screen freezes, the grenade remains active, continuing to damage the boss. After fifteen seconds the player unpauses the game to find that <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> destroyed.|$|E
500|$|In Hyrulean Adventure, most of {{the same}} {{mechanics}} as the previously released [...] for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) are used. The multiplayer version requires each player to have a GBA, which {{is used as a}} controller and to which the action transfers when that player's character goes off the main screen, but the single player game may be played with either a GameCube controller or a GBA. There are always four Link characters (differentiated by different colors: green, red, blue and purple) in play, regardless of the number of people playing; [...] "extra" [...] Links are attached to those directly controlled and positioned around the controlling character. Normally, the extra Links follow the player, but players can separate an individual Link and control independently, or put the four Links into formations. These techniques are required to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Players are encouraged to work together to gather enough Force Gems to empower the Four Sword, and failing to do so by the time <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> <b>is</b> defeated or the dark barrier is reached results in having {{to go back to the}} beginning of the stage to collect more. However, once the requisite gems are collected, players are automatically transported to the dark barrier and therefore do not have to repeat the entire stage.|$|E
500|$|Players use {{the control}} pad to move {{horizontally}} and to crouch. Kuros can attack enemies by using his Brightsword or with other weapons and magic. He can also attack enemies {{while in the}} air or while standing by simply holding the sword in position. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect the various weapons and magic as well as the gems and treasure along the way; players use these items to make it past the enemies and other obstacles and hazards. Players collect gems in order to [...] "bribe" [...] the creature who guards the entrance to the next level; if players do not have enough gems, they cannot progress to the next level. At the end of each level is a boss creature which has been empowered by Malkil's black magic. Bosses have an [...] "Enemy's Black Magic Power" [...] meter which shows how difficult <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> <b>is,</b> how many hits are required to defeat it, and what type of weaponry needs to be used. Kuros has a life meter which decreases as time passes and when he sustains damage from enemies. Players loses a life when Kuros' life meter runs out, but upon restarting they keep all the items they have obtained up to that point. The game ends when all three lives have been lost, but players have the choice to continue and restart at the level in which they lost their last life; upon continuing, players keep all their items obtained up to that point, but their score goes back to zero. Along the way, players can replenish Kuros' life meter by collecting pieces of meat scattered throughout the levels.|$|E

2500|$|There {{was also}} a {{separate}} line of comic book titles published by the Caplin family-owned Toby Press, including Shmoo Comics featuring Washable Jones. Cartoonist Mell Lazarus, creator of Miss Peach and Momma, wrote a comic novel in 1963 titled <b>The</b> <b>Boss</b> <b>Is</b> Crazy, Too which was partly inspired by his apprenticeship days working with Capp and his brother Elliot at Toby. In a seminar at the Charles Schulz Museum on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby [...] "the five funniest years of my life." [...] Lazarus went on to cite Capp {{as one of the}} [...] "four essentials" [...] in the field of newspaper cartoonists, along with Walt Kelly, Charles Schulz and Milton Caniff.|$|E

We'll just say it was your first movie and they just didn't release it." [...] I think people were all fucked up on drugs. I don't know. I was a little removed, because I wasn't on the movie the whole time, but it seemed like it was just a mess.

50|$|Also, {{the blood}} and gore from the {{original}} game was edited out of the western localizations. In the original game, any of the normal enemies would have their heads explode, followed by their bodies in a bloody fashion {{as well as some}} boss characters having more of a gory finishes to their fights. Last Battle, however, edited down the gore so that the normal enemies would only fly offscreen when hit and many of the bloody animations for <b>the</b> <b>bosses</b> <b>were</b> removed or some of <b>the</b> <b>bosses</b> <b>were</b> recolored to look more like mutants than humans.|$|R
