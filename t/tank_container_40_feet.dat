50|$|In 1982, another {{industry}} caught Jaco|b’s attention.

50|$|Jacob Stolt-Nielsen helped {{establish}} United <b>Tank</b> <b>Containers</b> in 1978, starting small {{with only a}} few units. The outfit was eventually renamed Stolt <b>Tank</b> <b>Containers</b> (STC). It currently operates the world’s largest fleet of stainless steel ISO <b>tank</b> <b>containers,</b> with more than 31,000 units in service. The fleet is supported by a global network of 24 offices and 15 tank maintenance, repair and cleaning depots in locations worldwide.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> is {{a vessel}} of {{stainless}} steel surrounded by an insulation and protective layer of usually polyurethane and aluminum. The vessel {{is in the middle}} of a steel frame. The frame is made according to ISO standards and is 19.8556 ft long, 7.874 ft wide and 7.874 ft or 8.374 ft high. The contents of the tank range from 17500 to 26000 L. There are both smaller and larger <b>tank</b> <b>containers,</b> which usually have a size different from the ISO standard sizes. For example, there are some 27000 L and above litre <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> in the European swap body fleets in Europe but they are not used on international business only on intra European traffic.The trade organization @TCO estimates that at the end of 2012 the global fleet of <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> was between 340,000 and 380,000. Most of these <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> are owned by operators and leasing companies.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> {{concept was}} also {{employed}} in Europe by Bob Fossey, an engineer {{who worked for}} Williams Fairclough in London. They improved on the 1950s framed American elliptical <b>container</b> <b>tanks,</b> oft noted carrying specified USA engine oils for the UK’s MoD aircraft built in Preston, Lancashire. In 1964 Fairclough made a swap body tank for combined transport by truck and train, but not yet constructed according to ISO standards. In 1966, commercial production began and one year later the first <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> to ISO dimensions was developed. The first mass-produced <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> were purchased by Trafpak, a part of Pakhoed.|$|R

50|$|A <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> can {{be loaded}} and {{unloaded}} {{from the top}} and the bottom. On a standard <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> there is a manhole {{and at least one}} valve on the top, and there is a valve at the bottom. Loading and unloading is done by connecting hoses of the loading and unloading facility to the valves of the tank. The loading or unloading is often done using a pump. Depending on the installation and regulation of certain products, it is determined how the <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> should be loaded or unloaded.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tank</b> <b>container,</b> {{also known}} as ISO tank, is a {{specialized}} type of container designed to carry bulk liquids, such as chemicals, liquid hydrogen, gases and foodgrade products. Both hazardous and non hazardous products can be shipped in <b>tank</b> <b>containers.</b> A standard <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> is 20 ft long, 8 ft high and 8 ft wide. The tank, which is made from stainless steel, is held within a box-shaped frame with the same shape as an intermodal container. This allows it to be carried on multiple modes of transport, such as truck, rail and ship.|$|R

The invention of the <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> revolutionized the way bulk liquids were transported, stored, and handled worldwide. It has improved safety, reduced costs and brought with it the benefits of convenience and efficiency associated with a multi-modal transport system. Invariably the invention of the drop frame chassis followed soon after to accommodate this new type of intermodal container.|$|R

40|$|Lured by {{the promise}} of bigger sales, {{companies}} are increasingly looking to raise the volume of international trade. Consequently, the amount of bulk products carried in containers and transported overseas exploded because of the flexibility and reliability of this type of transportation. However, minimizing the logistics costs arising from the container flow management across different terminals has emerged asa major problem that companies and affiliated third-party logistics firms face routinely. The empty tankcontainer allocation problem occurs in the context of intermodal distribution systems management and transportation operations carried out by logistic service provider companies. This paper considers the time-evolving supply chain system of an international logistic service provider company that transports bulk products loaded in <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> via road, rail and sea. In such system, unbalanced movements of loaded <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> forces the company to reposition empty <b>tank</b> <b>containers.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop a mathematical model that supports tactical decisions for flow management of empty <b>tank</b> <b>containers.</b> The problem involves dispatching empty <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> of various types to the meet on-time delivery requirements and repositioning the other <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> to storage facilities, depots and cleaning stations. To this aim, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) multiperiod optimization model is developed. The model is analyzed and developed step by step, and its functionality is demonstrated by conducting experiments on the network from our case study problem, within the boarders of Europe. The case study constitutes three different scenarios of empty <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> allocation. The computational experiments show that the model finds good quality solutions, and demonstrate that cost and modality improvements can be achieved in the network The sensitivity analysis employs a set of data from our case study and randomly selected data to highlight certain features of the model and provide some insights regarding the model’s behavior...|$|R

40|$|Effective {{logistics}} {{is the key}} {{to improving}} supply chain performance. <b>Tank</b> <b>containers</b> are attractive from the viewpoints of safety, cost, and environment, and are widely used for transporting fluid chemicals. Minimizing the logistics costs arising from the container flow imbalances across the globe and container cleaning is a major issue that chemical companies and affiliated third-party logistics firms face routinely. In contrast to dry containers, this important problem of managing <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> in global chemical logistics has received no attention. An innovative, event-based, pull approach is presented for the minimum-cost or the maximum-profit scheduling of the transport and cleaning of multiproduct <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> (loaded and empty) given a set of projected shipment orders. A novel linear programming formulation is developed and illustrated through examples that successfully solves large, industrially relevant problems with key practical considerations such as alternate ship schedules, delivery time windows, and intermodal transport routes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT...|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} {{to the need for}} greater improved movement of bulk liquids, <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> were invented in the mid 1960 by Bob Fossey who worked for Wiliams Fairclough in London. This first tank was a beam type designed in 1967 built onto a swap body design from Fossey in 1966. The eighties and early nineties saw two different trends. One was a quest to make the <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> both lighter and have a greater capacity. Through the following decades tanks have evolved to become a lighter and more space efficient means of transporting bulk liquids.|$|R

50|$|Over {{the next}} decade the company built up an {{impressive}} portfolio of shipping services including a liner agency, port agency, project logistics, offshore support, international freight forwarding, port representation, <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> & leasing and P&I club representation and surveying.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s. the <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> evolved {{to its current}} form and the {{production}} was also well underway. In the early days, production took place in Europe. In 2010 and afterward, production is mainly in China and South Africa.|$|R
50|$|There are {{hundreds}} of <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> operators worldwide, that can vary on the service they offer. The bigger operators typically offer {{a wide range of}} services, while smaller operators may only offer services in one region or with one type of tank.|$|R
