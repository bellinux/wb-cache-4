5|$|As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an {{advocate}} for gender equality and healthcare reform. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during <b>the</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal, which led to her issuing a statement reaffirming her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female Senator from New York. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.|$|E

Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, {{a week before the}} Obama inauguration; two days later, the Committee voted 16–1 to approve Clinton. By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65percent, the highest point since <b>the</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal.

5|$|Sorkin {{conceived}} the political drama The West Wing in 1997 {{when he went}} unprepared to a lunch with producer John Wells and in a panic pitched to Wells a series centered on the senior staff of the White House, using leftover ideas from his script for The American President. He told Wells about his visits to the White House while doing research for The American President, and they found themselves discussing public service and {{the passion of the}} people who serve. Wells took the concept and pitched it to the NBC network, but was told to wait because the facts behind <b>the</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal were breaking and there was concern that an audience {{would not be able to}} take a series about the White House seriously. When a year later some other networks started showing interest in The West Wing, NBC decided to greenlight the series despite their previous reluctance. The pilot debuted in the fall of 1999 and was produced by Warner Bros. Television.|$|E
25|$|The Drudge Report {{attained}} prominence {{when it was}} {{the first}} to report what {{came to be known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal. It published the story on 17 January 1998, alleging that Newsweek had turned down the story.|$|E

5000|$|The Private Lives of the Three Tenors is a gossip {{biography}} of tenors Plácido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti, and José Carreras by Marcia Lewis, {{the mother of}} Monica <b>Lewinsky.</b> <b>The</b> book received high-level publicity during <b>the</b> 1998 <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal, as journalists compared Lewis' [...] "hints" [...] of an affair with popular opera singer, Plácido Domingo, to Lewinsky’s then-unproven allegations against U.S. President Bill Clinton. Domingo insisted that he only knew Lewis socially.|$|R
25|$|After {{he began}} at Fox News, Hume was in discussions about {{starting}} a Washington-based television news {{program for the}} 6p.m. timeslot. <b>The</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal began during January 1998, and Hume's wife told him the story was so well known that he should start the show immediately.

25|$|The Drudge Report {{originated}} in 1995 as a weekly subscriber-based email dispatch. It {{was the first}} news source to break <b>the</b> Monica <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal to <b>the</b> public, after Newsweek decided to hold its story.|$|R

25|$|In April 1996, Lewinsky's {{superiors}} relocated {{her job to}} the Pentagon, {{because they}} {{felt that she was}} spending too much time around Clinton. According to his autobiography, then-United Nations Ambassador Bill Richardson was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Lewinsky for a job on his staff at the UN. Richardson did so, and offered her a position, which she declined. The American Spectator alleged that Richardson knew more about <b>the</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> affair than he declared to the grand jury.|$|E
25|$|Incumbent Democratic President Bill Clinton was ineligible {{to serve}} a third term due to term {{limitations}} in the 22nd Amendment of the Constitution, and Vice President Gore was able to secure the Democratic nomination with relative ease. Bush {{was seen as the}} early favorite for the Republican nomination and, despite a contentious primary battle with Senator John McCain and other candidates, secured the nomination by Super Tuesday. Bush chose former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney as his running mate, while Gore chose Senator Joe Lieberman as his. Both major party candidates focused primarily on domestic issues, such as the budget, tax relief, and reforms for federal social insurance programs, although foreign policy was not ignored. Clinton and Gore often did not campaign together, a deliberate decision resulting from <b>the</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> sex scandal two years prior.|$|E
25|$|On April 6, 2004, he was {{appointed}} dean of the Pepperdine University School of Law. He originally accepted a position at Pepperdine as the first dean of the newly created School of Public Policy in 1996; however, he withdrew from the appointment in 1998, several months after <b>the</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> controversy erupted. Critics charged {{that there was a}} conflict of interest due to substantial donations to Pepperdine from billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, a Clinton critic who funded many media outlets attacking the president. (Scaife's money, however, supported the Foster-was-murdered theory, according to CNN, and Scaife defunded The American Spectator after it endorsed Starr's conclusion of suicide and mocked a Scaife-aided book.) In 2004, some five years after President Clinton's impeachment, Starr was again offered a Pepperdine position at the School of Law and this time accepted it.|$|E

25|$|The law conferred broad investigative powers on Starr and {{the other}} {{independent}} counsels named to investigate the administration, {{including the right to}} subpoena nearly anyone who might have information relevant to the particular investigation. Starr would later receive authority to conduct additional investigations, including the firing of White House Travel Office personnel, potential political abuse of confidential FBIfiles, Madison Guaranty, Rose Law Firm, Paula Jones law suit and, most notoriously, possible perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up President Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. <b>The</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker Linda Tripp, requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they might have seen while guarding Clinton. With the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political hit man than as a prosecutor.|$|E
25|$|Historically, two doctrines {{concerning}} {{executive power}} have developed that enable {{the president to}} exercise executive power {{with a degree of}} autonomy. The first is executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution, or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Richard Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon, , that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When President Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding <b>the</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in Clinton v. Jones, , that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees, but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.|$|E
500|$|Issues that {{surrounded}} <b>the</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills; in 2014, Hillary would state {{that she and}} Bill had left the White House [...] "not only dead broke, but in debt."

500|$|In 1998, the Clintons' {{relationship}} {{became the}} subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the President had engaged in an extramarital affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Events surrounding <b>the</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal eventually led to the impeachment of the President by the House of Representatives and later acquittal by the Senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a [...] "vast right-wing conspiracy", characterizing <b>the</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies rather than any wrongdoing by her husband. She later said that she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had taken place. After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage, but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage. The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{two years}} passed. [...] Independent Counsel Starr {{continued}} his investigation. [...] Starr wanted access to notes that Vince Foster's attorney {{took in a}} conversation with Foster about the travel office affair shortly before Foster's suicide, but on June 25, 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6–3 against Starr in Swidler & Berlin v. United States, stating that attorney–client privilege extends beyond the grave. [...] In September 1998 Independent Counsel Starr released the famous Starr Report, concerning offenses that may have been committed by President Clinton as part of <b>the</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> scandal.
