40|$|Stepped block {{protection}} has considerable {{potential as}} a low-cost method {{for the construction of}} chute spillways and the protection of embankments from erosion by overtopping flow. Stepped spillways are structurally stable, resistant to water loads and significantly increase the rate of energy dissipation on the spillway face thus eliminating or greatly reducing the need for a large energy dissipation basin at the spillway toe. It can also be readily adopted for use in diversion works during dam construction and for providing additional spillway capacity to existing dams. While constructing stepped spillway over embankment dam, the stepped block is used in conjunction with an under layer which incorporates a free draining medium and a lower zone which has the function of filtering seepage flow out of the subsoil and also protecting the subsoil from erosion by flow in the draining layer. Blocks are laid in stretcher bond configuration. It is proposed to construct stepped precast concrete block spillway over the truncated embankment dam to be constructed at Jambhira in Orissa on Subarnarekha river. In the present study, model investigations are carried out to study the energy dissipation efficiency of the monolithic stepped spillway and the negative slope of the <b>toe</b> <b>wall</b> to be provided for the spillway. The stepped spillway is found to be very efficient in energy dissipation. It was observed that with the increase in discharge, the amount of energy dissipated is reducing. For additional energy dissipation, a <b>toe</b> <b>wall</b> with a negative slope of 8 to 12 is found to be suitable...|$|E
40|$|A 180 -ft-wide (54. 4 -m-wide) {{landslide}} occurred {{along the}} north side of Foxridge Drive (Mission, Kansas) in July 2001. The earthen mass had moved laterally and downward approximately 2 ft (0. 6 m). Additional movement during the following months indicated the landslide was threatening stability of the north edge of the roadway. In addition, the road was scheduled to be widened by approximately 10 ft (3. 0 m) in the near future. Therefore, repair of the slope was critical to the stability of the road and the future widening. A phased subsurface investigation revealed subsurface conditions generally consisting of fill overlying alternating layers of limestone and shale. An inclinometer was installed to monitor further slope movement and evaluate the location of the slip surface. Exploratory drilling, inclinometer monitoring, and modeling of the slope indicated the most probable slip surface was positioned at the contact between the fill and underlying shale. The landslide was likely caused by a rise in the groundwater level resulting from a wetter than normal spring. A geogrid reinforced earth system was designed to repair the slope. The base of the repair consisted of crushed rock backfill with welded-wire baskets at the face to provide an independent <b>toe</b> <b>wall.</b> The upper portion of the design section consisted of reinforced clay and crushed shale backfill.

40|$|Abstract: In July 2001 {{a series}} of severe storms with extreme rain and winds {{resulted}} in heavy flooding in West Virginia. The flooding caused damage to several roads and bridges in six counties. A significant landslide developed along a 600 -foot section of Cunard River Access Road on the New River Gorge National River creating an 85 feet high sheer face. Flood water reshaped a 27 -foot high waterfall located {{at the base of}} the slide and formed a large scour pool. Removal of material at the slope face and water flowing through the slope contributed to the slide movement. The subsurface field investigations to obtain soil and rock strength properties for the design progressed in several phases because of the difficulty accessing the unstable edge and toe of the slope. A proposed slide repair design was completed quickly and met environmental and aesthetic constraints and requirements for maintaining of public access during construction and maintaining the original alignment. The proposed slide repair design consisted of an anchored soldier pile wall at the toe of the slope and reinforced soil slope (RSS) for the embankment. The need for additional subsurface information at the toe of the slope for the design of the <b>toe</b> <b>wall</b> resulted in a third phase of field investigations.

40|$|ObjectiveProsthetic femoral-popliteal {{bypasses}} {{are performed}} {{by using an}} end-to-side anastomosis, and disease can develop at the distal end; {{this can lead to}} poor long-term patency rates. Disturbed flow characteristics are hypothesized as being a major factor in promoting disease development. The objective {{of this study was to}} propose a new prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypass graft configuration specifically engineered to reduce or eliminate certain disease-influencing factors that act on the host artery. MethodsThe proposed device contains a streamlined bifurcation toward its distal end that results in two end-to-end anastomoses, rather than the single end-to-side anastomosis in the traditional procedure. Comparisons are made between idealized representations of it and the traditional end-to-side anastomosis for specific femoral artery flow rates. Qualitative results in the form of velocity vector plots and wall shear stress contour plots are compared, and quantitative results examine the wall shear stress magnitudes and gradients along the bed and roof of each graft model. ResultsVelocity vector plots through each junction suggest that the proposed graft configuration promotes streamlined flow and helps to reduce the magnitude of flow recirculation and separation regions associated with the traditional end-to-side anastomosis. At peak velocity, the flow separation region distal to the toe is eliminated, as evidenced by the change in <b>toe</b> <b>wall</b> shear stress from âˆ’ 0. 2 Pa in the traditional anastomosis to + 0. 5 Pa in the proposed device. Normal fully developed flow occurs sooner in the distal host artery, approximately 15 mm downstream from the toe, unlike 20 mm in the conventional case. The proposed design results in reductions of up to 58 % in peak wall shear stress and 86 % in peak wall shear stress gradient during the decelerative phase of the femoral pulse in the vicinity of the artery bed below the toe. ConclusionsIn vitro tests on the proposed device suggest that the streamlined nature of blood flow through the junction does result in less disturbed hemodynamic conditions within the host artery junction. Abnormal wall shear stress magnitudes and gradients are reduced, and normal fully developed flow occurs sooner in the distal host artery. This suggests that the proposed graft may have design attributes that are relevant in the search for increased prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypass graft patency rates. A drawback of the proposed device is that significant flow recirculation and separation exist within the prosthesis itself. Clinical RelevanceThe search for a viable alternative to traditional end-to-side anastomosis for prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypass procedures is ongoing. Prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypass procedures have low long-term patency rates, and there is a need for methods that increase the life span of the procedure. Although research is progressing on a variety of different fronts, this study is significant in that it reports on in vitro tests on a potential device that may increase bypass patency. The device is simple, may be manufactured from clinically proven materials, does not require any additional training in its use, and combines attributes of end-to-side anastomoses with those of end-to-end anastomoses. In addition, the design concept behind the device, the natural bifurcation, may be relevant in other aspects of cardiovascular surgery...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis: Cyclic {{in-plane}} shear {{tests were}} conducted on six full-scale walls built from reinforced concrete masonry units and strengthened by unidirectional composite laminates. Carbon/epoxy, E-glass/epoxy and pre-cured carbon/epoxy strips were placed on one or {{both sides of the}} walls. Each wall sample was loaded with a constant axial load simulating the gravity load, and incremental cyclic lateral shear loads were applied in accordance with the Acceptance Criteria (AC- 125) of the International Code Council Evaluation Services (ICC-ES 2003). Displacements, strains and loads were continuously monitored and recorded during all tests. Evaluations of the observed strength and ductility enhancements of the strengthened wall samples are made and limitations of such retrofit methods are highlighted for design purposes. Results obtained from current tests indicated that the limit-state parameter influencing strength gain of the FRP retrofitted walls was the weak compressive strength of the masonry units, especially at the <b>wall</b> <b>toe</b> where high compression stresses exist. Despite such a premature failure caused by localized compression damage of the masonry at the <b>wall</b> <b>toe,</b> notable improvement in their behavior was achieved by applying the FRP laminates to either one or two sides of the walls. However, it should be cautioned that available theoretical models may significantly overestimate the shear enhancement in the FRP strengthened walls, if other limiting failure modes are not considered...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the performance of geogrid reinforced soil walls with panel facing using marginal backfill with and without chimney sand drain subjected to seepage. A series of centrifuge model tests were performed at 40 gravities using a 4. 5 m radius large beam centrifuge facility available at IIT Bombay. The results revealed that a geogrid reinforced soil wall with low stiffness geogrid and without any chimney drain experienced a catastrophic failure due to excess pore water pressure that developed in the reinforced and backfill zones at the onset of seepage. In comparison, a soil wall reinforced with stiff geogrid layers was found to perform effectively even at the onset of seepage. Provision of chimney sand drain effectively decreased pore water pressure not only at the <b>wall</b> <b>toe</b> but also at mid distance from <b>toe</b> of the <b>wall</b> and thereby resulted in enhancing the wall performance under the effect of seepage forces. However, a local piping failure was observed near the toe region of the wall. The observed centrifuge test results were further analysed by performing seepage and stability analyses to evaluate the effect of thickness of sand layer in a chimney drain. An increase in thickness of sand layer in chimney drain was found to improve the discharge values and thereby enhancing the factor of safety against piping near the toe region. Based on the analysis and interpretation of centrifuge test results, it can be concluded that marginal soil can be used as a backfill in reinforced soil walls provided, it has geogrid layers of adequate stiffness and/or proper chimney drain configuration.

The study {{examined}} the value of contrast echocardiography (CE) {{in the assessment of}} left ventricular (LV) wall motion in ventilated patients in comparison with transesophageal (TOE) and standard fundamental transthoracic imaging (SE). Methods. Transthoracic echocardiograms were done in 40 ventilated patients. Wall motion was evaluated using the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography on SE, CE and TOE. A visualization score was assigned on a scale of 2 - 0 for each of 16 segments. The segment was assigned a value of 2 if the segment was seen in both systole and diastole, 1 if seen only in systole or diastole, and 0 if not seen at all. A confidence score was also given for each segment with each technique (unable to evaluate; not sure; sure). The ejection fraction (EF) was estimated visually for each technique, and a confidence score was also applied to the EF. Results. Visualization score 0 was present in 6. 2 segments/patient on SE, 1. 2 on CE (P< 0. 0001) and 1. 1 on TOE (P< 0. 0001). An average of 6. 5 segments were read with surety on SE, 11. 5 on CE (P< 0. 0001) and 12. 3 on TOE (P< 0. 0001). There was no significant dierence for CE vs TOE. EF was uninterpretable in 32 % on SE, 0 % on CE (P< 0. 001) and 0 % on TOE (P< 0. 001). The EF was read with surety in 53 % of patients on SE, 88 % on CE (P< 0. 0001) and 93 % with TOE (P< 0. 0001) with no dierence for CE vs <b>TOE.</b> Thus, <b>wall</b> motion was seen with more confidence on CE and TOE.

40|$|Sustainable {{approaches}} to the construction and widening of roads and highways are essential to offset negative influences on aquatic habitat and fish passage in the fragile ecosystem of the Himalayan Mountains in northern India. Evidence is growing that the expanding, poorly designed network of roads and trails in mountain areas, without giving due considerations to natural processes such as geological processes and climatic severity, such as heavy monsoon precipitation, is {{a major cause of}} habitat fragmentation and degradation of both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. These effects have been quantified for aquatic primary producers (periphyton), aquatic benthic insects, and Snow Trout, a Himalayan teleost (Schizothorax richardsonii, Gray; Schizothoraichthys progastus, McClelland) that dwells in the upper Ganges River, following Indian National Highway 58 (NH- 58) in the mountain region of Garhwal Himalaya, India (latitude 29 degree 61 minutes - 30 degree 28 minutes N; longitude 77 degree 49 minutes - 80 degree 6 minutes E). Indian Highway 58 {{is one of the most}} important highways, is 300 -km long, and passes along the Alaknanda River (230 km), which is one of the parent streams of the Ganges (70 km) in the fragile mountain ecosystem of Garhwal Himalaya of northern India. Keeping in mind the heavy traffic on the highway, a RS 450 million (US $ 100 million) widening project was launched in 2001. The widening of Highway 58 through massive cutting of mountain slopes, the disposal of tons of the cut material downhill into the waterways in an uncontrolled manner, and the improper water management of the slopes has resulted in intensive accumulation of soil and woody debris into the aquatic ecosystem from accelerated erosion, gulling, and landslides, resulting in drastic changes in the physico-chemical and biological profile of the aquatic habitat. Detrimental effects on transparency, current velocity, conductivity, bottom-substrate composition, dissolved oxygen, periphytonic production, and the production of benthic insect communities have been documented. Feeding, spawning, and the passage of the Snow Trout cold-water fish have been degraded or destroyed. Subsequent to the widening of Highway 58, the annual gross primary production (Pg) of periphyton declined from 8771 g C m- 3 yr- 1 (96. 48 k. cal m- 3 yr- 1) to a value of 5952 g C m- 3 yr- 1 (65. 47 k cal m- 3 yr- 1), a 32 -percent decrease in aquatic habitat. The maximum biomass (standing crop) of aquatic insects declined from a mean monthly biomass of 4. 926 g m- 2 (February) to 1. 848 g m- 2, a 62 -percent decrease, and a minimum monthly mean biomass of 0. 408 g m- 2 (August) to 0. 126 g m- 2, a 69 -percent decrease. Subsequent to widening of the highway, the standing crop estimate of Snow Trout declined from a maximum mean monthly biomass of 2. 955 g m- 2 (February) to 1. 201 g m- 2, a 59 -percent decrease, and a minimum monthly mean biomass (August) of 0. 244 g m- 2 to 0. 082 g m- 2, a 66 -percent decrease. Annual productivity of Snow Trout declined from 1. 309 g m- 2 to 0. 448 g m- 2, a 66 -percent decrease. This decline is believed to have been caused by increased turbidity accompanied by a decline in depth and dissolved oxygen, accumulation of fine silt and suspended solids, a decrease in primary productivity, a decrease in general benthic-aquatic insects productivity, depletion of the food supply, and loss of cover. We have recommended the following measures to restore habitat quality and connectivity of Snow Trout: â€¢ Stream restoration and stream bank stabilization using these structures: - <b>Toe</b> <b>walls</b> - Retaining walls - Stone layers - Stone arches - Terraces â€¢ Bioengineering methods by - Planting fast-growing plant species in combination with wire netting, gravel mining, and dredging in the impacted sites - Protecting riparian vegetation - Monitoring of water quality - Enhancement of fish food reserves - Sustainable {{approaches to}} road construction and widening - Proper drainage of water-saturated mountain slopes and spring runoff during monsoon season (July-August) - Sealing of side drains against underground water penetration alongside endangered sections of the highway - Construction of check dams for protection of steep gullies and side erosion of the river bed We also recommend establishment of a strong partnership among experienced, expert â€¢ Geologists â€¢ Civil engineers â€¢ Structural engineers â€¢ Environmental biologist...|$|R
40|$|Geosynthetic {{reinforced}} soil (GRS) walls {{involve the}} use of geosynthetic reinforcement (polymer material) within the retained backfill, forming a reinforced soil block where transmission of overturning and sliding forces on the wall to the backfill occurs. Key advantages of GRS systems include the reduced need for large foundations, cost reduction (up to 50 %), lower environmental costs, faster construction and significantly improved seismic performance as observed in previous earthquakes. Design methods in New Zealand have not been well established and as a result, GRS structures {{do not have a}} uniform level of seismic and static resistance; hence involve different risks of failure. Further research is required to better understand the seismic behaviour of GRS structures to advance design practices. The experimental study of this research involved a series of twelve 1 -g shake table tests on reduced-scale (1 : 5) GRS wall models using the University of Canterbury shake-table. The seismic excitation of the models was unidirectional sinusoidal input motion with a predominant frequency of 5 Hz and 10 s duration. Seismic excitation of the model commenced at an acceleration amplitude level of 0. 1 g and was incrementally increased by 0. 1 g in subsequent excitation levels up to failure (excessive displacement of the wall panel). The wall models were 900 mm high with a full-height rigid facing panel and five layers of Microgird reinforcement (reinforcement spacing of 150 mm). The <b>wall</b> panel <b>toe</b> was founded on a rigid foundation and was free to slide. The backfill deposit was constructed from dry Albany sand to a backfill relative density, Dr = 85 % or 50 % through model vibration. The influence of GRS wall parameters such as reinforcement length and layout, backfill density and application of a 3 kPa surcharge on the backfill surface was investigated in the testing sequence. Through extensive instrumentation of the wall models, the wall facing displacements, backfill accelerations, earth pressures and reinforcement loads were recorded at the varying levels of model excitation. Additionally, backfill deformation was also measured through high-speed imaging and Geotechnical Particle Image Velocimetry (GeoPIV) analysis. The GeoPIV analysis enabled the identification of the evolution of shear strains and volumetric strains within the backfill at low strain levels before failure of the wall thus allowing interpretations to be made regarding the strain development and shear band progression within the retained backfill. Rotation about the <b>wall</b> <b>toe</b> was the predominant failure mechanism in all excitation level with sliding only significant in the last two excitation levels, resulting in a bi-linear displacement acceleration curve. An increase in acceleration amplification with increasing excitation was observed with amplification factors of up to 1. 5 recorded. Maximum seismic and static horizontal earth pressures were recorded at failure and were recorded at the <b>wall</b> <b>toe.</b> The highest reinforcement load was recorded at the lowest (deepest in the backfill) reinforcement layer with a decrease in peak load observed at failure, possibly due to pullout failure of the reinforcement layer. Conversely, peak reinforcement load was recorded at failure for the top reinforcement layer. The staggered reinforcement models exhibited greater wall stability than the uniform reinforcement models of L/H= 0. 75. However, similar critical accelerations were determined for the two wall models due to the coarseness of excitation level increments of 0. 1 g. The extended top reinforcements were found to restrict the rotational component of displacement and prevented the development of a preliminary shear band at the middle reinforcement layer, contributing positively to wall stability. Lower acceleration amplification factors were determined for the longer uniform reinforcement length models due to reduced model deformation. A greater distribution of reinforcement load towards the top two extended reinforcement layers was also observed in the staggered wall models. An increase in model backfill density was observed to result in greater wall stability than an increase in uniform reinforcement length. Greater acceleration amplification was observed in looser backfill models due to their lower model stiffness. Due to greater confinement of the reinforcement layers, greater reinforcement loads were developed in higher density wall models with less wall movement required to engage the reinforcement layers and mobilise their resistance. The application of surcharge on the backfill was observed to initially increase the wall stability due to greater normal stresses within the backfill but at greater excitation levels, the surcharge contribution to wall destabilising inertial forces outweighs its contribution to wall stability. As a result, no clear influence of surcharge on the critical acceleration of the wall models was observed. Lower acceleration amplification factors were observed for the surcharged models as the surcharge acts as a damper during excitation. The application of the surcharge also increases the magnitude of reinforcement load developed due to greater confinement and increased wall destabilising forces. The rotation of the wall panel resulted in the progressive development of shears surface with depth that extended from the backfill surface {{to the ends of the}} reinforcement (edge of the reinforced soil block). The resultant failure plane would have extended from the backfill surface to the lowest reinforcement layer before developing at the <b>toe</b> of the <b>wall,</b> forming a two-wedge failure mechanism. This is confirmed by development of failure planes at the lowest reinforcement layer (deepest with the backfill) and at the <b>wall</b> <b>toe</b> observed at the critical acceleration level. Key observations of the effect of different wall parameters from the GeoPIV results are found to be in good agreement with conclusions developed from the other forms of instrumentation. Further research is required to achieve the goal of developing seismic guidelines for GRS walls in geotechnical structures in New Zealand.

40|$|A {{series of}} dynamic shaking table {{experiments}} were {{performed at the}} Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) to investigate the seismic performance of reduced-scale reinforced soil walls constructed with different toe boundary conditions, facing panel configurations and reinforcement layouts. The models were 1 m high by 1. 4 m wide by 2. 4 m long and were constructed with a full-height rigid panel facing, a uniform sand backfill and multiple layers of polymeric geogrid reinforcement. The <b>wall</b> <b>toe</b> was constructed to simulate a perfectly hinged toe (i. e. the toe allowed to rotate only) in one series of models and an idealised sliding toe (i. e. the toe allowed to rotate and slide. horizontally) in the other series. The model walls were instrumented to measure facing panel and soil backfill lateral displacement, reinforcement strains, horizontal and vertical toe loads, and both facing and backfill acceleration response. All the models were subjected to a horizontal stepped-amplitude sinusoidal base acceleration input. The paper {{is focused on the}} experimental design, material properties, instrumentation and the interpretation of results. Selected test results are presented to illustrate typical model response features. Finally, some implications to current seismic design practice are identified with respect to magnitude and distribution of reinforcement-facing connection loads and the influence of a structural facing and restrained toe boundary condition on wall response during base excitation...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{enormous}} neuroscientific {{progress of the}} last half century, the phenomenon of consciousness remains largely a mystery. Fortunately, with respect to one large class of unanswered questions about consciousness, unraveling the mystery looks {{to be only a}} matter of time. Questions broadly relating to the information-processing side of consciousness, for example, all look eventually answerable in neuroscientific or computational terms. Such questions thus constitute what are often called the easy problems of consciousness. Although such questions may well take us decades to solve, they do not seem beyond the realm of our standard physicalist framework. Contrast such questions, however, with whatâ€™s known as the hard problem of consciousness, the problem of conscious experience. Our inner life is filled with vivid sensations of color and sound, with pulsing pains, with deeply felt emotions and moods. Consider the experience of seeing the rich hues of a peacockâ€™s plumage, of hearing the sonorous tones of a grandfather clock, of stubbing a <b>toe</b> against the <b>wall,</b> of overflowing with happiness, or of sinking deeper into an all-encompassing depression. With respect to conscious experiences such as these, it looks considerably less likely that standard scientific explanations will eventually be forthcoming. No matter how much we learn about a given neural process, it seems that we still wonâ€™t have explained how the process gives rise to this particular conscious experience â€“ o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} a simple numerical FLAC model {{that was developed}} to simulate the dynamic response of two instrumented reduced-scale model reinforced soil walls constructed on a 1 -g shaking table. The models were 1 m high by 1. 4 m wide by 2. 4 m long and were constructed with a uniform size sand backfill, a polymeric geogrid reinforcement material with appropriately scaled stiffness, and a structural full-height rigid panel facing. The <b>wall</b> <b>toe</b> was constructed to simulate a perfectly hinged toe (i. e. toe allowed to rotate only) in one model and an idealized sliding toe (i. e. toe allowed to rotate and slide horizontally) in the other. Physical and numerical models were subjected to the same stepped amplitude sinusoidal base acceleration record. The material properties of the component materials (e. g. backfill and reinforcement) were determined from independent laboratory testing (reinforcement) and by back-fitting results of a numerical FLAC model for direct shear box testing to the corresponding physical test results. A simple elastic-plastic model with Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for the sand was judged to give satisfactory agreement with measured wall results. The numerical results are also compared to closed-form solutions for reinforcement loads. In most cases predicted and closed-form solutions fall within the accuracy of measured loads based on Â± 1 standard deviation applied to physical measurements. The paper summarizes important lessons learned and implications to the seismic design and performance of geosynthetic reinforced soil walls...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the load-displacement {{response}} and displacement capacity of shear-dominated reinforced concrete walls is studied {{with the help}} of a three-parameter kinematic theory (3 PKT). The 3 PKT is a rational and efficient approach based on a three-degree-of-freedom kinematic description of the deformation patterns in cantilever walls with aspect ratios â‰¤ 3. 0. In addition to kinematics, the 3 PKT also includes equations for equilibrium and constitutive relationships for the load-bearing mechanisms in walls. The paper summarizes this approach and applies it to nine wall tests from the literature featuring a wide range of test variables. It is shown that the model captures adequately the response of both moderately short walls (aspect ratios 2. 2 - 3. 0) and squat walls (ratios 0. 33 - 0. 54). With the help of the load-bearing mechanisms predicted by the 3 PKT, it is shown that shear failures in squat walls develop due to the complex interaction between concrete crushing in the <b>toes</b> of the <b>walls</b> and aggregate interlocking along flat critical cracks. A modification to the 3 PKT is proposed to capture the effect of loading conditions on squat shear walls. With this modification, it is shown that the 3 PKT can also capture the effect of concrete stiffness, concrete compressive strength, and reinforcement ratios on the shear response of squat members. For all tests considered in this study, the 3 PKT produced an average shear strength experimental-to-predicted ratio of 1. 05 and a coefficient of variation COV= 10. 5 %. Similarly accurate predictions were obtained for the displacement capacity of the walls: an average of 0. 90 and COV= 15. 69 %. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that port facilities, and {{especially}} caisson-type quay walls, are particularly vulnerable to earthquake related hazards. Motivated by numerous observed cases where caisson-type quay walls suffered large displacement and rotation during earthquakes, an illustrative numerical analysis is presented for the response of a typical caisson-type quay wall section at Piraeus port in Greece. Utilizing the Byrne's elastoplastic constitutive model, an effective stress dynamic analysis is performed using as seismic excitation seven recorded motions of the seismic environment throughout the world. These excitations are applied to three different types of the backfill soil regarding the relative density (Dr). Primarily, the results emphasize the role of relative density and time history of excitation on the horizontal displacement and the tilt of a typical caisson-type quay wall. Supplementary results demonstrate secondary deformations of a caisson-type quay wall, like the settlement of the backfill soil and the heave of the soil surface at the sea bottom, {{in front of the}} <b>toe</b> of the <b>wall.</b> The excess pore-water pressure, positive or negative, build-up during shaking is also examined in extent, shedding light on the liquefied or non-liquefied regions of the soil profile and the ensuing deformation of the adjacent quay-wall, in sight of interaction. The numerical modeling is performed using the two-dimensional finite element program Plaxis 2 D in order to extract the results that are of our interest in this thesis, either it is the time histories of some variables or the ultimate values of others. Concluding, the main purpose of this thesis is to produce fragility functions for the aforementioned variables for each backfill soil relative density and therefore to investigate the general agreement of the numerical results of a typical caisson-type quay wall section at Piraeus port in Greece with those of different case studies throughout the world...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceArchitectural Engineering and Construction ScienceKimberly W. KramerThe term hybrid masonry {{describes}} three {{variations of}} a lateral force resisting system that utilizes masonry panels inside steel framing to resist lateral loads from wind or earthquakes. The system originates {{from the rich}} history of masonry {{in the construction industry}} and is currently used in low-rise, low-seismic, wind-governed locations within the United States. Considerable research is focused on hybrid systems to prove their validity in high-seismic applications. The three variations of hybrid masonry are known by number. Type I hybrid masonry utilizes the masonry panel as a non-load-bearing masonry shear wall. Shear loads from the diaphragm are transferred into the beam, through metal plates, and over an air gap {{to the top of the}} masonry panel. The masonry panel transfers the shear to the beam below the panel using compression at the <b>toe</b> of the <b>wall</b> and tension through the reinforcement that is welded to the beam supporting the masonry. Steel framing in this system is designed to resist all gravity loads and effects from the shear wall. Type II hybrid masonry utilizes the masonry as a load-bearing masonry shear wall. The masonry wall, which is constructed from the ground up, supports the floor live loads and dead load of the wall, as well as the lateral seismic load. Shear is transferred from the diaphragm to the steel beam and into the attached masonry panel via shear studs. The masonry panel transfers the seismic load using compression at the toe and opposite corner of the panel. Type III hybrid masonry also utilizes the masonry panel as a load-bearing masonry shear wall, but the load transfer mechanisms are more complicated since the panel is attached to the surrounding steel framing on all four sides of the panel. This study created standard building designs for hybrid systems and a standard moment frame system with masonry infill in order to evaluate the validity of Type I and II hybrid masonry. The hybrid systems were compared to the standard of a moment frame system based on constructability, design, and economics...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{the recent}} catastrophes {{associated}} with deep excavations, there is an urgent need to provide vital guidelines {{on the design of}} the construction process. To develop a simple tool for predicting ground deformation around a deep excavation construction for preliminary design and decision-making purposes, small scale centrifuge models were made to observe the complicated mechanisms involved. A newly developed actuation system, with which the construction sequences of propping could be implemented, was developed, the new procedures were proven to give more realistic initial ground conditions before excavation with minimal development of pre-excavation bending moment and wall displacement. Incremental wall deformation profiles generally followed the Oâ€™Rourke cosine bulge equation and a new deformation mechanism was proposed with respect to <b>wall</b> <b>toe</b> fixity and excavation geometry. Validation of the conservation energy principle was carried out for the undrained excavation process. The total loss of potential energy was shown to be balanced by the total work done in shearing and the total elastic energy stored in structures with an error term of 30 %. An improved mobilizable strength method (MSD) method using observed mechanistic deformation patterns was introduced to calculate the displacement profile of a multi-propped undrained excavation in soft clay. The incremental loss in potential energy associated with the formation of settlement toughs was balanced by the sum of incremental storage of elastic energy and the energy dissipation in shearing. A reasonable agreement was found between the prediction by the MSD method and the finite element results computed by an advanced MIT-E 3 model for wall displacements, ground settlement, base heave and bending moment on fixed base walls. For cases of excavations supported by floating walls, the effect of embedded wall length, depth of the stiff layer, bending stiffness of wall and excavation geometry and over-consolidation ratio of soils were found to have a influence on the maximum wall deflection. In general, the predictions fell within 30 % of the finite element computed results. A new chart Ïˆ versus normalized system stiffness was used to demonstrate that MSD could correctly capture the trend of wall displacements increasing with the ratio of excavation depth to depth of stiff layer, which could be controlled by increasing wall stiffness for very stiff wall system only. The incorporation of a simple parabolic curve quantifying small strain stiffness of soil was proven to be essential to good ground movement predictions. A new dimensionless group has been defined using the MSD concepts to analyze 110 cases of excavation. The new database can now be used to investigate the relationship between structural response ratio S and soil-structure stiffness ratio R where this is shown on log-log axes to capture the enormous range of wall stiffness between sheet-piles and thick diaphragm walls. Wall stiffness was found to have a negligible influence on the magnitude of the wall bulging displacements for deep excavation supported by fixed-based wall with stiffness ranging from sheet pile walls to ordinary reinforced concrete diaphragm walls, whereas excavations supported by floating walls were found to be influenced by wall stiffness due to the difference in deformation mechanisms...|$|R
