5|$|A {{document}} prepared on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised {{the combat}} losses incurred by the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive {{for all of}} its five corps, as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> reported the following irrecoverable losses: 222 T-34s, 89 T-70s, 12 Churchills, 8 SU-122s, 3 SU-76s, and 240 support vehicles. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T-34s, 56 T-70s, 7 Churchills, 3 SU-122s, and 3 SU-76s, with no figures for support vehicles. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> reported personnel casualties as 2,940 killed in action, 3,510 wounded in action, and 1,157 missing in action. This totals 334 irrevocable losses in tanks and self-propelled guns, with another 212 tanks and self-propelled guns under repair, and 7,607 casualties. The historian Karl-Heinz Frieser argued that the majority of these losses must have occurred on 12 July.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Theophanu kept <b>the</b> <b>document</b> until October 989, when she left for her journey to Italy and Rome, at which time it is {{believed}} she placed it in Gandersheim Abbey to preserve <b>the</b> <b>document.</b> It was discovered and published in 1700 by writer and historian Johann Georg Leuckfeld. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz {{was among the first}} to recognise the historical significance of this document, and reports on it in History of Welf. After the secularisation of Gandersheim Abbey in 1811, <b>the</b> <b>document</b> was transferred to the Göttingen State and University Library. On 4 May 1820, the archives from the abbey were delivered to the treasury of the duchy of Brunswick. In 1835, <b>the</b> <b>document</b> was transferred to the State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign <b>the</b> <b>document.</b> Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate <b>the</b> <b>document</b> later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> Killian <b>documents</b> {{controversy}} (also {{referred to}} as Memogate or Rathergate) involved six purported documents critical of U.S. President George W.

5|$|The {{originality}} of {{this document}} remains {{a matter of}} debate. Hans K. Schulze and Hans Goetting believe that <b>the</b> <b>document</b> was presented by Otto II at their wedding feast, and then given to Theophanu. Interpreter Walter Deeters says that the separations in the text act as reading aids, showing that <b>the</b> <b>document</b> {{was intended to be}} read. Diplomats Theodor von Sickel and Carlrichard Brühl believe that <b>the</b> <b>document</b> is not the original as it lacks a seal and the lines are unusually shaped.|$|E

5|$|Æthelred also {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with Ælfred, an ealdorman, where Ælfred was granted the life use of a Canterbury estate in return for bequeathing one of his estates to Canterbury after his death. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> that records this agreement is not dated, however, so it is unknown when exactly during Æthelred's episcopate <b>the</b> <b>document</b> was drawn up. Another problem for the archbishop was {{a decline in the}} abilities of the scribes at Canterbury, which is dramatically illustrated by <b>the</b> <b>document,</b> which has a number of errors and duplications. Other documents of the period show that some of the scribes had little knowledge of Latin.|$|E
5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of <b>the</b> <b>document</b> and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} contents of <b>the</b> <b>document,</b> and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that <b>the</b> <b>document</b> was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E
5|$|An {{original}} typescript of {{the laws}} signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps in 1945. It {{ended up in the}} possession of General George S. Patton, who kept it, in violation of orders that such finds should {{be turned over to the}} government. During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed it over to the Huntington Library, where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of <b>the</b> <b>document</b> in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the Skirball Cultural Center, which placed it on public display. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> was transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington in August 2010.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the vague}} {{language}} of <b>the</b> <b>document,</b> {{there has been}} much scholarly debate over how it should be interpreted. John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father, or face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There were others who were more intrinsic in their opposition to the king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of <b>the</b> <b>document,</b> in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and hopefully protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Clustering {{is related}} to data mining for {{information}} retrieval. Relevant information is retrieved quickly while doing <b>the</b> clustering of <b>documents.</b> It organizes <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> into groups; each group contains <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> of similar type content. Different clustering algorithms are used for clustering <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> such as partitioned clustering (K-means Clustering) and Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC)). This paper presents analysis of Semantic Suffix Tree Clustering (SSTC) Algorithm and other clustering techniques (K-means, AHC, and Lingo). SSTC perform the clustering and make the clusters based on synonyms shared between <b>the</b> <b>documents.</b> SSTC is faster clustering algorithm for document clustering as it is incremental...|$|R
