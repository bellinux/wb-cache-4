5|$|Later, Jan starts {{playing one}} of Frankie's CDs, but Graham <b>turns</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> {{to talk about}} money with Si and Sally. Jan takes Tamsin outside. Tamsin worries that Frankie's death is her fault because {{she asked him to}} blow up the balloon. She asks if Frankie's soul will go to Heaven, and Jan says that it will. Inside, Si, Sally and Graham argue about how to split the money they will make from the balloon. The {{argument}} gets heated after Sally argues that the fact Tamsin will soon die should preclude her from getting a share. As Graham threatens to pop the balloon, Jan reappears and chastises him. Tamsin, who is now considered neutral, takes the balloon. Graham says they should all settle down and have lunch. In the kitchen, Sally and Jan talk about Sally's work, and, in Tamsin's bedroom, Graham and Si talk about Parsons, with Si revealing that Parsons was actually unpleasant to work for. There is a loud bang from outside, and everyone goes back into the lounge, erroneously thinking that the balloon has burst. Graham and Si take the balloon to an upstairs bedroom and tuck it into a bed, while Jan turns the music back on.|$|E

50|$|It seems {{impossible}} {{to answer this}} question. It cannot be on, because I did not ever <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> on without at once <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>off.</b> <b>It</b> cannot be <b>off,</b> because I did {{in the first place}} <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> on, and thereafter I never <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>off</b> without at once <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> on.
