40|$|International audienceIn {{tolerance}} analysis, approaches {{based on}} sets of constraints (also called convex hull techniques) {{are able to}} study simultaneously all the possible extreme configurations of a mechanism when simulating manufacturing defects in its components. The accumulation of these defects can be calculated by summing and intersecting 6 -dimensional sets of constraints, i. e. polyhedra. These approaches tend to be time-consuming, however, because of the complexity resulting from manipulating sets in R 6. In this paper, polyhedra are decomposed into a bounded set (a polytope) and an unbounded set (a set of straight lines). The unbounded part of the polyhedra {{is characterized by the}} degrees of freedom of the <b>toleranced</b> <b>feature</b> or the joint. Therefore, the decomposition can be performed based on a kinematic analysis of the studied assembly using screw systems. The proposed decomposition is presented for the most common features used in geometric tolerancing. The idea behind this strategy is, instead of summing polyhedra in R 6, to sum only their underlying polytopes by isolating the unbounded part of the operands. A slider-crank mechanism is used to show the gain in computational time of the proposed method in comparison with the strategy based on complete 6 -dimensional sets of constraints...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to show through a simple {{assembly}} a method of tolerancing analysis (coherent with GPS) developed at LMécA and based on the model of clearance and deviation domains. Tolerancing is an important step in the product design because on it will depend the functionality of the mechanism its assemblibility but also its cost: manufacturing cost increases with the precision of tolerances values. In our model, each feature specification is translated into tolerance zone. This zone limits displacements of the <b>toleranced</b> <b>feature.</b> Limitations of this small displacements are expressed in a mathematical form by a 6 -polytope in a 6 dimensions space (3 rotations and 3 translations). In the same way, contact conditions in joints allow to write linear inequalities which can be translated by 6 -polytopes. Each domain is defined by a set of vertices and a system of inequalities. Considering a chosen tolerancing, the method allows to verify the mechanism assemblibility but also several functional requirements. The example of a minimal clearance requirement between two surfaces will be treated. We will show the residual clearance zone associated to these surfaces considering tolerances on parts and clearances in joints. With such a tool, the designer will be able to modify values of the tolerances and thus to reduce the manufacturing cost while guaranteeing the functionality of the mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{proposes a}} novel general {{approach}} to automatically calculate the variational parame- ters for planar or cylindrical features {{for a given}} set of tolerance specifications, according to ANSI or ISO Stan- dards. Variational parameters correspond to those directions along/around which variation, in terms of small translation and rotation, may propagate for a given feature with toler- ance specifications. A graph representation of these tolerance specifications is adopted and it is used along with screw the- ory and Davies’s laws to automatically calculate the varia- tional parameters, and then the net variational space of each <b>toleranced</b> <b>feature,</b> by capturing nominal geometries directly from a CAD environment (SolidWorks). From screw theory, twist matrices, able to capture the motion properties of any kinematic joint in mechanical assemblies, are here adopted at part level and collected for every feature-to-datum relation- ship. Davies’s laws are then recalled to put those matrices together to calculate the variational parameters. In this way, both single-datum and multi-datum tolerance specifications can be handled. The proposed approach for the automatic calculation of variational parameters could be successfully implemented in a more general expert system for design- ing mechanical assemblies where an added-value interaction could allow user to detect relationships between geometric features. In this way, the leading of activities aimed to toler- ance analysis could be accomplished both during the prelim- inary design stages and throughout the manufacturing and reviewing sessions...|$|E
