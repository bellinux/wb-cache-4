5|$|Notwithstanding {{his other}} actions, Peckham's {{relations}} with the king were generally good, and Edward sent him on a diplomatic mission to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in Wales. In 1282 he attempted to mediate between <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> and King Edward, but given that Edward would not budge on the main issues, it was a hopeless mission. In the end, Peckham excommunicated some of <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> who were resisting Edward, not unsurprising given Peckham's views of <b>the</b> <b>Welsh.</b> Peckham visited <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> dioceses {{as part of his}} tour of all his subordinate dioceses. While there, Peckham criticised <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> clergy for their unchaste lives, conspicuous consumption, and heavy drinking. He also found <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> clergy to be uneducated, although he did order a Welsh-speaking suffragan bishop to be appointed to help with pastoral duties in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield. Peckham also criticised <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> people as a whole, contrasting their pastoral economy with the farming-based economy of England, and finding <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> to be lazy and idle.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 English and Welsh breeders {{established}} a breeders' association, <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> Pony and Cob Society, {{and the first}} stud book was published in 1902. It was decided that <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> Stud Book should be separated into sections divided by type and height. Welsh Ponies were originally only classified as Section A, but in 1931, with the rising demand for riding ponies for children, Section B was added. In the first stud books, the Section B was <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> Pony of Cob Type, and <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> Cob was Section C and Section D. The upper height limit for Section D Cobs was removed in 1907 and in 1931 Sections C and D were combined as simply Section C. The current standards of Cobs as Sections C and D were finalised in 1949. Until the mid 20th century, the British War Office considered <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> Cob so valuable that they paid premiums to the best stallions. After World War II, only three stallions were registered in Section C, but numbers have since recovered.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> {{roots of}} the college {{come to the fore}} most {{prominently}} on Saint David's Day. The feast is marked by a choral Evensong in the chapel, decorated for the occasion with daffodils. The service, including music, is conducted entirely in Welsh (despite only a small minority of the choir usually being native speakers of the language). It is generally well attended by members of <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> community in Oxford. The college's annual St. David's Day Dinner traditionally culminates with the serving of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn's Pudding. The name recalls <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> politician and prominent Jacobite who attended the college early in the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Royal {{power in}} Wales was {{unevenly}} applied, {{with the country}} divided between the marcher lords along the borders, royal territories in Pembrokeshire and the more independent native Welsh lords of North Wales. John took a close interest in Wales and knew the country well, visiting every year between 1204 and 1211 and marrying his illegitimate daughter, Joan, to <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> prince Llywelyn the Great. The king used the marcher lords and the native Welsh to increase his own territory and power, striking a sequence of increasingly precise deals backed by royal military power with <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> rulers. A major royal expedition to enforce these agreements occurred in 1211, after Llywelyn attempted to exploit the instability caused by the removal of William de Braose, through <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> uprising of 1211. John's invasion, striking into <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> heartlands, was a military success. Llywelyn came to terms that included an expansion of John's power across much of Wales, albeit only temporarily.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Welsh</b> border {{situation}} remained unsettled however, and in {{the decades}} after 1250 security grew significantly worse, as <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd conducted numerous raids into English territories.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Welsh</b> crosses {{well with}} many other breeds, and has {{influenced}} the Pony of the Americas and the British Riding Pony. Many are also cross-bred with Thoroughbreds, and other horse breeds. <b>The</b> <b>Welsh</b> Pony {{has contributed to the}} founding of several other horse and pony breeds. The Morgan horse is one such breed, being in part descended from Welsh Cobs left behind by British forces {{after the end of the}} American Revolutionary War. They are crossed with Arab horses to produce riding horses, and with Thoroughbreds to produce jumpers, hunters, and eventers. Welsh mares have also been used to breed polo ponies that were agile and nimble. <b>The</b> <b>Welsh</b> Pony was used to create the Welara, a cross-breed of <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> and the Arab horse, which has been registered in America as a separate breed since 1981.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{was created}} {{the border between}} Wales and England, a border which has survived until today. It did not follow the old line of Offa's Dyke nor the eastern {{boundary}} of <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> dioceses; it excluded districts such as Oswestry and Ewias, where <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> language {{would continue to be}} spoken for centuries, districts which it would not be wholly fanciful to consider as Cambria irredenta. Yet, as the purpose of the statute was to incorporate Wales into England, the location of <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> border was irrelevant to the purposes of its framers.|$|E

50|$|Four periods are {{identified}} in <b>the</b> history of <b>Welsh,</b> with rather indistinct boundaries. The period {{immediately following the}} language's emergence from Brittonic is {{sometimes referred to as}} Primitive Welsh; this was followed by <b>the</b> Old <b>Welsh</b> period, considered to stretch {{from the beginning of the}} 9th century to the 12th century. <b>The</b> Middle <b>Welsh</b> period is considered to have lasted from then until the 14th century, when <b>the</b> Modern <b>Welsh</b> period began, which in turn divided into Early and Late Modern Welsh.|$|R
5|$|Within {{four years}} of the Battle of Hastings, England had been {{completely}} subjugated by the Normans. William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors along <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> border, the boundaries fixed only to the east. This frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie, <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> Marches, in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law. The area of the March varied as {{the fortunes of the}} Marcher Lords and <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> princes ebbed and flowed. The March of Wales, which existed for over 450 years, was abolished under the Acts of Union in 1536.|$|E
5|$|Æthelstan {{followed}} up his {{advances in the}} north by securing the recognition of <b>the</b> <b>Welsh</b> kings. For the next seven years, the record {{of events in the}} north is blank.

This absence of record means that Æthelstan's reasons for marching north against Constantine in 934 are unclear.|$|E
5|$|A {{report to}} Blaenau Gwent council in March 2008 showed that on completion, {{the project was}} more than £8.4million over the {{original}} budget. Funding came from three sources.
