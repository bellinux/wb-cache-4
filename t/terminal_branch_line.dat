5000|$|The {{first section}} of the Wehntal railway was opened between Oberglatt and Dielsdorf at May 1, 1865. It was {{operated}} by the Bülach-Regensberg-Bahn as a <b>terminal</b> <b>branch</b> <b>line</b> connecting to the main line Bülach-Zürich Oerlikon of the same company. At January 1, 1877 the Bülach-Regensberg-Bahn got bought by the Swiss Northeastern Railway (NOB), which made the acquisition to fight a possible competition by the Swiss National Railway (SNB) by providing a shorter connection between Winterhtur and Baden.|$|E
50|$|A further {{extension}} of the railway line through the Surb valley was planned since the mid-19th century, but was never realized. With this extension called Surb railway line the Wehntalbahn would have been connected in Döttingen to the Turgi-Koblenz-Waldshut railway line and would have had lost the status as a <b>terminal</b> <b>branch</b> <b>line.</b> The construction of the extension was decided 1916 by amending the Swiss federal law by paragraph SR 742.34, but the construction never started. When the amended paragraph was cancelled 1937, the government had to give in by adapting the Swiss wide ticket prices and fright fares in such a way, that all prices were evaluated if the extension would have been built. The calculation considering the virtual Surb valley railroad only ended somewhere in the seventies.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{data have}} {{demonstrated}} {{a crucial role}} for the transcription factor SRF (serum response factor) downstream of VEGF and FGF signalling during branching morphogenesis. This {{is the case for}} sprouting angiogenesis in vertebrates, axonal branching in mammals and <b>terminal</b> <b>branching</b> of the Drosophila tracheal system. However, the specific functions of SRF in these processes remain unclear. Here, we establish the relative contributions of the Drosophila homologues of FGF [Branchless (BNL) ] and SRF [Blistered (BS) ] in <b>terminal</b> tracheal <b>branching.</b> Conversely to an extended view, we show that BNL triggers <b>terminal</b> <b>branching</b> initiation in a DSRF-independent mechanism and that DSRF transcription induced by BNL signalling is required to maintain <b>terminal</b> <b>branch</b> elongation. Moreover, we report that increased and continuous FGF signalling can trigger tracheal cells to develop full-length <b>terminal</b> <b>branches</b> in the absence of DSRF transcription. Our results indicate that DSRF acts as an amplifying step to sustain the progression of <b>terminal</b> <b>branch</b> elongation even in the wild-type conditions of FGF signalling. © 2011.

40|$|Recordings {{of single}} human peroneal C-fibres and rat saphenous C-fibres confirm two {{different}} patterns of conduction at branching points. In general, an action potential (AP) arising from one <b>terminal</b> <b>branch</b> may be propagated not only centrally, but also antidromically {{into the other}} <b>branches</b> of the <b>terminal</b> arborisation. If a stimulus activates several converging branches of one unit, at each branching point only the AP arriving first from the simultaneously activated daughter branches will be propagated centrally, resetting the slower branches. However, occasionally a single electrical stimulus may evoke a double response in the parent axon. In this case, these two responses apparently originate from different <b>terminal</b> <b>branches</b> and require unidirectional conduction block to prevent the faster AP from invading and resetting the slower-conducting terminal. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} notion that when such a double response occurs, both responses immediately show additional activity-dependent slowing of the conduction velocity due to frequency increase in the parent axon (two spikes per stimulus, one from each of the two excited branches). A comparable discharge pattern in the stem axon can be induced by repetitive paired stimulation of one <b>terminal</b> <b>branch.</b> Then the slowing is induced by the doubled frequency along the whole nerve fibre including the <b>terminal</b> <b>branch.</b> Since in this case not only the stem axon, but also the <b>terminal</b> <b>branches</b> carry two spikes per pulse, activity-dependent slowing is predictably more pronounced. Unidirectional block thus provides insight into the differential amount of activity-dependent slowing (and hence postexcitatory hyperpolarisation) in the stem axon and <b>terminal</b> <b>branches</b> of cutaneous C-fibres. This comparison reveals that {{more than two-thirds of the}} slowing can be attributed to the <b>terminal</b> <b>branches,</b> since it is two- to fourfold that observed during double stimulation as compared with the unidirectional block condition. This indicates that the <b>terminal</b> <b>branches</b> are equipped with membrane proteins that are different from those of the parent axon...|$|R

40|$|Asymmetrical {{localization}} of mRNAs and localized {{protein synthesis}} {{have an important}} role in establishing and maintaining polarity in cells such as neurons or the Drosophila oocyte and in the regulation of developmental plasticity. In Drosophila a subset of highly branched cells of the respiratory system exhibits both a high degree of polarity and developmental plasticity. These tracheal cells respond to the need for oxygen in the surrounding tissue by outgrowth of branches, often at sites very distant from the nucleus. The experiments presented here are {{based on the assumption that}} some of the proteins required at the site of outgrowth are synthesized locally rather than near the nucleus. I have demonstrated that the translational and co-translational machinery is present in the <b>terminal</b> <b>branches,</b> which indicates that the conditions for localized translation to occur exist in the <b>terminal</b> <b>branches.</b> Based on this knowledge I have developed a strategy for screening for mRNAs with asymmetric subcellular localization using a technique of tagging mRNAs with GFP in vivo. With this experimental setup I have performed a pilot screen in Drosophila tracheal cells and have identified 8 candidates exhibiting specific subcellular localization in terminal tracheal cells. Analysis of this experimental strategy shows that the technique is also suitable for other cells such as neurons and oocytes. On of the candidates bitesize (btsz) was investigated to analyze its function in <b>terminal</b> <b>branch</b> development. In btsz mutants <b>terminal</b> <b>branch</b> are either absent or their numbers are reduced. Mutation in moesin, a btsz interacting partner, also shows an abnormal branching phenotype. Both Btsz and Moesin localize at the apical membrane, which surrounds the lumen of <b>terminal</b> <b>branches.</b> Taking into account that btsz together with moesin is required for organizing actin at adherens junctions in embryonic epithelial cells; I propose a model by which Btsz/Moesin regulates <b>terminal</b> <b>branch</b> development by acting as an anchor for the actin cytoskeleton on the plasma membrane surrounding the lumen in <b>terminal</b> <b>branches...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Purpose {{of current}} study was to {{describe}} the variations in the complex network of <b>terminal</b> <b>branches</b> of facial nerve in the face. The facial nerve passes through the substance of parotid gland in the plane between superficial and deep lobes. The knowledge of variation in the <b>branching</b> pattern of <b>terminal</b> <b>branches</b> {{is very important for}} surgeons to prevent the injuries which may lead to facial palsy. Methods: The present study includes fifty foetal parotid glands in 25 foetuses and 8 adult parotid glands of 4 cadavers. The glands exposed in fixed fetuses and adult cadavers, capsules removed. The superficial lobe of the gland reflected laterally and the trunk of facial nerve in the substance was observed. The divisions and <b>terminal</b> <b>branches</b> were traced. The variations in the divisions and <b>terminal</b> <b>branches,</b> loops between branches were observed and noted. Results: In the foetal specimens the facial nerve divides into 2 main divisions in 88 % of glands. The remaining 12 % foetal specimens the facial nerve divides directly into 5 <b>terminal</b> <b>branches.</b> 56 % foetal specimens show straight branching pattern, 12 %specimens show looping between zygomatic and buccal branch. In 32 % specimens the loop between upper buccal and lower buccal branches present. Multiple communications or complex pattern between two main divisions not found in this study. Conclusion: The variations noted are: In the foetal specimens the facial nerve divides into two main divisions in 88 % and in all adult specimens. In 12 % of foetal specimens direct five <b>terminal</b> <b>branches</b> are given. [Int J Res Med Sci 2015; 3 (2. 000) : 466 - 469...|$|R
