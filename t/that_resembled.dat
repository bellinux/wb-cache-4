5|$|A second {{possible}} aetosaur nest site {{is known}} from northeastern Italy. The nests are preserved as depressions in carbonate rock that are circular or horseshoe-shaped, with high ridges around the sides. They {{appear to be}} unusually complex for nests created by Triassic reptiles. Archosaur footprints were found nearby <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> aetosaurs, although they were not present in the same layer. Because the tracks were found {{so close to the}} nests, it is likely that aetosaurs built them.|$|E
5|$|Anomalocaridids, such as Anomalocaris, were {{organism}}s {{thought to}} be distantly related to the arthropods. These creatures looked quite unlike any organism living today—they had segmented exoskeletons, with lateral lobes used for swimming, typically large compound eyes, often set on stalks, and most strikingly, a pair of large, claw-like great appendages <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> headless shrimp. These appendages {{are thought to have}} passed food to the animal's mouth, which resembled a ring of sliced pineapple.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} and co-writer George Lucas {{decided to make}} the film a prequel as he did not want the Nazis to be the villains again. After three rejected plot devices, Lucas wrote a film treatment <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> the film's final storyline. Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas's collaborator on Raiders of the Lost Ark, turned down the offer to write the script, and Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz were hired as his replacements, with the screenplay partly based upon the 1939 film Gunga Din.|$|E

She meets Shiro Takaoji as a mouse, Kyoya Ootori as the Caterpillar, and Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin as twin Cheshire Cats. She seems to recognize something about all of them in her dream like the fact that the [...] "one" [...] Cheshire cat is actually the twins or that Kyoya always writes in a black notebook.

5|$|Former ACT New Zealand Member of Parliament Muriel Newman filed a {{petition}} to have New Zealand schoolchildren be protected from political indoctrination by putting provisions <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> those in the UK to the Education Act. The petition {{was in response to}} concerned parents talked with Newman after An Inconvenient Truth was shown in schools in 2007. The parents were worried that teachers were not pointing out supposed inaccuracies in the film and were not explaining differing viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E
5|$|The Fat Man and Pumpkin bombs (non-nuclear bombs <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> {{and handled}} like Fat Man) weighed over , so weight was a concern, {{even with the}} more {{powerful}} engines. Weight reduction was accomplished by removal of all gun turrets and armor plating. This work {{was done by the}} 509th Composite Group for the early Silverplate aircraft, but later models were delivered without them. These B-29s represented a significant increase in performance over the standard variants.|$|E

5|$|The Rocketeer's {{attack on}} the Nazi Zeppelin was filmed near Six Flags Magic Mountain {{amusement}} park in Valencia, California over four months through pick-ups. Remaining visual effects footage took place at ILM's headquarters in San Rafael and Hamilton Air Force Base. There, they constructed a 12ft scale model of the Zeppelin, which was photographed against matte paintings <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> 1938 Los Angeles for intercutting purposes. The Zeppelin explosion special effect alone cost $400,000.|$|E
5|$|Early {{members of}} the group often proselytized on street corners for hours, and Clarence13X's assistants led classes about the group's teachings, {{strictly}} enforcing study habits. He instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters. Once they did so, they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths. These lessons were taught in a form <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> catechisms. Rather than hold services in mosques, they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments, which were often held outdoors. Attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that Ted Swedenburg of the University of Arkansas has compared to Quaker meetings.|$|E
5|$|In 1765, Parliament {{passed the}} Stamp Act which {{required}} colonists {{to pay a}} new tax on most printed materials. News of {{the passage of the}} Stamp Act produced an uproar in the colonies. The colonial response echoed Adams's 1764 instructions. In June 1765, Otis called for a Stamp Act Congress to coordinate colonial resistance. The Virginia House of Burgesses passed a widely reprinted set of resolves against the Stamp Act <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> Adams's arguments against the Sugar Act. Adams argued that the Stamp Act was unconstitutional; he also believed that it would hurt the economy of the British Empire. He supported calls for a boycott of British goods to put pressure on Parliament to repeal the tax.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, predating Booth's attempt, WMATA {{released}} a professionally designed graphic that displayed the Silver Line on an unofficial map <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> the current version, but with thin lines. The interplay between Metro's unofficial proposal {{and those of}} other designers received attention in a number of press outlets. A poster displaying a map of similar design has been hanging in DC Councilman Jack Evans' office for a number of years, but received scant attention until 2008. Wyman, one of the original designers of the map, was confirmed as the layout specialist who would be redesigning the map by the Washington Post on June 4, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{another of}} her studies, Morgan worked with a fox breeder to {{study the effects of}} diets that {{contained}} low and normal amounts of B vitamins. The experimental group (the vitamin-restricted foxes) developed a fine, sparse gray coat <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> the fashionable fur of the silver fox. Morgan found that the foxes with normal intake of B vitamins had shiny black fur. After the experiments, a fur stole was made out of fur from both the experimental and control groups. Morgan wore the stole on at least two important occasions – her presentation of the study data in 1939 and her Garvan Medal award ceremony ten years later.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Germany, a red mineral {{was found}} in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> copper ore. However, when miners were unable to extract any copper from it, they blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), for besetting the copper. They called this ore Kupfernickel from the German Kupfer for copper. This ore is now known to be nickeline (aka niccolite), a nickel arsenide. In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt tried to extract copper from {{kupfernickel}} at a cobalt mine in the Swedish village of Los, and instead produced a white metal that he named after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral, nickel. In modern German, Kupfernickel or Kupfer-Nickel designates the alloy cupronickel.|$|E

5|$|It was in Brockville {{that the}} 21-year-old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting. In 1959, CFJR, a local radio station, hired {{him as a}} member of its news department; many of his stories, {{including}} his coverage of a local train wreck, were picked up by the CBC. By 1961, Jennings had joined the staff of CJOH-TV, then a new television station in Ottawa. When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially an interviewer and co-producer for Vue, a late-night news program. His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> that of Dick Clark, and Jennings soon found himself hosting Club Thirteen, a dance show similar to American Bandstand.|$|E
5|$|Once {{it became}} clear that the {{locomotives}} would be used further afield than the West Country, a decision was made to name the remainder after RAF squadrons, airfields, commanders and aircraft that had participated in the Battle of Britain over Kent, Surrey and Sussex. 'Battle of Britain' nameplates incorporated the name of the locomotive with the class name below, in a design <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> the wings of an aircraft. This was painted Air Force blue, though other colours were sometimes substituted for the same reasons as above. An enamelled crest of the aircraft, personality or squadron was placed below the nameplate, in the same position as the West Country class equivalent.|$|E
5|$|The American {{occupation}} in 1898 {{introduced a new}} breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters. During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by Daniel Burnham was done on the portions of the city of Manila. Part of the Burnham's plan was the construction of government buildings <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> Greek or Neoclassical architecture. In Iloilo, a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American {{occupation in}} the country can still be seen. Commercial buildings, houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in Calle Real.|$|E

5|$|The {{cluster is}} {{dominated}} by hot blue and extremely luminous stars that have formed within the last 100 million years. Dust that forms a faint reflection nebulosity around the brightest stars was thought at first to be {{left over from the}} formation of the cluster (hence the alternative name Maia Nebula after the star Maia), but is now known to be an unrelated dust cloud in the interstellar medium, through which the stars are currently passing. Computer simulations have shown that the Pleiades were probably formed from a compact configuration <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> the Orion Nebula. Astronomers estimate that the cluster will survive for about another 250 million years, after which it will disperse due to gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|The film {{shows the}} traditions {{exhibited}} by courtesans, zamindars in coaches drawn by horses, and palaces <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> 19th century architecture. The contemporary areas of Madurai and Thanjavur, especially their railway junctions, gave the film {{a sense of}} ambiguity that was then very common in Tamil cinema. The film recreated {{the manner in which}} the Devadasis were portrayed in the early 20th century, and also depicts the social conditions and the upper class milieu in Thanjavur. Real locations were mixed with the fictional town of Madhanpur, which was ruled by a king portrayed by Nambiar. The film also had undertones of the Chithirai festival.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} special effects, {{including}} smoke machines and fireworks that erupted during the show. There {{was a giant}} projection screen <b>that</b> <b>resembled</b> the magical mirror from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Also present was a mechanical magic carpet in which Spears sat and flew over the first 100 feet above the crowd. Spears, who had five costumes changes during the show, was joined on stage by eight dancers. The setlist consisted of nine songs, seven from her debut album and two unreleased songs from her then upcoming album, Oops!... I Did It Again (2000).|$|E
