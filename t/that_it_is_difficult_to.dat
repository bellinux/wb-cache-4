5|$|Holy Trinity Church on Boar Lane was {{constructed}} between 1721 and 1727, built to a design by William Etty. It is a Grade I listed building. The building {{has not changed}} much (although a new steeple was built in 1839 by R D Chantrell), but developments such as the Burton Arcade and the Leeds Shopping Plaza have been built so close <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> see the full exterior of the building as was once possible.|$|E

5|$|In the {{intervening}} months, the Ministry of Transport had withdrawn permission for further stunts to be filmed on the M40, forcing the production team {{to resort to}} alternative methods to complete the Tiger Moth sequences. The special effects department constructed a -scale model re-creation, located on the Century 21 outdoor backlot to reduce lighting discrepancies, with radio-controlled miniatures of the Tiger Moth made to replace Hughes' aircraft. Ranging from six feet (1.8m) in width to a smaller -scale for filming with the puppet characters, the replicas were unreliable and frequently crashed, but Anderson asserts that the production team successfully merged the full-sized and miniature shots so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish which aircraft is piloted by Hughes and which is remote-controlled. The scale reconstruction of the M40 bridge was aligned with a backdrop of real trees and fields to simulate the intended setting as faithfully as possible. Bad weather forced the outdoor filming to run for six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms with an {{appearance}} similar to S.lakei {{can often be}} distinguished by their associations with trees. For example, the eastern North American species S.spraguei grows in association with Eastern White Pine. The cap of S.spraguei has red fibrils on a yellow background. S.cavipes and S.ochraceoroseus always grow with Larch. S.ponderosus, which grows in mixed coniferous forests, has a gelatinous veil. Smith and Thiers note <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{tell the difference between}} the two if S.ponderosus has lost its veil, since the colors of the species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them. S.decipiens has a cap that is orangish to pink-orange with hairs or scales. S.caerulescens is a similar species in western North America; it can be distinguished by the strong blue staining that develops when the stem is injured.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, {{with so much}} of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as {{dangerous}} as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E
