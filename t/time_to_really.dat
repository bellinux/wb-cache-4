500|$|The three DVD volumes {{released}} by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania.com. In {{the review of}} the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge described the anime as [...] "something different from the norm" [...] which [...] "mixes romance and comedy quite well". However, the pacing early on is felt as being [...] "awkward" [...] which [...] "takes <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> find its rhythm". For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that [...] "the mixing of the relationships continues to be the most interesting part of the show." [...] Beveridge goes on to state [...] "the mild moments of it are tacky and bad," [...] but [...] "when it comes to the core cast of characters, it's all solid material that is very enjoyable." [...] Finally, for the third volume, Beveridge wrote that [...] "despite the issues with how the series turns in the bonus OVA episode, Kashimashi has proven to be quite a lot of fun for the situations it presented." [...] The series is seen to [...] "close out rather well," [...] and [...] "not only is it good fun but it's also an enjoyable romantic show with lots of heart and emotion." ...|$|E

She looks great in her myriad of outfits, and she can still move with the best of them. [...] It's just, well, she's almost lost in the sheer hugeness of the production around her". Jane Stevenson of Toronto Sun gave Spears's performance three out of five stars stating there was [...] "so much was going on– there were also martial artists, bicyclists, etc.– there was no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>really</b> assess Spears other than to note that she looked great. [...] She could lip-synch the words (one can assume) and strut around the stage well enough, but there was little in the way of genuine passion, joy, or excitement on her part". The Hollywood Reporters Craig Rosen claimed that [...] "in the end, Britney and company delivered an entertaining spectacle, but one couldn't help but wish that she would strip it all down and show a little more of herself". Sean Daly of St. Petersburg Times summed up all the reviews by stating, [...] "When Britney, touring behind her new Circus album, plays the Times Forum, there will be as many people rooting for her success as her failure. [...] But in the end, we're all envious and thankful, jealous and applauding. We like them/us and hate them/us for the very same reasons".|$|E

Instead of trying to humanize the beast what this film does - and, I think, rightfully so - is humanize the people. You root for them and sympathize with their plight". Cranston also joined the film because he has been a fan of Godzilla since childhood, stating, [...] "Godzilla was always my favorite monster when I was young. He was unapologetic." [...] Cranston had to wear a wig for his scenes due to finishing Breaking Bad days before filming Godzilla. Cranston was initially ready to decline the offer after being approached, assuming the film was going to be [...] "silly", however, director Edwards' passion for the film and his previous film Monsters impressed Cranston enough to read the script and join the film.
