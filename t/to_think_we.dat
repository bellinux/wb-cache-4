He added that [...] "the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are" [...] and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans [...] "represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future".|$|E
500|$|Egan said: [...] "I love {{working with}} Michael Muhney. I heard about him because {{my mom had}} watched Y before I joined. So when I told her my {{character}} {{was going to be}} mixed up with Adam, she went, 'Oh! He is so good, but so bad'". Egan said that her mother [...] "told me he was a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, it has been so much fun." [...] She said that [...] "everyone seems <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have good on-screen chemistry" [...] and that [...] "it's an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the [...] "bad guys" [...] in town." [...] Egan said Adam was Sharon's biggest supporter when Chelsea had Billy's baby and gave him up.|$|E
500|$|England {{experienced}} {{another surprise}} upset under Winterbottom's guidance in 1953 when Hungary defeated England 6–3 at Wembley Stadium. [...] Winterbottom said afterwards, [...] "...The press tended <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> would win easily, but I tried {{to point out}} that the Hungarians were actually a great side." [...] He guided England to first place in the 1954 British Home Championship, which qualified the team for the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, but saw his side knocked out in the quarter-finals, going down 4–2 against Uruguay. Four wins from four matches enabled England's qualification for the 1958 World Cup only for Winterbottom's side to fail in the group play-off stage, losing 1–0 to USSR. [...] England lost to Brazil in the quarter-final of the 1962 World Cup in Chile and, under attack from the British press, Winterbottom resigned five months later. [...] He remains the longest serving manager of England.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 1975 {{federal and}} state elections, Australia, and South Australia in particular, {{had been hit by}} a series of {{economic}} problems. The 1973 oil crisis had massively increased the cost of living, domestic industry began to erode {{due to a lack of}} cost-competitiveness, and government funds were waning. In response, the Dunstan Government sold loss-making railways to the Commonwealth and brought in new taxes to allow wage rises. The changes had unexpected consequences: inflation, already high, increased markedly, and workers were still displeased with wages. The LCL, now known as the Liberal Party, had rebuilt after internal schism and had modernised to make themselves more appealing to the public. Having called an early election, Dunstan appealed to the electorate and pushed blame onto the Whitlam Government for South Australia's problems. In a television address just days before the election, he said: [...] "My Government is being smeared and it hurts. They want you <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are to blame for Canberra's mistakes. The vote on Saturday is not for Canberra, not for Australia, but for South Australia." ...|$|E
500|$|Starr's {{wife had}} a strong aversion to insects and McCartney {{recalled}} she was once [...] "trapped in her room {{because there was a}} fly over the door." [...] Spiders, mosquitoes and flies were present at the ashram and when Starr complained to the Maharishi he was told: [...] "For people travelling in the realm of pure consciousness, flies no longer matter very much." [...] Starr found the food [...] "impossible" [...] because he was [...] "allergic to so many different things" [...] and he and his wife left India on 1 March saying [...] "I wouldn't want anyone <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> didn't like it there;" [...] they returned home [...] "because we missed the children." [...] Their departure was precheduled by one account, but premature by others. McCartney and Asher departed in mid to late March as he needed to get back to London to supervise Apple Corps and she had a theatrical commitment. When he left he told another student, [...] "I'm a new man". Alex Mardas arrived after McCartney left, either at Lennon's invitation or on his own initiative.|$|E
500|$|One direct death {{occurred}} in North Carolina; {{a young girl}} was killed when a tree fell on her Currituck County home. Throughout eastern portions of the state, trees and powerlines were downed, and {{there were reports of}} structural damage. Numerous docks, piers and bulkheads were either damaged or destroyed, including the Iron Steamer and Indian Beach piers, which both lost large sections to the strong wind and surf. Due to the winds, the Brunswick Community Hospital lost about [...] of roof and an air conditioner. The storm left about 500,000 people in the state without electric power. In some areas, vegetative and structural debris accumulated in piles several feet deep; it is reported that thick underbrush prevented the debris from traveling further inland. Wilmington [...] "turned into a disaster zone", with flooded highways, and downed trees lying across roadways. Crop, particularly tobacco, damage was extensive. According to then-governor Jim Hunt, [...] "You fly along and don't see much damage to the beach houses, and it's easy <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> didn't have much damage. But then you look at the tobacco in fields and you know the damage has been extensive." [...] The crop losses accounted for much of the overall damage. Forty-seven of those who failed to evacuate in time sought shelter in the Bald Head Island lighthouse as the worst of the storm bore down. Despite the effects, Bonnie's impact was actually less than originally predicted. Overall, property damage in the state is estimated at $240million (1998 USD), with significantly higher crop damages.|$|E

500|$|... "There's Something About Marrying" [...] was {{met with}} {{positive}} reception as well, particularly from gay rights groups. The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) was welcoming of the episode, calling it [...] "a ray of light". GLAAD executive director Joan Garry enjoyed seeing Marge's transformation, from having ambivalent feelings for her sister to then supporting her. He commented that [...] "when Marge learns that Patty's about to marry someone who isn't really a lesbian, she comes to realize that what her sister really deserves {{is to be in}} love with and married to a person who's right for her. If millions of Simpsons viewers came away from last night's episode with that little bit of moral truth, it was time well spent." [...] AfterEllen.com's David Kennerley approved of the willingness of a [...] "hit network TV show in prime time, watched by children and adults" [...] to [...] "serve up such a politically charged issue". Rick Garcia, an activist of the gay rights group Equality Illinois, said to the Chicago Tribune that the episode would likely affect society in a positive way because of the iconic status of the show which [...] "shape our attitudes". Unlike many of the conservative groups, Kennerley noted that [...] "in the show's tradition of equal-opportunity lampooning, the message is not all pro-gay. Irksome lesbian stereotypes abound, and Nelson the bully suggests they 'legalize gay funerals.' And naturally, Reverend Lovejoy shutters his church to the same-sex sinners." [...] According to Simpsons writer Mike Reiss, the episode also had supporters among conservative groups. He told Encore magazine that [...] "gay people came out very much in favor of it and were happy with the episode, but arch conservatives and right-wing Christians loved the episode, too, because they seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were making fun of gay people. We really had it both ways." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bloomberg {{supported}} {{the legalization of}} same-sex marriage in New York. Still, he appealed a decision finding the limiting of same-sex marriage {{in the state of}} New York unconstitutional. [...] "My personal opinion is that anybody should be allowed to marry anybody. I don't happen <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should put restrictions on who you should marry.... What the city doesn't want to have happen is people getting a marriage license and then six months, or one year later, or two years later, finding out it's meaningless," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, {{businessman}} Ken Myer commented; [...] "we like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have {{a distinct}} style of our own. We have outgrown {{a lot of}} our inadequacies.... There was a time when an interest in the arts threw doubts on one's masculinity." [...] In 1973, historian Geoffrey Serle, in his 1973 From Deserts the Prophets Come, argued that while Australia had finally arrived at [...] "mature nationhood," [...] until that time that the [...] "most important study of Australia had been found in creative treatments", rather than academic study at universities and schools.|$|E
2500|$|By 1984 {{public and}} Government opinion had so changed that a {{campaign}} to save the semi-derelict, but untouched by time, Calke Abbey was successful. Writing in 1992 in the Daily Telegraph, 47 years after his father wrote his melancholy novel prophesying the decline of country house life, Auberon Waugh felt confident enough of {{the survival of the}} country house as a domestic residence to declare: [...] "I would be surprised if there is any greater happiness than that provided by a game of croquet played on an English lawn through a summer's afternoon, after a good luncheon and with the prospect of a good dinner ahead. There are not that many things which the English do better than anyone else. It is encouraging <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are still holding on to a few of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing about {{attempts}} by CAMERA {{to get a}} local Pasadena, California church to cancel an appearance by Palestinian activist Reverend Naim Ateek, Rob Eshman, Editor-in-Chief of The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, wrote: [...] "I'm always leery when Jewish groups ride in {{from out of town}} to try to save us from the bad guys. We have plenty of sharp-eyed Jewish defense groups locally who can tussle on our behalf. It's just a bit condescending <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> rubes, out in America's second-largest Jewish city, don't know how and when to fight. Or whom." [...] Eshman later clarified that his criticism was directed specifically at CAMERA's handling of the Ateek visit, and not toward the organization in general. [...] "I think CAMERA, which in so many cases I find useful and correct, is in this case making things worse," [...] he wrote.|$|E
2500|$|This {{rejection}} {{was actively}} advanced by some logicians, most notably W. V. Quine. [...] Quine advanced {{the view that}} in predicate-language sentences like Fx the [...] "x" [...] is {{to be thought of}} as a variable or name denoting an object and hence can be quantified over, as in [...] "For all things, it is the case that [...] [...] [...]" [...] but the [...] "F" [...] is {{to be thought of as}} an abbreviation for an incomplete sentence, not the name of an object (not even of an abstract object like a property). [...] For example, it might mean [...] " [...] [...] [...] is a dog." [...] But it makes no sense <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can quantify over something like this. (Such a position is quite consistent with Frege's own arguments on the concept-object distinction). So to use a predicate as a variable is to have it occupy the place of a name which only individual variables should occupy. This reasoning has been rejected by Boolos.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2010 the duo's second album, Down the Way, debuted at No.1. By 2011 it was {{certified}} 3×platinum by ARIA. It was the highest-selling album by an Australian {{artist in}} 2010. Down the Way peaked in the top30 on the French Albums Chart {{and stayed in}} the top200 for 86weeks. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 the duo won 'Album of the Year' for Down the Way and 'Single of the Year' for [...] "Big Jet Plane". Their single [...] "Big Jet Plane" [...] was voted No.1 in the Triple J Hottest 100 in 2011. After a world tour promoting Down the Way, Stone and his sister parted ways, according to Stone with a [...] "tip of the hat and strolled in different directions". In a Rolling Stone (Australia) interview, Julia revealed the duo had started recording tracks for a third album, in January 2011, but shelved them indefinitely: [...] "It was too much <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> could only pick six songs each… We were both {{in a place where}} we really wanted creative space to go in whatever direction we wanted so we were like 'let’s just take a year out'". She elaborated that those songs were unlikely to be heard, but maintained the pair would reunite after their solo projects.|$|E

2500|$|McManaman {{had also}} been noted for his {{versatility}} in his free role, switching {{from right to left}} wings, and his ability to play in central midfield, behind the front pair, or as a forward, with many notable managers including then Ajax coach Louis van Gaal, describing it as a role few could pull off the way McManaman had. McManaman was credited for making the role manager Evans gave him work, with the result being that Liverpool were playing some of the most aesthetically pleasing attacking football at the time in England. McManaman was also said to have been {{one of only a handful}} of so-called [...] "talismanic" [...] players along with Eric Cantona and Gianfranco Zola in the league at the time believed to have the charisma to lift supporters from their seats each time they got the ball. Managers would deploy a man-marker specifically to follow him for an entire game, with Gianfranco Zola noting that McManaman was the player the Italian national players monitored the most. Howard Wilkinson said McManaman was [...] "virtually unstoppable" [...] at times, while then Middlesbrough manager, Bryan Robson, was quoted as saying that [...] "everyone in the Premiership knows that if you stop McManaman, you stop Liverpool". Roy Evans, attempting to diminish the attention on marking McManaman, stated, [...] "I would hate <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are no more than a one-man team." [...] German coach Berti Vogts named McManaman as one of only three Premiership players in his select European XI Team.|$|E
2500|$|More than a {{half century}} ago, Mario Bauzá {{developed}} arranging in-clave to a high art. Another name for clave is guide-pattern, and that is certainly how Bauzá related to it. Bauzá taught Tito Puente, and Puente's arrangers in turn, learned from him. The techniques were passed down {{from one generation to}} the next. It's worth noting that many of the highly educated, new generation of Cuban musicians reject the idea of 3-2/2-3 clave. Both the clave genius Dafnis Prieto, and Alain Pérez, an important innovator in timba and Cuban jazz, reject the concept. Many of the younger musicians even reject the fundamental concept of [...] "clave rules." [...] Pérez states: [...] "I just don't treat the clave as a study or a profound analysis conceived around where it overlaps and where it comes in. I didn't learn it in that way" [...] (2002: web). New York-based Bobby Sanabria laments the pervasiveness of this attitude in Cuba: [...] "The lack of clave consciousness in Cuba is starting to be felt more and more where the rhythmic equilibrium established by the clave direction is being sacrificed due to lack of knowledge in how to work with it from an arranging standpoint by young arrangers especially in the timba movement" [...] (2010: 251). Perhaps Juan Formell, founder of Los Van Van, summed up this contemporary Cuban clave attitude best when he said: [...] "We Cubans like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have clave license [...] [...] [...] and we don't feel obsessed about the clave as many others do" [...] (1999: 16). There is currently a [...] "clave schism" [...] between these two schools of thought.|$|E
