5|$|In 1976, {{the court}} heard the {{original}} proceedings in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, {{a case that}} challenged several Missouri state regulations regarding abortion.

50|$|Present-Canadian {{women in}} the {{majority}} of major cities have the right to and access <b>to</b> an <b>abortion.</b> Women living in rural areas are still having issues with access <b>to</b> <b>abortions.</b> Medicare now covers abortions in hospitals, but several provinces still refuse <b>to</b> provide <b>abortion</b> services in clinics.|$|R

5|$|As an {{economic}} conservative, Kemp advocated low taxes and supply-side policies during his political career. His positions spanned the social spectrum, ranging from his conservative opposition <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> to his more libertarian stances advocating immigration reform. As {{a proponent of}} both Chicago school and supply-side economics, he is notable as an influence upon the Reagan agenda and {{the architect of the}} Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which is known as the Kemp–Roth tax cut.|$|E
5|$|Abortion is the {{intentional}} termination of pregnancy, {{as compared to}} spontaneous termination (miscarriage). Abortion is closely allied to contraception in terms of women's control and regulation of their reproduction, and is often subject to similar cultural, religious, legislative and economic constraints. Where access to contraception is limited, women turn <b>to</b> <b>abortion.</b> Consequently, abortion rates {{may be used to}} estimate unmet needs for contraception. However the available procedures have carried great risk for women throughout most of history, and still do in the developing world, or where legal restrictions force women to seek clandestine facilities. Access to safe legal abortion places undue burdens on lower socioeconomic groups and in jurisdictions that create significant barriers. These issues have frequently been the subject of political and feminist campaigns where differing viewpoints pit health against moral values.|$|E
50|$|Women on Web's goal is <b>to</b> prevent unsafe <b>abortion</b> {{and reduce}} {{mortality}} rate due <b>to</b> unsafe <b>abortions</b> by supporting access <b>to</b> safe medical <b>abortion</b> {{through use of}} telemedicine.|$|R

5|$|After {{the general}} {{election}} in November 1982, the incoming Michigan governor, James Blanchard, appointed Mansour in December to the directorship of the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS); Michigan's biggest agency. The administrative position involved oversight of public health programs including disbursement of some $5million in federal monies from Medicaid for abortions. To accept the appointment, she asked for and received permission from her order and from Szoka. Szoka asked Mansour to publicly state her opposition to abortion; he said he originally gave his approval on this condition. Mansour did not follow his request. Though she personally disapproved of abortion, she knew that many others felt differently, and she determined that the poor should have equal access <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> {{as long as it}} was legal.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{there were}} 87 million {{unwanted}} pregnancies in 2005, of those 46 million resorted <b>to</b> <b>abortion,</b> of which 18 million were considered unsafe, resulting in 68,000 deaths. The {{majority of these}} deaths occurred in the developing world. The United Nations considers these avoidable with access to safe abortion and post-abortion care. While abortion rates have fallen in developed countries, but not in developing countries. Between 2010–2014 there were 35 abortions per 1000 women aged 15–44, a total of 56 million abortions per year. The United nations has prepared recommendations for health care workers to provide more accessible and safe abortion and post-abortion care. An inherent part of post-abortion care involves provision of adequate contraception.|$|E
5|$|Hentoff {{was known}} as a civil libertarian, free speech activist, anti-death penalty advocate, and anti-abortion advocate. He {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the State of Israel. Hentoff espoused generally liberal views on domestic policy and civil liberties, but in the 1980s, he began articulating more socially conservative positions—opposition <b>to</b> <b>abortion,</b> voluntary euthanasia, and the selective medical treatment of severely disabled infants. Hentoff argued that a consistent life ethic should be the viewpoint of a genuine civil libertarian, arguing that all human rights are at risk when the rights of any one group of people are diminished, that human rights are interconnected, and people deny others' human rights at their peril.|$|E
25|$|Pro-life activist groups {{varied in}} their responses. Some praised O'Malley's decision, but others {{continued}} to object that Caritas, {{as a participant}} in CommonwealthCare, is still required, even as it refuses <b>to</b> provide <b>abortions,</b> <b>to</b> engage in <b>abortion</b> referrals.|$|R
50|$|Lucio was {{the only}} Democrat in the Texas Senate to support the 2013 {{legislation}} <b>to</b> restrict <b>abortions</b> <b>to</b> twenty weeks of gestation and <b>to</b> require <b>abortions</b> be performed in surgical centers.

5|$|Progressive {{politics}} {{have been particularly}} strong in municipal government since the 1960s. Voters approved charter amendments that have lessened the penalties for possession of marijuana (1974), and that aim to protect access <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan (1990). In 1974, Kathy Kozachenko's victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country's first openly homosexual candidate to win public office. In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use instant-runoff voting for a mayoral race. Adopted through a ballot initiative sponsored by the local Human Rights Party, which feared a splintering of the liberal vote, the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election. As of May 2016, Democrats hold the mayorship and nine out of the ten council seats. Nationally, Ann Arbor is located in Michigan's 12th congressional district, represented by Democrat Debbie Dingell.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} privacy is not {{explicitly}} identified in the U.S. Constitution, but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive 1961 Poe v. Ullman case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), {{and this time the}} Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position, and formally declared a {{right to privacy}}. The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate anti-abortion laws starting in 1964, a year before Griswold was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the right <b>to</b> <b>abortion</b> as a policy. The ACLU led the defense in United States v. Vuitch which expanded the right of physicians to determine when abortions were necessary. These efforts culminated {{in one of the most}} controversial Supreme Court decisions of all time, Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy. The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on interracial marriage, in the case of Loving v. Virginia (1967).|$|E

25|$|Russia was {{the first}} country <b>to</b> legalise <b>abortions</b> and offer free medical care in state {{hospitals}} to do so.

The Bolsheviks legalised abortion in November 1920. This {{was the first}} time in world history that women had won the right <b>to</b> free <b>abortions</b> in state hospitals.|$|R
50|$|A January 2013 Sunday Times/Behaviour and Attitudes poll of 916 voters {{found that}} 87% would support {{legislation}} <b>to</b> provide <b>abortion</b> where the woman's {{life was in}} danger {{for reasons other than}} threat of suicide, 80% would support legislation <b>to</b> provide <b>abortion</b> where there was a foetal abnormality meaning the baby could not survive outside of the womb, 74% would support legislation <b>to</b> provide <b>abortion</b> where the pregnancy was a result of rape, and 59% would support legislation <b>to</b> provide <b>abortion</b> where the woman displayed suicidal feelings. Overall, 92% supported allowing abortion in one of these four circumstances, while 51% supported allowing abortion in all four circumstances.|$|R
