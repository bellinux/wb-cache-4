25|$|Mary Barnett {{fell ill}} in 1930 and was {{confined}} to a wheel chair. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> of Wharetiki House were replaced with a lift at that stage, {{so that she could}} move around the house.|$|E
25|$|The Kitchen Chamber {{is where}} the {{servants}} slept and food was stored. It is unpanelled and has no ceiling. Its position next to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> and above the kitchen made it accessible to the servants. Many local houses used their kitchen chambers for storage. In 1611 it had five arks for storing meal and grain. Today it has one great ark {{and a collection of}} food chests. Lack of a fireplace and unpanelled walls would have made it cold in winter, although warmth from the kitchen below would keep the stored food dry.|$|E
25|$|Mary Barnett's {{father died}} in 1908 and her mother Margaret, {{together}} with her second youngest son Bill, moved to Christchurch to live at Wharetiki, too. Margaret Whelan lived there {{for the rest of}} her life and she died at Wharetiki in 1926. Mary Barnett fell ill in 1930 and was confined to a wheel chair. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> of Wharetiki House were replaced with a lift at that stage, so that she could move around the house. Mary Barnett died on 1 March 1931 at Wharetiki, aged 66. Matthew Barnett died on 28 January 1935, aged 75, also at Wharetiki. He was buried next to his wife the following day.|$|E

50|$|After {{the tragedy}} of 1934 {{membership}} suffered and {{it was decided to}} build a new chapter house. The house was demolished soon and the current building was constructed in 1940. The only part of the original building that remains is part of the basement that leads to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stair</b> and contains <b>the</b> laundry room, called Appalachia.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 28: Spottiswoode says, {{the king}} awaited this charge with firmness; but Birrell avers, that he fled upon the gallop. The same author, {{instead of the}} firm deportment of James, when seized by Bothwell, {{describes}} [...] "the king's majestie as flying down <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stair,</b> with his breeches in his hand, in great fear."--Birrell, apud Dalyell, p. 30. Such is the difference betwixt the narrative of the courtly archbishop, {{and that of the}} presbyterian burgess of Edinburgh.] ...|$|R
500|$|The design, like Pratt's {{other large}} country house Horseheath Manor in Cambridgeshire, was much {{influenced}} by Chevening. Like that house, the hall is two storeys high, though the great stair {{has been moved}} from {{the centre of the}} house" [...] Instead the great stair and <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> are situated symmetrically {{on either side of the}} hall, on the main long axis of the house.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976 Tina Turner was {{scheduled}} to perform at the Statler Hilton. It was from here she left her abusive husband, Ike Turner, for good. As he slept in their suite, Tina sneaked down <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> [...] "with a Mobil credit card and thirty-six cents." [...] She then walked to the nearby Ramada Inn Plaza Hotel for safety.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally the Parisian {{apartment}} had {{a kitchen}} {{at the back}} overlooking a service yard, with food carried through a corridor to {{the room where the}} family ate. Experiment in the inter-war period led to new post-war designs in which the kitchen was moved near to the apartment's entrance, close to the living and dining room. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> disappeared. Water, electricity, gas and sewage were now integrated into the design of buildings. The kitchen was relatively small, with a layout designed to let the housewife perform different tasks without moving. The SAM {{played an important role in}} introducing these innovations. In Marcel Gascoin's 8-piece [...] "Logis 1949" [...] display the kitchen played a central role and followed the ergonomic principles spelled out by Paulette Bernège in the inter-war period.|$|E
60|$|The man ushered {{him across}} the hall and threw {{open the door of}} the little room at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Large, {{traditional}} {{houses were}} frequently designed with two stairs: a formal front stairway {{for use by}} the family and guests and a utilitarian <b>back</b> <b>stair</b> for use by household staff. The combination stair is a T-shaped compromise design popular in the nineteenth century that was found in some moderate-sized houses. [...] In this design, both the formal front <b>stair</b> and <b>the</b> utilitarian <b>back</b> <b>stair</b> ran to a common intermediate landing. [...] One common stair then extended from this intermediate landing to {{the second floor of the}} house.|$|R
5|$|On 27 December 2016 Gascoigne was hospitalised {{with head}} {{injuries}} including broken teeth after being kicked in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> down <b>stairs</b> in a London hotel, where he allegedly made racist remarks {{according to a}} witness. In July 2017 his assailant was jailed for 23 weeks and ordered to pay £7,800 compensation.|$|R
2500|$|He {{seems to}} have been an amiable figure, entirely devoted to Louis, who in turn trusted him as he did few others. [...] He was twelve years older than the King. [...] He was one of a small handful of {{witnesses}} to the secret second marriage of Louis to Madame de Maintenon. Saint-Simon speaks of [...] "royal coaches (the kind without armorial bearings on the harness, such as Bontemps used for the King's private missions)" [...] and says that [...] "all the secret orders, the private audiences, the sealed letters to and from the King, in fact all the mysteries passed through his hands". [...] Saint-Simon anecdotes have him arranging the marriage to an obscure country nobleman of an illegitimate daughter of Louis who, unlike many, he did not choose to acknowledge officially, and, in Louis's earlier years, leading a minor mistress enveloped in a cloak up <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> to the King's study for her assignation; the king having put the key {{on the outside of the}} door.|$|E
2500|$|The Kitchen was {{originally}} in the North pavilion. The concept of placing kitchens {{in a separate}} block to the house (and dining room) was a practice which had begun in the 1680s to prevent kitchen smells pervading the main house. Thus, Palladio's idea of a villa flanked by pavilions (intended to house farm animals) suited this practice admirably. However, the need for symmetry meant a balancing second pavilion was required. Therefore, it was common, as at Blenheim Palace, for the kitchen to be balanced by a chapel or an orangery, or for the less spiritual, a brewery or, as at a Basildon, a laundry. This meant that at Basildon, hot food [...] "en route" [...] {{to the dining room}} had to cross an open courtyard in all weathers, be taken through the ground floor of the mansion up <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs,</b> cross the second floor and then be laid behind a colonnaded screen in the dining room before being finally served. During the modernisations at Basildon in the 1950s, Lady Iliffe had a new and state of the art kitchen installed on the piano nobile in the former bedroom allotted to former ladies of the house (12 on first floor plan). This solved the problem of hot food. Interestingly, the new kitchen is now open to the public as a nostalgic 1950s set museum piece, containing kitchen appliances and food stuffs and packaging contemporary to the mid 20th century. This is shown in the same fashion as the remainder of the house.|$|E
60|$|Down <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> came Katherine {{with her}} smile like sunrise on Gweebarra Bay.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{she heard}} the door shut to behind her, she ran up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>back</b> to her own room with all speed, like a frightened hare.|$|R
60|$|This {{will explain}} pretty clearly, I flatter myself, the game I was playing; and, though some rigid moralist may object to its propriety, I say that {{anything}} is fair in love, and that men so poor as myself can't afford to be squeamish about their means of getting on in life. The great and rich are welcomed, smiling, up the grand staircase of the world; the poor but aspiring must clamber up the wall, or push and struggle up <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stair,</b> or, PARDI, crawl through any of the conduits of the house, never mind how foul and narrow, {{that lead to the}} top. The unambitious sluggard pretends that the eminence is not worth attaining, declines altogether the struggle, and calls himself a philosopher. I say he is a poor-spirited coward. What is life good for but for honour? and that is so indispensable, that we should attain it anyhow.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were so many}} tears by that time, and Mrs. Evelyn felt so much shaken, {{that she}} made the signal for {{breaking}} up. No one was more relieved than Barbara. She must go to her room to compose herself before she could bear a word from any one, {{and as soon as}} she could gain <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stair,</b> she gathered up her heavy white silk and dashed up, rushing along the gallery so blinded by tears under her veil that she would have had a collision if a hand had not been put out as some one drew aside to let her fly past if she wished; but as the mechanical [...] "beg pardon" [...] was exchanged, she knew Fordham's voice and paused. [...] "I was going to look after the wounded Friar," [...] he said, and then he saw her tearful eyes, and she exclaimed, [...] "I could not help it! I could not stay. You would say such things. O, Duke! Duke!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I came up <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs.</b> I {{was just}} {{coming through the}} {{corridor}} when I heard the noise and came {{to see what it}} meant." ...|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes later}} Jeanne walked unnoticed down <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> of the house, {{and out into}} the street. She turned into Piccadilly and entered a bus.|$|E
60|$|In {{about ten}} minutes they {{returned}} to the house by a circuitous route, entering at the rear. Bathsheba glided up <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> to a disused attic, and her companion followed.|$|E
5000|$|Arriving in Akron, Ohio {{during the}} early 1900s, Rosario {{operated}} a successful general goods store (a front he used as a legitimate business as he soon began criminal operations in two backrooms of his store). Living above his store, Rosario claimed his home was [...] "police proof", as the property was guarded by an extensive security system including alarms on both <b>the</b> front and <b>back</b> <b>stairs,</b> pits built into the stairs which held foot-long steel spikes, a solid steel door, and a large arsenal of weapons including shotguns, rifles, pistols, and submachine guns.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} is reached via an {{internal}} and original timber staircase at {{the northwest corner}} of the building, which now is accessed only from the front street. The upper floor has been gutted and refurbished as office space not associated with the bank on the ground floor, hence the alterations to create a separate entrance. There is a set of external timber <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> leading from <b>the</b> first floor to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> yard, at <b>the</b> original northeast corner of the building.|$|R
60|$|Tom {{led the way}} up a <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> and to <b>the</b> room {{occupied}} {{that term}} by Tubbs and some other students. They met the dudish student, half dressed, going to the lavatory to wash up.|$|R
60|$|Stealing {{out of the}} greenhouse, she ran back, {{with her}} brain busily at work. Madge was waiting where she had left her. Together they crept up <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> and into Madge's room.|$|E
60|$|When Eliza Parsons had {{disappeared}} down <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> Beth drew {{a long breath}} and approached Tom Gates, who still stood by the wall staring {{at the place where}} the girl {{had disappeared}}.|$|E
60|$|With {{a parting}} kick at Dick he rushed down <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> to the resort, and {{unlocked}} the door. Taking care that Powell should not see him, he darted into the gathering darkness.|$|E
50|$|As rescuers {{search for}} {{residents}} unaccounted for, Danny, Arthur and Stacey volunteer {{to search for}} Mrs. Smiley, who is trapped in her roofless house, to the reluctant allowance of Linda, who takes Ryan and boards a bus to a local shelter. The three go to rescue Belle from the basement, using her kitchen table to navigate to her amid <b>the</b> partially collapsed <b>back</b> <b>stairs,</b> after Dan and Arthur find her asleep on a sofa, which they use as a makeshift ladder to get her and themselves out the window with Stacey helping them from outside. Danny exhibits more worry when a firefighter informs him that tornadoes were reported near Phillips, where his dad and grandparents are. As Dan, Stacey and Arthur are transported by police car with other evacuees to the Kmart on South Locust Street (one of the few buildings that escaped damage {{from one of the}} tornadoes that hit the business district), Danny struggles {{to find out what happened}} to the Hatch farm in Phillips, when he hears a message on the two-way radio that Meves Bowl was struck. Shortly after, the police car experiences a close call, when another tornado touches down and cuts through their path; Officer Kelly - who begins to lose his vision after the car's windows shatter, spraying his eyes with flying glass - then asks Dan to help him steer the car to the Grand Island Police Department headquarters, eventually letting Danny take over driving.|$|R
50|$|Stepney is {{the final}} resting place, the Guide says, of the chef who dies {{forgotten}} and alone among his cats in a <b>back</b> <b>stair,</b> whose memorial is those plastic pins {{in the shape of}} a chef's hat found in pub sausages. In So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish.|$|R
60|$|The {{three boys}} {{could not leave}} the {{dormitory}} until the monitor, Jim Murphy, had made the rounds and seen to it that all was right for the night and the lights put out. Then they stole {{out into the hallway}} and down a <b>back</b> <b>stairs.</b> Soon they were out of the building and making for Farmer Cadmore's place.|$|R
60|$|There {{was no time}} {{to think}} long, for the sleep-walker was already {{descending}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> slowly and noiselessly. Dave hurried into the dormitory, set down the pitcher, and aroused Roger, who was nearest to him.|$|E
60|$|After dinner Jordan {{crept up}} {{by way of}} <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs</b> to see her. Aunty Nan was lying with her {{eyes fixed on the}} pale pink {{climbing}} roses that nodded about the window. When she saw Jordan she smiled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was so {{startled by}} the {{discovery}} that I ran out with the nightgown in my hand, and made for <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>stairs,</b> and locked myself into my own room, {{to look at it}} in a place where nobody could intrude and interrupt me.|$|E
60|$|He {{led the way}} to {{an alley}} halfway down the block. This ran {{to the rear of the}} tavern, where there was a door {{communicating}} with a hallway and a <b>back</b> <b>stairs.</b> Under <b>the</b> stairs was a closet filled with discarded cooking utensils. The closet had two doors, one opening into a drinking-room behind the main bar-room of the tavern.|$|R
50|$|When {{he discovers}} {{he can see}} into the {{apartment}} of a beautiful, mysterious woman from his own <b>back</b> <b>stairs,</b> Francis cannot stop watching her, even after he meets her and they become romantically involved. Unable or unwilling {{to believe that she}} could actually love him, he becomes ever more obsessive in his voyeurism. And it is what Francis sees - or thinks he sees - that leads ultimately to his undoing.|$|R
60|$|Fontaine's grand staircase, {{with its}} arches, and painted {{ceilings}} and shining Doric columns, leads {{directly to the}} gallery; but it is thought too fine for working days, and is only opened for the public entrance on Sabbath. A little <b>back</b> <b>stair</b> (leading from a court, in which stand numerous bas-reliefs, and a solemn sphinx, of polished granite,) is the common entry for students and others, who, during the week, enter the gallery.|$|R
