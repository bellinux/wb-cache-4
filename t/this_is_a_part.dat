25|$|After the Flood of 1997, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{recommended}} against replacing residential {{or business}} {{development in the}} floodplain. The land {{on both sides of}} the river was developed as a park and state recreation area, known as the Red River State Recreation Area. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. It provides a place for residents to enjoy recreation near the river, as well as protecting the cities. The trees and greenery in this zone can help absorb future seasonal flooding. In the northern part of town is a private golf course, Valley Golf Course.|$|E
25|$|Tishomingo State Park offers {{visitors}} seven {{hiking trails}} that range in length from ¾ to 3 miles and in difficulty from easy to moderate. The trails feature beautiful scenery, including natural springs, waterfalls, rocky creeks and streams, cliffs, rock walls and huge outcrops. The terrain suggests mountains, and indeed <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the Appalachian range, but the hills here are {{no higher than}} about 660 feet. Rock climbing, which requires a helmet and a free permit (available at the park office), is a popular activity on the trails, particularly at the formation known as Jean's Overhang. Bear Creek is encountered {{at a number of}} points by the trail system, and can itself be explored by canoe on one of the float trips offered here.|$|E

2500|$|Shifting identities (cf. [...] "the {{theme of}} identity") makes the past ambiguous: Goldberg is called [...] "Nat," [...] {{but in his}} stories of the past {{he says that he}} was called [...] "Simey" [...] (73) and also [...] "Benny" [...] (92), and he refers to McCann as both [...] "Dermot" [...] (in talking to Petey [...] ) and [...] "Seamus" [...] (in talking to McCann [...] ). Given such contradictions, these characters' actual names and thus identities remain unclear. According to John Russell Brown (94), [...] "Falsehoods are {{important}} for Pinter's dialogue, not least when they can be detected only by careful reference from one scene to another.... Some of the more blatant lies are so casually delivered that the audience is encouraged to look for more than is going to be disclosed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of Pinter's two-pronged tactic of awakening the audience's desire for verification and repeatedly disappointing this desire" [...] (Brown 94).|$|E
2500|$|In Indonesia, {{religious}} conflicts {{have typically}} occurred in Western New Guinea, Maluku (particularly Ambon), and Sulawesi. The presence of Muslims in these traditionally Christian regions {{is in part}} {{a result of the}} transmigrasi program of population re-distribution. Conflicts have often occurred because of the aims of radical Islamist organizations such as Jemaah Islamiah or Laskar Jihad to impose Sharia, with such groups attacking Christians and destroying over 600 churches. In 2005 three Christian girls were beheaded as retaliation for previous Muslim deaths in Christian-Muslim rioting. The men were imprisoned for the murders, including Jemaah Islamiyah's district ringleader Hasanuddin. On going to jail, Hasanuddin said, [...] "It's not a problem (if I am being sentenced to prison), because <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of our struggle." [...] Later in November 2011, another fight between Christians against Muslims happen in Ambon. Radical Islamists allegedly set fire to several Christian houses, forcing the occupants to leave the buildings.|$|E

2500|$|In most shrines it is {{considered}} a duty of the shrine slaves to have obligatory sex with the priest and sometimes the elders. [...] The priest's genital organs have been dedicated to the gods of the shrine, so having sex with him {{is considered}} a sacred act—in a sense, copulating with the gods. [...] This is the origin and {{meaning of the term}} [...] "wives of the gods." [...] Many trokosi and vudusi have described beatings and other severe punishments imposed on them for refusing sex with the priest. [...] In Ghana, human rights organizations monitoring the practice of [...] "trokosi" [...] claim that shrine slaves often end up with an average of four children while in servitude, many of them by the priest or elders of the shrines. [...] Proponents of ritual servitude deny that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the practice. [...] There seem to be wide differences between practices in different districts, but Rouster claims that the problem of forced sex in many of the shrines is too well documented to be disputed.|$|E
2500|$|Oklahoma and {{southern}} US plains: [...] Before recorded history American Indians {{in this area}} used songs and instrumentation; music and dance remain the core of ceremonial and social activities. [...] "Stomp dance" [...] remains at its core, a call and response form; instrumentation is provided by rattles or shackles worn on the legs of women. [...] "Other southeastern nations have their own complexes of sacred and social songs, including those for animal dances and friendship dances, and songs that accompany stickball games. [...] Central {{to the music of}} the southern Plains Indians is the drum, which has been called the heartbeat of Plains Indian music. Most of that genre {{can be traced back to}} activities of hunting and warfare, upon which plains culture was based." [...] The drum is central to the music of the southern plains Indians. During the reservation period, they used music to relieve boredom. Neighbors gathered, exchanged and created songs and dances; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the roots of the modern intertribal powwow. Another common instrument is the courting flute.|$|E
2500|$|A direct {{comparison}} is difficult since cricket is predominantly played {{in three different}} formats: Test (and other first-class matches), One Day (50 over/List A matches) and Twenty20. Of these, the Twenty20 format takes much {{the same time as}} a baseball game: around three to three-and-a-half hours. Baseball games are generally much shorter than Test and One Day cricket games. Most Major League Baseball games last between two-and-a-half and four-and-a-half hours. Because the Major League playing season is 6 months long (183 days, between April and October with Spring training in February and March), with 81 games played at home and 81 away (162 in all, not counting the postseason or the All-Star Game), baseball teams often find themselves playing double-headers and series games. A doubleheader entails two games, played back to back, in one day. This usually occurs when a game needed to be rescheduled, and is a common occurrence {{at the beginning of the}} Major League season, which coincides with the rainy Spring season. Although they were once common, double-headers are rarely scheduled any more by teams, but are part of the culture of baseball, with Ernie Banks' [...] "Let's play two" [...] a famous refrain. A series occurs when two teams play on several consecutive days. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the regular schedule in baseball because of the number of games required in a season, and because there are large distances between stadiums in the US and Canada, thus conserving time and resources by allowing the teams to spend several days in a single location. In Major League Baseball there is a maximum of 20 days consecutively played before a break in games must be observed.|$|E

It is the personal conflicts between bodies of men of different nations. Does his majesty engage in these conflicts? Certainly not. The war is maintained by taxes. Does his majesty pay them? No. Thus we see that while the war is constitutionally the king's, it is practically the people's. It follows, as a corollary--since you quote corollaries, brother Downright--that there are two wars--or the war of the prerogative, and the war of the fact. Now, the prerogative is a constitutional principle--a very sacred one, certainly--but a fact is a thing that comes home to every monikin's fireside; and therefore the courts have decided, ever since the reign of Timid II., or ever since they dared, that the prerogative was one thing, and the law another." ...|$|E
