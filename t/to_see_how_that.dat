5|$|The first {{director}} approached to helm the production by Michael Wearing was Danny Boyle. Boyle was keen to direct all nine episodes, but Pattinson believed that one director {{taking charge of}} the entire serial would be too punishing a schedule for whomever was chosen. Boyle had recently completed work on the feature film Shallow Grave and wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> film was received before committing to Our Friends in the North. When Shallow Grave {{proved to be a}} critical success, Boyle was able to enter pre-production on Trainspotting. He withdrew from Our Friends in the North. Sir Peter Hall was also briefly considered, but he too had other production commitments.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} script for [...] "Subway", Yoshimura wanted the Pembleton {{character}} to be confronted with his own mortality, a theme that had continued from the previous season in which the character suffered a stroke. Although Pembleton does not typically discuss his own feelings, Yoshimura {{wanted him to be}} placed in a situation in which he not only discussed death, but is also led by the unique circumstance of Lange's subway incident to confide his stroke experience to an almost complete stranger. From the beginning of the writing process, Yoshimura specifically wanted the Lange character to be mean and unpleasant, rather than the nice and innocent victim more typically portrayed in such television episodes: [...] "Tragedy can happen to jerky people too and I think it'd be much more interesting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> kind of character's circumstances transcends the typical cliched TV kind of victim." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{meantime}} Buick succeeded in repairing the 11 Platoon radio, {{and was able}} to re-establish communications with Company Headquarters, and with Stanley, who was again able to adjust the artillery by radio. Yet the Viet Cong succeeded in closing to within [...] of 11 Platoon's position, and much of the artillery was beginning to fall behind them. Although the fire was likely impacting the Viet Cong rear area and was probably causing considerable casualties there, the assault troops had deliberately closed with the Australians to negate its effect. Buick estimated 11 Platoon was being assaulted by at least two companies; down to the last of their ammunition and with just 10 of its 28 men still able to fight, he feared the platoon would soon be overrun and destroyed, and would be unlikely to survive more than the next 10 to 15 minutes. Confident the rest of D Company would be attempting to reach them, but unable <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> might occur, Buick requested artillery fire onto his own position despite the danger this entailed. Stanley refused, although after confirming 11 Platoon's precarious situation, he was able to walk the artillery in closer. Landing [...] to their front, the artillery detonated among a large concentration of Viet Cong troops, destroying an entire assault line as they formed up. Three US F-4 Phantoms arrived on station at 17:00 for an airstrike arranged by Battalion Headquarters.|$|E

But {{it was in}} 2009 that his second hour-long show, An Open Return letter to Richard Branson, bought him {{critical}} acclaim. The show {{was based on a}} true story, beginning with Wrigglesworth narrating a letter to Sir Richard Branson. It goes on to describe a hung-over Wrigglesworth boarding a Virgin train at Manchester, and witnessing a ticket inspector forcing an OAP called Lena Ainscow to purchase a new full-price train ticket. Wrigglesworth then conducted a whipround to help Lena, much to the annoyance of the ticket inspector, who arranged for the Police to meet the train at Euston, after stating Wrigglesworth would be charged with begging. Thanks to several other passengers becoming embroiled in the story, a furore ensued and he and Lena were released from Police questioning. The show ends with the conclusion of the letter to Richard Branson, the point of which was to ask Branson for help in making train fares fairer.|$|R

Translation theory is based on social constructionism [3], which inter alia posits that concepts, such as Green IT, do not have intrinsic meanings, but that meaning is created in social interaction. The theory is therefore part of an interpretive turn in organization studies, where effort is dedicated not to increasing the efficiency or effectiveness of organizations (the main concern of more functionalist studies), but <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> people <b>that</b> constitute them, make sense and interpret their work...|$|R
