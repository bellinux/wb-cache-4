5|$|Chapman married Margaret F. Ingraham in 1832, and {{had seven}} {{children}} with her. They moved to Macomb, Illinois in 1833, then <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> Burlington, Iowa (then part of Michigan Territory) in 1835, {{where they were}} among the first settlers. The next year he became a prosecuting attorney, and was then appointed by United States President Andrew Jackson as United States Attorney for the Michigan Territory.|$|E
5|$|Christianity was {{probably}} introduced <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> Lowland Scotland by Roman soldiers {{stationed in the}} north of the province of Britannia. After the collapse of Roman authority in the early fifth century, Christianity is presumed to have survived among the British enclaves in the south of what is now Scotland, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced.|$|E

5|$|From 1499 to 1508 {{a number}} of other expeditions were {{launched}} from Bristol to the 'New found land', the earliest being undertaken by William Weston. One of these, led by John Cabot's son, Sebastian Cabot, explored down the coast of North America until he was ‘almost in the latitude of Gibraltar’ and ‘almost the longitude of Cuba’. This would suggest that he reached as far as the Chesapeake, close <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> Washington D.C.|$|E
5|$|Highway 33, {{also known}} since 1984 as the Loyalist Parkway, follows a pioneer colonial route {{on which the}} first {{segments}} were built two hundred years prior.

5000|$|The family Monimiaceae {{was erected}} in 1809 by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu. He called it [...] "the order Monimieae", but {{the orders of}} that time <b>were</b> {{equivalent}} <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> called families. He defined the family broadly, <b>to</b> include <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> called the Siparunaceae and Atherospermataceae, {{as well as the}} modern Monimiaceae. This circumscription of the family prevailed until the 1990s, but some, such as Robert Brown and John Lindley, recognized the Atherospermataceae as a separate family.|$|R

5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000– 70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer than today's, and early humans may have made their way <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated a site near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers, probably with a very low density of population.|$|E
5|$|During {{their time}} in Africa, Krapf and Rebmann worked {{their way into the}} {{interior}} of the continent. They traveled to several areas in the regions of Central and Eastern Africa, including <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> known as the African Great Lakes. The finding of one especially large lake (Uniamési) is depicted in a map known as the 'Slug' map. It was known by this name because the layout of the water body suggested a shape similar to that of a slug.|$|E
5|$|In 815 the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{records that}} Ecgberht ravaged {{the whole of}} the territories of the {{remaining}} British kingdom, Dumnonia, known to the author of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as the West Welsh; their territory was about equivalent <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> Cornwall. Ten years later, a charter dated 19 August 825 indicates that Ecgberht was campaigning in Dumnonia again; this may have been related to a battle recorded in the Chronicle at Gafulford in 823, between the men of Devon and the Britons of Cornwall.|$|E
50|$|Duan is {{also known}} for {{describing}} in his written work of 863 AD the slave trade, ivory trade, and ambergris trade of Bobali, which believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> Berbera in Somalia, East Africa.|$|R

5|$|In the 17th {{century the}} town was at the centre of Puritan {{emigration}} to America, and the local rector, John White, organised the settlement of Dorchester, Massachusetts. The first colonisation attempted was at Cape Ann, where fishermen who would rejoin the fishing fleet when the vessels returned the next year, tried to be self-sufficient. However, the land was unsuitable, the colony failed and was moved <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> Salem. In 1628 the enterprise received a Royal Charter and the Massachusetts Bay Company was formed with three hundred colonists arriving in America that year and more the following year.|$|E
5|$|Modern NY9L {{follows the}} length of the Old Military Road, which was the first road to connect <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> the town of Queensbury. It was first built in 1755 as the Colonial Army headed north from Albany. The {{construction}} of the road helped to increase development in the town. In 1832, the Glens Falls Feeder Canal opened, further improving transportation in Queensbury. Sixteen years later, in 1848, a plank road was built over the old Military Road.|$|E
5|$|NY144 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY10 in the mid-1920s {{and as part of}} US9W from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY144 was assigned <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> US9W between New Baltimore and Albany. The alignments of US9W and NY144 were flipped in the mid-1930s, placing the latter on a routing that extended north from Bethlehem to downtown Albany. NY144 was truncated to its present length in the late 1960s.|$|E

5|$|NY348 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the time, it began at NY22 in West Chazy and ended at US11 in the village of Champlain. NY348 had an overlap with US9 from Chazy <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> NY9B in the town of Champlain. Here, US9 forked to the east and followed the length of modern NY9B to Rouses Point. NY348 was extended east to Rouses Point along US11 and what is now NY276 by the following year.|$|E
5|$|NY37A was an {{alternate}} route of NY37 between Ogdensburg and Waddington. It was assigned {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> NY37 between the two locations. At the time, NY37 was routed on Van Rensselaer Road. The alignments of NY37 and NY37A were flipped in the late 1950s. On April10, 1980, the NY37A designation was removed. Ownership and maintenance of Van Rensselaer Road was transferred from the state of New York to St. Lawrence County on September1, 1982, at which time the highway was redesignated as CR28.|$|E
5|$|NY380 {{began at}} the modern {{intersection}} of NY60 and CR44 in the Ellicott community of Kimball Stand. The route proceeded west along modern CR44 <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> CR380, where it turned north to join the current alignment of CR380. NY380 left the vicinity of Kimball Stand and headed northwest along {{the base of a}} valley surrounding Cassadaga Creek to the hamlet of Towerville, where it intersected with CR59 and CR48. After leaving Towerville, Route380 went northward into the town of Ellery. Here, it intersected CR52 and CR66 in Redbird, a community in the extreme northeastern corner of the town.|$|E
