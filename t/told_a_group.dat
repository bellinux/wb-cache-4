Herodotus says that his only purpose in doing this was to vex the Persian high command.|$|E
5|$|Though the Republican {{legislative}} candidates {{won more}} popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite {{the bitterness of}} the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation. In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize. In {{the aftermath of the}} 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 1860, with William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Simon Cameron looming as rivals for the nomination. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency. In January 1860, Lincoln <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed Lincoln for president.|$|E

25|$|Another notable {{action of}} his term was a strict new ethics law. When campaigning for {{re-election}} in 2006, Blagojevich said that if his ethics law had existed when former governor George Ryan had been in office, Ryan's corruption might not have occurred. Blagojevich also signed a comprehensive death penalty reform bill that was written by then-Senator Barack Obama and the late U.S. Senator Paul M. Simon. Organized labor and African Americans were Blagojevich's staunchest political supporters. In 2008, he <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of African-Americans that he sometimes considered himself the first African American governor of Illinois.|$|E
500|$|Another decisive {{limitation}} in the German-Japanese alliance {{were the}} fundamental {{differences between the}} two nation's policies towards Jews.

500|$|Television cameras {{broadcast}} {{to the nation}} the scenes of fire hoses knocking down schoolchildren and police dogs attacking unprotected demonstrators.

President Kennedy <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> {{of people at the}} White House that The New York Times photo made him [...] "sick".

500|$|On April 15, Keyes {{confirmed}} his split from the Republican Party and {{his intention to}} explore the candidacy of the Constitution Party.

She was welcomed by the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI) organizations, {{and for the first time}} in her life lived in a community run by and for anarchists, according to true anarchist principles. [...] "In all my life", she wrote later, [...] "I have not met with such warm hospitality, comradeship and solidarity." [...] After touring a series of collectives in the province of Huesca, she <b>told</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> of workers: [...] "Your revolution will destroy forever [...] that anarchism stands for chaos."

Our goal is to discuss how <b>a</b> <b>group</b> storytelling tool can help the externalization of the contextual information behind the scenes of <b>a</b> story <b>told</b> by <b>a</b> <b>group,</b> making it easier to understand, interpret, and mainly to reuse the knowledge and context intrinsic to it. 1...|$|R
