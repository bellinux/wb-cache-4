40|$|The Khoisan is the {{original}} inhabitants of southern Africa. The Koranna {{were one of the}} tribes that already lived in the vicinity of Cape Town before the arrival of the first white settlers (1652). They had an own culture, language, identity and racial basis. However, by 1932 the Koranna no longer existed. Colonisation had threatened their nomadic existence of cattle-farming and hunting, while two destructive wars (1868 - 69 and 1878 - 79) against colonial oppressors had left them leaderless. Intermarriage, evangelisation, capitalisation (the discovery of diamonds in 1869 - 71 created a need for cheap labour at the diggings) and apartheid destroyed the <b>tribal</b> structures, <b>cohesion</b> and identity of the Koranna. According to the Population Registration Act of 1950, all South Africans who were not Whites or Blacks were regarded as “Coloureds” - the umbrella concept for the “residue” - those who did not fit in anywhere else. The Khoisan were stigmatised as “Coloureds” and were politically, socially and economically constrained to renounce their origins. The Department of Coloured Education, for example, prohibited the use of Khoisan languages amongst schoolchildren, while the Khoisan origins and culture were portrayed as “backward”. Constitutional accommodation and recognition are accorded to the Khoisan by the current government. A revival of traditional leadership and identity is evident everywhere. National and regional organisations are campaigning for political recognition and for linguistic and cultural regeneration. The Koranna, who were regarded as extinct, have also put in an appearance. After almost a century, there are virtually no more structures, knowledge, customs, or oral histories in existence, while political opportunism, nepotism and division are seriously hampering revival. In this contribution, {{the focus is on the}} Koranna in the Free State; on the regeneration of their structures and identity; as well as on the factors that are having a negative effect in this regard...|$|R
40|$|In this Article, I {{examine and}} test the {{assumptions}} of the United States Supreme Court regarding justice and those considered outsiders to Indian tribes. Over the last quarter century, the Court has progressively limited tribal jurisdiction over both non-Indians and Indians that are not members of the tribe. I examine these decisions {{to show that they}} owe less to established doctrine than to two assumptions about jurisdiction over nonmembers. The first is that outsiders will be at a disadvantage and subjected to bias by tribal courts. The second is that jurisdiction over outsiders {{has little to do with}} tribal self-government, which the Court sees as confined to control of tribal members and practices perceived as traditionally Indian. I test these assumptions using original empirical research regarding the decisions of the Navajo Nation courts. Analyzing 513 cases decided over a 32 year period, I find that the win-loss rate is numerically equal, with 50 % of nonmembers winning and 50 % losing when they go before the Navajo appellate courts. I complement the numerical analysis with closer analysis of three kinds of cases that might appear particularly vulnerable to bias: child custody cases, cases arising from business relationships, and cases resting on Navajo customary law. These decisions, I find, are both quantitatively and qualitatively balanced. The court, for example, often declines to exercise jurisdiction unfairly obtained, reaches holdings on questions of commercial law that are similar to or more favorable to outsiders than those reached in state or federal courts, and uses Navajo customary law to supplement Navajo codes to avoid unfair results. I then argue that cases involving nonmembers are disproportionately important in tribal legal systems. Although the Navajo Nation perhaps most closely matches the imagined ideal of a tribe isolated from non-Indians and non-Indian culture, cases involving nonmembers comprise 21 % of cases before the Navajo appellate courts over the 32 year period, and 30 % of cases decided in the last ten years. As this statistic suggests, formal tribal legal systems play one of their most important roles in resolving disputes arising from conflict with the outside world, and doing so in a way that preserves <b>tribal</b> distinctiveness and <b>cohesion.</b> Given the conflicted history of tribal legal systems as tools of both acculturation and resistance, moreover, jurisdiction over these disputes is crucial in preserving the efficacy and perceived legitimacy of tribal legal systems. It is also important in preserving incentives to fairness within the tribal courts, by creating a sense of the importance of the judicial role and by forcing judges to grapple with difference in tribal societies. Preservation of jurisdiction over outsiders, therefore, is crucial in keeping the federal commitment to tribal self-government...|$|R

However by the Faqir Hamu Shiru created a new notion of <b>tribal</b> <b>cohesion</b> which centered upon the attributes of ‘faqirdom’ but was heavily reliant on existing tribal solidarities.

Furthermore, the leading section of the tribe, the Mala Shiru, claimed to have originated from the Dinadiyya tribe of Shaykhan some of whose sections were already settled in Sinjar in the late 18th century. In this connection during the period of the British mandate Hamu Shiru consistently claimed to be a Dinadi chief. The personal prestige of the first nucleus of Fakirs who gathered around Hamu Shiru was undoubtedly strengthened by a careful policy of matrimonial alliances which represented one of the kernels of Hamu’s policy on the mountain at least since the early 1900s. Marriages were arranged between Hamu’s followers and members of other Sinjari groups. Membership in the tribe was also extended to those Yazidis who did not belong to the Faqir class by birth, so that the size of the group increased dramatically in a couple of decades. By 1932 the Fuqara’ tribe in Sinjar consisted of 240 families divided into six factions." ...|$|E
30|$|Given such difficulties, {{it is not}} {{surprising}} than that surveys of urban Bedouin attitudes toward housing policies (Abu-Saad et al. 2004) suggest that 70  % of residents favor tribal segregation. The reason being, as conveyed by our interviewees, is that living among extended families ensures property and personal safety as well as group integrity (Al Huzil 2012; El Assam 2012). Yet, in the tribally heterogeneous urban environment, maintaining <b>tribal</b> <b>cohesion</b> and collective codes of uncompromising group loyalty and mutual responsibility raises another challenging issue. Abu-Saad et al. (2004, 105) note that “when extended families were concentrated in one small area [tribally segregated neighborhoods], sometimes even small conflicts, such as disagreement between school children, would spark a much larger and more serious conflict involving the entire extended families”. As often the case, when such conflicts spiral into lethal blood-feuds, barricades and roadblocks are set-up between and across neighborhoods to prevent unwanted encounters. In extreme situations, entire neighborhoods are abandoned as hundreds of residents seek temporary refuge in other Bedouin towns or villages, school children are prevented from attending tribally integrated schools, and municipal services grind to a halt.|$|E
40|$|Diversity {{has been}} blamed for poor public goods {{provision}} {{in a number of}} different contexts. It is associated with reduced spending on services, meager rates of tax collection, and poor policies. At the same time, recent research has indicated that only certain types of diversity are associated with poor services and that in some cases diversity can actually improve service provision. In this dissertation, I argue that the relationship between the groups themselves is essential for understanding diversity’s impact on public goods provision. When relations are poor, public goods provision suffers; but this is not true for diverse groups everywhere. Through focusing on the case study of Jordan where tribes have relations characterized by mutual respect, I show that tribal diversity does not lead to poor service provision. I also argue that <b>tribal</b> <b>cohesion</b> is important in understanding the impact of tribal diversity on public goods provision—when tribes are cohesive, increasing diversity can positively impact service provision as it introduces greater electoral competition amongst candidates for the municipal council. I demonstrate in the dissertation that it is tribal diversity and cohesion’s ability to enhance electoral competition and decrease patronage as well the ability of heterogeneity to spur local economic development that explains their positive effect on public goods provision in Jordan...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{decreasing}} resource densities, higher latitude hunter-gatherers need {{to maintain}} their social networks over greater geographic distances than their equatorial counterparts. This suggests that as latitude increases, the frequency of face-to-face interaction decreases for 'weak tie' relationships in the outer mating pool (~ 500 -strong) and tribal (~ 1500 -strong) layers of a hunter-gatherer social network. A key question, then, is how a hunter-gatherer tribe sustains coherence as a single identifiable unit given that members are distributed across a large geographic area. The first step in answering this question is to establish whether the expectation that network maintenance raises a challenge for hunter-gatherers is correct, or whether sustaining inter-group contact is in fact trivial. Here I present a null model that represents mobile groups as randomly and independently moving gas particles. The aim of this model is to examine whether face-to-face contact can be maintained with every member of an individual's tribe at all latitudes even under the baseline assumption of random movement. Contrary to baseline expectations, the number of encounters between groups predicted by the gas model cannot support <b>tribal</b> <b>cohesion</b> and is significantly negatively associated with absolute latitude. In addition, above ~ 40 degrees latitude random mobility no longer produces {{a sufficient number of}} encounters between groups to maintain contact across the 500 -strong mating pool. These model predictions suggest that the outermost layers of hunter-gatherers' social networks may require additional mechanisms of support in the form of strategies that either enhance encounter rates, such as coordinated mobility patterns, or lessen the need for face-to-face interaction, {{such as the use of}} symbolic artefacts to represent social affiliations. Given the predicted decline in encounters away from the equator, such additional supports might be most strongly expressed at high latitudes...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{establishes}} a comprehensive {{understanding of the}} contemporary exercise of tino rangatiratanga by Ngai Tahu. This is achieved by examining Ngai Tahu's approach to, and internal expression of, tino rangatiratanga. In 1996 the Te Runanga 0 Ngai Tahu Act was passed. This, {{for the first time}} since the Treaty of Waitangi and Pakeha colonisation, legally recognised an organisational structure that was tribally derived and, in turn, allowed for a new degree of self-determination. This qualitative research provides an insight into the directions Ngai Tahu is embarking upon under its new administration in the attainment of tino rangatiratanga. Ngai Tahu's new organisational structure, since its formal inception, has not operated without its problems. These arise from a transitional phase which indicates a shift in paradigm from grievance mode to development mode. Internally, this has created a time of tension. Some runanga struggle to reaffirm their rangatiratanga in the wake of its tribal collectivisation represented in Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu. During this phase, communication throughout the organisational structure is paramount. This will ensure the recognition of rangatiratanga at all its levels and, thus, maintain <b>tribal</b> <b>cohesion.</b> Within Ngai Tahu, tino rangatiratanga is approached differently by its beneficiaries depending upon what element of the tribal make-up is being emphasised. For some, tino rangatiratanga is that expressed by the administrative structure, where it is translated into the notion of achieving economic sovereignty for the iwi. For others, it is derived from an individual's whakapapa (genealogy), with its collective expression revolving around the hapu and runanga only. With knowledge of these two divergent approaches to tino rangatiratanga, Ngai Tahu can negotiate a course of future development that embraces both the tribal, runanga and individual elements inherent in them both...|$|E
40|$|Social {{behaviour}} {{is notoriously}} difficult to study archaeologically {{and it is}} unclear how large the networks of prehistoric humans were, or how they remained connected. Maintaining social cohesion was crucial for early humans because social networks facilitate cooperation and are imperative for survival and reproduction. Recent hunter-gatherer social organisation typically comprises a number of nested layers, ranging from the nuclear family through to the ~ 1500 -strong ethnolinguistic tribe. Here we compare maximum obsidian transfer distances from the late Pleistocene with ethnographic data {{on the size of the}} geographic areas associated with each of these social grouping layers in recent hunter-gatherers. The closest match between the two is taken to indicate the maximum social layer within which contact could be sustained by Pleistocene hominins. Within both the (sub) tropical African and Subarctic biomes, the maximum obsidian transfer distances for Pleistocene modern humans (~ 200 km and ~ 400 km respectively) correspond to the geographic ranges of the outermost tribal layer in recent hunter-gatherers. This suggests that modern humans could potentially sustain the cohesion of their entire tribe at all latitudes, even though networks are more dispersed nearer the poles. Neanderthal obsidian transfer distances (300 km) indicate that although Neanderthal home ranges are larger than those of low latitude hominins, Neanderthals travelled shorter distances than modern humans living at the same high latitudes. We argue that, like modern humans, Neanderthals could have maintained <b>tribal</b> <b>cohesion,</b> but that their tribes were substantially smaller than those of contemporary modern humans living in similar environments. The greater time taken to traverse the larger modern human tribal ranges may have limited the frequency of their face-to-face interactions and thus necessitated additional mechanisms to ensure network connectivity, such as the exchange of symbolic artefacts including ornaments and figurines. Such cultural supports may not have been required to the same extent by the Neanderthals due to their smaller tribes and home ranges...|$|E
40|$|Social {{networks}} have been essential throughout hominin evolution, facilitating cooperative childrearing, transmission of cultural {{knowledge and the}} sharing of information and resources. As hominins dispersed out of Africa, these networks needed to be maintained at progressively higher latitudes. The {{first part of this}} thesis explores the impact of latitude on brain organisation and the possible implications for social cognition. I hypothesise that the lower temperatures and light levels found at higher latitudes select for larger bodies and visual systems, which in turn necessitate larger somatic and visual brain areas. Using orbit size to index eye and visual cortex size, I demonstrate a robust positive relationship between absolute latitude and orbit volume in recent humans. I show that Neanderthals, who solely inhabited high latitudes, have significantly larger orbits than contemporary anatomically modern humans (AMH), who evolved in lower latitude Africa and had only relatively recently dispersed into higher latitudes. Since Neanderthals and AMH dated 27 - 75 kya have almost identical endocranial volumes, I argue that if a greater proportion of the Neanderthal brain was required for somatic and visual processing, this would reduce the volume of neural tissue available for other functions. Since, according to the Social Brain Hypothesis, neocortex volume is positively associated with social complexity, I propose that Neanderthals might have been limited to smaller social networks than AMH. The second part of the thesis explores the challenge of maintaining social networks across greater geographic distances at higher latitudes, where high travelling costs seem to prevent whole tribes from bonding during periodic aggregations. Using a gas model I predict that at lower latitudes daily subsistence mobility allows sufficient encounters between subgroups for the tribe to maintain connectivity, whereas in (Sub) Arctic biomes additional mechanisms are required to facilitate <b>tribal</b> <b>cohesion.</b> This may explain the apparent ‘explosion’ of Upper Palaeolithic art in Europe: symbolic representations allowed social ties to be sustained in the absence of frequent face-to-face contact. Overall, this thesis demonstrates that latitude may influence both brain organisation and cultural expression and argues that both can have a substantial impact on the maintenance of hominin social networks at high latitudes.

40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} May, 1979 This paper {{attempts to}} {{shed some light}} on the 'inter-tribal faction fighting' which has rocked the Msinga and Mpofana rural locations for many decades. In this examination I have chosen to investigate the Tembu/Mabaso - Tembu/Majozi disturbances of 1922 because they have a long history which is fairly well documented and more importantly, the 1922 disturbances were a watershed in the relationship between tribes in Msinga and set a precedent for other tribes in the area with similar land problems and boundary disputes. Most importantly I think the war provided a model for local level politics among the districts within each tribe and was an important contribution {{to the development of a}} 'feud'(1) ideology in Msinga. Thirdly the war effectively broke Terabu dominance in Msinga politics and paved the way for the Chunu people to consolidate their power base and influence among those tribes which had been at loggerheads with the Terabu. The final blow to the Tembu power came in 1944 when they were defeated in massive clashes with the Chunu. The Chunu's slowly assumed the leadership role in Msinga after this and their chief SiMakade, has now been elected by the KwaZulu government to represent all the other chiefs in Msinga at important KwaZulu government functions. The first section deals with a vast period of history and is necessarily brief in sections. Whereas the first section deals with the 'inter-tribal' wars between the major tribes in Msinga, the second section deals with a new phenomenon which starts appearing in the early 1930 's - warfare between districts of the same tribe and even more stunning, fighting between sections within a single district within the same tribe. This breakdown of <b>tribal</b> <b>cohesion</b> into territorial opposition between districts and subsections within districts goes hand in hand with development of what I have called the 'ideology of vengeance' in Msinga. (2 *) In the pages that follow I think it will become clear that in trying to understand the conditions under which this new social phenomenon developed, there is among all the other numerous factors, a single underlying element which seems to pervade the fighting at every level - the problem of insufficient land...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{intervention}} processes in smallholder {{agriculture in the}} Nyanyadzi river catchment, located in Chimanimani district, Manicaland Province Zimbabwe. In particular it concerns itself with sociotechnical interventions that were implemented by Agritex, the local extension and irrigation service, in the mid- 1990 s. Despite a flurry of interventions and agrarian policies directed at the intensification of agricultural production and promotion of commercial agriculture in communal and resettlement areas, agricultural production has neither raised sufficiently nor in a sustainable manner. In this study intervention is taken as a measure to evoke a change in ordering practices of social actors, artefacts and natural elements by pursuing a model of how these three categories of actors might interrelate in a new way. Three models are researched in detail: {{the model of the}} smallholder commercial farmer as propagated in the master farmer training programme; the model of intensive smallholder irrigated agriculture {{in the case of a}} government managed smallholder irrigation scheme; the model of controlling water flows by means of conservation works and state management at catchment level of the Nyanyadzi river. In all three cases results have been disappointing to date: the master farmer programme has been ineffective in evoking widespread innovations in smallholder agriculture, the performance of the smallholder irrigation scheme has been low at high cost and finally siltation, land degradation and an increasingly fierce struggle over scarce river water have emerged in the catchment. The history of state interventions in the smallholder sector of Zimbabwe can be characterised by the presence of a strong state and a number of persistent themes and dichotomies, such as the prominence of the Land Question; recurrent swings in emphasis between development and control, modernity and tradition, and voluntary change and force; and a persistent belief in the potential ofthe mixed farming model to intensify agrarian production in the communal areas. Thus the post-Independence state adopted the very same technocratic policies that limited the possibilities to pursue the peasant option and had elicited widespread support for African nationalism and the ensuing liberation war. This study seeks to understand and explain these continuities in agrarian modernisation policies; qualify the impact of state interventions by paying explicit attention to alternative pathways of agrarian development pursued by smallholder farmers; develop an interdisciplinary understanding of water management and use at three hydraulic levels; and explore the possibilities and room for manoeuvre for reforms that calibrate policy discourse with local practice. It does so by engaging with the relationship between technology and society, informed by the actor­oriented approach, social construction oftechnology approach, and actor-network theory. The central research question guiding this study is: 'How did state engineered intervention models for agricultural modernisation of smallholder farming emerge, and which continuities and outcomes did these models produce at three hydraulic levels (field, scheme, catchment) in Nyanyadzi river catchment? ' A Native Commissioner, by the name of Keigwin, gave the first push towards the establishment of a govemment agency concerned with the segregated industrial and agricultural development of the African population in its own area. His plan in 1920 led to a training scheme for African instructors who were to demonstrate improved agricultural practices in the Reserves. With the appointment of E. D. Alvord, an American missionary, in the post of Agriculturist for instruction of natives in 1926, a more encompassing development scheme was embarked on, relying for its propagation on the concept of 'seeing is believing' The agricultural improvement package that Alvord developed provided a radical break with existing African agricultural practices, by maximising production per unit of land rather than per unit of labour. Whilst this break was considered necessary to allow the squeeze of the African population into the Reserves, facilitate administrative control and introduce the benefits of modem life to Africans, it may be questioned whether the resultant mixed smallholder farming model suited the social and ecological fabric of the Reserves. The elaboration of Alvord's philosophy of improving the livelihood of Africans led to the appointment of instructors, called demonstrators, in the fields of agriculture, community, development, home industries, forestry, irrigation, livestock and conservation. These demonstrators were tasked to develop African households and Reserves along an evolutionary path of modernisation. The global economic depression and rise of conservationist concerns in the 1930 s shifted the emphasis of the demonstrator programme from livehood improvement to the prevention of destruction of natural resources. Disappointed with the limited spread of his voluntary change programme. Alvord in the 1940 s succumbed to Conservationist pressures to enforce agricultural modernisation in the Reserves. The expanded agricultural Bureaucracy, left after Alvord's retirement in 1950, set out to impose the modernisation package by means of the Native Land Husbandry Act. However, African nationalist protests stopped its implementation in 1961, reverting the initiative over African development to tradionalist Administrators that sought to implement the Rhodesian Front's strict segregationist policies. Thus African modernist aspirations that had been created by alvord, where squashed by a community development policy that was modelled on a reinvented role for tradional leaders. In chapter three it is shown how the persistence of the model was achieved by assessing in more detail the methods, ideas and practices that made the master farmer programme the pivotal element of state intervention at field level. Whether the model of modernisation was successful in creating a vibrant, modernist c 1 ass of African smallholders mimicking their large scale European counterparts is also assessed. The agricultural success and upward mobility of master farmers and early generations of demonstrators suggests Alvord's modernisation strategy paid off initially. However, rather than improving and developing the (communal) area they originated from, Christian master farmers and demonstrators used their agricultural wealth to escape the Reserves, investing in either purchase farms, irrigation or agri-businesses and the education of their children. Thus a modem elite emerged that was actively supported by both the pre- and post-independence state, but was oflimited value in terms of the productive or political support rendered. After independence the master farmer programme expanded in scope to facilitate a rapid transfer of technology revolutionise and commercialise the previously neglected smallholder sector. However, the standardised programme capitalised on a farming style that did not fit the ecological and socio-economic fabric of the communal areas and continued to cater for a limited number of wealthy smallholders (6 % ofthe total) that had access to labour, cattle, capital and water. The second part ofthis chapter tums to Chimanimani district during the mid- 1990 s, assessing the meaning and effects of master farmer training, field days and agricultural shows in the different agro-ecological settings of Nyanyadzi river catchment. These three tenets of agricultural extension still formed the lynch pin of Agritex' mission to commercialise smallholder farmers using the image of their large-scale commercial counterparts. Despite their importance as heroes of progress and proof of Agritex' relevance, very little master farmer training was actually done by Chimanimani's extension workers. It is c 1 aimed that the model of the master fanner represents a mode of ordering (both material, social and ritual) that acts as an icon of modernisation. However, the trickle down effect (extension) to the masses of communal area dwellers did not occur. In two subsequent case studies involving master fanners the exclusionary features of the programme are highlighted. The fust case study assesses the relationship between field days and master farmers. Master fanners prove to be crucial actors for the reproduction and performance assessment of individual extension agents and their extension practices. Agricultural shows in Chimanimani, both at area and district level, have a highly ritual character where hardly any leaming takes place. The second case study demonstrates the active use that master fanners make of their relationship with extension workers as weil as their image as good fanners, in order to get access to state mediated resources, like land, water rights, loans and cattle. Aspiring to be a master fanner has less to do with wanting to practise agricultural methods that Agritex propagates, than with a desire to expand one's security and wealth by means of a master farmer badge. Thge latter serves as a ticket to state resources such as the heifer loan scheme aimed at restocking cattle heds in communal areas. The second part of the thesis (chapters 4 to 8) assesses the fTuits and fallacies of Nyanyadzi irrigation scheme as a model for intensive agricultural modemisation. In the intermezzo a new methodology is presented (technography) for the analysis of the life of an irrigated settlement scheme and the various actors involved in (re) shaping it. It is proposed to treat the social and technical aspects of settlement schemes as different but intemally related dimensions of a single object. Furthermore a strict ontological separation of the design of the irrigation scheme from its use is not helpful in analysing its success or failure, since 'closure' hardly occurs, i. e. the exact shape and use that is made of the water-network is subject to change. On the one hand settlement schemes are subject to iterative design processes informed by the disciplinary interests of its navigators (Engineers, Agricolas. and Administrators) and shifts in policy discourse or engineering paradigm. On the other hand,attempts to stabilise the scheme as a bounded entity are informed by the technologies of control that are devised by the management to control the behaviour of water and settlers, and counter-discours es and strategies of appropriation on the part of the users. The technography of Nyanyadzi irrigation scheme is further informed by three paradoxes conceming the role of irrigation in the emergence of sustained opposition against the govemment. Whilst Nyanyadzi irrigation scheme produced agric). lltural wealth for its modem users (in contrast to dry land fanners in the Reserves, who could not pursue the 'peasant option '), Nyanyadzi also became the scene of the most violent outbreaks of African opposition during the period of open Nationalism (1957 - 64). Thirty years later the agricultural success of the scheme had evaporated and the majority of users depended on drought relief hand-outs. Yet, the intemally divided Nyanyadzi irrigators persisted in their unified opposition against the govemment. Chapter four presents a first go at the base material, Nyanyadzi scheme, as conceived in a dream that Alvord had in 1926. A close look is taken at the construction and emergence of Nyanyadzi irrigation scheme as one of the most successful state engineered models for African modernisation under the vigorous leadership of its patron, Alvord. The technography starts with the rise and demise of the small MuNyanyadzi project that Alvord and his staff initiated in 1934 as a famine protection work and was washed away in a storm flood in 1942. This provided Alvord with a valuable leaming experience, which came in handy during the construction and settlement of the big Nyanyadzi project. Nyanyadzi provided Alvord with a key opportunity to realise his vision of agricultural modemisation. Whilst the resulting water­- network succeeded in eradicating famine and increasing agricultural production, the rural industrialisation policy, designed to cater for the unemployed agricultural workers and skilled professionals trom an emergent Atrican middle class, floundered. In the conclusion an assessment is given of the model of modemisation that Nyanyadzi scheme provided, strongly reflecting the central tenets of an irrigation factory. It is also shown how Alvord and his growing staff of Agricolas succeeded in crafting a successful water-network through the (re) alignment of various key elements, i. e. plot holders, crops, water and the market. The resulting water-network transforrned the existing Ndau society and physical landscape, by transferring wealth trom rain-fed cultivators to irrigators, whilst closing off opportunities for wet land cultivation in the Nyanyadzi catchment. During the next life-phase of the network (1950 - 67), treated in chapter five, the Agricolas focused on intensifYing and diversifYing irrigated production resulting in tangible increases in both the welfare and production attained by the plot holders. Yet, the aspirations of Nyanyadzi's wealthy plot holders went beyond that ofthe contented agriculturist, resulting in violent opposition during the period of open Atrican nationalist politics (1958 - 64). Instead of withdrawing, the Smith regime under the aegis of its Administrators tightened its hold over the Nyanyadzi water-network and its users, turning the scheme into a highly productive irrigation factory, yet failing to secure a dam to solve the network's persistent water woes. Events during the war of independence ultimately led to closure of the scheme, and sowed the seeds of future splits in the Nyanyadzi community. In the conclusion the life and transforrnation ofNyanyadzi scheme trom a famine protection work to an irrigation factory is reviewed by highlighting three recurrent eddies of thwarted hand-over of the scheme to its users within the general flow of increased state control. A pre-liminary answer to the Atrican nationalist paradox is provided. Both Agricolas and Administrators blamed the violent outbreaks of resistance on the unemployed and uneducated members of Nyanyadzi community. The latter had been instigated by urban politicians prying on feelings on insecurity that came with the threat of eviction, according to Agricolas. The Administrators blamed the umest on a lack of <b>tribal</b> <b>cohesion</b> and discipline. Yet Sithole (1970) and the Nyanyadzi nationalists themselves stress the leading role of Alvord's mission-educated modem men and women, who had acquired new wealth through irrigation and aspired better education, better wages and more business opportunities. Atrican nationalism provided both the voice and means to articulate these desires. Chapter six assesses the durability and demise of Nyanyadzi scheme as a state run venture, by investigating the intricacies of day-to-day management after Independence. The chapter opens with a review of govemment and donor agency initiated attempts to forrnulate a new irrigation management policy, stressing the benefits of increased cost recovery through user involvement in their management. The resulting (neo-liberal) policy discourse proved quite at odds with (futile) attempts by govemment staff on the ground to revive the scheme as a state run irrigation factory. The lack of a clear-cut policy statement on irrigation management allowed local govemment staff to push for such a revival, whilst head office staff engaged in lucrative donor mediated consultancies that sought to address this lacuna. Attempts to revive the Nyanyadzi factory failed in the face of natural and political opposition. It is argued that policy practice and discourse were enacted in two separate, though unconnected, policy arenas. Whilst massive donor support to and involvement with the smallholder irrigation sector produced an increase in both irrigated commands and managerial capacity on the part of Agritex, it did not contribute to a viabie model for handing over the management of these schemes to the users. The deadlock which emerged between the users and the management, and the complexity of the Nyanyadzi water-network is succinctly demonstrated by assessing attempts of both plot holders and the scheme's management to make the most of the dry winter season in 1995. Whilst a new water rotation schedule provided some reprieve, measures to reduce the crop acreage (one-acre rule) were ineffective, whilst continued break-downs and ultimate closure of the pump station seriously affected yields of the bean crop. Further complications were presented by the ineffectiveness of the irrigation management committee in regulating water distribution and the juggling act of gate keepers (bailiffs) that tried to negotiate their way between the list of official plot holders and de facto users of the scheme. The abrupt hand­over of the Nyanyadzi scheme to its politically divided users after 1995 was a direct result of the confluence of thnie currents, viz. the enactrnent of neo-liberal policies, a cash-strapped government, and the refusal of the plot holders to mobilise the resources required for the scheme's continued operation as an expensive government venture. Chapter seven focuses on the actual objects of irrigation based modernisation, the users. How did they experience the successive attempts to remould their livelihood? And in what ways did they actively re-shape, re-mould, and re-craft parts of the water-network to suit their own interests? First it is shown that irrigated agriculture in indigenous African schemes in East Africa is only a complementary activity to livestock or rain-fed production, whilst initial investments in the network's construction moderate its operation and maintenance (hydraulic property). The second section re-looks at the emergence of nationalist inspired resistance to the scheme's management in Nyanyadzi, and unravels how different farming strategies produced two types of plot holders that each had their own reasons to support the struggle for independence. By highlighting the effects of inheritance and investrnent patterns across different generations of Nyanyadzi plot holders, it is shown how political splits (n' the Nyanyadzi community after independence came to reflect different livelihood orien-tations and vice versa. An extensive plot survey in blocks A and C of the Nyanyadzi water-network reveals present-day differences in livelihood strategies pursued by plot holders of different religious and political orientation. Two cross-generational accumulation patterns and one recent politically informed accumulation pattem come to light, that produce a different understanding of how plot holders over the years have appropriated the Nyanyadzi water­network. These differences throw a new light on contemporary debates on small holder irrigation and livelihoods, impinging on the relationship between plot sizes and economic viability, the gender effects of irrigated production, the cultural dimension of risk avoidance, and tbe interplay between the sociotechnical environment of an irrigation scheme and the development of livelihood options by its users. Chapter eight is devoted to emergent modes of (re -) organisation that various users have developed to respond to and cope with the vagaries imposed by the crumbling official water­network. By means of three case studies it is shown how Nyanyadzi plot holders have re­appropriated and re-aligned some of the constituent elements of the scheme in order to make it work. The modalities of this re-alignment are informed by the two pattems of accumulation described in the previous chapter, and a third strategy that derives its strength from a combination of violence and political patronage (providing a prism to future events in Zimbabwe as a whole, after the start of the land occupations in 1999). The first case study is situated in block C where a traditionalist mode of organisation enables the successful implementation of main canal maintenance and crop marketing activities. Tbe second case study highlights the attempts of modernist plot holders and their urban kin to improve the water. supply situation of the scheme as a whole, through the mobilisation of donor funds to line the badly leaking main canal. Finally, a land conflict in block B highlights the failure of the traditionalleadership, Agritex, Rural District Council, and civil court to fend off a family of land claimants, who violently occupied the plot previously held by their evicted father. Ultimately, the heirs of the evictee succeed in chasing the legitimate plot holder off his land through the mobilisation of a politically inspired network of ZANU(PF) politicians. In the conclusion the three different modes of organisation are compared with emergent forms of organisation in o...|$|E
