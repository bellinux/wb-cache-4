On the other hand {{there are those who}} succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as the expression of a certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.|$|E
5|$|In many districts Taiwanese aborigines tend to {{vote for}} the Kuomintang, {{to the point that the}} {{legislative}} seats allocated to the aborigines are popularly described as iron votes for the pan-blue coalition. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> surprising in light of the focus of the pan-green coalition on promoting aboriginal culture as part of the Taiwanese nationalist discourse against the KMT. However, this voting pattern can be explained on economic grounds, and as part of an inter-ethnic power struggle waged in the electorate. Some aborigines see the rhetoric of Taiwan nationalism as favoring the majority Hoklo speakers rather than themselves. Aboriginal areas also tend to be poor and their economic vitality tied to the entrenched patronage networks established by the Kuomintang over the course of its fifty-five year reign.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E

25|$|Fusion {{power would}} provide more energy {{for a given}} weight of fuel than any {{fuel-consuming}} energy source currently in use, and the fuel itself (primarily deuterium) exists abundantly in the Earth's ocean: about 1 in 6500 hydrogen atoms in seawater is deuterium. Although <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> a low proportion (about 0.015%), because nuclear fusion reactions {{are so much more}} energetic than chemical combustion and seawater is easier to access and more plentiful than fossil fuels, fusion could potentially supply the world's energy needs for millions of years.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{the range}} of {{possibilities}} is first narrowed down (often by entering the desired character's pronunciation). Then, if there remains more than one possibility, the desired ideogram is selected, either by typing the number before the character, or using a graphical menu to select it. The computer assists the typist by using heuristics to guess which character is most likely desired. Although <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> painstaking, East Asian input methods are today sufficient in that, even for beginners, typing in these languages is only slightly slower than typing English.|$|E
25|$|This {{variation}} {{is similar to}} the Bin Packing Problem. It differs from the Bin Packing Problem in that a subset of items can be selected, whereas, in the Bin Packing Problem, all items have to be packed to certain bins. The concept is that there are multiple knapsacks. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> like a trivial change, but it is not equivalent to adding to the capacity of the initial knapsack. This {{variation is}} used in many loading and scheduling problems in Operations Research and has a Polynomial-time approximation scheme.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, the Philippine creepers, {{a single}} genus of three species of treecreeper-like birds {{appear to be}} highly apomorphic members of the more initial {{radiation}} of the Sturnidae. While <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> odd at first glance, their placement has always been contentious. In addition, biogeography virtually rules out a close relationship of Philippine creepers and treecreepers, as neither the latter nor their close relatives seem have ever reached the Wallacea, let alone the Philippines. Nonetheless, their inclusion in the Sturnidae is not entirely final and eventually they may remain a separate family.|$|E

25|$|Using {{the left}} {{end of each}} piece, the {{rectangle}} method sums 16 function values and multiplies by the step width, , here 0.25, to get an approximate value of 3.94325 for the integral. The accuracy is not impressive, but calculus formally uses pieces of infinitesimal width, so initially <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> little cause for concern. Indeed, repeatedly doubling the number of steps eventually produces an approximation of 3.76001. However, 218 pieces are required, a great computational expense for such little accuracy; and a reach for greater accuracy can force steps so small that arithmetic precision becomes an obstacle.|$|E
25|$|The {{council of}} war {{therefore}} unanimously decided {{to lower the}} flag of the Batavian Republic and declare themselves prisoners of war. They refused, however, to hoist the Orange flag. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> a minor point, but it signified that the officers did not defect. When Mitchell accepted the surrender, he did this {{in the name of the}} Prince of Orange. He therefore ordered {{the flag of the}} Prince to be hoisted, with which order some of the officers complied. This little act was to cost them dearly later on, as it was interpreted as an act of treason.|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{conservation}} hypothesis, people can exert self-control despite ego depletion if {{the stakes are}} high enough. Offering cash incentives or other motives for good performance counteracts the effects of ego depletion. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> surprising but in fact it may be highly adaptive. Given the value and importance of the capacity for self-control, it would be dangerous for a person to lose that capacity completely, and so ego depletion effects may occur because people start conserving their remaining strength. When people do exert themselves on the second task, they deplete the resource even more, as reflected in severe impairments on a third task that they have not anticipated.|$|E

25|$|Despite further rumours that {{he would}} resign, Beatty {{remained}} in office when the Conservatives took power {{in the autumn of}} 1924. Supported by the First Lord of the Admiralty William Bridgeman, he clashed with the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill, once again over the number of cruisers required by the Royal Navy. At this stage of his career Churchill was opposed to what he saw as excessive defence spending. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> odd in light of his previous and subsequent reputation, but in the 1920s no major war seemed to be on the horizon. Beatty also at this time pressed hard for the return of responsibility for naval aviation from the newly formed Royal Air Force to the Royal Navy.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only were}} all the social {{institutions}} of Turkish society reorganized, but {{the social and political}} values of the state were replaced as well. This new, secular state ideology was to become known as Kemalism, and it is the basis of the democratic Turkish republic. Since the establishment of the republic the Turkish military has perceived itself as the guardian of Kemalism, and it has intervened in Turkish politics to that end on several occasions, including the overthrow of civilian governments by coup d'état. While <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> contrary to democratic ideals, it was argued by military authorities and secularists as necessary in the light of Turkish history, ongoing efforts to maintain secular government, {{and the fact that the}} reforms were implemented at a time when the military occupied 16.9% of the professional job positions (the corresponding figure today is only 3%).|$|E
25|$|While lucrative, the {{revenues}} realized {{from the three}} factories should not be overemphasized: while the Medici often had invested more than 7,900 gold florins in the three factories in 1458, for example, the sum invested in banks in 1458 was more than 28,800and that figure is low, for it excludes the Rome branch serving the Pope, the Medici's interest-bearing deposits in their branches, and also omits any accounting of several years' profit which were inaccessible (since the relevant partnerships {{had not yet been}} dissolved; <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>seem</b> to be a flaw in the system, but it built up capital in a branch and allowed it to lend out more than it had been incorporated with).
