5|$|Shortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur {{somewhat}} {{like a cat}} would, licking their front paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, and sides. They also rub their backs and bellies {{along the sides of}} trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling secretion from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to their mouths or place food directly into their mouths.|$|E
5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is arboreal and diurnal, and most often moves <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> on four legs (quadrupedal locomotion). It lives in groups containing several adult males, adult females and juveniles. The group size {{tends to be}} smaller than that of South American {{squirrel monkey}}s, but is still larger than for many other New World monkey species. The group generally numbers between 20 and 75 monkeys, {{with a mean of}} 41 monkeys. Groups in excess of 100 sometimes occur, but these are believed to be temporary mergers of two groups. On average, groups contain about 60% more females than males.|$|E
5|$|The next {{stretch of}} State Route 664 {{is full of}} bends, and the highway {{continuously}} turns at a constant rate. At an intersection with another Honey Suckle Lane, the highway starts its northwestern progression once again. This changes again when Tedrow Lane begins paralleling the highway. Now following a steady northeastern alignment, the highway continues through the large patches of trees south of Haneyville. At Little Plum Run Road, the highway turns onto a steady northward alignment. The highway continues <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> for a while, continuing northward {{on its way to}} Gallagher Township.|$|E

5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and rocks well. When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown on its head and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled groan. It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head. It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has lived up to 25 years in captivity.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, the Sci Fi Channel {{sponsored}} a {{scientific study of}} the area and related records by the Coalition for Freedom of Information. The most significant finding of the scientific team was a line of damaged trees broken at the top leading to the site where some eyewitnesses said they saw the object embedded in the soil along with associated fresh tree damage. Furthermore, tree core samples dated the damage to 1965. This provided physical evidence that something airborne may have come crashing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and landed in the woods. (However, one of the scientists instead suggested ice damage to the trees.) Minor soil disturbance was also found at the alleged landing site. Another witness reported hearing a pair of loud, horrific screams {{as members of the}} military approached the object on foot.|$|E
25|$|The Bastarnae {{provided}} the casus belli by crossing the Haemus and attacking the Dentheletae, a Thracian tribe who were Roman allies. Crassus {{marched to the}} Dentheletae's assistance, but the Bastarnae host hastily withdrew over the Haemus at his approach. Crassus followed them closely into Moesia but {{they would not be}} drawn into battle, withdrawing beyond the Tsibritsa. Crassus now {{turned his attention to the}} Moesi, his prime target. After a successful campaign which resulted in the submission of a substantial section of the Moesi, Crassus again sought out the Bastarnae. Discovering their location from some peace envoys they had sent to him, he lured them into battle near the Tsibritsa by a stratagem. Hiding his main body of troops in a wood, he stationed as bait a smaller vanguard in open ground before the wood. As expected, the Bastarnae attacked the vanguard in force, only to find themselves entangled in the full-scale pitched battle with the Romans that they had tried to avoid. The Bastarnae tried to retreat into the forest but were hampered by the wagon-train carrying their women and children, as these could not move <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> Trapped into fighting to save their families, the Bastarnae were routed. Crassus personally killed their king, Deldo, in combat, a feat which qualified him for Rome's highest military honour, spolia opima, but Augustus refused to award it on a technicality. Thousands of fleeing Bastarnae perished, many asphyxiated in nearby woods by encircling fires set by the Romans, others drowned trying to swim across the Danube. Nevertheless, a substantial force dug themselves into a powerful hillfort. Crassus laid siege to fort, but had to enlist the assistance of Rholes, a Getan petty king, to dislodge them, for which service Rholes was granted the title of socius et amicus populi Romani ("ally and friend of the Roman people").|$|E
