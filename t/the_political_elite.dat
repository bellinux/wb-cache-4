25|$|The {{new country}} was a {{multi-ethnic}} state. The population consisted of Czechs (51%), Slovaks (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and Rusyns (4%). Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles and some Slovaks, felt oppressed because <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups.

25|$|Set {{against a}} {{backdrop}} of rapid economic development and social changes in post-Mao China, the protests reflected anxieties about the country's future in the popular consciousness and among <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>elite.</b> The reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy which benefitted some people but seriously disaffected others; the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy, and restrictions on political participation. The students called for democracy, greater accountability, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech, though they were loosely organized and their goals varied. At the height of the protests, about a million people assembled in the Square.|$|E

The Province of Canada was divided into Ontario and Quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the British North America Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of Protestant and the Catholic minority. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital.|$|E
25|$|Other public festivals {{were not}} {{required}} by the calendar, but occasioned by events. The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows, though these tended to be overshadowed by {{the political and social}} significance of the event. During the late Republic, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> competed to outdo each other in public display, and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests. Under the Principate, all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control: the most lavish were subsidised by emperors, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office. Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries. Others, such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era (saeculum), became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity. That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part.|$|E

He grew up as the oldest of twelve children, with seven {{brothers}} and four sisters. Three of James Jr.'s brothers died as infants, including one who was stillborn. In the summer of 1775, his sister Elizabeth (age 7) and his brother Reuben (age 3) died from a dysentery epidemic that swept through Orange County because of contaminated water. His father, James Madison Sr. (1723–1801), was a tobacco planter {{who grew up on}} a plantation, then called Mount Pleasant, which he had inherited upon reaching adulthood. He later acquired more property and slaves, and with , he became the largest landowner and a leading citizen in the Piedmont. James Jr.'s mother, Nelly Conway Madison (1731–1829), was born at Port Conway, the daughter of a prominent planter and tobacco merchant.

25|$|While Assad did {{not rule}} alone, he {{increasingly}} had the last word; those with whom he worked eventually became lieutenants, rather than colleagues. None of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> would question a decision of his, {{and those who did}} were dismissed. General Naji Jamil is an example, being dismissed after he disagreed with Assad's handling of the Islamic uprising. The two highest decision-making bodies were the Regional Command and the National Command, both part of the Ba'ath Party. Joint sessions of these bodies resembled politburos in socialist states which espoused communism. Assad headed the National Command and the Regional Command as Secretary General and Regional Secretary, respectively. The Regional Command was the highest decision-making body in Syria, appointing the president and (through him) the cabinet. As presidential authority strengthened, the power of the Regional Command and its members evaporated. The Regional and National Commands were nominally responsible to the Regional Congress and the National Congress—with the National Congress the de jure superior body—but the Regional Congress had de facto authority. The National Congress, which included delegates from Ba'athist Regional Branches in other countries, has been compared to the Comintern. It functioned as a session of the Regional Congress focusing on Syria's foreign policy and party ideology. The Regional Congress had limited accountability until the 1985 Eighth Regional Congress, the last under Assad. In 1985, responsibility for leadership accountability was transferred from the Regional Congress to the weaker National Progressive Front.|$|E
25|$|The church's {{situation}} {{began to}} improve in 1962, when {{relations with the}} state suddenly thawed, an event that coincided {{with the beginning of}} Romania's pursuit of an independent foreign policy course that saw <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> encourage nationalism as a means to strengthen its position against Soviet pressure. The Romanian Orthodox Church, an intensely national body that had made significant contributions to Romanian culture from the 14th century on, came to be regarded by the regime as a natural partner. As a result of this second co-optation, this time as an ally, the church entered a period of dramatic recovery. By 1975, its diocesan clergy was numbering about 12,000, and the church was already publishing by then eight high-quality theological reviews, including Ortodoxia and Studii Teologice. Orthodox clergymen consistently supported the Ceaușescu regime's foreign policy, refrained from criticizing domestic policy, and upheld the Romanian government's line against the Soviets (over Bessarabia) and the Hungarians (over Transylvania). As of 1989, two metropolitan bishops even sat in the Great National Assembly. The members of the church's hierarchy and clergy remained mostly silent as some two dozen historic Bucharest churches were demolished in the 1980s, and as plans for systematization (including the destruction of village churches) were announced. A notable dissenter was Gheorghe Calciu-Dumitreasa, imprisoned {{for a number of years}} and eventually expelled from Romania in June 1985, after signing an open letter criticizing and demanding an end to the regime's violations of human rights.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{analyzes}} the post-independence background {{and composition of}} <b>the</b> Nigerian core <b>political</b> execu-tive <b>elite.</b> By analyzing changes in <b>the</b> national <b>political</b> <b>elite,</b> this article attempts to establish {{the extent to which}} compo-sition of the elite reflects the democratic governance aspects of openness and inclusiveness. Liberal pluralists believe that transformation in the elite power structure depends on periodic renewals, i. e. the entrance of new persons and ideas as re-gimes and resources change. In post-colonial Nigeria, there have been many structural changes, especially in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> regime and economic resources. The article argues that structural changes have not been very effective in transforming the outlook of the Nigerian elite. The lack of transformation in <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> demeanor at <b>the</b> national executive power struc-ture is based on the shared (common) background and preferences of members of the elite. This article applies critical elite theory to analyze the characteristics and continuity of <b>the</b> Nigerian <b>political</b> <b>elite.</b> <b>The</b> findings demonstrate how the nature of <b>the</b> <b>political</b> executive <b>elite</b> in Nigeria has contributed to <b>the</b> weakness of <b>political</b> institutions...|$|R

25|$|State {{intervention}} in marketing peasant produce was justified in colonial times as protecting farmers against commodity price fluctuations. However, in ADMARC, development and profit-making were given priority of over price stabilization. At first, ADMARC accumulated substantial profits and re-invested {{them in a}} range of private companies and statutory corporations. Compared to those its neighbours Tanzania, Zambia, and later Mozambique and Zimbabwe, Malawi’s parastatal bodies were less bureaucratic and aimed to be business-like and profitable. In particular, its ADMARC was considered efficient until 1980. With an economic decline {{at the start of the}} 1980s, the flaws in its strategy became apparent. Profit accumulation had reduced the economic well-being of the peasant producers. The main beneficiaries of this strategy were <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> who controlled organisations sponsored by ADMARC, the urban population obtaining subsidised food and the employees of ADMARC and other state bodies. Transferring resources away from smallholders to the state led to corruption and abuse of office. In 1977, a long serving ADMARC chairman was convicted for misusing corporation property in his private businesses and of making large unauthorised loans to a private company in which he and family were involved. Corruption and general inefficiency in statutory corporations including ADMARC resulted in a 1980 law limiting their holding office for a renewable two year period. This was not followed by any change in ADMARC's business activities or its conflicting roles as a marketing organization and provider of development finance.|$|E
25|$|The final {{reaction}} of the Dutch economic elite (which doubled as <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>elite</b> in this oligarchical Republic) to these economic challenges lay in the political sphere. After {{the end of the}} Franco-Dutch War (which, like the previous wars was mostly financed by floating bonds, instead of higher taxation) the public debt had risen to an alarming size. The Regents at first tried to retire a significant part of this debt, and were successful in the years leading up to the Dutch invasion of England, known as the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Though this episode is usually described as narrowly English, or at most Anglo-Dutch of significance, it was actually part of a strategic defense of the Dutch Republic against the aggressive encroachments of king Louis XIV of France. The ensuing Nine Years' War and War of the Spanish Succession had for the Dutch also an economic aspect, as they were trying to revert French protectionist measures, which threatened to close the French and Spanish metropolitan and colonial markets to them (both the Treaty of Ryswick and the Treaty of Utrecht contained provisions abrogating the draconian French tariff list of 1667). The main effect of these wars, however, was that the Dutch public debt increased with 200 million guilders between 1688 and 1713. In view of the meagre results of the 1713 peace treaty (most advantages of the war that the Republic had helped to win went to Great Britain, thanks to the separate peace that country had concluded previously with France) the gamble had not paid off.|$|E
