40|$|LLM (Estate Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Sectional {{ownership}} {{has introduced}} several new concepts of property that {{differ significantly from}} prevailing as well as common-law concepts of property. The right of extension with regards to sectional titles is one such concept. The right entails a subtraction from the dominium of sectional owners and {{is widely regarded as}} a limited real right. It is submitted that the right cannot be categorised into any common-law category. The right is a statutory limited real right sui generis that has its own characteristics with regards to the way it is established, transferred, alienated, burdened or lapses. The right should also be recognised as constitutional property. The study concludes with an investigation into selected aspects relating to the right as an estate asset and points to problems relating to the valuation of the right for purposes of estate, capital gains and donation <b>tax.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Entrance to the Arti {{was highly}} {{structured}} {{from the first}} records; {{it was necessary to}} be the legitimate son of a member, to give proofs of competence in the craft involved, and to pay an entrance <b>tax.</b> <b>Masters</b> of the guilds, who possessed the means of production, took on apprentices and garzoni, the [...] "boys" [...] or journeymen who might work through a long career without ever becoming a master.Each of the Arti was ruled according to its statutes, which had the force of law, and might pass judgement in controversies among its members and with their workers. In the fourteenth century the guilds established the market tribunal called the Mercatanzia to hear causes that involved more than one of the Arti.

50|$|There are {{masters in}} the Queen's Bench Division; unlike the masters in the Chancery Division, the Queen's Bench masters have {{original}} jurisdiction, {{and are not}} attached to any particular judge.

There remains an appeal from the master to the judge; however, {{the ability of a}} judge to appeal to a divisional court in every case, and thence to the court of appeal, ceased after a multiplication of appeals in small interlocutory matters caused a scandal. Under the Supreme Court of Judicature (Procedure) Act, 1894, there is no right of appeal to the court of appeal in any interlocutory matters (except those mentioned in subs. (b)) without the leave of the judge or of the court of appeal, and, in matters of practice and procedure, the appeal lies directly to the court of appeal from the judge in chambers.|$|R

40|$|Analysis of data {{on civil}} {{litigation}} claims reveals two puzzles. First, despite the large costs of nonbargaining, {{only a fraction of}} claims receive more than one offer before settlement or adjudication. Second, the size of this fraction seems to depend on the type of parties involved in the claim. This paper develops a theory to explain these observations. The basic model describes bargaining between a risk-neutral defendant who plays the litigation game repeatedly and a risk-averse plaintiff who is involved in litigation only once. (This set-up, it is argued, is a good description of the parties in many civil litigation cases.) The paper shows that (under certain circumstances) the defendant will commit to withholding offers partially: In a two-period game, the optimal strategy is to make a second offer to the plaintiff with a probability between zero and one. The dependence of this probability on the characteristics of the plaintiff is described. A unique data set, collected from the files of the <b>Taxing</b> <b>Masters</b> in the United Kingdom, allows specific testing of the model’s predictions. Regression analysis and comparison with U. S. studies provide support for the theory...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Tax)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The tax {{world as}} {{we knew it was}} turned upside down on 13 September 2007 when the Supreme Court of Appeal (“SCA”) {{announced}} its decision to deem the right to use an interest-free loan as an amount that accrued to the taxpayers in the case Commissioner for South African Revenue Service v Brummeria Renaissance (Pty) Ltd and others 69 SATC 205. The findings of SCA brought about a “great deal of consternation in the business world” (Loubser, 2007 : 20). Due to the controversy {{as a result of this}} case, SARS drafted an Interpretation Note that illustrates the reasoning and tax treatment of an interest-free loan. On 30 June 2010, Interpretation Note No 58 was finally issued by SARS, providing guidance with regard to “an amount” that “accrues” to a taxpayer for the purposes of the gross income definition. This Interpretation Note will have a significant impact on a number of taxpayers. The purpose of this study is to understand the nature of an interest-free loan and identify its tax implications. The methodology followed in this study will be that of qualitative research. This will be conducted through analyzing the nature of a loan, specifically an interest-free loan, the gross income definition, including the value and timing of such amount, and whether a deduction may be claimed in respect of an interest-free loan. Notwithstanding the above, the study also includes an investigation of other taxes inter alia capital gains tax, donations tax, value-added tax, secondary tax on companies and newly proposed dividends <b>tax.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
