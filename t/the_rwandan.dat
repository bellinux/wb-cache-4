5|$|The Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) is the {{national}} army of Rwanda. Largely composed of former Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) soldiers, it includes the Rwanda Land Force, Rwanda Air Force and specialised units. After the successful conquest {{of the country in}} 1994 in the aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Genocide, <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Patriotic Front decided to split the RPF into a political division (which retained the RPF name) and the RDF, a military division which was to serve as the official army of <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> state. Defence spending continues to represent an important share of {{the national}} budget, largely due to continuing security problems along the frontiers with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi and lingering concerns about Uganda's intentions towards its former ally. In 2010, the United Nations released a report accusing <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the First and Second Congo Wars, charges denied by <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> government.|$|E
5|$|The RPF forces held Ruhengeri {{through the}} {{afternoon}} of 23 January, before withdrawing back into the mountains for the night. <b>The</b> <b>Rwandan</b> government sent troops to the city the following day, and {{a state of emergency}} was declared, with strict curfews in Ruhengeri and the surrounding area. The RPF raided the city every night, fighting with <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> army forces, and the country was back at war {{for the first time since}} the October invasion.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Civil War was a {{conflict}} in the African republic of Rwanda, between <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Armed Forces (FAR) and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). The war was fought in two phases. The first phase began on 1 October 1990, with an RPF invasion of the north east of the country from Uganda. This phase ended on 4 August 1993, with {{the signing of the}} Arusha Accords. The second phase took place following the assassination of President Juvénal Habyarimana on 6 April 1994, and the outbreak of <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> genocide. The RPF resumed fighting on 7 April, and the civil war ended with an RPF victory on 18 July 1994.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, {{during the}} Second Congo War, {{government}} forces suffered a major defeat by Rwandan forces at Pweto, {{at the source}} of the river. The DRC forces had brought most of their armored vehicles across the river. There was a single ferry, and they did not have enough time to evacuate the vehicles before <b>the</b> <b>Rwandans</b> arrived. Soldiers loaded a T-62 tank awkwardly, and the ferry tipped over and sank. <b>The</b> <b>Rwandans</b> found 33 tanks, as well as other vehicles, which the DRC troops had tried to burn.|$|R

5|$|The {{organisation}} {{which was}} to become <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Patriotic Front (RPF) was founded in 1979. It was known initially known as <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Refugees Welfare Association, and then from 1980 as <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Alliance for National Unity (RANU). It formed in response to persecution and discrimination against the Tutsi refugees by the regime of Ugandan president Milton Obote. Obote accused the Rwandans of collaboration with his predecessor, Idi Amin, including occupying the homes and stealing the cattle of Ugandans who had fled from Amin. Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame had joined Yoweri Museveni's rebel Front for National Salvation (FRONASA). FRONASA fought alongside Obote to defeat Amin in 1979, but withdrew from the government following Obote's disputed victory in the 1980 general election. Museveni, along with Rwigyema and Kagame, formed a new rebel army, the National Resistance Army (NRA). The NRA's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in {{what became known as}} the Ugandan Bush War. President Obote remained hostile to <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> refugees throughout his presidency, and RANU was forced into exile in 1981, relocating to Nairobi, Kenya. In 1982 Ankole youths attacked the Rwandans, with the authority of Obote, causing many more to join Museveni's NRA.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, the RPF waged a classic {{hit-and-run}} style guerrilla war, capturing some border areas but not making significant {{gains in the}} war against <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> army. Following the June 1992 formation of a multi-party coalition government in Kigali, Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> government in Arusha, Tanzania. In early 1993 groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large-scale violence against the Tutsi. Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group {{composed}} of nearly 500,000 Tutsi refugees, invaded northern Rwanda from their base in Uganda, initiating <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Civil War. The group condemned the Hutu-dominated government {{for failing to}} democratize and confront the problems facing these refugees. Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war, but by 1992 it had weakened Habyarimana's authority; mass demonstrations forced him into a coalition with the domestic opposition and eventually to sign the 1993 Arusha Accords with the RPF. The cease-fire ended on 6 April 1994 when Habyarimana's plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing him. The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Genocide, which began within a few hours. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government. Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted.|$|E

50|$|During the Second Congo War Kabinda {{was devastated}} by {{fighting}} between Congolese forces and Rwandan rebels, who were advancing west {{on their way}} to the diamond producing area around Mbuji-Mayi.

5|$|In {{addition}} to deceiving the French, <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> government used the fake attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for launching {{a wave of}} anti-Tutsi propaganda. They encouraged Hutu citizens to arrest Tutsi suspected of supporting the RPF. With French assistance, and benefiting {{from the loss of}} RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the FAR enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF, and pushed the rebels {{all the way back to}} the Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda, while others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. <b>The</b> <b>Rwandan</b> government announced on 30 October that the war was over.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to dismantling the refugee camps, Kagame began planning {{a war to}} remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Uganda, <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> government supported an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The rebels quickly took control of North and South Kivu provinces and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting, and controlling the whole country by May 1997. Mobutu fled into exile, and the country was renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Rwanda fell out with the new Congolese regime in 1998, and Kagame supported a fresh rebellion, leading to the Second Congo War. This war lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and massive damage. A 2010 United Nations report accused <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the two Congo wars, charges denied by <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> government.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters moved down from the {{mountains}} and waited in hidden locations around the city; they were assisted by RPF sympathisers residing in the area. On {{the morning of the}} 23rd they attacked. <b>The</b> <b>Rwandan</b> forces in the area were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion, although <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> police and army did succeed for a while in repelling the invasion in some areas, killing a number of rebel fighters in the process. It is likely the FAR forces were assisted by French troops, as the French government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard. By noon, however, the defending forces were defeated, and the RPF held the whole of the city.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{was born}} to a Tutsi family in {{southern}} Rwanda. His mother was younger sister to King Ndahindurwa's wife. When he was two years old, <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Revolution ended centuries of Tutsi political dominance; his family fled to Uganda, where he {{spent the rest of}} his childhood. In the 1980s, Kagame fought in Yoweri Museveni's rebel army, becoming a senior Ugandan army officer after Museveni's military victories carried him to the Ugandan presidency. Kagame joined <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Patriotic Front (RPF), which invaded Rwanda in 1990; leader Fred Rwigyema died early in the war and Kagame took control. By 1993, the RPF controlled significant territory in Rwanda and a ceasefire was negotiated. The assassination of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was the starting point of the genocide, in which Hutu extremists killed {{a little more than a}} million Tutsi and moderate Hutu combined. Kagame resumed the civil war, and ended the genocide with a military victory.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda {{does not}} {{have a long history of}} written literature, but there is a strong oral {{tradition}} ranging from poetry to folk stories. Many of the country's moral values and details of history have been passed down through the generations. The most famous Rwandan literary figure was Alexis Kagame (1912–1981), who carried out and published research into oral traditions as well as writing his own poetry. <b>The</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Genocide resulted in the emergence of a literature of witness accounts, essays and fiction by a new generation of writers such as Benjamin Sehene. A number of films have been produced about <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Genocide, including the Golden Globe-nominated Hotel Rwanda, Shake Hands with the Devil, Sometimes in April, and Shooting Dogs, the last two having been filmed in Rwanda and having featured survivors as cast members.|$|E

5000|$|The {{following}} is a partial chronology of significant events surrounding <b>the</b> 1994 <b>Rwandan</b> Genocide.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} coalesced, {{first into}} clans (ubwoko), and then, by 1700, into around eight kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda, {{ruled by the}} Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became the dominant kingdom from the mid-eighteenth century, expanding {{through a process of}} conquest and assimilation, and achieving its greatest extent under the reign of King Kigeli Rwabugiri in 1853–1895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations. The Berlin Conference of 1884 assigned the territory to Germany, which began a policy of ruling through <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> monarchy, and supporting Tutsi chiefs around the country. Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule. The Belgians modernised <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> economy, but Tutsi supremacy remained, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised. In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards labelling each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{shooting}} {{down of the}} plane served as the catalyst for <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> genocide, which began within a few hours. An interim government took over, headed by de facto-leader Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, which began ordering the systematic killing of huge numbers of Tutsi, {{as well as some}} politically moderate Hutu, through well-planned attacks. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 were killed.|$|E
5|$|They {{remained}} {{de facto}} senior officers, but the change {{caused them to}} accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda. They joined an organisation called <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Patriotic Front (RPF), a refugee association which had been operating under various names since 1979. Rwigyema became the RPF leader shortly after joining and, while still working for the Ugandan army, he and Kagame completed their invasion plans.|$|E

5|$|Following Habyarimana's death, a {{military}} committee led by Colonel Théoneste Bagosora took immediate {{control of the}} country. Under the committee's direction, the Hutu militia Interahamwe and the Presidential Guard began to kill Hutu and Tutsi opposition politicians and other prominent Tutsi figures; within 24 hours they had killed all moderate leaders, including Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana. The killers then began targeting the entire Tutsi population, as well as moderate Hutu, beginning <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> Genocide. Over the course of approximately 100 days, over 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks.|$|E
5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for <b>the</b> <b>Rwandan</b> genocide. The camps were crowded and squalid, and thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics, including cholera and dysentery. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide, who began rearming in a bid to return to power in Rwanda.|$|E
