5|$|In February 2016, in {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the Zika virus, the Obama administration requested that Congress appropriate $1.9billion to fight <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the disease. Congress did not initially take action, leaving Burwell to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to reprogram $589million in funds previously designated {{as part of the}} response to Ebola, to fight <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> the Zika virus. Of the initial Zika funding, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) received $222million to lead the domestic fight against the virus with the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority splitting $152million for the domestic effort. In response to Congressional complaints that the money was not being spent fast enough, Burwell informed Congress that without further funding the CDC's funding to fight Zika would be depleted by September30, 2016. After Burwell moved funding from other HHS programs, Congress finally appropriated $1.1billion to fight <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> Zika in the United States. By the end of September 2016, the United States reported 23,000 cases in the territory of Puerto Rico, 3,000 cases in the states, and 21babies born in the United States with microcephaly testing positive for Zika.|$|E

5|$|Though they {{maintained}} a formal neutrality policy {{in regards to}} religion, the French colonial administration began to regulate Islamic education in the early 1900s. In addition, fear of a pan-Islamism political rise throughout North Africa and the Sahel led the French to adopt policies that aimed to prevent <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> Islam beyond where it already existed and to prevent Muslim leaders from governing non-Muslim communities. Indigenous religions and Christianity existed under less formal policies, and French efforts often used these to balance <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> Islam in the region.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria luteobubalina {{was first}} {{described}} in 1978, {{after having been}} discovered several years earlier growing in a Eucalyptus plantation in southeastern Australia. It distinguished itself from other known Australian Armillaria species by its aggressive pathogenicity. It may take years for infected trees {{to show signs of}} disease, leading to an underestimation of disease prevalence. Studies show that <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following logging operations. Although several methods have been suggested to control <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> <b>of</b> disease, they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible. Phylogenetic analyses have determined that A.luteobubalina is closely related to A.montagnei and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species A.paulensis. The distribution of A.luteobubalina suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent Gondwana.|$|E

30|$|Many {{efforts have}} been {{invested}} in modeling <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> information through social bonds. One of the main diffusion models in marketing and management is the Bass model [9], which is generally used to study the rates of innovation and imitation in <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> ideas. <b>The</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> information is treated similarly <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> an infection in the following models; a user is thus said to be infected when he gets influenced by his friends. In a more recent model, the threshold model [10], each user is endowed with a personal threshold value and becomes infected {{when the number of}} infected friends meets this threshold. A generalization of this model, named the linear threshold model, uses the ratio of infected friends and/or links weights between friends [11, 12]. In the cascade model [13], a user has a certain probability to become infected each time one of his neighbors becomes infected.|$|R

30|$|The {{dissemination}} of official messages and <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> rumors are both key factors in emergency situations.

Three different scenarios for population behavior evolution are identified according to the degree of government involvement. The results shed new light to comprehend information dissemination in emergencies and provide some hint on how to limit <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>of</b> rumor within populations after emergency occur.|$|R
