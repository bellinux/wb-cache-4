5|$|This {{work was}} {{discovered}} by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in a Greek manuscript consisting of a poem of 44 lines, in the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in 1773. It is addressed to Eratosthenes and the mathematicians in Alexandria. Archimedes challenges them to count the numbers of cattle in the Herd of the Sun by solving a number of simultaneous Diophantine equations. There is a more difficult version {{of the problem in}} which some of <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> required to be square numbers. This version of the problem was first solved by A. Amthor in 1880, and the answer is a very large number, approximately 7.760271.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{question}} of whether trokosi is a form of slavery and whether sexual abuse is involved <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> polarized into two camps. [...] Some traditionalists defend the system saying that it is simply a cultural practice of certain shrines and as such should be protected. [...] These defenders claim that while instances of sexual abuse may occur, {{there is no evidence that}} sexual or physical abuse is an ingrained or systematic part of the practice. [...] According to them, the practice explicitly forbids a Trokosi to engage in sexual activity or contact. [...] The other camp is represented by NGO's working with the trokosi and by former trokosi who have been liberated. [...] These opponents of the practice have recorded testimony of hundreds of former (now liberated) trokosi who say that sexual abuse was a regular part of their time at the shrine, claiming the number of children born to them by the priest and shrine elders is a witness.|$|E
2500|$|Three Questions - The [...] "Three Questions" [...] test {{occurs when}} only three people are left; the exact amount {{required}} for this challenge. All players first fill out identical surveys where each question has two different answers to choose from. <b>The</b> <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> {{the names of}} the two other players. Later, the host leads one person to hide somewhere in the town. The other two must find their fellow player based on how they believe their teammate answered three questions taken from the survey. Selecting which route to take usually follows this premise: If Player X answered the question with Player Y, go left; otherwise, if the answer is believed to be Player Z, go right. Since no routes overlap, each question has to be answered correctly in order to win money. (USA - Season 1, 2, 3, Australia - Season 2, Netherlands - Season 4) A slight variation was done in Australia's Season 4, when it was done with four players, two questions apiece, and yes/no answers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} fugues in a prelude varies {{from one to}} three, not {{counting}} the pseudo-fugal free sections. The fugues normally employ four voices with extensive use of pedal. Most subjects are of medium length (see Example 2), frequently {{with some degree of}} repercussion (note repeating, particularly in BuxWV 148 and BuxWV 153), wide leaps or simplistic runs of 16th notes. One of the notable exceptions is a fugue in BuxWV 145, which features a six-bar subject. <b>The</b> <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> usually tonal, on scale degrees 1 and 5, and there is little real modulation. Stretto and parallel entries may be employed, with particular emphasis on the latter. Short and simple countersubjects appear, and may change their form slightly {{during the course of the}} fugue. In terms of structure, Buxtehude's fugues are a series of expositions, with non-thematic material appearing quite rarely, if ever. There is some variation, however, in the way they are constructed: in the first and last fugues of BuxWV 136 the second voice does not state the subject as it enters during the initial exposition; in BuxWV 153 the second exposition uses the subject in its inverted form, etc. Fugue subjects of a particular prelude may be related as in Froberger's and Frescobaldi's ricercars and canzonas (BuxWV 150, 152, etc.): ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{months after}} {{qualifying}} as a lecturer in philosophy, Adorno delivered an inaugural lecture at the Institute for Social Research, an independent organization which had recently appointed Horkheimer as its director and, {{with the arrival}} of the literary scholar Leo Lowenthal, social psychologist Erich Fromm and philosopher Herbert Marcuse, sought to exploit recent theoretical and methodological advances in the social sciences. His lecture, [...] "The Actuality of Philosophy," [...] created a scandal. In it, Adorno not only deviated from the theoretical program Horkheimer had laid out a year earlier, but challenged philosophy's very capacity for comprehending reality as such: [...] "For the mind," [...] Adorno announced, [...] "is indeed not capable of producing or grasping the totality of the real, but it may be possible to penetrate the detail, to explode in miniature the mass of merely existing reality." [...] In line with Benjamin's The Origin of German Tragic Drama and preliminary sketches of the Arcades Project, Adorno likened philosophical interpretation to experiments which should be conducted [...] "until they arrive at figurations in which <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> legible, while the questions themselves vanish." [...] Having lost its position as the Queen of the Sciences, philosophy must now radically transform its approach to objects so that it might [...] "construct keys before which reality springs open." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Donnie or Marie" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic {{rated the}} episode 4.6 out of 5 stars and [...] "could barely move" [...] {{after watching the}} episode. [...] "There's still a sense of not really having any clue who killed Rosie, which may be extremely obnoxious to some and perfectly riveting to others. But that noir tone has never changed, The characters have remained true to themselves flaws and all, and the case, while at times long winded, in these last few episodes has felt like it's moved somewhere, giving us something to grasp onto and feel as if <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> within our reach." [...] The A.V. Club's Brandon Nowalk rated this episode a B, calling it a [...] "suspenseful cliffhanger" [...] and comparing the cross-editing to the previous episode [...] "Bulldog" [...] by stating: [...] "The difference is that last week cut between an absorbing dramatic scene and an energetic detective scene while [...] "Donny Or Marie" [...] cuts between two thrilling mysteries surfing each other's wakes. Instead of falling through the dramatic pauses, the momentum carries {{all the way through}} the finale." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline was pleased to see an episode dedicated to the murder investigation. He stated: [...] "I've been saying throughout this season that The Killing would have to really step up its game in the last few episodes to make the last 11 episodes seem like they were worth the trouble, and while 'Donnie or Marie' is certainly a strong one, it's not so revelatory or dramatic that it forgives the failings of the season that precedes it. If every episode of the season was this good, The Killing would have been a much better series. But even then, it would need to really end with a glorified bang to justify the buildup." ...|$|E

Now if we substitute these values of x, y, in the quantities whose values are required, the first becomes (5 + 2z) + (3-3z) + z, i.e. 8: and the second becomes 2(5 + 2z) + 3(3-3z) + 5z, i.e. 19.
