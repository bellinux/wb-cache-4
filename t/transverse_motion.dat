25|$|In seismology, {{several types}} of surface waves are encountered. Surface waves, in this {{mechanical}} sense, {{are commonly known as}} either Love waves (L waves) or Rayleigh waves. A seismic wave is a wave that travels through the Earth, often as the result of an earthquake or explosion. Love waves have <b>transverse</b> <b>motion</b> (movement is perpendicular to the direction of travel, like light waves), whereas Rayleigh waves have both longitudinal (movement parallel to the direction of travel, like sound waves) and <b>transverse</b> <b>motion.</b> Seismic waves are studied by seismologists and measured by a seismograph or seismometer. Surface waves span a wide frequency range, and the period of waves that are most damaging is usually 10 seconds or longer. Surface waves can travel around the globe many times from the largest earthquakes. Surface waves are caused when P waves and S waves come to the surface.|$|E

40|$|We study heat {{conduction}} in a one-dimensional chain {{of particles with}} longitudinal as well as <b>transverse</b> <b>motions.</b> The particles are connected by two-dimensional harmonic springs together with bending angle interactions. Using equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics, three types of thermal conducting behaviors are found: a logarithmic divergence with system sizes for large transverse coupling, 1 / 3 power-law at intermediate coupling, and 2 / 5 power-law at low temperatures and weak coupling. The {{results are consistent with}} a simple mode-coupling analysis of the same model. The 1 / 3 power-law divergence should be a generic feature for models with <b>transverse</b> <b>motions.</b> Comment: 4 page...|$|R

50|$|The {{absence of}} {{reliable}} distances {{for the majority}} of stars means that the angular measurements made, astrometrically, in the plane of the sky, cannot generally be converted into true space velocities in the plane of the sky. For this reason, astrometry characterises the <b>transverse</b> <b>motions</b> of stars in angular measure (e.g. arcsec per year) rather than in km/s or equivalent. Similarly, the typical absence of reliable radial velocities means that the <b>transverse</b> space <b>motion</b> (when known) is, in any case, only a component of the complete, three-dimensional, space velocity.|$|R
2500|$|The basis light-front {{quantization}} (BLFQ) approach uses expansions {{in products}} of single-particle basis functions {{to represent the}} Fock-state wave functions. Typically, the longitudinal (...) dependence is represented in the DLCQ basis of plane waves, and the transverse dependence is represented by two-dimensional harmonic oscillator functions. The latter are ideal for applications to confining cavities and are consistent with light-front holographic QCD. The use of products of single particle basis functions is also convenient for incorporation of boson and fermion statistics, because the products are readily (anti)symmetrized. By employing two-dimensional basis functions with rotational symmetry about the longitudinal direction (where the harmonic oscillator functions serve as an example), one preserves the total angular momentum projection quantum number which facilitates determination of the total angular momentum of the mass eigenstates. For applications without an external cavity, where transverse momentum is conserved, a Lagrange multiplier method is used to separate the relative <b>transverse</b> <b>motion</b> from the total system's motion.|$|E

40|$|Using high {{resolution}} off-band {{data from the}} New Solar Telescope and Morlet wavelet analysis technique, we analyzed <b>transverse</b> <b>motions</b> of type II spicules observed near the North Pole of the Sun. Our new findings are that i) some of the observed type II spicules display kink or an inverse "Y" features, suggesting that their origin {{may be due to}} magnetic reconnection, and ii) type II spicules tend to display coherent transverse motions/oscillations. Also, the wavelet analysis detected significant presence of high frequency oscillations in type II spicules, ranging from 30 to 180 s with the the average period of 90 s. We conclude {{that at least some of}} type II spicules and their coherent <b>transverse</b> <b>motions</b> may be caused by reconnection between large scale fields rooted in the intergranular lanes and and small-scale emerging dipoles, a process that is know to generate high frequency kink mode MHD waves propagating along the magnetic field lines...|$|R

40|$|We analyze high {{temporal}} and spatial resolution time series of spectral scans of the Hα line obtained with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter instrument mounted on the Swedish Solar Telescope. The data reveal highly dynamic, dark, short-lived structures known as Rapid Redshifted and Blueshifted Excursions (RREs, RBEs) that are on-disk absorption features observed in the red and blue wings of spectral lines formed in the chromosphere. We study the dynamics of RREs and RBEs by tracking their evolution in space and time, measuring {{the speed of the}} apparent motion, line of sight (LOS) Doppler velocity, and transverse velocity of individual structures. A statistical study of their measured properties shows that RREs and RBEs have similar occurrence rates, lifetimes, lengths, and widths. They also display non-periodic, nonlinear <b>transverse</b> <b>motions</b> perpendicular to their axes at speeds of 4 – 31 km s− 1. Furthermore, both types of structures either appear as high speed jets and blobs that are directed outwardly from a magnetic bright point with speeds of 50 – 150 km s− 1, or emerge within a few seconds. A study of the different velocity components suggests that the <b>transverse</b> <b>motions</b> along the LOS of the chromospheric flux tubes are responsible for the formation and appearance of these redshifted/blueshifted structures. The short lifetime and fast disappearance of the RREs/RBEs suggests that, similar to type II spicules, they are rapidly heated to transition region or even coronal temperatures. We speculate that the Kelvin Helmholtz instability triggered by observed <b>transverse</b> <b>motions</b> of these structures may be a viable mechanism for their heating...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} non-linear scaling {{relations for}} two-dimensional gravitational collapse in an expanding background using a 2 D TreePM code {{and study the}} strongly non-linear regime (ξ̅≤ 200) for power law models. Evolution of these models {{is found to be}} scale-invariant in all our simulations. We find that the stable clustering limit is not reached, but there is a model independent non-linear scaling relation in the asymptotic regime. This confirms results from an earlier study which only probed the mildly non-linear regime (ξ̅≤ 40). The correlation function in the extremely non-linear regime is a less steep function of scale than reported in earlier studies. We show that this is due to coherent <b>transverse</b> <b>motions</b> in massive haloes. We also study density profiles and find that the scatter in the inner and outer slopes is large and that there is no single universal profile that fits all cases. We find that the difference in typical density profiles for different models is smaller than expected from similarity solutions for halo profiles and <b>transverse</b> <b>motions</b> induced by substructure are a likely reason for this difference being small.

5000|$|While Lamb's {{analysis}} {{assumed a}} straight wavefront, {{it has been}} shown that the same characteristic equations apply to cylindrical plate waves (i.e. waves propagating outwards from a line source, the line lying perpendicular to the plate). The difference is that whereas the [...] "carrier" [...] for the straight wavefront is a sinusoid, the [...] "carrier" [...] for the axisymmetric wave is a Bessel function. The Bessel function takes care of the singularity at the source, then converges towards sinusoidal behavior at great distances. These cylindrical waves are the eigenfunctions from which the plate's response to point disturbances can be composed. Thus a plate's response to a point disturbance can be expressed as a combination of Lamb waves, plus evanescent terms in the near field. The overall result can be loosely visualized as a pattern of circular wavefronts, like ripples from a stone dropped into a pond but changing more profoundly in form as they progress outwards. It should be noted always that Lamb wave theory relates only to motion in the (r,z) direction; <b>transverse</b> <b>motion</b> is a different topic.|$|E

40|$|Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink waves {{have now}} been {{observed}} to be ubiquitous throughout the solar atmosphere. With modern instruments, they {{have now been}} detected in the chromosphere, interface region, and corona. The key {{purpose of this paper}} is to show that kink waves do not only involve purely <b>transverse</b> <b>motions</b> of solar magnetic flux tubes, but the velocity field is a spatially and temporally varying sum of both <b>transverse</b> and rotational <b>motion.</b> Taking this fact into account is particularly important for the accurate interpretation of varying Doppler velocity profiles across oscillating structures such as spicules. It has now been shown that, as well as bulk <b>transverse</b> <b>motions,</b> spicules have omnipresent rotational motions. Here we emphasize that caution should be used before interpreting the particular MHD wave mode/s responsible for these rotational motions. The rotational motions are not necessarily signatures of the classic axisymmetric torsional Alfvén wave alone, because kink motion itself can also contribute substantially to varying Doppler velocity profiles observed across these structures. In this paper, the displacement field of the kink wave is demonstrated to be a sum of its transverse and rotational components, both for a flux tube with a discontinuous density profile at its boundary, and one with a more realistic density continuum between the internal and external plasma. Furthermore, the Doppler velocity profile of the kink wave is forward modeled to demonstrate that, depending on the line of sight, it can either be quite distinct or very similar to that expected from a torsional Alfvén wave. status: publishe...|$|R
