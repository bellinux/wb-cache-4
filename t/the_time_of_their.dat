5|$|Although Fuegians from Patagonia {{may have}} visited the Falkland Islands in prehistoric times, the islands were {{uninhabited}} at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> discovery by Europeans. Claims of discovery {{date back to}} the 16th century, but no consensus exists on whether early explorers discovered the Falklands or other islands in the South Atlantic. The first recorded landing on the islands is attributed to English captain John Strong, who, en route to Peru's and Chile's littoral in 1690, discovered the Falkland Sound and noted the islands' water and game.|$|E

5|$|Barbadian {{traditional}} {{folk songs}} are {{heavily influenced by}} the music of England. Many traditional songs concern events current at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> composition, such as the emancipation of the slaves of Barbados, and the coronations of Victoria, George V, and Elizabeth II; this song tradition dates back to 1650.

5|$|Carboniferous Period (359–299 {{million years}} ago) rocks are {{represented}} by the Carboniferous Limestone that forms the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out of the flat landscape of the Somerset Levels and Moors.

The latest records show that the nature <b>of</b> <b>their</b> trading has changed dramatically from <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> traditional land transport and trade fairs in the Balkans. Although the traditional method of commerce still occupies the merchants that are based in Metsovo or Ioannina, {{a large number of}} Metsovite merchants has established trading companies and agencies in distant places where they are occupied with all types of import and export trade.|$|R
50|$|Charcoal {{deposits}} were found, {{suggesting that}} fires had been lit within.

Dobie records that the cave system was used as a refuge for the local Covenanters during <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> persecution by <b>the</b> government of Charles II (1630-85) and Paterson confirms this, indicating that the Statistical Account of Ayrshire, written by the local ministers, was his source.

5|$|Many {{cultures}} have attached importance to astronomical events, and the Indians, Chinese, and Maya developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations.

The majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June 1999, Kouao and Climbié met Carl Manning (born 31 October 1972) {{on a bus}} {{which he}} was driving.

The relationship developed quickly and on 6 July 1999, Kouao and Climbié moved into Manning's one-bedroom flat at Somerset Gardens in Tottenham, in the London Borough of Haringey. There is evidence that Climbié's abuse increased soon after moving into Manning's flat.|$|E

Following {{the dissolution of the}} Templar order in France by Philip IV of France, Edward II ordered their properties to be seized and passed to the Hospitaller order in 1313, but in practice many properties were taken by local landowners and the Hospital was still attempting to reclaim them twenty-five years later.|$|E

40|$|A {{particle}} {{moves with}} constant velocity in the positive direction. It is also subject to randomly occuring instantaneous negative displacements called backtrackings. The magnitudes of these displacements are independent and identically distributed random variables, {{and it is}} assumed that the net velocity of the particle is still positive. The backtrackings are registered but <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> occurence are not. The resulting collection of overlapping intervals on the real line is studied as a stochastic process evolving in space. A fairly simple Markovian representation is derived and the stationary distribution obtained. Intimate connections with certain linear immigration-birth-death processes are exhibited. Some comments are made concerning estimation and sampling procedures and the identifiability of the displacement distribution from limited information. ...|$|R
