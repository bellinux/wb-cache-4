25|$|Camels are the {{backbone}} of the Rashaida pastoralists' economy and are also central to their culture. Camel milk is a key ingredient in their diet and, since sorghum is their only other staple, it represents their almost exclusive source of protein and vitamins. Cash is received at town markets for male camels sold for slaughter at the age of six to seven years. They are collected at regular intervals into large herds and driven to the meat markets in Egypt, where <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> profits ranging from LSd 7 000 to LSd 12 000, i.e. approximately US$600 to US$1000, per head. Some male animals though are kept for riding and to carry their burden for their migrations. A separate strain, the Anafi, is bred for the racing camel market in the Persian Gulf area, where prices reach up to LSd 1 million.|$|E
500|$|Debra finds {{a bag of}} {{marijuana}} hidden in a cereal box in Anton's apartment and asks her partner Det. Joey Quinn (Desmond Harrington) about Anton's previous charges for drug possession. Quinn tells her vaguely {{that it can be}} found on file, but when she asks Anton for his informant number, he tells her that he has none. She discovers that he had been working for Quinn unofficially and that he is not legally obligated to disclose any information to the police. After she tells him that he no longer has to work as an informant due to a [...] "clerical error" [...] in the filing of his report, he disappears. Debra and Quinn continue to work on the case of serial killer [...] "The Skinner". Believing that The Skinner may be a tree-trimmer, <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> a number of them for questioning; one contractor, George King (Jesse Borrego), tells Debra about one of his suspicious workers, Mario (Jerry Zatarain). When Mario tries to run from them, Debra and Quinn arrest him and he pleads to be sent back to Nicaragua at the mention of King's name. Debra later visits Anton's apartment and realizes that he has been taken by The Skinner, who recently trimmed the trees.|$|E

They often bring the lowest {{relative}} humidities {{of the year to}} coastal Southern California. These low humidities, combined with the warm, compressionally-heated airmass, plus high wind speeds, create critical fire weather conditions. [...] Known as [...] "devil winds", Santa Anas are infamous for fanning regional wildfires.|$|E
2500|$|In the passage, Jesus has {{sat down}} in the temple to teach some of the people, after he spent the {{previous}} night at the Mount of Olives. [...] A group of scribes and Pharisees confront Jesus, interrupting his teaching session. <b>They</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> a woman, accusing her of committing adultery, claiming she was caught in the very act. They ask Jesus whether the punishment for someone like her should be stoning, as prescribed by Mosaic Law. Jesus first ignores the interruption, and writes on the ground as though he does not hear them. But when the woman's accusers continue their challenge, he states that the one who is without sin is the one who should cast the first stone. The accusers and congregants depart, leaving Jesus alone with the woman. [...] Jesus asks the woman if anyone has condemned her. She answers that no one has condemned her. Jesus says that he, too, does not condemn her, and tells her to go and sin no more.|$|E

2500|$|Taiwan {{is one of}} the {{few major}} {{countries}} that do not have Confucius Institutes, and scholars from Academia Sinica's Center for Asia-Pacific Area Studies carried out a two-year research project to collect empirical evidence on CIs. The project leader Michael Hsiao (蕭新煌), chairperson of Academia Sinica’s Institute of Sociology, said he learned the implicit rules about off-limit topics—Taiwan, Tibet, the Dalai Lama, the Tiananmen Square massacre, and Falun Gong—during interviews with staff at CI host institutions in Southeast Asian countries and in the US. Hsiao called the Hanban's rapid expansion of Confucius Institutes into over 105 countries [...] "a smart move," [...] but also mentioned that CI criticisms have arisen in at universities worldwide. [...] "People in favor of the institutes say <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> revenue and provide opportunities for students to learn Chinese.

2500|$|Not all BevMo! {{expansion}} {{has been}} welcomed by city residents. In March 2010 in Santa Barbara, California, a group voiced opposition at a city board meeting, delaying {{approval of a}} BevMo! store. Concerns brought up at the meeting included complaints about the company's plans to cut down a tree in the parking lot, and about loading dock plans that would increase congestion in a narrow alley. The city's Architectural Board of Review member Paul Zink recommended against BevMo!'s plans to have pedestrians cross a parking lot to enter the store, saying that [...] "there's a tie-in between what's inside and the street". Zink continued, [...] "here in Santa Barbara, we like to window shop." [...] Area retailers noted that a new liquor store within range of nine smaller liquor stores and several supermarkets that sell liquor would decrease sales for longstanding area businesses. Sarkis Abdulhi, a liquor store owner, asked, [...] "how can a politician say they support small business when <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> giant chains? How many employees {{are they going to}} have, 13? What good does that do anybody when they put nine or 10 small shops out of business?" [...] Area resident Trudy Fernandez said the opening of chain location [...] "takes away from what people like me who have been in Santa Barbara 40 years came here for. This is a small town—we don't want to be L.A." [...] The store, BevMo's 105th, saw brisk business upon opening.|$|E

60|$|I might dwell {{upon this}} article, {{and extend the}} {{observation}} to the East Indies, where a remarkable difference is evident between {{the present and the}} past times; for whereas a few years past the quantity of European goods, whether of English or other manufactures, was very small, and indeed not worth naming; on the contrary, now the number of European inhabitants in the several factories of the English, Dutch, and Portuguese, is so much increased, {{and the people who are}} subject to them also, and who <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> daily to clothe after the European fashion, especially at Batavia, at Fort St. George, at Surat, Goa, and other principal factories, that the demand for our manufactures is grown very considerable, and daily increasing.

60|$|There must be {{something}} very unusual in the climate of Timor to permit wheat being grown at so moderate an elevation. The grain is of excellent quality, the bread made from it being equal to any I have ever tasted, and it is universally acknowledged to be unsurpassed by any made from imported European or American flour. The fact that the natives have (quite of their own accord) taken to cultivating such foreign articles as wheat and potatoes, which <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> small quantities {{on the backs of}} ponies by the most horrible mountain tracks, and sell very cheaply at the seaside, sufficiently indicates what might be done if good roads were made, and if the people were taught, encouraged, and protected. Sheep also do well on the mountains; and a breed of hardy ponies in much repute all over the Archipelago, runs half-wild, so that it appears as if this island, so barren-looking and devoid of the usual features of tropical vegetation, were yet especially adapted to supply a variety of products essential to Europeans, which the other islands will not produce, and which they accordingly import {{from the other side of}} the globe.|$|E
60|$|Their second {{accusation}} is, That {{we encourage}} and maintain arbitrary power in princes, and promote enslaving doctrines among the people. This {{they go about}} to prove by instances, producing the particular opinions of certain divines in King Charles the Second's reign; a decree of Oxford University,[5] and some few writers since the Revolution. What they mean, is the principle of passive obedience and non-resistance, which those who affirm, did, I believe, never intend should include arbitrary power. However, though I am sensible {{that it is not}} reckoned prudent in a dispute, to make any concessions without the last necessity; yet I do agree, that in my own private opinion, some writers did carry that tenet of passive obedience to a height, which seemed hardly consistent with the liberties of a country, whose laws can be neither enacted nor repealed, without the consent of the whole people. I mean not those who affirm it due in general, as it certainly is to the Legislature, but such as fix it entirely in the prince's person. This last has, I believe, been done by a very few; but when the Whigs quote authors to prove it upon us, <b>they</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> all who mention it as a duty in general, without applying it to princes, abstracted from their senate.|$|E
