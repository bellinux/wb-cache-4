5|$|The Indo-German {{alliance}} and <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy</b> were {{the target of}} a worldwide British intelligence effort, which was successful in preventing further attempts. American intelligence agencies arrested key figures {{in the aftermath of the}} Annie Larsen affair in 1917. <b>The</b> <b>conspiracy</b> resulted in the Lahore conspiracy case trials in India as well as the Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial—at the time the longest and most expensive trial ever held in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India. When {{a clear idea of}} <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy</b> emerged, more earnest and {{elaborate}} plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, who had arrived in the United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy</b> after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|For five months, Henry took {{no action}} on the accusations against his archbishop. <b>The</b> <b>conspiracy</b> was finally {{revealed}} to Cranmer by the king himself. According to Cranmer's secretary, Ralph Morice, sometime in September 1543 the king showed Cranmer a paper summarising the accusations against him. An investigation was to be mounted and Cranmer was appointed chief investigator. Surprise raids were carried out, evidence gathered, and ringleaders identified. Typically, Cranmer put the clergymen involved in <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy</b> through immediate humiliation, but he eventually forgave them and continued to use their services. To show his trust in Cranmer, Henry gave Cranmer his personal ring. When the Privy Council arrested Cranmer {{at the end of}} November, the nobles were stymied by the symbol of the king's trust in him. Cranmer's victory ended with two second-rank leaders imprisoned and Germain Gardiner executed.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>conspiracy</b> {{is known}} under several {{different}} names, including the 'Hindu Conspiracy', the 'Indo-German Conspiracy', the 'Ghadar conspiracy' (or 'Ghadr conspiracy'), or the 'German plot'. The term Hindu–German Conspiracy is {{closely associated with}} the uncovering of the Annie Larsen plot in the United States, and the ensuing trial of Indian nationalists and the staff of the German Consulate of San Francisco for violating American neutrality. The trial itself was called the Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial, and <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy</b> was reported in the media (and later studied by several historians) as Hindu–German Conspiracy. However, <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy</b> involved not only Hindus and Germans, but also substantial numbers of Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs, and strong Irish support that pre-dated German and Turkish involvement. The term Hindu was used commonly in opprobrium in America to identify Indians regardless of religion. Likewise, conspiracy was also a term with negative connotations. The term Hindu Conspiracy was used by the government to actively discredit the Indian revolutionaries at a time the United States was about to join the war against Germany.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{shipment}} {{was meant to}} supply the mutiny planned for February 1915, it was not dispatched until June of that year, by which time <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy</b> had been uncovered in India and major leaders had been arrested or gone into hiding.

The plot had already been infiltrated by British intelligence through Indian and Irish agents linked closely with <b>the</b> <b>conspiracy.</b> Upon returning to Hoquiam, Washington after several failed attempts, the Annie Larsen's cargo was promptly seized by US customs.

After Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, her influence had declined, and it was Afghanistan that was at the time seen by Britain as the only power in the sub-continent capable of directly threatening India.|$|E
