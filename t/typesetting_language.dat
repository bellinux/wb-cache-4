We have designed a language that is a full-function programming language with embedded text. This shift in emphasis results in a level of consistency, flexibility, and power not otherwise possible. Introduction A batch-style computer typesetting system accepts text files as input, to produce formatted documents as output. Most such systems are extensible. They allow definitions of new document styles and commands. Some, like T E X, also allow the input syntax to be changed. To do all this, {{the format of the}} input must be a complex language. The design of this language affects the robustness, ease of use, and overall quality of the whole system. A document, therefore, is a mix of text and commands, some of which define new comman [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The UNIX Operating System {{served as}} a killer {{application}} for the DEC PDP-11 minicomputer and VAX-11 minicomputer during roughly 1975-1985. Many of the PDP-11 and VAX-11 processors never ran DEC's operating systems (RSTS or VAX/VMS), but instead, they ran UNIX, which was first licensed in 1975. To get a virtual-memory UNIX (BSD 3.0) you had to purchase a VAX-11 computer. Many universities wanted a general-purpose timesharing system that would {{meet the needs of}} students and researchers (early versions of UNIX included free compilers for C, Fortran, and Pascal; at the time, offering even one free compiler was unprecedented). From its inception UNIX could drive high-quality typesetting equipment and later Postscript printers using the nroff/troff <b>typesetting</b> <b>language,</b> and this was also unprecedented for its time. UNIX was the first operating system offered in source-license form (a university license cost only $10,000, less than a PDP-11), allowing it to run on an unlimited number of machines, and allowing the machines to interface to any type of hardware because the UNIX I/O system was extensible.|$|E
