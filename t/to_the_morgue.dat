[...] He studied them and used their styles and themes in his early doodles. [...] After the foreign influences in his works were noticed by a family friend, Lat was advised by his father to observe and draw upon ideas from their surroundings instead. [...] Heeding the advice, the young cartoonist intimated himself with local happenings. [...] Tiga Sekawan was conceived as a humorous crime-fighting story of a local flavour.

What a ball player this Dunlap was and what an artist in getting the fat salaries! ... Dunlap was a real infielder of the type so popular ten years ago -- [...] one of the solid, bulky style through whom no grounder seemed able to pass, but who could nevertheless wave the hot ones goodbye with graceful ease when occasion demanded. [...] With the gloves now in use to aid, Dunny would have been even a bigger wonder now than then." ...|$|E
