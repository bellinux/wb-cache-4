5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> current technology controls our ability to manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control our ability to develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E

[...] Would it be possible, without asking permission of Congress, to employ a man like Saint-Gaudens {{to give us a}} coinage which would have some beauty?" [...] Roosevelt had Mint Director George E. Roberts write to Saint-Gaudens, who replied, [...] "I am extremely interested in the matter of the new designs of the coinage... it will I assure you give me great pleasure to assist in the procuring of good work." [...] Roosevelt caused the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign some of the coins which could be changed without the need for Congressional approval—the cent and the four gold coins. [...] No U.S. coin had ever been designed by anyone other than a Mint employee.|$|E
2500|$|The ‘argument from hallucination’ has {{traditionally}} {{been one of those}} used by proponents of the philosophical theory of representationalism against direct realism. [...] Representationalism holds that when perceiving the world we are not in direct contact with it, as common sense suggests, but only in direct contact with a representation of the world in consciousness. [...] That representation may be a more or less accurate one depending on our circumstances, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> health, and so on. [...] Direct realism, on the other hand, holds that the common sense or unthinking view of perception is correct, and that when perceiving the world we should be regarded as in direct contact with it, unmediated by any representation in consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|The 39th Division {{had been}} {{organized}} from National Guard units from Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and had adopted the name [...] "Delta Division" [...] {{since they were}} from the delta region of the Mississippi River. After being assigned as a depot division and eventually skeletonized, nothing {{had been done to}} adopt a shoulder patch until January 1919, when the 64th Field Artillery Brigade proposed a design for the division's insignia. The 64th had remained intact and had been reassigned as a Corps Artillery unit. The brigade commander, Brigadier General Ira A. Haynes, was the senior officer of what remained of the 39th Division. Haynes attempted to consult with the former division commander, Brigadier General H.C. Hodges, but Hodges had been reassigned to Scholfield Barracks in Hawaii. Haynes issued General Order #1, 64th Field Artillery Brigade, on 18 January 1819, which described the insignia and authorized its wear by remaining division personnel. The design was submitted to American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) for approval, but was rejected on the grounds than it only applied to the 64th Field Artillery Brigade (brigades were not authorized to have separate patches) and that the design was too similar to the 3rd Army patch. Haynes applied for reconsideration and, this time, was able to gain the support of Hodges. In his request for reconsideration, Haynes wrote, [...] "The States of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi have long been known as the Delta States. The 39th Division was known to ourselves at least as the Delta Division and our baggage was marked in that way. We take pride in Honoring <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> origin..." [...] The U.S. Army Adjutant General did not approve the patch, and told Hodges that it would be retained on file, and if the 39th Division were ever activated again, it would be reconsidered. When the 39th Division was reorganized following World War II, a different design was adopted. Nevertheless, many soldiers of the old 39th Division returned home wearing the unauthorized patch.|$|E
