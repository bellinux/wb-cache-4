The plan called upon local citizens to pledge to move their savings accounts to a local institution that would guarantee to invest <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> mortgages within Jamaica Plain. The plan eventually generated five hundred thousand dollars in pledges. In 1975 a contract was signed with the Jamaica Plain Cooperative Bank to implement the Community Investment plan.|$|E
25|$|In a {{press conference}} November 5, 2006, Chen rebutted the charges against his wife and members of his Presidential office. He said that Taiwan {{government}} offices advised him to prepare the receipts in such a fashion, and that {{after six years of}} doing so, it is strange that they would never mention an irregularity if it was not the right way to do it. He promised that all of the money actually went to diplomatic missions and did not go into any private pockets. Furthermore, he mentioned that when he took office, he thought his salary was so excessive that he cut his own salary in half, and that reduction is more than the amount he is accused of embezzling, so {{there is no need for}} him to take <b>that</b> <b>money.</b> <b>In</b> addition, he said that if the charges against his wife were proven in a court of law just as they were charged, then he would at that time step down as President of the Republic of China.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004 it was {{discovered}} that Portas's CDS-PP party had deposited 1,065,250 euros through 105 low-denomination deposits into the party's accounts in an attempt to circumvent monitoring regulations on political party funding and possibly on money-laundering (see smurfing). It was factually established that CDS-PP fabricated the donor receipts (including some using comical names such as [...] "Jacinto Leite Capelo Rego," [...] which in Portuguese is an erotic pun on words) but the real source of the money was never identified. In investigating, the police suspected the Espírito Santo Group (on whose bank the money was deposited) to have donated <b>that</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> connection with a tourism development named 'Portucale' in Benavente that entailed the cutting down of thousands of protected cork trees, which Paulo Portas, through his (until then) best friend and party colleague Luís Nobre Guedes, allegedly facilitated {{in the final days of}} the government to which they belonged. Paulo Portas denied any illegality and was not directly implicated in the case, while Nobre Guedes took the blame (and stopped talking to Paulo Portas). However, in investigating this case, the police intercepted phone calls that motivated another investigation into the costly purchase of two submarines by the Portuguese State (see below). It turned out that in addition to the Espírito Santo Group's real estate subsidiary in charge of the Portucale project (ESAF) there was another trading subsidiary (ESCOM) that was also an intermediary in a major submarines deal, for which it had received 30 million euros in advance and which was judicially suspected to have been the source of the CDS-PP deposits as a kickback pay-off for the submarines intermediation.|$|E

40|$|Money is the life-blood of any modern market-oriented economy. The {{level of}} money supply - the {{quantity}} and velocity of <b>money</b> circulated <b>in</b> such an economy would determine its health. The central issue in managing the economy is to understand how money supply is determined. The history of modern monetary economics actually has witnessed the emergence of two opposing views pertaining {{to the role of}} central bank in controlling the supply of <b>money</b> <b>in</b> an economy. A group of economists, known as monetarists, under the influence of Milton Friedman, contended <b>that</b> <b>money</b> supply <b>in</b> an economy is exogenously determined.
