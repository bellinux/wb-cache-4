Very {{little is known about}} the presence of these pathogens in commercially reared rabbits for the production of meat for human consumption. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. in intensively reared meat rabbits in Northern Italy, where a high density of meat rabbit farms is concentrated. Two hundred and sixty rectal swabs were collected from clinically healthy breeding does housed in 13 farms (20 swabs per farm) and submitted to microbiological examination to detect the presence of Campylobacter spp. following the procedure suggested by the OIE (2008). Out of 260 rectal swabs, none was found positive for <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. This finding indicates that meat rabbits could not be potential carriers of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. and could probably not play a role in the transmission of campylobacteriosis to humans...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter {{is one of}} {{the common}} causes of human {{gastroenteritis}} worldwide. The organism is transmitted mostly via foods of animal origin. The study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of contamination of raw beef, mutton and camel meat in Sokoto, Nigeria, with <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. and determined antibiotic susceptibilities of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. isolated from these carcasses. From March 2008 to February 2009, a total of 531 raw meat samples from beef (n= 242), mutton (n= 181) and camel (n= 108) were collected randomly from meat processing facilities and retail stalls in Sokoto, and were evaluated for the presence of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. <b>Thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. were isolated from 139 (26. 33 %) of the tested samples and the individual prevalence are 22. 08 %, 37. 22 % and 17. 49 % for beef, mutton and camel meat respectively. The most prevalent <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. isolates from the raw meat samples was Campylobacter jejuni (74. 10 %). The antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates were determined for 10 antibiotic, revealed that resistance to tetracycline was the most common (71. 4 %) resistance observed, followed by ciprofloxacin (42. 9 %) and nalidixic acid (37. 1 %). All the isolates tested were susceptible to chloramphenicol and gentamycin. The results of our study have demonstrated that high proportion of meat samples are contaminated by <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. which may have serious effects on public health. Most of the isolates are antimicrobial resistant strains. Campylobacteriosis is transmitted primarily through food of animal origin, the presence of antimicrobial-resistant strains in meat is of serious concern to food safety and public health...|$|E
40|$|The {{foodborne}} <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> {{species are}} considered to be the leading cause of human gastroenteritis worldwide with emerging antimicrobial resistant strains. Consumption of raw or undercooked meat is an important source for zoonotic infection. A cross-sectional study was conducted on sheep destined for slaughter at a slaughterhouse in Addis Ababa to determine the prevalence of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. A total of 160 carcass swabs and 160 rectal swabs were bacteriologically examined from which 21 (13. 1 %) and 12 (7. 5 %) <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. were isolated, respectively. Biochemical test results of the carcass isolates indicated 12 (57. 1 %) to be C. jejuni, 6 (28. 6 %) C. coli and 3 (14. 3 %) C. lari. Similar examination of abattoir environment pool samples of eight sampling days revealed 7 (87. 5 %) to be positive for the <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. None of the wash water samples were positive for the bacteria. Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern test towards twelve antimicrobials using standard disc diffusion method revealed higher resistance (38. 1 %) for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and kanamycin (38. 1 %) followed by streptomycin, oxytetracycline and compound sulphonamide (33. 3 % each). Most isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and clindamycin (4. 8 % each) and to a lesser degree to erythromycin (9. 5 %). Multidrug resistance was observed in 52. 4 % of the isolates examined. Isolation of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp., with higher isolation rate for C. jejuni, the primary cause of human campylobacteriosis, from sheep meat and the existence of resistant isolates highlight the potential threat to public health.

40|$|The term "spotty liver disease" (SLD) {{has been}} used since the late 1990 s for a {{condition}} seen in the UK and Australia that primarily affects free range laying hens around peak lay, causing acute mortality and a fall in egg production. A novel <b>thermophilic</b> SLD-associated <b>Campylobacter</b> {{was reported in the}} United Kingdom (UK) in 2015. Subsequently, similar isolates occurring in Australia were formally described as a new species, Campylobacter hepaticus. We describe the comparative genomics of 10 C. hepaticus isolates recovered from 5 geographically distinct poultry holdings in the UK between 2010 and 2012. Hierarchical gene-by-gene analyses of the study isolates and representatives of 24 known Campylobacter species indicated that C. hepaticus is most closely related to the major pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli. We observed low levels of within-farm variation, even between isolates collected over almost 3 years. With respect to C. hepaticus genome features, we noted that the study isolates had a ~ 140 Kb reduction in genome size, ~ 144 fewer genes, and a lower GC content compared to C. jejuni. The most notable reduction was in the subsystem containing genes for iron acquisition and metabolism, supported by reduced growth of C. hepaticus in an iron depletion assay. Genome reduction is common among many pathogens and in C. hepaticus has likely been driven at least in part by specialization following the occupation of a new niche, the chicken liver...|$|R

40|$|<b>Thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. {{infections are}} {{the main cause of}} human {{bacterial}} gastroenteritis worldwide, and currently representing a relevant public health problem. Furthermore, an increasing number of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> isolated from animals, humans and foodstuffs is resistant to antimicrobial drugs commonly used in therapy of human campylobacteriosis. Since the leading role of poultry in transmitting the infection to humans, this study was carried out to evaluate the presence and the antimicrobial susceptibility of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. in commercial broiler farms in Northern Italy. A total of 200 cloacal swabs from 10 chicken flocks were examined. Seven chicken flocks were positive for <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter.</b> C. jejuni was detected in 63. 8 % of positive samples and C. coli in 36. 2 %. The agar disk diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer, 1966) was used to test the susceptibility to 20 antimicrobial drugs of 36 C. jejuni isolates and 21 C. coli isolates. All isolates showed resistance to multiple antimicrobial drugs. Most isolates were resistant to quinolones, ampicillin and cephalosporins. A number of isolates was also resistant to oxytetracycline and sulphametoxazole+trimethoprim. Most isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid and cefotaxime, and all susceptible to chloramphenicol. Susceptibility to macrolides, clindamycin, oxytetracycline and streptomycin was different between C. coli and C. jejuni. Particularly, most of C. coli isolates were resistant to macrolides and clindamycin, while most C. jejuni were susceptible. This study showed a widespread presence of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> in commercial broilers and a high occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among them. Chicken meat represents one of the main sources of food-borne infection in humans and antimicrobial resistant isolates could be transmitted to humans through food. Therefore, antimicrobial resistance profiles of Campylobacter strains should be strictly monitored due to the relevant impact on public health...|$|E

40|$|Avian hosts {{constitute}} a natural reservoir for <b>thermophilic</b> Campylobacterspecies, primarily <b>Campylobacter</b> jejuni and Campylobacter coli, and poultry flocks are frequently colonized in the intestinal tract with {{high numbers of}} the organisms. Prevalence rates in poultry, especially in slaughter-age broiler flocks, could reach as high as 100 % on some farms. Despite the extensive colonization,Campylobacter is essentially a commensal in birds, although limited evidence has implicated the organism as a poultry pathogen. Although Campylobacter is insignificant for poultry health, it is {{a leading cause of}} food-borne gastroenteritis in humans worldwide, and contaminated poultry meat is recognized as the main source for human exposure. Therefore, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the development of interventions to diminish Campylobactercontamination in poultry, with the intention to reduce the burden of food-borne illnesses.

Four biotypes were also identified among the 19 C. coli strains: biotype 8 with 14 strains, biotype 5 and 7 with 2 strains, biotype 6 with 1 strain. Of the 80 strains isolated, 64 (51 C. jejuni and 13 C. coli) were assayed for typing. Data obtained with a passive hemagglutination technique showed a great variety of serotypes, the most common of which were serotypes 1 (12. 5 %) and 2 (10. 9 %), found in the species C. jejuni biotype 1 only.

The evidence of a seasonal trend in <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. contamination of raw milk sold for direct consumption, with an increase of the prevalence in warmer months, may represent one of the possible links between seasonal trend in cattle faecal shedding and seasonal trend in human campylobacteriosis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pathogen causing food borne illness in the world. In Tanzania, the risks of campylobacteriosis had not been studied yet and the risks especially from informally marketed foods are in a great need for assessment. A study on risk assessment for <b>Thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> infection through consumption of ready to eat beef in Arusha was therefore carried out from January to March 2010. METHODS: A total of 160 samples were collected from beef carcasses (swabs) in butcher (n= 73) and roast beef (nyama choma in Swahili language) (n= 45; one gram pieces) and skewer beef (mishikaki) (n= 42, one gram pieces) sold in beer bars. All the samples were served for isolation of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. The number of customers per hour was recorded in nine nyama choma and nine mishikaki centres for seven consecutive days. A risk model for assessing risk of campylobacteriosis due to the consumption of ready-to-eat beef was developed in @Risk (Palisade) and these data were fed into it. Dose-Response relationship was modeled using reported variables in literatures. Immunity against <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> for adults was modeled using the diarrhoeal data in a hospital reported in a separate study. Monte Carlo simulation was run for 10, 000 iterations and sensitivity analysis was run for 63 simulations in 1000 iterations. RESULTS: The overall contamination rate of ready-to-eat beef with <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> was 24 %. The probability of consuming contaminated meat with <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> at nyama choma pubs was 15. 5 % and at mishikaki shops was 34. 7 %. The total amount of beef sold at nyama choma pubs in Arusha municipality per day was 3, 595 kg (90 % CI: 1, 745 - 6, 173) and that sold as mishikaki per day was 165 kg (90 % CI: 57 - 328). The probability that a naturally immunized person develops illness when he/she ingests enough dose of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> causing illness to a susceptible person was 13. 1 % by point estimate. Risk characterization showed that the incidence rate of campylobacteriosis in Arusha per day was estimated as 6. 43 people (90 %CI: 3. 4 - 10. 4) per 1000 people. Sensitivity analysis found that the most sensitive risk input was initial population of Campylobacter in ready-to-eat beef which we did not study in the present study. SUMMARY: Contamination of carcasses with Campylobacter spp has indicated the need of applying good hygienic standards at all levels from farm to table in order to ensure food wholesomeness and safety in beef. Public education programmes, consumer awareness and training of food handlers on general food hygiene are recommended to reduce potential health risks to the public. Additional studies on the concentration of Campylobacter in different stages of value chain especially on the surfaces of ready-to-eat beef is required to update the present study for the more reliable risk characterization...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the presence of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. using the conventional cultural technique from neck skin, intestinal contents of slaughtered chickens, and water, feed samples of same flock taken at the farm level. C. jejuni strains obtained using conventional cultural techniques were confirmed using the PCR technique. Method: 384 samples consisting of 160 chicken neck skin, 160 intestinal content, 32 feed, and 32 water samples were obtained from two different slaughterhouses in hot (May, June, July, August) and cold months (November, December, January, February). The enrichment based ISO (The International Organization for Standardization, 10272) method was used for the isolation and identification of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. in all samples. Strains were verified by ceuE gene. Results: 248 (64. 58 %) of the 384 samples were found to be contaminated with <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> species. 138 (86. 25 %) of the 160 chicken neck skin, 106 (66. 25 %) of the intestinal content and 4 (12. 5 %) of the 32 water samples were contaminated with <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> species. Nothing was found in the analysis of feed. C. jejuni was the species of Campylobacter determined in 82 (51. 25 %) of the 138 neck skin samples, 122 (76. 25 %) of the 106 intestinal contents samples and three of the four sets of drinker samples. All the factors identified in the drinkers were isolated from bowl type ones and Campylobacter species could not be determined in none of the samples of nipple type watering system. C. jejuni was determined in 116 (% 60. 42) of the samples in hot months and 91 (% 47. 40) in cold months of the 192 samples in total taken from each farm, 80 intestinal content, 80 neck, 16 water and 16 feed samples). Contamination rate for the samples taken in warmer months was 14. 20 % higher than in colder months and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0. 0021). 171 (82. 00 %) of the 207 C. jejuni strains defined by classical culture methods were also confirmed with PCR technique. 1220 <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> strains isolated from 384 samples in total and they were identified in 649 as C. jejuni, 515 as C. coli and 56 as C. lari according to ISO methods. Conclusion: It was determined that C. jejuni contamination of chicken flocks in slaughter houses occurs during the processing. ceuE gene is found to be a good primer for confirmation of the presence of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. in the strains. Data acquired from this study underlines that Campylobacter jejuni found in poultry meat is an important public health hazard...|$|E
40|$|In October and November 1978 two {{outbreaks}} of enteritis {{occurred in the}} north of England. Symptoms lasted two to over eight days but in no case necessitated admission to hospital.

Examination of rectal swabs from the cattle concerned and milk socks yielded strains of Campylobacter sp indistinguishable from those isolated from the patients. It was therefore concluded that, since campylobacters are not known to be excreted in milk, faecal contamination of the milk had probably occurred and had led to these outbreaks.

40|$|A {{total of}} 593 strains of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> species were {{isolated}} either from humans with diarrhea or from poultry in King County, Washington. Of these strains, 98 (52 hippurate-positive strains and all 46 of the hippurate-negative strains) {{were selected for}} further phenotypic characterization and genetic classification. Hippurate hydrolysis, the test typically used to differentiate Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, did not always correlate with the genetic classification. All hippurate-positive strains were classified as C. jejuni. Of the hippurate-negative strains, 20 % were C. jejuni, 78 % were C. coli, and 2 % were C. laridis. Assuming that the remaining hippurate-positive strains were all C. jejuni, then hippurate-negative C. jejuni represented a small percentage (9 of 556 or 1. 6 %) of C. jejuni strains but a significant percentage (9 of 46 or 20 %) of hippurate-negative strains.

Bayesian inference from two surveys showed that the contamination rates of nyamachoma and mishikaki were 7. 7 % (90 %CI: 4. 3 %- 11. 8 %) and 34. 7 % (90 %CI: 21. 3 %- 49. 1 %) respectively. The MPN was 0. 37 (95 %CI: 0. 07 - 1. 0). Every day, 1. 4 % (90 % CI: 0. 8 - 2. 3 %) of customers consuming either nyamachoma or mishikaki in pubs in Arusha was estimated to develop campylobacteriosis. The annual incidence was 248 (95 %CI: 127 - 406) per 1000 people among whole population of Arusha Municipality and one forth of people was estimated to become sick once a year. The most sensitive factors were contamination rate of ready-to-eat beef and the MPN. From observation, beef was well roasted and the high prevalence could be due to post-roast contamination. Hygiene training focused on such contamination could reduce the incidence greatly...|$|E

Furthermore, Campylobacter species distribution analysis and genetic characterization of isolates were carried out, and their antimicrobial susceptibility profile was determined. Three flocks belonging to three different intensive farms located {{in the province of}} Vicenza, Veneto region, were examined. Samples were regularly collected at weekly intervals up to Campylobacter colonization of the flocks, then twice a month up to time of slaughter. A conventional culture method and a multiplex end-point PCR assay were used for Campylobacter detection and identification, respectively. Selected isolates were genetically characterized by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) –PCR and by flaA short variable region (SVR) DNA sequencing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolates was performed by disk diffusion method. A high occurrence of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> infection was detected, with colonization of birds persisting throughout the whole production cycle. Both C. jejuni and C. coli were recovered and a high genetic diversity was observed among them. Moreover, antimicrobial-resistance appeared to be widely spread among turkey campylobacters...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{sources of}} Campylobacter spp. in poultry meat before slaughter were studied by examining samples of feathers, cloaca swabs, litter swabs, transport coops, rinse water from coop washing equipment, and chicken breast supports in the slaughter line just before stunning. The {{samples were collected}} from 8 broiler houses and from 8 different producers, from a poultry integration system in southern Brazil. The study was carried out over a 12 -month period, and each broiler house was sampled in three consecutive flocks, {{for a total of}} 24 flocks/broiler house. Campylobacter was found in 79. 2 % of the feather samples, followed by cloacal swabs (75. 0 %) and transport coop (50. 0 %), litter (37. 5 %), breast support (33. 3 %) and coop rinse water (25. 0 %) samples.

40|$|International audienceCampylobacter {{species are}} one of the leading causes of {{bacterial}} gastroenteritis in humans worldwide. This twofold study was sought to: i) develop and optimize four single-tube multiplex PCR (mPCR) assays for the detection of six virulence (ciaB, dnaJ, flaA, flaB, pldA and racR), three toxin (cdtA, cdtB and cdtC) and one antibiotic resistance tet(O) genes in <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. and ii) apply and evaluate the developed mPCR assays by testing 470 previously identified C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari isolates from agricultural water. In each mPCR assay, a combination of two or three sets of primer pairs for virulence, antibiotic resistance and toxin (VAT) genes was used and optimized. Assay 1 was developed for the detection of dnaJ, racR and cdtC genes with expected amplification sizes of 720, 584 and 182 bp. Assay 2 generated PCR amplicons for tet(O) and cdtA genes of 559 and 370 bp. Assay 3 amplified cdtB ciaB, and pldA genes with PCR amplicon sizes of 620, 527 and 385 bp. Assay 4 was optimized for flaA and flaB genes that generated PCR amplicons of 855 and 260 bp. The primer pairs and optimized PCR protocols did not show interference and/or cross-amplification with each other and generated the expected size of amplification products for each target VAT gene for the C. jejuni ATCC 33291 reference strain. Overall, all ten target VAT genes were detected at a variable frequency in tested isolates of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. where cdtC, flaB, ciaB, cdtB, cdtA and pldA were commonly detected compared to the flaA, racR, dnaJ and tet(O) genes which were detected with less frequency. The developed mPCR assays are simple, rapid, reliable and sensitive tools for simultaneously assessing potential pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance profiling in <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. The mPCR assays will be useful in diagnostic and analytical settings for routine screening of VAT characteristics of Campylobacter spp. as well as being applicable in epidemiological studies by providing information that could be related to the risk of human infection...|$|E
40|$|Intestinal <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> species produce stable {{patterns}} when {{subjected to}} bacterial restriction endonuclease DNA analysis (BRENDA); {{this technique is}} therefore of considerable value in epidemiological studies. BRENDA {{was used to examine}} <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> species from humans, wild and domestic animals. One hundred and ninety-four (61 %) of 316 isolates of Campylobacter jejuni from humans had BRENDA patterns which could be matched to those of animal isolates. Poultry appear to be a major source of infection for C. jejuni in humans with nearly half (49. 7 %) of the human isolates giving patterns which were indistinguishable from those isolated from poultry. A total of 60 BRENDA types were identified from 316 human isolates and 11 of these had the same pattern as those isolated from poultry. One of the three Campylobacter coli BRENDA types recovered from poultry was indistinguishable from a human isolate type. Pigs appear to be only a minor source of C. coli infection for humans in New Zealand. Rats were found to be infected with strains of C. jejuni with BRENDA patterns indistinguishable from those infecting humans, poultry and a horse.

40|$|Aims: To {{develop a}} {{real-time}} (rt) PCR for species differentiation of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> {{and to develop}} a method for assessing co-colonization of pigs by Campylobacter spp. Methods and results: The specificity of a developed 5 ’nuclease rt-PCR for species-specific identification of C. jejuni, C. coli, C. lari, C. upsaliensis and of a hipO gene nucleotide probe for detection of C. jejuni by colony-blot hybridization were determined by testing a total of 75 reference strains of Campylobacter spp. and related organisms. The rt-PCR method allowed species-specific detection of Campylobacter spp. in naturally infected pig faecal samples after an enrichment step, whereas the hybridization approach enhanced the specific isolation of C. jejuni (present in minority to C. coli) from pigs. Conclusions: The rt-PCR was specific for Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, C. lari, and C. upsaliensis and the colony-blot hybridization approach provided an effective tool for isolation of C. jejuni from pig faecal samples typically dominated by C. coli. Significance and impact of study: Species differentiation between <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> is difficult by phenotypic methods and the developed rt-PCR provides an easy and fast method for such differentiation. Detection of C. jejuni by colony hybridization may increase the isolation rate of this species from pig feces. ...|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter jejuni {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{sporadic}} food-borne bacterial disease in humans. In intensive poultry and pig rearing systems the use of oral antibiotics is essential to maintain health. Consequently, there is a high risk for the <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> jejuni and C. coli resident in the intestinal tract of food animals to develop resistance to commonly used antibiotics. Contamination of meat or eggs with pathogenic strains of resistant Campylobacter could, therefore, result in a form of campylobacteriosis in humans that is difficult to treat. The aim of this investigation was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. isolated from pigs and poultry by the broth microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test. A total of 482 samples from the Western Cape and Gauteng provinces was collected and analysed. Thirty-eight Campylobacter isolates were obtained. Analysis of data revealed that C. jejuni strains mainly of poultry origin were more resistant to the fluoroquinolones, macrolides and tetracyclines and the C. coli strains were more resistant to the macrolides and lincosamides. Multiresistance was also detected in 4 Campylobacter strains from the Western Cape. With the exception of tetracyclines, strains from high health Gauteng broiler farms were susceptible to antibiotics used to treat Campylobacter infections...|$|E

The study ran for 12 months from January 2003, involved 93 abattoirs and collected 7703 intestinal samples. The design was similar to two previous abattoir surveys undertaken in 1999 – 2000 allowing comparisons. Samples were examined for VTEC O 157, Salmonella, <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> and Yersinia enterocolitica. The prevalence of VTEC O 157 faecal carriage was 4 · 7 % in cattle, 0 · 7 % in sheep and 0 · 3 % in pigs. A significant decrease in sheep was detected from the previous survey (1 · 7 %). Salmonella carriage was 1 · 4 % in cattle, a significant increase from the previous survey of 0 · 2 %. In sheep, faecal carriage was 1 · 1 % a significant increase from the previous survey (0 · 1 %).

40|$|<b>Thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. {{represent}} {{the most common}} zoonotic microorganisms implicated in human food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide. Campylobacter species are widespread in nature and the digestive systems of wild and domestic birds and mammals are the principal reservoirs of these microorganisms. Poultry and poultry products {{represent the}} main source of infection for human beings. Notwithstanding the epidemiology of Campylobacter spp. infections in chickens is well known and investigated, few data are still available on the infection in commercial meat turkeys. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the occurrence of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. in commercial meat turkeys and to analyze the trend of infection during the entire production cycle. Furthermore, the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and the strain diversity of isolates were investigated. Between September 2009 and May 2010, a monitoring was performed in 3 commercial meat turkey flocks belonging to 3 different farms located in Northern Italy (Veneto region). Two flocks of females and one flock of males were monitored (investigation in two flocks is still ongoing). First sampling was carried out at the hatchery, where 60 samples of meconium were collected from day-old birds. Thereafter, 60 cloacal swabs were taken at farm at weekly intervals up to the Campylobacter colonization of the flock, then twice every month up to the transport to the slaughterhouse. Samples were immediately transported to the laboratory and examined within 2 - 3 hrs to detect the presence of <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. following the procedure suggested by OIE (2008). Genus and species identification was carried out by end-point multiplex PCR method as indicated by Yamazaki-Matsune et al. (2007). Out of three flocks, <b>thermophilic</b> <b>Campylobacter</b> spp. were detected only in one female flock. Birds became positive for Campylobacter spp. by day 14 and the infection persisted in the flock up to the transport to the slaughterhouse. Both Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were isolated. C. coli was the predominant species at the beginning (sampling at day 14) and at the end of the production cycle (sampling at days 56, 70 and 82), whereas C. jejuni was predominant in the remainder of the cycle. To date (77 days of age), no Campylobacter spp. have been detected in the other two turkey flocks. Among isolates from each sampling, 15 Campylobacter jejuni and 15 Campylobacter coli isolates were selected and tested by the agar disc diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer, 1966) for antimicrobial susceptibility to 20 drugs belonging to the following classes: aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, penicillines, quinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, sulfonamides + diaminopyrimidines, tetracyclines, and phenicols. All C. jejuni and C. coli isolates showed similar antimicrobial-resistance profiles and both were cross-resistant to 3 to 15 antimicrobials.
