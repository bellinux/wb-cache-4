The Hamiltonian {{of a body}} moving in central gravitational field separates on two parts: orbital movement about central body and a rotation around the body mass center. For the small bodies like asteroids the separation spin-orbit constant has rate 10 - 12 of total energy and orbital and rotational motion are almost independent. This way we may consider orbital motion as a known function of time or true anomaly. Using the Hamiltonian I found gravitational torque affecting triaxial body in quadruple approximation. The Euler-Liouville equation is a system of non-linear differential equations.

We measured the kinematics and activity of individual motoneurons in loaded and unloaded leg movements in an insect. To evaluate {{the role of}} active and passive musculoskeletal properties in aiming and load compensation, we used a neuromechanical model of the femur–tibia joint that transformed measured extensor and flexor motoneuron spikes into joint kinematics. The model comprises three steps: first, an activation dynamics module that determines {{the time course of}} isometric force; second, a pair of antagonistic muscle models that determine the joint torque; and third, a forward dynamics simulation that calculates the movement of the limb. The muscles were modeled in five variants, differing in {{the presence or absence of}} force–length–velocity characteristics of the contractile element, a parallel passive elastic element, and passive joint damping. Each variant was optimized to yield the best simulation of measured behavior. Passive muscle force and viscous joint damping were sufficient and necessary to simulate the observed movements. Elastic or damping properties of the active contractile element could not replace passive elements. Passive elastic forces were similar in magnitude to active forces caused by muscle contraction, generating substantial joint stiffness. Antagonistic muscles co-contract, although there was no motoneuronal coactivation, because of slow dynamics of muscle activation.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Women’s {{gymnastics}} has {{the highest}} injury incidence rates for NCAA female college athletes. Gymnastics maneuvers may require support and transfer of the entire body weight from the feet to the hands. Such motions cause excessive loading and stress across joint surfaces which on occasion can exceed the mechanical strength of upper limb joints and supportive musculoskeletal structures, resulting in injuries ranging from acute fractures to chronic overuse injuries like osteochondritis dissecans. Recent technological advances have only now {{made it possible to}} analyze the complex and simultaneous motions in multiple planes required for evaluation of even the most basic gymnastic maneuvers like the round-off back handspring (ROBHS). OBJECTIVES: There is a paucity of data characterizing upper extremity injury causation and biomechanical risk factors in the small number of gymnastics studies conducted. The first hand contact for any gymnastics skill has never been quantitatively assessed. Therefore, the primary objective {{of this study is to}} perform a detailed 3 D biomechanical characterization of the round-off back handspring (ROBHS) first hand contact and evaluate any potential correlations to upper extremity injury determinants. METHODS:	 A 3 D motion capture camera and force plate system captured the relative positon of reflective markers affixed to 62 anatomical positions on subjects during performance of an ROBHS. A virtual model of each subject was constructed using Nexus C-motion software. Programming with Visual 3 D and MATLAB software was used to calculate desired force, kinematic and kinetic variables such as joint torques and angles. Past medical history questionnaires were administered, and clinical range of motion and strength measures were assessed. RESULTS: Compared with other factors analyzed, hand contact order appeared to have the highest degree of influence on upper extremity biomechanics at both the time of initial contact and throughout the entire movement sequence. The second contact limb was correlated with a larger average ground contact force, whereas while the first contact limb was related to a shorter time to peak force development and larger magnitude rotational kinematic variables, especially at the elbow—the primary site of upper extremity injury. For the first hand contact, torque development at the elbow and shoulder appeared to be related, and wrist and shoulder variables were presumably related to ground reaction force (GRF) development. The proposed literature elbow injury mechanism may need some adjustment to reflect the impact of elbow flexion angle on GRF and elbow valgus <b>torque,</b> <b>key</b> variables tied to chronic elbow joint capsule overload injuries. CONCLUSIONS: The novel information provided by this study can be used to guide future recommendations for the prevention of upper extremity injury in gymnastics training and competition. Improved understanding of associated force, kinetic, and kinematic biomechanical variables like joint torque could have implications for movement specific body positioning with the potential for extrapolation to gymnastics moves with similar loading patterns. Possible protective technique interventions based on study findings include increasing second hand elbow flexion during the round-off phase of motion or minimizing the time between hand contacts...|$|E
3000|$|It is, however, {{difficult}} {{to calculate the}} real archwire/slot play and torque expression, which needs {{to take into account}} all the dimensional parameters, and results do not readily lend themselves to generalizations due to the great variability in archwire and bracket slot dimensions between manufacturers, even if they are nominally the same. Indeed, Huang et al. [17] used finite elements analysis to evaluate the play and torque expression of pre-angled appliances, but failed to consider the bevelled edges of the archwires, meaning that those results have little bearing in real-world scenarios. Badawi et al. [18] also set out to measure the archwire/slot play and torque angles, using a dynamometer that engaged the ends of the archwire and progressively rotated it in the slot. We also used a dynamometer, but adopted a <b>torquing</b> <b>key,</b> as proposed by Flores et al. [19],[20] to help us measure the torque and play. This approach has the advantage of taking all geometric factors of the archwire and slot into consideration, thereby providing authentic values for play and torque.

40|$|Few computationalmodels have {{addressed}} the spatiotemporal features of unconstrained three-dimensional (3 D) armmotion. Empirical observations made on hand paths, speed profiles, and arm postures during point-to-point movements led to the assumption that hand path and arm posture are independent of movement speed, suggesting that the geometric and temporal properties of movements are decoupled. In this study, we present a computational model of 3 D movements for an arm with four degrees of freedom {{based on the assumption}} that optimization principles are separately applied at the geometric and temporal levels of control. Geometric properties (path andposture) aredefined in termsof geodesic pathswith respect to thekinetic energymetric in theRiemannian configuration space. Accordingly, a geodesic path can be generated with less muscular effort than on any other, nongeodesic path, because the sum of all configuration-speed-dependent torques vanishes. The temporal properties of the movement (speed) are determined in task space by minimizing the squared jerk along the selected end-effector path. The integration of both planning levels into a single spatiotemporal representation simplifies the control of arm dynamics along geodesic paths and results inmovements with nearminimal torque change and minimal peak value of kinetic energy. Thus, the application of Riemannian geometry allows for a reconciliation of computational models previously proposed for the description of arm movements. We suggest that geodesics are an emergent property of the motor system through the exploration of dynamical space.

A third initial condition, the radial shape of the density profile, plays a smaller, but noticeable role. Regarding the dynamical development of the ROI, the instability a) begins after systems collapse to their most compact configuration and b) evolves fastest when a majority of the particles have radially anisotropic orbits while {{there is a lack of}} centrally-concentrated isotropic orbits.

Subsequently, 6 core materials with different compositions (Durafill, Adaptic, Coradent, Ti-Core, Hytac Aplitip, and Photac-Fil Aplitip) were applied to titanium posts that were previously coated with 2 types of light-polymerized opaquers, either Artglass or Dentacolor. Sixty air-abraded titanium posts (250 mum, 30 seconds) were used as controls for each core material. Following thermocycling (5 degrees- 55 degreesC, 30 seconds, 5000 cycles), maximum torsional forces were determined with an electronic <b>torque</b> movement <b>key.</b> Data were statistically analyzed by 1 -way analysis of variance followed by 2 -way analysis of variance (P Results. Significantly higher mean torsional forces were observed with respect to Siloc (20. 4 Newton decimeter [dNm]), Silicoater Classical (18. 6 dNm), Silicoatcr MD (18. 2 dNm), and Rocatec (17. 0 dNm) systems compared with the mean for the untreated control group (14. 6 dNm) (P. 001). The Kevloc system in combination with the Artglass opaquer and Photac-Fil Aplitip (0. 00 dNm) core material showed no resistance against torsional forces. Significant differences were observed between hybrid core materials and microfilled composite, compomer, or resin-modified glass ionomer core materials (P Conclusion. Within the limitations of this study, the resistance to torsional forces for the core materials on titanium posts increased with the use of chemical surface-conditioning techniques and varied in accordance with the opaquer type. Type of core material also significantly influenced the resistance after thermocycling...|$|R
40|$|Theories of {{topographic}} instability predict {{growth of}} perturbations of mean flow and wave modes {{due to their}} interaction with mountains under favorable conditions. Mountain torques form {{an important part of}} this interaction. It has been suggested that topographic instabilities contribute significantly to the subseasonal variability of the atmosphere but observational tests of topographic instability mechanisms have not yet been performed. Greenland is selected as a test bed because of its isolation, simple shape, and appropriate size. The observed flow development during mountain torque events is investigated in terms of a regression analysis. Changes of axial angular momentum and zonal mean wind with respect to the torques are monitored for domains covering Greenland since the acceleration (deceleration) of the regional zonal flow in response to a positive (negative) <b>torque</b> is a <b>key</b> feature of topographic instability. In particular, southern and northern analysis domains are considered separately in order to test “dipole” instability theories in addition to “monopole” situations where the meridional extent of the pressure perturbations {{is similar to that of}} Greenland. Moreover, zonal bands are used as analysis domains. It is found that the response of the zonal wind to the torques is quite small and not systematic. There is no evidence of monopole or dipole topographic instability. A less detailed analysis for the Tibetan Plateau leads to the same result. Reasons for these negative outcomes are discussed as are shortcomings of the tests...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{different}} methods to analyze power transmission systems with computer software {{to aid in}} detection of faulty or damaged systems. It is split into three sections. The first section involves utilizing finite element software to analyze gear stiffness and stresses. A quasi-static and dynamic analysis are done on two sets of fixed axis spur gears and a planetary gear system using ABAQUS to analyze the stress, strain and gear mesh stiffness variation. In the second section, the vibrational patterns produced by a simple bevel gear system are investigated by an experiment and by dynamic modeling in ADAMS. Using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the dynamic contact forces, a comprehensive frequency-domain analysis will reveal unique vibration spectra at distinct frequencies around the gear mesh frequencies, their super- and sub- harmonics, and their side-band modulations. ADAMS simulation results are then compared with the experimental results. Constraints, bearing resistant <b>torques,</b> and other <b>key</b> parameters are applied {{as closely as possible}} to real operating conditions. The third section looks closely at the dynamic contact forces of a practical two-stage planetary gear. Using the same FFT approach in the second section, a frequency-domain analysis will reveal distinct frequencies around both the first-stage and the second-stage gear mesh frequencies, and their harmonics. In addition, joint time-frequency analysis (JTFA) will be applied to damaged and undamaged planetary gear systems with transient start-up conditions to observe how the frequency contents of the contact force evolve over time...|$|R

This conference paper {{was presented at the}} 7 th International Styrian Noise, Vibration & Harshness Congress, Graz, Austria, 2013. [URL] paper presents an investigation into Elastohydrodynamic (EHL) modeling of differential hypoid gears {{that can be used in}} coupling with Newtonian (or multibody) dynamics to study Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) phenomena, such as axle whine. The latter is a noise of a tonal nature, emitted from differential axles, characterised by the gear meshing frequency and its multiples. It appears at a variety of operating conditions; during drive and coasting, high and low <b>torque</b> loading. <b>Key</b> design targets for differential hypoid gears are improved efficiency and reduced vibration, which depend critically on the formation of an EHL lubricant film. The stiffness and damping of the oil film and friction generated in the contact can have important effects and cannot be neglected when examining the NVH behaviour of hypoid gears. The operating conditions in hypoid gears are usually characterized by high load, relatively low speeds, angled flow and elliptical contact footprint of high aspect ratio. Some extrapolated/empirical equations to estimate friction and film thickness have been reported for moderate loads. However, their use in hypoid gears is questionable. Additionally, the majority of reported numerical models for film thickness and friction have not been applied under such operating conditions. In this paper a numerical model of EHL elliptical point contact has been presented to obtain the EHL film behaviour under the usual range of operating conditions of hypoid gears. Realistic engine torque-speed characteristics are used. For these conditions, the load share per teeth pair contact is in the region of 500 - 6000 N. A suitable method of solution is applied to ease the convergence of the numerical method, namely the distributed line low relaxation effective influence Newton-Raphson method. As the result of the angled direction of the entraining flow in the contact of hypoid gear teeth pairs, this method has been found to be suitable, thus adopted. The geometric and kinematic input data for EHL calculations are calculated using Tooth Contact Analysis (TCA) ...|$|R
