30|$|The {{magnetic}} <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> {{has many}} advantages, such as durability, wide application, high reliability, and good prospects for development. It is widely concerned by researchers. ShaoPeng studied a ring <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> [7] {{based on the}} counter magnetostriction effect of amorphous alloy. It used the method of sticking the ribbon of the amorphous alloy. However, it was large, not easy to install, and not easy to monitor the torque in real time. Meng et al. studied a non-contact <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> [8] based on the change of magnetic induction, which was not suitable for dynamic measurement of torque because it needed manually adjusting two digital potentiometers. Muro et al. studied a ring <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> [9] based on the measurement of magnetic field by the Hall detection circuit, and magnetostrictive effect whose measuring range was small. Jiles studied the theory of magnetomechanical effects [10] and it provided a theoretical basis for the magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>sensor.</b> Sablik et al. studied the magnetostriction when the magnetic shaft suffered a tensile or compressive stress and applied a magnetic field. The stress and magnetic field were coaxial [11]. The <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> proposed in this paper uses the non-contact signal extraction circuit to detect the deflection angle of magnetization vector and explores {{the relationship between the}} deflection angle and the torque; instead of using the wireless communication equipment, the non-contact torque measurement is realized directly.|$|R

For this purpose, it is essential to develop a dynamometer with high sensitivity and high natural frequency which is suited to these conditions.

The paper has also discussed integration of the <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> technology with the overall electrical system of the vehicle. Incorporating the components of <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> technology reduces the human effort immensely by providing assistance from the battery bank to drive a hub motor while maneuvering the wheelchair using the <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> pedal. Field tests were carried out in three different stages, one with pedal, one with the throttle only, and with varying the load on the wheelchair, to distinguish the effect of load test on battery performance using the pedal. Results of the field tests reveal that the state of charge of batteries has been minimized using the pedal due to the contribution of the muscular energy of the user along with the battery energy to meet the total energy demand of the motor. Analyzing test results with the <b>torque</b> <b>sensor</b> pedal clarifies that the vehicle covers a longer distance, lessens power dissipation from the batteries, and reduces energy consumption from the batteries, which leads to improvement of the battery performance and its longevity ensuring sustainability of the electric vehicle...|$|R
