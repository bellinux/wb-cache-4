5|$|Edward {{refurbished}} {{the royal}} palaces, reintroduced the traditional ceremonies, {{such as the}} State Opening of Parliament, {{that his mother had}} forgone, and founded new honours, such as the Order of Merit, to recognise contributions to the arts and sciences. In 1902, the Shah of Persia, Mozzafar-al-Din, visited England expecting to receive the Order of the Garter. Edward refused to bestow the honour on the Shah because the order was meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> personal gift and the Foreign Secretary, Lord Lansdowne, had promised it without his consent. Edward also objected to inducting a Muslim into a Christian order of chivalry. His refusal threatened to damage British attempts to gain influence in Persia, but Edward resented his ministers' attempts to reduce the King's traditional powers. Eventually, he relented and Britain sent a special embassy to the Shah with a full Order of the Garter the following year.|$|E

5|$|During a {{match with}} Mr. Kennedy on the October 1, 2007 episode of Raw, Cena {{suffered}} a legitimate torn pectoral muscle while executing a hip toss. Though finishing the match and {{taking part in}} the scripted attack by Orton after the match, surgery the following day found that his pectoralis major muscle was torn completely from the bone, estimating at the time to require seven months to a year of rehabilitation. As a result, Cena was stripped of the title by Mr. McMahon on the next night's episode of ECW, ending what was the longest WWE Championship reign in over 19 years. Cena's surgery was performed by orthopedic surgeon James Andrews at St. Vincent's Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Two weeks later in a video update on WWE.com, Dr. Andrews and Cena's physical trainer both said that he was several weeks ahead of where he was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> rehabilitation at that time. Despite his injury, Cena attended the annual WWE's Tribute to the Troops show filmed at Camp Speicher in Tikrit, Iraq on December 7, and aired on December 24.|$|E
5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages {{in the very early}} stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} painters of northern Italy was Andrea Mantegna of Padua, who had the good fortune <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> teen years at the time in which the great Florentine sculptor Donatello was working there. Donatello created the enormous equestrian bronze, the first since the Roman Empire, of the condotiero Gattemelata, still visible on its plinth in the square outside the Basilica of Sant'Antonio. He also worked on the high altar and created a series of bronze panels in which he achieved a remarkable illusion of depth, with perspective in the architectural settings and apparent roundness of the human form all in very shallow relief.|$|E
25|$|On {{the back}} of his {{performances}} for Oxford University in which he gained his Blue, Evans was offered a trial for {{the latter half of the}} 1939 season by Glamorgan, making his debut against the touring West Indians at Cardiff Arms Park. Following this match there was talk of him becoming a long-term replacement for Jack Mercer, but with the start of World War II and the subsequent cancellation of county cricket, this was not <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> brief time with Glamorgan, Evans scored 164 runs at an average of 12.61, with a high score of 36. With the ball, he took 5 wickets, although these came at a fairly expensive average of 66.20. Following the war he opted not to continue his cricket career, but instead to focus on a career in teaching.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Annie and Dixon {{are going}} through rough times after their parents' divorce and attempt to keep the family close. Debbie deals {{with the realities of}} being a newly single mother. Annie has spent the summer on house arrest (in {{addition}} to being on probation and having a suspended license) after confessing to her hit-and-run. Annie and Liam have feelings for each other but think it best to put it away so it doesn't interfere with their relationships with others. Annie finds romance with a college student, Charlie, who turns out to be Liam's half-brother. Charlie and Annie {{have a lot in common}} and both are theater kids. Liam has a tumultuous relationship with Charlie due to their rocky past. Teddy and Silver are happy to be together, but in the earthquake Teddy injures his leg, which could possibly end his tennis career. Teddy is also struggling with his sexuality, after realizing that he drunkenly slept with another guy, Ian. After some discouraging behavior from Teddy, Silver breaks up with him. This discouraging behavior was a result of Teddy being so insecure with himself being gay. With all that going on in school, Adrianna is driving back from a summer of touring with the pop star, Javier. The two become a couple until Navid reveals to Adrianna that he has never stopped loving her, and she dumps Javier for Navid. Although he initially resolves to get her back, Javier becomes angered by this. He tells her that her singing career is over, before dying in a car crash, which Adrianna survives. She steals Javier's song book and performs one of his songs at his memorial service, which becomes a hit. She is then blackmailed by Javier's uncle, Victor, who becomes her manager and takes a huge portion of her earnings and forces her to do some things she finds uncomfortable, such as taking half naked photos and forming a snobby famous image that did not exist before. Navid, realizing the blackmail, asks Adrianna not to give in to the threats of Victor. Adrianna decides to take control of her career from Victor after seeing herself on the cover of a magazine. She begins to treat Victor badly and starts alienating Navid and her friends. Navid, however, begins to have family problems when he and Silver discover that his father has been employing underage girls <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> porn films. Adrianna is oblivious to his problems, causing him and Silver to become closer.|$|E

500|$|On October 3, 1849, Poe {{was found}} delirious {{on the streets}} of Baltimore, [...] "in great distress, and... in need of {{immediate}} assistance", according to Joseph W. Walker who found him. He was taken to the Washington Medical College where he died on Sunday, October 7, 1849 at 5:00 in the morning. Poe was never coherent long enough to explain how he came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> dire condition and, oddly, was wearing clothes that were not his own. He is said to have repeatedly called out the name [...] "Reynolds" [...] on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring.

500|$|During {{planning}} stages, the 1942 {{operation was}} known as [...] "Anvil", to complement Operation Sledgehammer, {{at that time the}} code name for the invasion of Normandy. Subsequently, both plans were renamed, Sledgehammer becoming Operation Overlord, and Anvil becoming Operation Dragoon. The original idea of an invasion of Southern France had come from General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff already in 1942. It was supported at the Tehran Conference in late 1943 by Joseph Stalin, who, in discussions with Franklin D. Roosevelt, advocated for it as an inherent part of Overlord, preferring to have the Allies in the far west instead of an alternative landing in the Balkans as he considered them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> zone of influence. Marshall insisted that it be included in the strategic planning, and Roosevelt found it unpalatable to cancel the operation.|$|E
