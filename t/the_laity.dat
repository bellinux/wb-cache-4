Instead of promoting <b>the</b> <b>laity's</b> emancipation from “foreign” Greek administrative and financial control, the ordinances left little room for a true inversion of the power structure between the two opposing camps, retaining the status quo {{at the expense of}} <b>the</b> Arab Orthodox <b>laity's</b> rights...|$|R

Ælfric also ordered the composition of the first Life of Dunstan, a hagiography, or saint's life, of Dunstan, a predecessor as Archbishop of Canterbury. He also acted as a royal judge, once being ordered by King Æthelred to adjudicate a case between thegns, or local noblemen.|$|E

5|$|Oda {{also made}} constitutions, or rules, for his clergy. His Constitutions of Oda {{are the first}} {{surviving}} constitutions of a 10th-century English ecclesiastical reformer. Oda reworked some statutes from 786 to form his updated code, and one item that was dropped were any clauses dealing with paganism. Other items covered were relations between laymen and the clergy, the duties of bishops, the need for <b>the</b> <b>laity</b> to make canonical marriages, how to observe fasts, {{and the need for}} tithes to be given by <b>the</b> <b>laity.</b> The work is extant in just one surviving manuscript, British Museum Cotton Vespasian A XIV, folios 175v to 177v.

5|$|The papacy further refined the {{practice}} in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. <b>The</b> <b>laity</b> continued {{the practice}}s of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief {{in the power of}} the Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught <b>the</b> <b>laity</b> to focus on their inner spiritual life, which laid the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.|$|E
5|$|The {{right of}} <b>the</b> <b>laity</b> {{to reject the}} person elected was {{abolished}} by a Synod held in the Lateran in 769, but restored to Roman noblemen by Pope Nicholas I during a Synod of Rome in 862. The pope was also subjected to oaths of loyalty to the Holy Roman Emperor, who had the duty of providing security and public peace in Rome. A major change came in 1059, when Pope Nicholas II decreed in In Nomine Domini that the cardinals were to elect a candidate, who would take office after receiving the assent of the clergy and laity. The cardinal bishops were to meet first and discuss the candidates before summoning the cardinal priests and cardinal deacons for the actual vote. The Second Council of the Lateran in 1139 removed the requirement for obtaining the assent of the lower clergy and <b>the</b> <b>laity,</b> while the Third Council of the Lateran in 1179 gave equal rights to the entire College of Cardinals when electing a new pope.|$|E

50|$|In December 1977, “A Chicago Declaration of Christian Concern” was published. The {{declaration}} {{looked back}} {{a decade to}} the Vatican Council II with appreciation for its “compelling vision of lay Christians in society.” As the Declaration interpreted it, the Council viewed <b>the</b> <b>laity’s</b> “special vocation” as being the “leaven” for the “sanctification of the world” in their “secular professions and occupations.” However, lamented the Declaration, the Council’s vision has “all but vanished” from the church.|$|R
5|$|Ordained Catholics, as well {{as members}} of <b>the</b> <b>laity,</b> may enter into consecrated life either on an {{individual}} basis, as a hermit or consecrated virgin, or by joining an institute of consecrated life (a religious institute or a secular institute) in which to take vows confirming their desire to follow the three evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience. Examples of institutes of consecrated life are the Benedictines, the Carmelites, the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Legionaries of Christ and the Sisters of Mercy.|$|E

5|$|Unlike in Western Europe where priests {{were clearly}} demarcated from the laymen, the clergy of the Eastern Roman Empire {{remained}} {{in close contact}} with the rest of society. Readers and subdeacons were drawn from <b>the</b> <b>laity</b> and expected to be at least twenty years of age while priests and bishops had to be at least 30. Unlike the Latin church, the Byzantine church allowed married priests and deacons, {{as long as they were}} married before ordination. Bishops, however, were required to be unmarried.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fire}} of 1270, a {{programme}} of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer aisles {{were added to the}} nave, the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles provided on its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern aisles ran the length of the choir, past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south aisle of the choir contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer aisles of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end of each of these aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for <b>the</b> <b>laity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alboin moved west in his march, invading {{the region}} of Liguria (north-west Italy) and {{reaching}} its capital Mediolanum (Milan) on September 3, 569, only to find it already abandoned by the vicarius Italiae (vicar of Italy), the authority entrusted with {{the administration of the}} diocese of Annonarian Italy. Archbishop Honoratus, his clergy, and part of <b>the</b> <b>laity</b> accompanied the vicarius Italiae to find a safe haven in the Byzantine port of Genua (Genoa). Alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of Milan, when he assumed the title of dominus Italiae (Lord of Italy). His success also meant the collapse of Byzantine defences {{in the northern part of}} the Po plain, and large movements of refugees to Byzantine areas.|$|E
5|$|At an {{ecclesiastical council}} held at Lambeth in 1281, Peckham ordered the clergy to {{instruct}} their congregations in doctrine {{at least four}} times a year. They were to explain and teach the Articles of Faith, the Ten Commandments, the Works of Mercy, the Seven Deadly Sins, the Seven Virtues and the Sacraments. This command was issued as a canon, or law, of the council, and the group is known as the Lambeth Constitutions. Even later these constitutions were collected as the Ignorantia sacerdotum. The six doctrines comprised the minimum theological knowledge the archbishop considered necessary for <b>the</b> <b>laity</b> to know. The constitutions, which were originally in Latin, were the basis and inspiration for pastoral and devotional works throughout the remainder of the Middle Ages, and were eventually translated into English in the 15th century.|$|E
