40|$|Interfacial {{fracture}} toughness acting as <b>true</b> <b>adhesion</b> strength {{has been identified}} as one of the key factors in evaluating delamination problem of IC plastic packages. However, since most conventional adhesion tests are not configured to obtain this bi-material {{fracture toughness}} constant (only apparent adhesion strengths varying with specimen geometry and loading position), their results cannot be used for structural design and material selection purposes. This study employed an End Notch Flexure (ENF) test to determine, by the means of finite element analysis (FEA), the <b>true</b> <b>adhesion</b> strength expressed in terms of resultant stress intensity factor of mixed Mode I & Mode II fracture. The ENF test was successfully applied to the specimens composed of epoxy moulding compounds (EMCs) and 3 different leadframes such as bare Cu, Ni plated Cu and black oxide Cu for adhesion evaluation without any moisture preconditioning. The result indicated most of the epoxy compounds adhering to black oxide Cu can achieve relatively high fracture toughness, but in opposite behaviour to Ni plated Cu. It has been verified that there is a strong correlation between these findings and the occurrence of package delamination in real cases. Indeed, for a specific IC package, the selection of plating materials for adhesion improvement may directly rely on the corresponding fracture toughness found, as the mechanical effect of thin plating material can be negligible...|$|E
40|$|Caulobacters {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} {{in the environment}} via their holdfasts, attachment organelles located {{at the base of}} the flagellum in swarmer cells and later at the end of the cellular stalk in the stalked cells which develop from the swarmer cells. There seems to be little specificity with respect to the types of surfaces to which holdfasts adhere. A notable exception is that the holdfast of one cell does not adhere to the cell surface of another caulobacter, except by joining holdfasts, typically forming "rosettes" of stalked cells. Thus, the localized adhesion of the holdfasts to the cells is in some way a specialized attachment. We investigated this holdfast-cell attachment by developing an adhesion screening assay and analyzing several mutants of Caulobacter crescentus CB 2 A selected to be defective in adhesion. One class of mutants made a normal holdfast by all available criteria, yet the attachment to the cell was very weak, such that the holdfast was readily shed. Another class of mutants made no holdfast at all, but when mixed with a wild-type strain, a mutant of this class participated in rosette formation. The mutant could also attach to the discarded holdfast produced by a shedding mutant. In addition, when rosettes composed of holdfast-defective and wild-type cells were examined, an increase in the number of holdfast-defective cells was correlated with a decrease in the ability of the holdfast material at the center of the rosette to bind colloidal gold particles. Gold particles are one type of surface to which holdfasts adhere well, suggesting that the stalk end and the colloidal gold particles occupy the same sites on the holdfast substance. Taken together, the data support the interpretation that there is a specialized attachment site for the holdfast {{at the base of the}} flagellum which later becomes the end of the stalk, but not a specialized region of the holdfast for attachment to this site. Also, attachment to the cell is accomplished by bond formations that occur not only at the time of holdfast production. Thus, we propose that the attachment of the holdfast to the cell is a <b>true</b> <b>adhesion</b> process and that the stalk tip and base of the flagellum must have compositions distinctly different from that of the remainder of the caulobacter cell surface...|$|E

30|$|Currently, {{interface}} adhesion is {{assessed by}} destructive testing. For metal bonding, a widely accepted industrial test {{to secure a}} proper bond is the standard floating roller peel test [1]. A cohesive failure when peeling-off the aluminium part ensures that the adherends are properly bonded and that this bond will endure. This is a fast and reliable test to assess metal bonding adhesion. Significant research has been performed using these type of peel test for metal bonding with diverse objectives, including adhesives screening, effect of surface pre-treatments, bond durability, etc. [2 - 4]. Diverse studies have also investigated the adherends effects in the floating roller peel test. It {{has been found that}} the peel strength measured is a combination of the <b>true</b> interface <b>adhesion</b> strength plus work expended in the plastic deformation of the thin adherend. Therefore the mechanical characteristics of the thin adherend {{have a significant effect on}} the measured peel load [5 - 7].|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To objectively detect true {{posterior}} vitreous cortex (PVC) adhesion status using {{a commercially}} available swept-source OCT device (DRI OCT- 1, Atlantis©). Material and Methods. Case report, {{review of the}} literature, and methodical discussion of concepts to improve OCT-guided PVC imaging. Results. Standard OCT imaging misdiagnosed PVC adhesion status as totally detached in this case report when using a horizontal 6 [*]mm scan only. Contrariwise imaging the same eye with a 12 [*]mm horizontal scan, partial posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) {{and the presence of}} a bursa premacularis were clearly discernible. Besides a broader scan, specific scan patterns, highest resolution, and contrast sensitivity, an anterior-to-posterior adjusted scan through the entire vitreous as well as the detection of characteristic undulating aftermovements might enhance the capability of OCT imaging to detect <b>true</b> PVC <b>adhesion</b> status. Conclusions. Further developments are needed to address these issues and to establish OCT recordings as the standard and objective method of choice in PVC adhesion status imaging...|$|R
40|$|Connexins, like <b>true</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> molecules, have {{extracellular}} domains {{that provide}} strong and specific homophilic, {{and in some}} cases, heterophilic interactions between cells. Though {{the structure of the}} binding domains of adhesion proteins have been determined, the extracellular domains of connexins, consisting of two loops of ∼ 34 – 37 amino acids each, are not easily studied in isolation {{from the rest of the}} molecule. As an alternative, we used a novel application of site-directed mutagenesis in which four of the six conserved cysteines in the extracellular loops of connexin 32 were moved individually and in all possible pairwise and some quadruple combinations. This mapping allowed us to deduce that all disulfides form between the two loops of a single connexin, with the first cysteine in one loop connected to the third of the other. Furthermore, the periodicity of movements that produced functional channels indicated that these loops are likely to form antiparallel β sheets. A possible model that could explain how these domains from apposed connexins interact to form a complete channel is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} of cells {{with their neighbors}} and with the extracetlular matrix play crucial roles in de-velopment and in numerous physiological and pathological processes (Hay 1991; Hynes and Lander 1992). Studies of cell adhesion {{during the past decade}} and more have uncovered the existence {{of a large number of}} cell adhesion molecules. These include cell-surface receptors involved in cell-cell adhesion, such as the cadherins (Takeichi 1988, 1990, 1991), members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Jessell 1988; Grumet 1991), and selectins (Bevilacqua et al. 1991; Lasky and Rosen 1992). Each of these families of receptors in-cludes multiple related molecules. The same is <b>true</b> for cell-matrix <b>adhesion,</b> which is most frequently me-diated by the family of adhesion receptors known a...|$|R
40|$|Polyolefin {{geosynthetics}} including {{high-density polyethylene}} geomembranes {{have traditionally been}} limited to being joined with heat seaming or mechanical attachment. Use of adhesives and coatings have been impossible due to poor adhesion stemming from the inherently low surface energy of polyethylene. However, methods exist to raise the surface energy of polyethylene and other thermoplastics, some temporarily and some permanently. Permanent surface energy increase is achieved through reactive gas-initiated surface oxidation providing the opportunity for <b>true</b> structural <b>adhesion.</b> With such treatment {{and the use of}} chemical adhesives come new opportunities for fabrication and installation. This paper reviews the chemistry of surface-modification for improved adhesion of plastics, and presents the results of bonding tests on surface-modified and non surface-modified polyolefin geosynthetic surfaces. The paper presents data {{on a wide range of}} adhesive options using conventional destructive seam peel tests per ASTM D 4437. Test results are also presented for adhesive bond strengths of treated HDPE to steel and concrete. Adhesion tests to concrete include pull-out adhesion strength compared to conventional “studded ” concrete embedment liners, and thermal cycling tests for bond durability. Implications for installation are discussed, noting improved options for leak prevention and liability protection among other considerations...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} interfacial fracture energies of thin gold films {{as a function}} of film thickness is presented in this paper. The films were sputter deposited onto sapphire substrates to thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 200 nm. Nanoindentation was used to measure mechanical properties and combined with stressed overlayers to trigger delamination and buckling. Fracture energies and interfacial fracture energies were then obtained from the buckles using mechanics-based models. The results showed that measured fracture energies decreased with decreasing film thickness to a lower limiting value near 1. 5 J/m 2 for film thicknesses up to 40 nm with a mode I normal component equal to 0. 6 J/m 2. The normal component equals the <b>true</b> work of <b>adhesion</b> and governs delamination. The shear component is composed of contributions from the test technique and crack tip plasticity which varied with film thickness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Nanoindentation for {{measuring}} thin film mechanical properties {{is probably the}} most popular yet ill-understood method due to its inherent complexities. As opposed to burst pressure or microtensile tests of lithographed structures, where relatively uniform stress fields may be generated, the indentation-induced stress gradients can produce unique challenges. Because of the test’s simplicity and ability to mechanically probe the smallest of scales, it is becoming increasingly applied. Five possible stages of deformation are suggested from Hertzian elastic to film delamination and double buckling. In particular metal films on harder substrates are emphasized where it is shown that dislocation nucleation and arrest are only partially understood. Later stages of film delamination are illustrated with Cu/SiO 2 /Si where it is shown that the <b>true</b> work of <b>adhesion</b> is 0. 6 J/m 2. Current limitations of indentation-induced delamination measures of toughness involve large scatter associated with sensitivity of the fracture radius to the contact radius ratio...|$|R
40|$|Many cell {{adhesion}} molecules are located at synapses but only {{few of them}} can be considered synaptic {{cell adhesion}} molecules in the strict sense. Besides the Neurexins and Neuroligins, the LRRTMs (leucine rich repeat transmembrane proteins) and the SynCAMs/CADMs can induce synapse formation when expressed in non-neuronal cells and therefore are <b>true</b> synaptic cell <b>adhesion</b> molecules. SynCAMs (synaptic cell adhesion molecules) are a subfamily of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. As suggested by their name, they were first identified as cell adhesion molecules at the synapse which were sufficient to trigger synapse formation. They also contribute to myelination by mediating axon-glia cell contacts. More recently, their role in earlier stages of neural circuit formation was demonstrated, as they also guide axons both in the peripheral and in the central nervous system. Mutations in SynCAM genes were found in patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders. The diverse functions of SynCAMs during development suggest that neurodevelopmental disorders are not only due to defects in synaptic plasticity. Rather, early steps of neural circuit formation are likely to contribute...|$|R
40|$|Human tears contain ~ 60 {{different}} {{proteins that}} accumulate on contact lenses. We examine the adhesion of human transferrin to FDA Group II Omafilcon A contact lenses, fabricated from a biomimetic material whose interaction with tear proteins {{is not well}} characterized and for which the consequences of protein accumulation are unclear. Omafilcon A lenses were incubated in human transferrin for five days, and protein adhesion was determined by bicinchoninic acid colorimetry on a daily basis. Transferrin adhered to the Omafilcon A lenses {{to a lesser extent}} (~ 10 %) than it did to Alphafilcon A lenses (also FDA Group II). Our previous data indicate the same is <b>true</b> for lysozyme <b>adhesion,</b> with Omafilcon A lenses adsorbing less lysozyme (~ 25 %) than Alphafilcon A lenses. Levels of transferrin and lysozyme adhesion to Omafilcon A lenses are lower than their levels of adhesion to any other type of contact lenses in all four FDA groups, suggesting that Omafilcon A lenses are better able to resist protein adhesion than contact lenses fabricated from other materials...|$|R
40|$|Indentation-induced {{delamination}} of {{thin films}} provides {{the basis for}} adhesion calculations. In the case of ductile Cu films plastic deformation usually prevents a film from debonding from the substrate. Deadhesion is facilitated {{by the use of}} a hard W superlayer, which promotes indenter-induced Cu film failure, increasing the delamination area by an order of magnitude. Radial as well as annular cracking acts like a secondary mechanism in the strain energy release, and can be resolved from excursions on the load-displacement curves. For the thicker Cu films no excursions were observed, though radial cracking took place. It is important to identify fracture events as they occur {{in order to understand the}} system behavior and accurately apply the analysis. An acoustic emission signal is used to detect both the magnitude and the type of fracture events in thin Cu films. For the films of different thickness from 40 nm to 3 microns the corresponding interfacial fracture energy ranged from 0. 2 to over 100 J/m 2. Limits of plastic energy dissipation are determined with the lower limit, the <b>true</b> work of <b>adhesion,</b> being associated with a dislocation emission criterion. Crack arrest marks were found upon the blister removal, and are proposed to represent the shape of the crack tip. Total acoustic emission energy was found to be inversely proportional to the strain energy release rate...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: Urokinase is used {{clinically}} for thrombolysis, {{but little}} is known of its direct effect on vascular endothelial cells. The following experiments were preformed to assess the in vitro effects of urokinase on vascular endothelial cell growth, adhesion molecule expression, and interaction with lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and platelets. Methods: Commercially available human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured with varying concentrations of urokinase (0 to 10, 000 IU/ml) (clinical dosage, ≤ 500 IU/ml). HUVEC viability was determined from 1 to 4 days. HUVECs were incubated with urokinase (0 to 2000 IU/ml) from 4 to 72 hours. Adherence of 51 -chromium-labeled polymorphonuclear leukocytes, platelets, or lymphocytes was then quantitated. In separate experiments HUVEC adhesion molecule expression (intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, or endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule- 1) was determined by flow cytometry. Results: There was a decrease of HUVEC viability at suprapharmacologic urokinase concentrations of ≥ 2000 IU/ml compared with nontreated control samples (0 IU/ml, 73 % ± 2 %, 2000 IU/ml, 60. 5 % ± 1. 9 %, p < 0. 05) presumably because of drug toxicity. There was no significantly increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte, lymphocyte, or platelet adhesion to urokinase-treated HUVEC monolayers at any time point. This was also <b>true</b> for each <b>adhesion</b> molecule tested. Conclusions: Urokinase at clinically relevant concentrations (≤ 500 IU/ml) did not affect endothelial cell viability or growth, nor did it upregulate adhesion molecule expression or cellular adhesion associated with the local vascular inflammatory response. It is therefore implied {{that the use of}} urokinase in vivo similarly would not initiate the vascular inflammatory response. (J Vasc Surg 1997; 25 : 471 - 80. ...|$|R
40|$|Thin film {{adhesion}} can {{be measured}} {{by means of the}} nanoindentation technique [1]. In the case of a ductile film (Cu, Al, Au, etc.) well adhered to a brittle substrate, plastic deformation in the film acts as an energy dissipation mechanism, preventing film debonding. Depositing a brittle layer of W (about 1 micron thick) on top of the film of interest increases the driving force for delamination, thus solving the problem [2]. Indentation produces circular delaminations (blisters), sometimes two orders of magnitude bigger than the indenter contact radius. Thin film adhesion was shown to scale with the film thickness, approaching the <b>true</b> work of <b>adhesion</b> of 0. 8 J/m 2 for Cu films less than 100 nm thick [3]. Conceptually {{it is important to know}} along what interface the fracture occurs during the blister formation. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) has been used to determine where fracture occurs for different film systems. Cu films on SiO 2 failed along the Cu/SiO 2 interface. Fracture of Cu films with a 10 nm adhesion-promoting Ti underlayer occurred along the Ti/Cu interface. Significantly, Ti increased the thin Cu film adhesion by a factor of ten. Blisters were removed from the substrate, and the fracture surface was analyzed. In the case of thin Cu films, crack arrest marks were found upon blister removal, and represent the shape of the crack tip [4]. AFM has been used to determine the geometry of the marks. The main component of the arrest marks is carbon, which comes either from the diamond tip or from the hydrocarbons adsorbed on the newly formed surfaces in the indentation process...|$|R
