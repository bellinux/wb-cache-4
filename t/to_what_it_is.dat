The two are arrested by German police, but when the police realize they have apprehended fellow investigators they promise cooperation. However, the pair learn that Schlossburg has already been cremated; later they narrowly escape death when their rental car has been rigged with a car bomb.|$|E

25|$|The Scarborough Amateur Rowing Club {{was founded}} in May 1869, and is the oldest {{surviving}} rowing club on the north-east coast. For more than 100 years, sea rowing has taken place on the Yorkshire coast between the Tees and the Humber. Beginning with friendly rivalry between the fishermen and the jet miners from Blyth (the German Ocean Race), the sport has progressed <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> today. More recent successes for the club include Bob Hewitt, who now competes as a lightweight rower for the national team. In 2006 the club finally won the acclaimed Wilson Cup, until then held by rival clubs in neighbouring town Whitby for over eighty years. Rowing takes place throughout the summer months.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{accounts of}} Blue Licks {{describe it as}} a place where animals gathered to lick the salt deposits flowing from the springs in the area. The Reverend James Smith provides this account in his 1795–97 diary: As you approach the Licks, at the distance of 4 or 5 miles from it, you begin to perceive the change. The earth seems to be worn away; the roots of the trees lie naked and bare; the rocks forsaken of the earth, that once covered them, lie naked on the neighboring hills, and roads of an amazing size, in all directions, unite at the Licks, as their common center. Here immense herds of buffalo used formerly to meet and with their fighting, scraping etc., have worn away the ground <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> at present.|$|E
25|$|The {{name was}} {{originally}} Peñamellera, given by José de Escandón, as the mountain formation east of town {{reminded him of}} a similar formation in Asturias, Spain in the Peñamellera Baja. It was officially named Santa María de Peñamillera when the area became a sub prefecture of Tolimán. Eventually, the name morphed <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> today. The municipality’s coat of arms represents the history and traditions of the area, especially those related to the founding of the Spanish town in 1748 and after. Since it was the 18th century, the sun figure has eighteen rays. Another motif is that of a colonizer subjugating an indigenous person to represent the conquest of the Chichimecas. As thirty seven families moved in to found the town, there are thirty seven marked tombs, and a tree represents the distribution of lands. Eight palms in a walnut tree branch represent the most important annual celebration, that of the Virgin of the Assumption on August 15. The parish church is represented, and the mass of foundation is represented by a cross {{at the top of the}} coat of arms.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1243, Ejō left Kōshōhōrin-ji for Echizen with Dōgen and his other {{students}} after Hatano Yoshishige, a magistrate from that area, offered land and protection for a new monastery. Dōgen and his followers accepted the offer largely because of continuous tensions with the Tendai community in Kyoto which threatened the long-term stability of their practice. Before {{the construction of the}} new temple had been completed, the monks stayed at the temples Kippō-ji and Yamashibu. During this time, Ejō served Dōgen as before, continued a project managing the texts for what would become Dōgen's magnum opus, the Shōbōgenzō (not {{to be confused with the}} Shōbōgenzō zuimonki mentioned above), and also assisting in the planning of the new temple being constructed. In {{the summer of}} 1244 the hattō (法堂; dharma hall) of the new temple, originally called Daibutsu-ji, was completed. In June 1246, the temple name was changed <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still known as to this day: Eihei-ji. For these first years at the new temple, Ejō found himself taking on many of the responsibilities for the day-to-day functioning of the new temple. He simultaneously began work on Eihei kōroku (Broad Record of Eihei) and Eihei shingi (Pure Criteria of Eihei) with the help of the other students Gien and Sene.|$|E

25|$|Back in the 1940s {{there were}} many members {{that were in the}} military. During that time period it was not easy for all of the members to get {{together}} for meetings because of gas rationing. On May 27 and 28, 1944 the first formal convention was held. This meeting was led by Jane Farrow and Jo Folden in Columbus, Ohio. The first Regional Meeting was held later that year in Plainfield, New Jersey. From this came the decision on the colors and the logo for Motor Maids. It was decided that royal blue and silver gray would make up the colors and a shield would represent the logo. Another thing that came from this meeting was the uniform for the group. At the start the uniforms were tailor-made of silver-gray gabardine with royal blue piping. This soon changed and the uniform became gray slacks, royal blue over-blouse with white boots, and a tie. Down the road in 2006, the group voted to change the uniform again. It was then changed <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in present day. It consists of black pants and boots, royal blue mock neck long sleeved shirt with a white cotton vest, and white gloves. White gloves were added in 1941 when Howard Foley went to the motor maids with the idea of parading at the Charity Newsies Race. During this parade, the Motor Maids wore white gloves making them known as the “Ladies of the White Gloves”. They continued to parade for this event each year up until 1979. The Motor Maids are required to wear royal blue mock turtleneck and white cotton vest, jet-black slacks, and clean black footwear. For parades white gloves are added. The rest are required at a convention for the parade, formal group picture, and banquet.|$|E
500|$|While deconstructionists have {{concluded}} that we must abandon any further attempts to create a comprehensive vision of the world, Cobb and other constructive postmodernists believe that metaphysics and comprehensive world-models are possible and still needed. [...] In particular, they have argued for a new Whiteheadian metaphysics based on events rather than substances. [...] In this formulation, it is incorrect {{to say that a}} person or thing ("substance") has a fundamental identity that remains constant, and that any changes to the person or thing are secondary <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> [...] Instead, each moment in a person's life ("event") is seen as a new actuality, thus asserting that continual change and transformation are fundamental, while static identities are far less important. [...] This view more easily reconciles itself with certain findings of modern science, such as evolution and wave-particle duality.|$|E
500|$|Falk's {{enduring}} legacy {{can best}} be described as the NBA's new star-centered focus.

[...] "Very gifted players almost make a team by themselves. In that environment, a Michael Jordan, Alonzo Mourning, Juwan Howard, Shaquille O'Neal and Patrick Ewing bring in the fans. Fans come to watch them play primarily. They create marketing opportunities, new stadiums, luxury boxes, and they should be paid a disproportionate amount of money. The salary structure should be close <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in Hollywood, where Jim Carrey makes $16 million a film and the second star makes $2 million. That's what I believe as an economics major and as a neo-capitalist." ...|$|E

500|$|The split-reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1000 {{feet long}} with A Husband's Jealous Wife included, {{was released on}} September 23, 1910. Advertising for the film was a bit mixed {{as to whether or}} not it was a comedy or a drama, stating, [...] "You have no idea as to how marvelously a Thanhouser can twist a story until you see this gripping dra - well, perhaps, it isn't a drama at that - or a comedy even. We hate to tip you off as <b>to</b> <b>WHAT</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> When you see the picture, with its totally unlooked-for climax, you'll know why!" [...] Bowers would later term this as more of the slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser said the company would not produce. The film likely had a wide national release, known advertising theatres include Indiana, and Kansas. The film was also shown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. One theater advertisement may have confused this film with another because it lists this film as a western film.|$|E
500|$|... "Southern boobook" [...] {{has been}} {{designated}} the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). The common name comes from the two-tone call of the bird, and has also been transcribed as [...] "mopoke". English explorer George Caley had recorded the native name as buck-buck during {{the earliest days of}} the colony, and reporting that early settlers had called it cuckoo owl as its call was reminiscent of the common cuckoo. However, he added, [...] "The settlers in New South Wales are led away by the idea that everything is the reverse in that country <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in England; and the Cuckoo, as they call this bird, singing by night, is one of the instances they point out." [...] Gould recorded local aboriginal names: Goor-goor-da (Western Australia), Mel-in-de-ye (Port Essington), and Koor-koo (South Australia). Alternative common names include spotted owl and brown owl. The Ngarluma people of the western Pilbara knew it as gurrgumarlu. In the Yuwaaliyaay dialect of the Gamilaraay language of southeastern Australia, the southern boobook is guurrguurr.|$|E
500|$|In equal {{protection}} cases, {{the purpose of}} the law must be distilled before the reasonableness of a classification can be judged. When {{the purpose of the}} law is not explicitly stated, the court may conclude that there is no legitimate public purpose, assume that there is a legitimate public purpose but refuse to look for it, or draw some inferences as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> When the purpose of the law is explicitly stated, the court may either accept it at face value; or challenge the integrity of the legislative declaration, looking behind the explicit purpose to determine the true purpose. In the latter situation, what is concerned is the discriminatory character of the legislation. The need to identify the legislative purpose has been said to involve the court in the [...] "thornier aspects of judicial review", because it must either [...] "uncritically and often unrealistically accept a legislative avowal at face value" [...] or [...] "challenge legislative integrity and push beyond the express statement into unconfined realms of inference". The court must then [...] "make a judgment as to the purity of legislative motive and ... determine the legitimacy of the end".|$|E

500|$|The Domesday Book {{mentions}} ponies in Exmoor in 1086. Mentions of {{the ponies}} are rare {{between then and}} 1818, when the Royal Exmoor Forest was sold to a private buyer. Sir Thomas Acland, the Exmoor Royal Forest's last warden, took 30 ponies from the area to Winsford Hill, where he owned land. This herd {{became known as the}} Anchor herd, and a small number of descendants of this original herd still remain at Winsford Hill. At the same time as Acland's removal, the rest of the ponies were sold, but some stayed with breeders in the area, and their families still preserve the descendants of those animals. From the 1820s to 1860s Exmoors were used to produce crossbreds, which although successful were not as hardy as their ancestors. In 1893, the ponies were described in Sidney's Book of the Horse as around [...] high, usually bay in color, and with conformation similar <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> today. In the late 1800s, the National Pony Society began to register Exmoors and Exmoor crossbreds. In 1921, the Exmoor Pony Society was formed, and published its first stud book in 1963.|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} Tucker goes free upholds {{a common theme}} in Homicide: Life on the Street – that life is not always fair, and that criminals {{sometimes}} get away with their crimes, a conviction that often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives. Fontana deliberately wrote the script {{so that it would}} remain ambiguous whether Tucker committed the murder or not. He wanted the character to have a genuine feeling of love for Adena Watson, but the strong feelings do not specifically mean he killed the girl. Braugher praised Fontana for creating such a three-dimensional character in Tucker, and said, [...] "Fontana's genius is that we are never quite certain as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that we have on our hands." [...] Fontana also wanted Pembleton and Bayliss to have different interpretations of the same interrogation; Bayliss begins the interview convinced of the man's guilt and becomes uncertain by the end, and Pembleton has the opposite experience. Multiple police departments have requested copies of [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] for use in training sessions due to its accurate portrayal of the intricacies of the police interrogation process. The interrogation included several police tactics not typically featured in television dramas, including the presentation of false evidence in an attempt to get a confession.|$|E
500|$|Besides word {{of mouth}} and {{opinions}} in letters, {{there were only a}} few published contemporary reviews. The writer and journalist John Stoddart (1773–1856), in a review of Lyrical Ballads, described [...] "Strange fits" [...] and [...] "She dwelt" [...] as [...] "the most singular specimens of unpretending, yet irresistible pathos". An anonymous review of Poems in Two Volumes in 1807 had a less positive opinion about [...] "I travell'd": [...] "Another string of flat lines about Lucy is succeeded by an ode to Duty". Critic Francis Jeffrey (1773–1850) claimed that, in [...] "Strange fits", [...] "Mr Wordsworth, however, has thought fit to compose a piece, illustrating this copious subject by one single thought. A lover trots away to see his mistress one fine evening, staring all the way at the moon: when he comes to her door, 'O mercy! to myself I cried, / If Lucy should be dead!' And there the poem ends!" [...] On [...] "A slumber did my spirit seal", Wordsworth's friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem [...] "stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, yet we are to know, from the penetration of Mr. Wordsworth's admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about 'A Slumber;' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, to put us out of pain as <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> about." ...|$|E
