The {{controversy}} erupted when a 1998 Rugrats comic strip was published, featuring Boris in a synagogue reciting the Mourner's Kaddish. <b>The</b> <b>ADL</b> {{issued a statement saying}} that the design resembled Nazi-era depictions of Jews, {{and the fact that the}} character was reciting the sacred prayer perverted its solemnity. The Washington Post, the newspaper who published the strip, issued a similar statement in their Editor's Note section, criticizing Nickelodeon for not showing better judgment in editing the strip.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether specifically designed {{activities of daily}} living (ADL) observations can measure disability due to apraxia with more sensitivity than <b>the</b> Barthel <b>ADL</b> Index, a conventional functional scale. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Rehabilitation centres and nursing homes. Subjects: One hundred and six left hemisphere stroke patients with apraxia, hospitalized in rehabilitation centres and nursing homes. Measures: ADL observations, Barthel ADL Index, an apraxia test, Motricity Index, Functional Motor Test. Results: Multivariate analyses showed that <b>the</b> specific <b>ADL</b> observations were associated with severity of apraxia (and not with motor impairments). <b>The</b> Barthel <b>ADL</b> Index was associated with motor impairments (and not with severity of apraxia). Conclusion: The assessment of disability in stroke patients with apraxia cannot rely only on <b>the</b> Barthel <b>ADL</b> Index. In addition, <b>the</b> specific <b>ADL</b> observation procedure is needed to measure disability due to apraxia. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
