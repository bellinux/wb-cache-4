25|$|Dev {{constantly}} takes Paro's {{love and}} affection for granted. He grows up to be arrogant and lazy, which causes his father {{to send him to}} London to complete his education. While separated by distance, Paro and Dev's youthful love only blossoms more, despite Dev becoming increasingly more egotistical and entitled. After finishing his studies, Dev returns to Chandigarh and meets Paro, and they rekindle their romance. After some time, Dev overhears scandalous rumours about Paro concerning her reputation and sexual history, which he immediately believes. Paro is shocked to see Dev's chauvinist attitude towards her, even after she claims innocence. Dev hypocritically passes judgement on Paro and does not approve of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has heard. Paro turns her back on him when she hears him insult her and rashly agrees to marry a man of her parents' choice. On her wedding day, Dev learns that the rumors were false but his ego doesn't let him accept his mistake, and he lets Paro marry someone else.|$|E
500|$|Blumenfeld has {{described}} how his character [...] "sort of evolved" [...] from being [...] "super needy [...] weird" [...] to [...] "a little crazier", but that [...] "the root of my character {{is still the}} same, the insecurity of it". Regarding his similarity to his character, {{he said he is}} [...] "hopefully very different but maybe at the root of it we're the same person. I'm probably a little smarter than the character though. Maybe <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thinks I also think but I'm able to suppress them." ...|$|E
500|$|A superhero who is {{commissioned}} by the U.S. government as a black-ops specialist. When reading the comic for the part, Morgan stopped when he saw his character was killed off three pages in. When telling his agent {{he did not want}} the part, he was told to continue reading it and find out how important his character was. Morgan found the role a challenge, explaining, [...] "For some reason, in reading the novel, you don't hate this guy even though he does things that are unmentionable. [...] My job is to kind of make that translate, so as a viewer you end up not making excuses to like him, but you don't hate him like you should for doing <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does." [...] Of his casting, Snyder said, [...] "It's hard to find a man's man in Hollywood. It just is. And Jeffrey came in and was grumpy and cool and grizzled, and I was, like, 'OK, Jeffrey is perfect!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Tutu called Mugabe [...] "someone we {{were very}} proud of", as he [...] "did a fantastic job, and it's such a great shame, {{because he had a}} {{wonderful}} legacy. If he had stepped down ten or so years ago he would be held in very, very high regard. And I still want to say we must honour him for <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did do, and just say what a shame." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herzog {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} [...] "in a frenzy", and completed it in two-and-a-half days. Much {{of the script}} was written during a [...] bus trip with Herzog's football team. His teammates got drunk after winning a game {{and one of them}} vomited on several pages of Herzog's manuscript, which he immediately threw out the window. Herzog claims he cannot remember all of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wrote on these pages.|$|E
2500|$|According to Hill, the film's origins {{came out}} of a desire to make {{what he thought was a}} perfect film when he was a teenager, and put in all of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought were [...] "great then and which I still have great affection for: custom cars, kissing in the rain, neon, trains in the night, {{high-speed}} pursuit, rumbles, rock stars, motorcycles, jokes in tough situations, leather jackets and questions of honor".|$|E
6000|$|... "And to like {{to fight}} they must know how to fight," [...] he said, [...] "for no man likes to do <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{does not know how}} to do well." ...|$|R
60|$|How could <b>he</b> resist <b>that</b> appeal? <b>He</b> {{heard her}} sigh--he heard the {{rustling}} {{of her dress}} as she moved away in despair. <b>The</b> very <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had shrunk from doing but a few minutes since was <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did now! He joined Agnes in the corridor. She turned as she heard him, and pointed, trembling, {{in the direction of}} the closed room. 'Is it so terrible as that?' she asked faintly.|$|R
60|$|Finally {{he decided}} to take to the land himself, leaving his company to follow after him by boat. He {{explained}} to Mugambi <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had in mind, and told Akut to follow the directions of the black.|$|R
2500|$|In 2011, pro wrestling podcaster Peter Rosenberg stated, to {{agreement}} from veteran wrestler Shawn Michaels, that, [...] "You add up all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was capable}} of, {{and you can}} make a case that there was no one better than 'Macho Man'." [...] Also that year, Kevin Eck of The Baltimore Sun lauded Savage as an all-round performer, saying that [...] "nobody blended power, speed, agility, and technical skills like the 'Macho Man' in his prime".|$|E
2500|$|Nolte {{believed}} that, for Hitler, Jews represented [...] "the historical process itself". Nolte {{argues that}} Hitler was [...] "logically consistent" [...] in seeking genocide of the Jews because Hitler detested modernity and identified Jews with <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> most hated in the world. According to Nolte, [...] "In Hitler's extermination of the Jews, {{it was not}} a case of criminals committing criminal deeds, but of a uniquely monstrous action in which principles ran riot in a frenzy of self-destruction". Nolte's theories about Nazi antisemitism as a rejection of modernity inspired the Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka to argue that National Socialism was an attack on [...] "the very roots of Western civilisation, its basic values and moral foundations".|$|E
2500|$|On July 13, 2017, Romero {{released}} the first poster for Road of the Dead and discussed the plot {{for the movie}} saying [...] "it's set in a sanctuary city where this fat cat runs a haven for rich folks, and one of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does is stage drag races to entertain them," [...] Romero told Rue Morgue. [...] "There's a scientist there doing genetic experiments, {{trying to make the}} zombies stop eating us, and he has discovered that with a little tampering, they can recall certain memory skills that enable them to drive in these races. It's really The Fast and the Furious with zombies". Romero died three days later, and the status of the film is currently unknown.|$|E

2500|$|The 1947 season saw a {{dramatic}} turnaround as Lynn [...] "Pappy" [...] Waldorf became the head coach. The 1946 Bears only won 2 games while losing 7, upon Pappy's arrival {{they went to}} 9–1, their only loss was to USC. Known as [...] "Pappy's Boys", the California teams of 1947–1950 won 33 consecutive regular season games, earning three PCC championships and three Rose Bowl berths. However California lost all three Rose Bowls: 20–14 to Northwestern in 1949, 17–14 to Ohio State in 1950, and 14–6 to Michigan in 1951. Because of both Cal's return to greatness and Pappy's great character – even after the losses, Pappy became admired by both his players and his fans. One of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became known for was him addressing the fans after every home game from an outside balcony of the Memorial stadium.|$|E
2500|$|In 2015 and 2016, The New York Times and The Washington Post {{addressed}} {{changes in}} the show's direction, {{with an emphasis on}} celebrity interviews and change in tone. [...] The New York Times wrote: [...] "Scattered among the gleefully vulgar mainstays are now long, starkly intimate live exchanges — character excavations that have made Mr. Stern one of the most deft and engrossing celebrity interviewers in the business and a sought-after stop for stars selling a movie or setting the record straight." [...] Amongst the changes to the show, some Wack Pack members have been given less offensive names; Wendy the Retard was renamed Wendy the Slow Adult. [...] During an interview with Madonna, Stern said of his earlier years in radio, [...] "I used to say bad things about everybody ... I was an angry young man." [...] Former staff member Jackie Martling commented, [...] "Howard has become a lot of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> always told people not to become", while John Melendez said, [...] "There’s nothing wrong with change, but the old Howard would probably goof on the new Howard now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the end of}} 1967 Vysotsky {{got another}} pivotal theater role, that of [...] in Pugachov (a play based on a poem by Sergei Yesenin), often {{described}} as one of Taganka's finest. [...] "He put into his performance all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> excelled at and, on the other hand, it was Pugachyov that made him discover his own potential," [...] – Soviet critic Natalya Krymova wrote years later. Several weeks after the premiere, infuriated by the actor's increasing unreliability triggered by worsening drinking problems, Lyubimov fired him – only to let him back again several months later (and thus begin the humiliating sacked-then-pardoned routine which continued for years). In June 1968 a Vysotsky-slagging campaign was launched in the Soviet press. First Sovetskaya Rossiya commented on the [...] "epidemic spread of immoral, smutty songs," [...] allegedly promoting [...] "criminal world values, alcoholism, vice and immorality" [...] and condemned their author for [...] "sowing seeds of evil." [...] Then Komsomolskaya Pravda linked Vysotsky with black market dealers selling his tapes somewhere in Siberia. Composer Dmitry Kabalevsky speaking from the Union of Soviet Composers' Committee tribune criticised the Soviet radio for giving an ideologically dubious, [...] "low-life product" [...] like [...] "Song of a Friend" [...] (Песня о друге) an unwarranted airplay. Playwright Alexander Stein who in his Last Parade play used several of Vysotsky's songs, was chastised by a Ministry of Culture official for [...] "providing a tribune for this anti-Soviet scum." [...] The phraseology prompted commentators in the West to make parallels between Vysotsky and Mikhail Zoschenko, another Soviet author who'd been officially labeled [...] "scum" [...] some 20 years ago.|$|E

5000|$|Ravelo's {{favorite}} fighter is Roy Jones Jr. [...] "The way <b>he</b> fights, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> done are incredible" [...] says Ravelo.

60|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had planned}} they did. But they climbed {{more than he}} had {{intended}} because Ann Veronica proved rather a good climber, steady-headed and plucky, rather daring, but quite willing to be cautious at his command.|$|E
60|$|Madame {{turned to}} stare at him, {{surprise}} ineffable in her glance--not at <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> suggested, but at the abruptness with which the suggestion came.

5000|$|Peoples Ioannis Tsioulis said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> missed from <b>the</b> {{show was}} the extreme {{reactions}} from the contestants {{relatives and friends}} and the backstage.

60|$|He had a {{sense of}} adventure, a {{pleasant}} fear in <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had done. He got out of bed, leaving his cup of tea untasted, and began to dress.
