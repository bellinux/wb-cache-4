40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{artificial}} materials have attracted considerable attention as potential solutions {{to meet the}} demands of modern microwave technology for simultaneously achieving component minimization and higher performance in mobile communications, medical, and optoelectronics applications. To realize this potential, more research on metamaterials is needed. In this dissertation, new <b>bandpass</b> <b>filter</b> and diplexer as microwave metamaterial applications have been developed. Unlike the conventional complementary split ring (CSRR) filters, coupled lines are used to provide larger coupling capacitance, resulting in better bandpass characteristics with two CSRRs <b>only.</b> <b>The</b> modified <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> are used to deisgn a compact diplexer. A new CSRR antenna fed by coplanar waveguide has also been developed as another metamaterial application. The rectangular shape CSRRs antenna achieves dual band frequency properties without any special matching network. The higher resonant frequency is dominantly determined by the outer slot ring, while the lower resonant frequency is generated by the coupling between two CSRRs. The proposed antenna achieves about 35 percent size reduction, compared with the conventional slot antennas at the low resonant frequencies. As a future alternative energy solution, space solar power transmission and wireless power transmission have received much attention. The design of efficient rectifying antennas called rectennas is very critical in the wireless power transmission system. The conventional method to obtain long distance range and high output power is to use a large antenna array in rectenna design. However, the use of array antennas has several problems: the relatively high loss of the array feed networks, difficultiy in feeding network design, and antenna radiator coupling that degrades rectenna array performance. In this dissertation, to overcome the above problems, a reflectarray is used to build a rectenna system. The spatial feeding method of the reflectarray eliminates the energy loss and design complexity of a feeding network. A high gain rectifying antenna has been developed and located at the focal point of the reflectarray to receive the reflected RF singals and genterate DC power. The technologies are very useful for high power wireless power transmission applications...|$|R

40|$|A pair of {{conjugated}} multiple <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> (CMBF) {{can be used}} {{to create}} spatially separated pupils in a traditional lens and imaging sensor system allowing for the passive capture of stereo video. This method is especially useful for surgical endoscopy where smaller cameras are needed to provide ample room for manipulating tools while also granting improved visualizations of scene depth. The significant issue in this process is that, due to the complimentary nature of the filters, the colors seen through each filter do not match each other, and also differ from colors as seen under a white illumination source. A color correction model was implemented that included optimized filter selection, such that the degree of necessary post-processing correction was minimized, and a chromatic adaptation transformation that attempted to fix the imaged colors tristimulus indices based on the principle of color constancy. Due to fabrication constraints, <b>only</b> dual <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters</b> were feasible. The theoretical average color error after correction between these filters was still above the fusion limit meaning that rivalry conditions are possible during viewing. This error can be minimized further by designing the filters for a subset of colors corresponding to specific working environments...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{first step}} in digital signal {{processing}} is analog-to-digital conversion. Classically, the analog signal is sampled via the process described by the Whittaker-Kotelnikov-Shannon theorem (WKS), which requires that the original signal is band-limited. Irregular signals, as are fractal ones, typically do not verify such an assumption. The low-pass filtering necessary to apply the WKS theorem implies then a serious loss of information. Although extensions of the WKS theorem to non-band limited signals do exist, their implementation is typically rather difficult. We propose in this paper a sampling procedure for some classes of non-band limited signal which shares {{the simplicity of the}} WKS procedure (involving <b>only</b> <b>bandpass</b> analog <b>filtering</b> and regular sampling).

This study represents the first study for the IMC, IL and ML. Clinically, the intima-media thickness (IMT) {{is used as a}} validated measure for the assessment of atherosclerosis, that causes enlargement of the arteries and thickening of the artery walls. The authors use the same AM-FM histograms as in Section 2.4. 1 but computed using <b>only</b> horizontal-oriented <b>bandpass</b> <b>filters.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> authors use similar scales like those described in Table 1 but using <b>only</b> <b>the</b> filters numbered as (see Figure 2 a): 1 (LPF), 2, 5 (in the H scale), 8, 11 (in the M scale) and 14 and 17 (in the L scale). The reason for the selection of these horizontal-oriented filters is related with the horizontally elongated nature of the atherosclerotic structures. As the last step for the statistical analysis, the authors use the Mann-Whitney rank sum test in order to identify is there are significant differences (SD) or not (NS) between the extracted AM-FM features. The authors use p < 0.05 for significant differences and comparison between different age groups.|$|R
