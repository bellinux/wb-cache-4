5|$|Lukashenko {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> be {{a conservative}} person and avoid using modern electronic gadgets {{such as an}} iPad or iPhone. He used to play bayan and football, but abandoned both during his presidency. He is a keen skier and ice hockey forward, who played exhibition games alongside international hockey stars. His two elder sons also play hockey, sometimes alongside their father.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> be a person of integrity and moral standing, {{with the ability to}} monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does not stand as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E
5|$|Edström {{intended}} to retire following the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, when a successor would be elected. Brundage's rival {{for the presidency}} was Great Britain's Lord Burghley, an Olympic gold medalist in track in 1928 {{and president of the}} International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF). The balloting took place at the IOC session in the Finnish capital before the Games. Although Brundage was the executive board's candidate, he was disliked by some IOC members; others felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> be a European. Private notes kept during the balloting reveal it to have been very close, but on the 25th and final ballot, Brundage received 30votes to 17 for Burghley and was elected.|$|E
50|$|Adams was a {{supported}} {{of limited}} presidential terms, {{well before the}} 22nd Amendment passed, and advocated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidents</b> <b>should</b> be required to renounce political parties and that after they left the presidency, should be made ex-officio members of the United States Senate.|$|R
60|$|Without {{debate it}} was {{unanimously}} agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> plan <b>should</b> be carried out. And within ten minutes the whole Dorcas Society of eleven members {{started out in}} double file to visit the house of Maria Port.|$|R
5000|$|On 18 August {{the ruling}} Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairmen, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Asif Ali Zardari, said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> next <b>president</b> <b>should</b> come from <b>the</b> PPP {{as they had}} {{the largest number of}} seats in parliament.|$|R
5|$|With {{the death}} of President Harrison, Tyler became the first vice {{president}} to succeed to the presidency without election. After Harrison's one-month term, Tyler served longer than any president in U.S. history not elected to the office. To forestall constitutional uncertainty, Tyler immediately took the oath of office, moved into the White House, and assumed full presidential powers, a precedent that governed future successions and was codified in the Twenty-fifth Amendment. A strict constructionist, Tyler found much of the Whig platform unconstitutional, and vetoed several of his party's bills. Believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> set policy rather than Congress, he sought to bypass the Whig establishment, most notably Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. Most of Tyler's Cabinet resigned soon into his term, and the Whigs, dubbing him His Accidency, expelled him from the party. Tyler {{was the first to}} see his veto of legislation overridden by Congress. Although he faced a stalemate on domestic policy, he had several foreign-policy achievements, including the Webster–Ashburton Treaty with Britain and the Treaty of Wanghia with Qing China.|$|E
25|$|Vinson {{referenced}} Federalist No. 70’s {{arguments about}} {{energy in the}} executive to argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> be allowed to seize private property {{in a time of}} national crisis. In a more recent 2004 case, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, Justice Clarence Thomas utilized Federalist No. 70 to make the case <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> have the power to suspend Habeas Corpus for American citizens in order to fight the war on terror.|$|E
25|$|Formal {{negotiations}} on the salary and privileges of the permanent presidency began in April 2008 {{as part of the}} draft of the 2009 EU budget. The outcome was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> enjoy the same conditions as the President of the Commission, with a basic salary of 138% of the highest civil service grade: that would be €24,874.62 per month (not including family and other allowances).|$|E
50|$|A survey {{conducted}} {{during the presidential campaign}} in December 2014 by the daily newspaper Večernji list found that 50.4% of people thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> future <b>president</b> <b>should</b> support <b>the</b> current level of LGBT rights in Croatia, while 49.6% thought he/she shouldn't.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Act stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>President</b> <b>should</b> seek to end Sudanese {{veto power}} over and {{manipulation}} of United Nations humanitarian relief efforts carried out through Operation Lifeline Sudan, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. administration should make contingency plans for relief through other channels.|$|R

25|$|On March 21, Speaker Wang {{refused to}} meet with President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Jiang Yi-huah to discuss a response, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> listen {{to the people and}} that a {{compromise}} was needed between the lawmakers first. Premier Jiang met with demonstrators outside the legislature on March 22 but stated that the executive branch had no intention of dropping the trade pact. At a press conference on March 23, President Ma restated his resolve in passing the trade pact and affirmed he did not act according to orders from Beijing.|$|E
25|$|In 1825, Polk {{ran for the}} United States House of Representatives in the Tennessee's 6th congressional district. Polk campaigned so vigorously that Sarah {{began to}} worry about his health. During the campaign, Polk's opponents said that {{at the age of}} 29 Polk was too young for a spot in the House, but he won the {{election}} and took his seat in Congress. When Polk arrived in Washington, D.C. he roomed in Benjamin Burch's boarding house with some other Tennessee representatives, including Sam Houston. Polk made his first major speech on March 13, 1826, in which he said that the Electoral College should be abolished and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> be elected by the popular vote. Polk became a vocal critic of the Adams administration, frequently voting against its policies.|$|E
500|$|Lewis Strauss, the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, {{proposed}} in January 1958 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> {{be able to}} share nuclear information with allies that were making [...] "substantial and material contributions to the national defense and security". In addition to its own nuclear weapons, Britain had hosted American Strategic Air Command nuclear bombers since 1948. Congress modified the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 in June 1958, and America and Britain again began sharing nuclear research under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Amnesty International, Carter criticized {{the use of}} torture at Guantanamo Bay, saying that it [...] "contravenes the basic principles on which this nation was founded."

50|$|On 12 April 2007, in a {{press conference}} of the then Chief of the Turkish General Staff General Yaşar Büyükanıt, the Armed Forces' opinion on the {{elections}} was asked. Büyükanıt answered <b>the</b> question stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> new <b>president</b> <b>should</b> be loyal to republic principles not only by words but also by heart.|$|R
50|$|Hawit, {{having seen}} Jack Warner's reign as CONCACAF President last twenty one years, {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CONCACAF <b>president</b> <b>should</b> {{be able to}} serve only one four year-term {{at a time and}} for the Caribbean Football Union, UNCAF and North American Football Union to nominate <b>the</b> <b>president</b> on a rotary basis. He was an interim president of CONCACAF.|$|R
500|$|Furthermore, in the English tradition, {{judges were}} seen as being agents of the King and his court, who {{represented}} him throughout his realm. Madison believed that in the American states, this direct link between state executives and judges {{was a source of}} corruption through patronage, and thought the link had to be severed between the two, thus creating the [...] "third branch" [...] of the judiciary which had been without any direct precedent before this point. Madison, however, did not believe that the judiciary should be truly independent, but rather beholden to the legislature rather than the executive. At the Convention, some sided with Madison that the legislature should choose judges, while others believed the president should choose judges. A compromise was eventually reached <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> choose judges and the Senate confirm them.|$|E
500|$|His first {{incursion}} {{into the}} legislative realm occurred {{shortly after he}} assumed office, during the Senate debates over titles {{for the president and}} executive officers of the new government. Although the House of Representatives agreed in short order <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> be addressed simply as [...] "George Washington, President of the United States," [...] the Senate debated the issue at some length. Adams favored the adoption of the style of Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [...] Liberties) for the president. Others favored the variant of Electoral Highness or the lesser Excellency." [...] Anti-federalists in the Senate objected to the monarchical sound of them all. In the end, Washington yielded to their objections and the House decided that the title of [...] "Mr. President" [...] would be used.|$|E
500|$|While {{attending}} {{the launch of}} the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement on March 30, 2017, a student asked Biden what [...] "piece of advice" [...] he would give to President Trump, Biden responding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> grow up and cease his tweeting so he could focus on the office. During a speech at a May 29, 2017 gathering of Philip D. Murphy supporters at a community center gymnasium, [...] "There {{are a lot of people}} out there who are frightened. Trump played on their fears. What we haven’t done, in my view — and this is a criticism of all us — we haven’t spoken enough to the fears and aspirations of the people we come from." [...] On June 17, Biden predicted the [...] "state the nation is today will not be sustained by the American people" [...] while speaking at a Florida Democratic Party fundraiser in Hollywood.|$|E
50|$|All of Russia's Presidents {{have been}} independents. Former {{president}} Dmitry Medvedev declined {{an offer to}} join United Russia, saying <b>that</b> he believes <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> be an independent so <b>that</b> he serves <b>the</b> interests of the country rather than his political party.|$|R
50|$|Under <b>the</b> constitution, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> has {{extremely}} broad powers, including lawmaking {{authority and}} the ability to appoint judges. This makes it easy for him to abuse his power and accumulate wealth {{at the expense of the}} people. Critics have argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> power <b>should</b> be limited in specific ways while the prime minister's, parliament's, attorney general's, the judiciary’s powers are strengthened and reinforced. Critics have also called for a merit-based civil service.|$|R
5000|$|With the Death of Antonin Scalia in February of 2016, in {{the thick}} of a Presidential {{election}} year, the Republican majority in the Senate made it their stated policy to refuse to consider any nominee put forward by <b>President</b> Obama, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> next <b>president</b> <b>should</b> be <b>the</b> one to appoint Scalia's replacement. Scalia's death was only the second death of a serving justice in a span of sixty years ...|$|R
500|$|Harrison's {{health was}} a minor {{campaign}} issue; it was presented by the Whigs as robust, and by Democrats as decrepit. The campaign released a letter from his doctor, testifying to his good health; this was a presidential election first. Another testament to Harrison's health was his speeches: he gave 24 addresses between June and October, all in Ohio and lasting up to three hours; Van Buren did not give any. Harrison {{did not have the}} campaign trail to himself; Vice President Johnson told Van Buren <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> [...] "go out among the voters as I intended doing". Democrats tried to paint Johnson as the true hero of the Battle of the Thames, but the Vice President refused to criticize Harrison's conduct in battle. Nevertheless, Johnson spoke with such enthusiasm that he may have set off a riot in Cleveland, and was followed onto the trail late in the campaign by John Tyler, who had difficulty staying on message and resorted to telling questioners, [...] "I am in favor of what General Harrison and Mr. Clay are in favor of." ...|$|E
500|$|Primarily {{established}} {{to provide a}} successor {{in the event of}} the president's death, disability, or resignation, The vice president's sole constitutionally prescribed responsibility is to preside over the U.S. Senate as its president. The vice president also has the authority (ex officio, for he is not an elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Adams played {{an active role in the}} Senate's deliberations, particularly during his first term. On at least one occasion, he persuaded senators to vote against legislation he opposed, and he frequently lectured the body on procedural and policy matters. At the start of Washington's presidency, Adams became deeply involved in a month-long Senate controversy over the official titles for the president and executive officers of the new government. Although the House of Representatives agreed in short order <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> be addressed simply as [...] "George Washington, President of the United States," [...] the Senate debated the issue at some length. Adams favored the adoption of the style of Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [...] Liberties) for the president. Others favored the variant of Electoral Highness or the lesser Excellency." [...] Anti-federalists in the Senate objected to the monarchical sound of them all; Jefferson described them as [...] "superlatively ridiculous." [...] In the end, Washington yielded to their objections and the House decided that the title of [...] "Mr. President" [...] would be used.|$|E
2500|$|On April 3, 2003, Rep. Houghton {{introduced}} a similar bill, H.R 1584, to the House of Representatives with 3 co-sponsors: 2 Republicans, 1 Democrat. In Section 4 and 5 of S.760, it states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> report to Congress. In Section 4 and 5 of H.R 1584, it states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>should</b> {{report to the}} [...] "appropriate congressional committee". In Section 6 of S. 760, the Secretary of State is responsible for publishing in the Federal Register the required information, but the responsibility {{was given to the}} President in H.R 1584. The bill passed with a vote of 419-2 vote. The bill was then sent to the Senate and passed with unanimous consent. [...] The bill was presented to the president April 14, 2003, and it was signed on April 25, 2003, thus becoming law. Section 4 of the new law required President George W. Bush to “prohibit the importation into, or exportation from, the United States of any rough diamond, from whatever source, that has not been controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS)." [...] In order to adhere to this new law, President George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13312.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2016, Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died. <b>The</b> {{following}} month, <b>President</b> Barack Obama nominated D.C. Circuit Judge Merrick Garland {{to replace}} Scalia. However, the Senate {{was controlled by}} the Republican Party, which argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> next <b>president</b> <b>should</b> instead appoint Scalia's successor. Senate Republicans refused to hold hearings on Garland, and Garland's nomination remained before the Senate longer than any other Supreme Court nomination. Garland's nomination expired {{with the end of}} the 114th United States Congress.|$|R

50|$|The main {{theme of}} {{discussion}} in the campaign preceding the election was <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> powers and whether they should be limited further. The Green League's candidate Heidi Hautala suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> be completely stripped of all powers relating to foreign affairs and foreign policy, but this proposal met with fierce resistance from the three candidates of the largest parties - Tarja Halonen, Matti Vanhanen and Sauli Niinistö. Halonen, the main left-wing candidate and incumbent president, has further indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> powers <b>should</b> not be increased either, since it would, in her opinion, reduce the degree of democratic decision-making.|$|R

[...] He also noted “The storm was still forming, people were debating whether {{it was going to be}} as bad as expected, or not, and I noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>should</b> have let the governors and mayors deal with the storm until it got closer to hitting the coastal areas along the Washington, D.C.-New York City corridor.” ...|$|E
