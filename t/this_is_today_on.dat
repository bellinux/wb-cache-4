40|$|In {{building}} the parliamentary democracy, parties as membership organizations are crucial in exercising the linkage function of political participation and representation between {{citizens and the}} State (Poguntke 2002). At their core, parties have always attracted members who have both participated {{in the community of}} supporters and have been decisive actors in the minimal conventional participation, that of electoral participation (Whiteley, Seyd & Richardson 1994). Members are also critical in the implementation of social and political representation (Widfelt 1999). In the last twenty years, a number of political scientists have focused on the causes and consequences of a decline in party membership (Mair & Van Biezen 2001) and in the partiesâ€™ own interest in their members (Scarrow 1996). Though controversial, <b>this</b> debate <b>is</b> <b>today</b> <b>on</b> the agenda of studies of political activism or partiesâ€™ organizational changes. Part of the debate refers to the potential changes linked to the shifts in party organization, the shifts of power downwards - regionalization - and upwards - Europeanization and internationalization - and of substantial transformations linked to the introduction and exploitation of new communication media. The panel welcomes papers questioning the causes and consequences of these shifts on party membership, the ability of party members to exercise their linkage function (participation and representation), and the willingness of party organizations and leaders to do so. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R

In the same time, the common grazing on crop residues of farmers by cattle belonging to pastoralists has accelerated the export of organic matter and encouraged the decline of soil fertility of farmers. The extensive practices and avoidance strategies that are traditionally developed individually by farmers, herders and local authorities, are now unable to contain the threats to sustainability of agricultural resources and profitability of production systems. Based on the detailed study of actor's practices and the follow-up during two years of their methods and results concerning the production and management of crop residues and organic manure, this paper proposes a pragmatic approach for innovation. The intensification of production systems is based on models of crop-livestock integration that have been constructed according to 3 scales: plot; farm; and territory. The implementation of these models requires coordinating scales and deploying approaches of consultation and contracting among actors and also technical and also organizational support as presented in the paper...|$|R

Drones-based monitoring is of great importance in variety of civilian domains, such as road safety, homeland security, and even environmental control. In its military aspect, efficiently detecting evading targets by a fleet of unmanned drones has an ever increasing impact on the ability of modern armies to engage in warfare. The latter is true both traditional symmetric conflicts among armies as well as asymmetric ones.

Given an estimation cost of the threat's potential damages, as well as types of monitoring drones available and their comparative performance, our proposed method generates an analytically provable strategy, stating the optimal number and types of drones to be deployed, in order to cost-efficiently monitor a pre-defined region for targets maneuvering using a given roads networks.

However, the application of medicines in coccidiosis control has as a consequence also certain undesired effects, of which the most important are toxicity, incompatibility with other drugs or chemical substances, coccidia resistence, and the presence of residue in poultry tissue.

In order to fulfill these flexible business situations, {{there is a need for}} the use of support systems. However, classical support systems do not offer the necessary agility to support today’s rapidly changing or generally unpredictable workflows due to their static runtime execution. Thus, modern workflow systems have the need to provide a flexible, but process aware execution at runtime that do not force users into a pre-defined way of doing their work. In addition to these new requirements, they must still support users during the execution like classical systems already do (Herbst 2004, p. 4). However, to find the right balance between both tasks is highly challenging. According to prior research papers (Schwarz et al. 2001; Wargitsch 1998), the examined systems were not appropriate for supporting flexible or so called ad-hoc (cf. section two) workflows. Thus, this paper evaluates the state-of-the-art of current systems based on the viewpoint which requirements have already been achieved and for which requirements technical concepts are still to be developed. Furthermore, the paper clarifies whether there is a comprehensive approach which can be used in every business context or which approach can be used in which specific context. To achieve such an evaluation, the paper defines the basics of flexibility and details concerning business processes and process support within section two. Subsequently, a framework with six criterions is derived which allows a structural evaluation (cf. section four) of the reviewed approaches and technology (cf. section three). 121...|$|R

HHS provides oversight of state child welfare systems, and in all states, child protective services (CPS) is part of the child welfare system.

As people age, they often reach a point when {{they are no longer}} capable of handling their own finances or have difficulty making other decisions for themselves. To ensure that federal cash payments received by incapacitated adults are used in their best interest, the Social Security Administration (SSA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and other federal agencies assign a responsible third party or fiduciary to oversee these benefits. SSA and VA can designate spouses, other family members, friends, and organizations to serve as fiduciaries. Similarly, when state courts determine that adults are incapacitated, they have the authority to grant other persons or entities [...] guardians [...] the authority and responsibility to make financial and other decisions for them. Incapacitated adults are vulnerable to financial exploitation by fiduciaries and guardians, so these arrangements are not without risk. In 2010, we identified hundreds of allegations of abuse, neglect, and exploitation by guardians in 45 states and the District of Columbia between 1990 and 2010. At that time, we reviewed 20 of these cases and found that guardians had stolen or otherwise improperly obtained $ 5. 4 million from 158 incapacitated victims, many of whom were older adults. To protect against financial exploitation, state courts as well as federal agencies are responsible for screening prospective guardians and federal fiduciaries, respectively, to make sure suitable individuals are appointed. They are also responsible for monitoring the performance of those they appoint. <b>This</b> statement <b>today</b> <b>is</b> based <b>on</b> our recent report on this topic.

NextGen will impact nearly every aspect of air transportation and will transform {{the way in which}} the air transportation system operates today. It will do so, in part, by (1) using satellite-based surveillance as opposed to ground-based radars, (2) using performance-based navigation instead of cumbersome step-by-step procedures, (3) replacing routine voice communications with data transmissions, and (4) organizing and merging the disjointed data that pilots, controllers, airports, airlines, and others currently rely on to operate the system. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been planning and developing NextGen since 2003, and is now implementing near-term (through 2012) and mid-term (through 2018) capabilities. Over the years, concerns have been raised by the Congress and other stakeholders that despite years of effort and billions of dollars spent, FAA has not made sufficient progress in deploying systems and producing benefits. In past reports, we have made a number of recommendations to FAA to address delays in development and acquisitions, improve its processes, and focus on accountability and performance. Others have also made recommendations to FAA to improve its implementation of NextGen. For example, the Department of Transportation's Office of the Inspector General recently made recommendations regarding specific NextGen programs, and the NextGen Midterm Implementation Task Force [...] whose creation was requested by FAA [...] resulted in consensus recommendations from industry on specific capabilities FAA should prioritize.
