5|$|The Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway is {{now closed}} between Rowsley and Buxton where the <b>trackbed</b> forms {{part of the}} Monsal Trail. The Cromford and High Peak Railway is now {{completely}} shut, with part of the <b>trackbed</b> {{open to the public}} as the High Peak Trail. Another disused rail line between Buxton and Ashbourne now forms the Tissington Trail.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern <b>trackbed</b> {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had {{acquired}} a bad reputation due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused <b>trackbed</b> by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E
5|$|The former <b>trackbed</b> of the Tyldesley Loopline {{route to}} the A580,within the Wigan MBC area was {{reserved}} in the Unitary Development Plan in case the rail route could be reinstated. A guided busway {{was built on the}} former <b>trackbed</b> but the proposal was not universally popular. After consultations work started on the 4.5-mile busway from Leigh to Ellenbrook in 2013. It has four stops, Cooling Lane, Astley Street, Hough Lane and Sale Lane and one of its three park and ride sites in Tyldesley. A pathway for walkers, cyclists and horse riders runs alongside it.|$|E

5|$|Competition from {{road traffic}} {{starting}} {{in the early twentieth}} century put pressure on the railway, and it was later a victim of the Beeching cuts. The line was seen as unprofitable, and it closed to passengers in 1964, and to goods traffic in 1967. Part of the <b>trackbed</b> today provides a section of the Milton Keynes redway system.|$|E
5|$|Passenger train {{services}} {{over the}} bridge declined significantly after the Ruabon to Barmouth line via Llangollen and Dolgellau was closed in 1965, causing all traffic to take the longer and slower route from Shrewsbury via Machynlleth and Dovey Junction.

5|$|The {{line was}} finally closed to freight traffic in 1967, {{after which the}} tracks were lifted. Part of the <b>trackbed</b> is now used by the Milton Keynes redway system, the network of cycle and {{pedestrian}} routes that serves the Milton Keynes urban area.|$|E
5|$|The {{poor quality}} gravel soil, {{which had been}} the initial reason for the site's cheapness and its {{selection}} as {{the site for the}} cemetery, was poorly suited as a railway <b>trackbed.</b> The LNC's rails, and in particular its sleepers, deteriorated rapidly and needed constantly to be replaced.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, Lawrence Hill {{came under the}} control of the Western Region of British Railways, which oversaw a gradual decline of services at Lawrence Hill. Passenger numbers along the Clifton Extension Railway, now known as the Severn Beach Line, also dropped, and in 1963 the Beeching report suggested that all services along the line be withdrawn. In the end, services continued to Severn Beach but were discontinued via Henbury and Pilning. Staff were withdrawn from the station from 17 July 1967 as a cost-saving measure. The footbridge was demolished by 1970, forcing passengers to change platform via the steps to Church Road at the south end of the station. Most of the station buildings were demolished in August 1970, but there were still some on the westernmost platform in 1979. By 1974 the platforms serving the eastern tracks had been removed, with the tracks themselves removed in 1984. Plans to use the disused <b>trackbed</b> as part of a light rail scheme linking the city centre to the northern suburbs were formed in the late 1990s, with the aim of an operational scheme by 2008, but the plans had been shelved by 2004. It was suggested in 2008 that the <b>trackbed</b> could be used as a cycle path to join together communities which had been separated by the construction of the M32 motorway, however this was dropped due to Network Rail asserting that the <b>trackbed</b> might be necessary for future rail expansion.|$|E

5|$|A dam {{was built}} across the Cefni river north of Llangefni {{in the late}} 1940s to {{increase}} the water supply available to the island. The new reservoir, Llyn Cefni, crossed the railway's <b>trackbed,</b> and a bridge was built to support it.

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, the {{pendulum}} had swung back towards road transport. The Cromford Canal was largely abandoned in 1944, and several of the rail lines passing through the Peak were closed as uneconomic in the 1960s as part of the Beeching Axe. The Woodhead Line was closed between Hadfield and Penistone. Parts of the <b>trackbed</b> are now used for the Trans Pennine Trail, the stretch between Hadfield and Woodhead being known specifically as the Longdendale Trail.|$|E

5|$|The Cuckoo Line closed {{shortly after}} the Hospital Railway. Hellingly station closed to {{passengers}} on 14June 1965, and the line closed for goods traffic on 26April 1968. The station building complete with platform is now a private residence, and the Cuckoo Line <b>trackbed</b> was converted to the Cuckoo Trail long-distance footpath in 1990. Much of {{the route of the}} Hospital Railway is also now a footpath.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuation}} of Octel Freight Traffic until 1993 ensured {{that not only}} was the <b>trackbed</b> kept whole, but the majority of the rail infrastructure was still in situ. As such, the Amlwch line was well suited to preservation as a heritage railway, or see a return of mainline services. The continued role of Llangefni as an administrative and commercial centre led British Rail and Gwynedd County Council to consider restoring passenger services between Llangefni and Bangor in the late 1980s, but the idea was turned down.|$|E
5|$|The {{station and}} the {{adjacent}} segment of the Rockaway Line suffered serious damage during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and was out of service for several months.

During its temporary closure, the station received new ADA-tactile strips, platform edge rubbing boards, and cosmetic and mechanical work.

5|$|A new mineral venture was {{attempted}} in 1907, {{for which}} {{much of the}} line was re-opened and a -gauge extension was added, but this failed and the line closed again in 1910. A section of the track {{was used to test}} and demonstrate an automatic signal warning device in 1911 and occasionally used in that connection up to 1914. The tracks were lifted for scrap in 1917, after which a light railway was laid on part of the <b>trackbed</b> in 1918 to carry timber. This ended in 1920 and the company was wound up in 1925.|$|E
5|$|After closure, {{the line}} was largely forgotten. Because it had been built on private land without an Act of Parliament, few records of it prior to the Oxford {{extension}} schemes exist in official archives.

Other than the station buildings at Westcott and Quainton Road almost nothing survives of the tramway, although much of the route can still be traced by a double line of hedges.
