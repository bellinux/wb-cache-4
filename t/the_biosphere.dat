5|$|Polonium-210 is {{widespread}} in <b>the</b> <b>biosphere,</b> including in human tissues, {{because of its}} position in the uranium-238 decay chain. Natural uranium-238 in the Earth's crust decays through a series of solid radioactive intermediates including radium-226 to the radioactive noble gas radon-222, some of which, during its 3.8-day half-life, diffuses into the atmosphere. There it decays through several more steps to polonium-210, much of which, during its 138-day half-life, is washed back down to the Earth's surface, thus entering <b>the</b> <b>biosphere,</b> before finally decaying to stable lead-206.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>biosphere</b> is {{the part}} of Earth's outer shell– {{including}} land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere– within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest geophysiological point of view, <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air). The entire Earth contains over 75billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within <b>the</b> <b>biosphere.)</b> and 455billion kg (between 845billion and 975billion lb, or about 423million–488million short tons). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8x1013kg (75billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.|$|E

50|$|Human {{activity}} has large effects on <b>the</b> terrestrial <b>biosphere,</b> changing <b>the</b> {{way that it}} acts as a carbon reservoir. Anthropogenically caused fires release large amounts of carbon as CO2 directly into the atmosphere. More significantly, however, humans modify land cover. Land cover change greatly decreases {{the amount of carbon}} uptake in <b>the</b> terrestrial <b>biosphere.</b> It modifies <b>the</b> local ecosystem, often replacing carbon-rich forest with agricultural or urban land use. This releases the carbon stored in the former land cover type and simultaneously decreases <b>the</b> <b>biosphere's</b> ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere.|$|R

5|$|Group 3 {{elements}} are generally hard metals with low aqueous solubility, and have low availability to <b>the</b> <b>biosphere.</b> No group 3 element has any documented biological role in living organisms. The radioactivity of the actinides generally makes them highly toxic to living cells, causing radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the ecology of individual organisms, to those of populations, to the ecosystems and finally <b>the</b> <b>biosphere.</b> The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although population biology is more frequently used in the case of diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E
5|$|The group 4 {{elements}} {{are not known}} {{to be involved in}} the biological chemistry of any living systems. They are hard refractory metals with low aqueous solubility and low availability to <b>the</b> <b>biosphere.</b> Titanium is one of the few first row d-block transition metals with no known biological role. Rutherfordium's radioactivity would make it toxic to living cells.|$|E

50|$|Other human-caused {{changes in}} the {{atmospheric}} carbon cycle are due to anthropogenic changes to carbon reservoirs. Deforestation, for example, decreases <b>the</b> <b>biosphere's</b> ability to absorb carbon, thus {{increasing the amount of}} carbon in the atmosphere.|$|R
5|$|The present era is {{classified}} {{as part of a}} mass extinction event, the Holocene extinction event, the fastest ever to have occurred. Some, such as E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, predict that human destruction of <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100years. The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.|$|E
5|$|After the Carboniferous {{rainforest}} collapse amphibian dominance {{gave way}} to reptiles, and amphibians were further devastated by the Permian–Triassic extinction event. During the Triassic Period (250 to 200 million years ago), the reptiles continued to out-compete the amphibians, leading {{to a reduction in}} both the amphibians' size and their importance in <b>the</b> <b>biosphere.</b> According to the fossil record, Lissamphibia, which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage, may have branched off from the extinct groups Temnospondyli and Lepospondyli at some period between the Late Carboniferous and the Early Triassic. The relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating, but the most recent molecular study, based on multilocus sequence typing, suggests a Late Carboniferous/Early Permian origin for extant amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} stems {{largely from the}} habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to the operations of <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems. At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities.|$|E

5|$|The {{unusually high}} {{concentration}} of oxygen gas on Earth {{is the result of}} the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, <b>the</b> <b>biosphere,</b> and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.|$|E

5|$|Wilderness is {{generally}} defined as {{areas that have}} not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, , national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, solitude, and recreation. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity, and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to {{be an integral part of}} the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (<b>the</b> <b>biosphere).</b> They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Climatic and osmotic {{pressure}} places physiological constraints on organisms, {{especially those that}} fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths. These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in <b>the</b> <b>biosphere,</b> as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences. For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. Water transportation by plants is another important ecophysiological process affected by {{osmotic pressure}} gradients. Water pressure {{in the depths of}} oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences. Differences between hagfish species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Humans play a {{key role}} in <b>the</b> <b>biosphere,</b> with the large human {{population}} dominating many of Earth's ecosystems. This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, now known as the Holocene extinction. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007. At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of extinction in the next hundred years. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution of invasive species, hunting, and climate change. In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global primary production. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Humans regard certain insects as pests, {{and attempt}} to control them using {{insecticides}} {{and a host of}} other techniques. Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves or fruits. A few parasitic species are pathogenic. Some insects perform complex ecological roles; blow-flies, for example, help consume carrion but also spread diseases. Insect pollinators are essential to the life cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms, including humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the terrestrial portion of <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> (including humans) would be devastated. Many other insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit. Silkworms and bees have been used extensively by humans for the production of silk and honey, respectively. In some cultures, people eat the larvae or adults of certain insects.|$|E
5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E
5|$|This {{narrative}} for Tommy {{is set in}} {{deep space}} in a small, self-contained biosphere bubble spaceship. Jackman's character in this plot is alone, flying in outer space toward the golden nebula of Xibalba with a large tree and a few personal effects comprising his ship. While traveling, he meditates, performs t'ai chi, grows mushrooms and cuts pieces of bark from the tree for nourishment. He also converses with apparitions of Izzi. It is implied that the tree within <b>the</b> <b>biosphere</b> also represents Izzi and that Tommy has been transporting it to Xibalba {{with the hope that}} she will be restored to him. Tommy is also shown to have applied extensive, incremental tattooed ring patterns to both of his arms similar to the tattoo of his engagement ring from Izzi in 2006; it is implied that the tattoos mark the passage of time on his journey in 2500.|$|E
