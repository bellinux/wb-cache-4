40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{are a major}} {{family of}} brominated flame retardants, being lipophilic, persistent, and <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> <b>fauna</b> and humans. Today there is growing concern about accumulation of brominated organic compounds in the food chain. The highest levels of PBDEs {{have been found in}} top marine predators. In this study we use immunofluorescence techniques in fibroblast cell cultures to explore the susceptibility of cetaceans to PBDEs, with qualitative and quantitative evaluation of target proteins such as CYP 450 1 A 1 - 1 A 2 and CYP 450 2 B 4. Fibroblast cell cultures (third generation) from two male and two female striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) and a speciment of bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), sampled with biopsy darts in summer 2004 in the Mediterranean Whale Santuary, were treated experimentally with a commercial mixture (BDE-MXE, Wellington, Canada) containing 27 PBDEs, from mono- to deca-brominated. The cells were treated with the mixture solubilized in nonane (0. 01 µg/ml) at three different doses were used: 0. 1 µg/ml, 0. 05 µg/ml and 0. 01 µg/ml, for 48 h, and with nonane (0. 01 µg/ml) as control. After a first reaction with the primary antibodies for CYP 450 1 A 1 - 1 A 2 and 2 B 4, the cells were treated with the respective secondary antibodies marked with a fluorochrome. The main results of this experiments were: 1) the detection of presence of the cytochromes 1 A 1 - 1 A 2 and 2 B 4 in striped dolphin fibroblast cells, revealed from the crossreaction of the antibody used and from the presence of fluorescence in the fibroblasts; 2) the increase of fluorescence in relation to the treatment doses of contaminants; 3) the preliminary detection of differences in the induction phenomena between specimens and gender...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was selection of an appropriate algal culture for biological treatment of biomass gasification wastewater based on acute toxicity considerations. The three algae that were selected were Spirulina sp., Scenedesmus abundans and a fresh water algal consortium. Acute toxicity of the metabolites produced by these algal cultures was tested at the end of log phase using the standard bioluminescence inhibition assay based on Vibrio fischeri NRRLB 11174. Scenedesmus abundans and a fresh water algal consortium dominated by cyanobacteria such as Phormidium, Chroococcus and Oscillatoria did not release much toxic metabolites at the end of log phase and caused only about 20 % inhibition in bioluminescence.

Nitrite caused significant declines in wood frog hatching success (3. 4 mg/L NO 2 -N, wood frog), and lower concentrations caused significant mortality during the early larval stages (4. 6 mg/L NO 2 -N, salamander; 0. 5 mg/L NO 2 -N, wood frog). Later tests exposing individuals to nitrite only after hatching showed that both wood frog and tiger salamander vulnerability to nitrite declined shortly after hatching. Hence, examining a single life-history stage, especially later in development, may miss critical toxic effects on organisms, causing the researcher potentially to underestimate seriously the ecological consequences of nitrite exposure.

40|$|Abstract To {{elucidate}} {{the effects of}} scallop mari-culture on the macrobenthic community in a moderate energy system, bimonthly samples from four transects along a distance gradient in Sishili Bay, the northern Yellow Sea of China, were investigated. Differences in macrobenthic community structure along the distance gradient were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. The AZTI’s Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and multivariate-AMBI analyses indi-cated that the macrobenthic community suffered little disturbance from the scallop culture. Consistently, the results of two-way analysis of similarities demon-strated that macrobenthic communities showed no difference along the distance gradient, but were significantly affected by the sampling months and transects. This conclusion was also confirmed by other univariate and multivariate analyses. The concentra-tion of total organic carbon was 17. 27 ± 6. 05 mg g- 1, which is below the dangerous threshold of 35 mg g- 1 <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> benthic <b>fauna.</b> Combined results revealed that no detectable effects on the macrobenthic community were caused by intensive and long-term scallop culture in this moderate energy system.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was carried out}} to observe effects of standard grade and fine grade barite on the filtration rates of four suspension feeding bivalves, Modiolus modiolus, Dosinia exoleta, Venerupis senegalensis and Chlamys varia. Standard grade barite, {{the most commonly used}} weighting agent in water-based drilling mud, was responsible for altering the filtration rates of the four bivalve species and damaging the gill structure. The four bivalves were exposed to 0. 5 mm, 1. 0 mm and 2. 0 mm daily depth equivalents of standard grade barite, which permanently remained in suspension. All three barite levels altered the filtration rates leading to 100 % mortality. The horse mussel, Modiolus modiolus was the most tolerant to standard barite with the scallop, Chlamys varia the least tolerant. Fine grade barite, at a 2 mm daily depth equivalent, also altered the filtration rates of the four bivalve species, but only affected mortality of Venerupis senegalensis, with 60 % survival at 28 days. In-vivo studies showed damage to the gills, ranging from displaced inter-lamellar junctions to the deletion of large parts of demibranch. Post-mortem microscopy studies showed damage to individual filaments with a marked reduction in the active surface area of the gill.

Many studies indicate {{the possibility of using}} these animals as bioindicators of environmental contamination of relatively limited areas. Today there is a growing concern about the accumulation of brominated organic compounds in the marine food web. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a major family of brominated flame retardants which are lipophilic, persistent, and <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> both <b>fauna</b> and humans. The highest levels of PBDEs have been found {{in the top of the}} marine food chain. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of PBDEs in specimens of striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba) sampled with the non-lethal method of biopsy in the Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic areas with different anthropogenic impacts: the Gibraltar Straits, the Pelagos Sanctuary (Ligurian Sea) and the west Ionian Sea (Sicily). The levels of individual PBDEs were determined by GC/MS. Negative chemical ionisation (NCI-MS) using methane as reagent gas, was the operating mode. Results obtained indicated the presence of BDE- 99, BDE- 153, BDE- 154, BDE- 100, and BDE- 47 as the most abundant. Total PBDEs found in this study were in the range 8 – 25 ppm (ug/g fresh weight), being samples from the Ligurian sea, the highest contaminated compared to specimens from the Straits of Gibraltar.

Another theory for the decline might be, as research shows, that species from the Southern Hemisphere are on average 4.6 million years old, compared to an average 2.9 million years old for the Northern Hemisphere: Researchers believe this age difference is because of the history of severe ice ages in the Northern Hemisphere, which may drive older species to extinction.|$|R
40|$|Vetiver grass {{technology}} (VGT), {{which is}} based on the application of vetiver grass, was first developed by the World Bank for soil and water conservation in India in the 1980 s. While this application still has a vital role in agricultural lands, scientific research conducted {{in the last ten years}} has clearly demonstrated that VGT is also one of the most effective, low cost and natural methods of environmental protection. As a result VGT is now increasingly being used worldwide for this purpose. Pollution of the environment due to soil erosion and agro-chemical contamination from agricultural lands, urban wastes and by-products of industrial and mining operations is a major global problem, as most of the pollutants are often <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> flora, <b>fauna</b> and human beings living in the vicinity or downstream of the contaminated sites. The main factors that have contributed to the global application and acceptance of VGT are the availability of scientific data to back up anecdotal field observation and also to provide explanations to vetiver’s phenomenal and unique characteristics. More specifically, the breakthrough was achieved following the establishment of high tolerance levels of vetiver grass to adverse soil conditions, heavy metal toxicities and agro-chemicals in the last six years. This has subsequently led to: (i) establish VGT as an effective, low-tech and low-cost method of mine rehabilitation, (ii) establish VGT as an effective offsite pollution control method by trapping pesticides, herbicides and nutrients in runoff water from agricultural lands, and (iii) demonstrate that vetiver is highly suitable as a wetland species, as it is extremely tolerant to high levels of agro-chemicals under wetland conditions. This paper presents the state of knowledge of the proven and potential applications of VGT in the above fields, and also other applications in protecting the terrestrial, aquatic, aerial and social environments...|$|R
40|$|Ozone {{is a key}} {{trace gas}} in the troposphere; {{because it is a}} {{greenhouse}} gas, it is very reactive, and it is potentially <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> humans, <b>fauna,</b> and vegetation. The main sink processes for ozone are chemical reactions and the turbulent deposition flux to the earth’s surface. The deposition process itself is rather complex: The interactions between co-varying drivers such as the tropospheric ozone concentration, turbulence, and chemical reactions are not well understood. In the case of ozone deposition to vegetation, another aspect that must be studied is the role of stomatal regulation {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Therefore, we measured turbulent deposition fluxes of ozone with the eddy covariance technique during the peak of the growing season in 2014 over a managed, rewetted peatland in NW Germany. The deposition flux was large during the day (up to − 15 nmol m− 2 s− 1) and relatively small during the night (between − 1 and − 2 nmol m− 2 s− 1). Flux partitioning by applying the surface resistance analogy and further analysis showed that the stomatal uptake was smaller than non-stomatal deposition. The correction of stomatal conductance with the gross primary production (GPP) improved the estimation of day- and nighttime stomatal deposition fluxes. Statistical analysis confirmed that the friction velocity (u*) was the single most important driver of non-stomatal ozone deposition and that relationships with other environmental drivers are not linear and highly variable. Further research is needed to develop a better process understanding of non-stomatal ozone deposition, to quantify the role of surface deposition to the ozone budget of the atmospheric boundary layer, and to estimate uncertainties associated with the partitioning of ozone deposition into stomatal and non-stomatal fluxes...|$|R

40|$|The present Doctoral Thesis {{is framed}} within the main {{research}} {{line of the}} Chemical and Biochemical Processes Technology Group (TEP 025), from the Chemical Engineering Department of the University of Granada. In this research group, different treatments {{have been developed for}} industrial wastewaters purification through advanced oxidation processes, membrane technology as well as IE technique. Concretely, one of the research lines is focused on the depuration of olive mill effluents. During the two-phase olive oil extraction system, two wastewater streams are mainly produced: the first one comes from the washing of the fruit, and is therefore called olives washing wastewater (OWW), and the second one is generated in the extraction of the olive oil, thus referred to as olive oil washing wastewater, OOW, a mixture of the olive-fruit humidity along with process-added water. These effluents are commonly known as olive mill wastewater (OMW). Olives washing wastewater presents low organic load and constitutes the largest amount of the generated wastewater volume. On the other hand, olive oil washing wastewater has high organic load, highlighting the phenols content, which are phytotoxic and refractory, thus resistant to biological degradation. In moderate concentrations are often <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> aquatic <b>fauna</b> and flora. Therefore, the wastewater from these industries great difficulty degrade by biological processes, both aerobic and anaerobic. Polyphenols gives a high antimicrobial activity inhibiting the development of flora responsible for self-purification processes, presenting phytotoxic activity. Improper disposal of OMW to the environment or to domestic wastewater treatment plants is prohibited due to its toxicity to microorganisms, and also because of the consequent surface and groundwater potential contamination. Moreover, there is a legislation requiring the reduction of the global indicators concentration - COD and suspended solids - so these effluents can be reused or discharged. On the other hand, this wastewater also presents a high inorganic compounds concentration, especially high levels of potassium salts (60 - 70...|$|R

The {{diameter of the}} net. cages i s between 15 and 25 metres. The height i s approximately 10 - 12 metres.

Finally, potential treatment of pollutants within sediment in a channel was quantified. The physical and chemical characteristics of car park sediment was shown to be similar during both the accumulation (build-up) and wash-off stages, suggesting that the accumulated sediment is generally mobilised and transported to the channel drain (wash-off). Furthermore, both the physical and chemical characteristics of the sediment were shown to be similar to those found on highways, thorough the build-up and wash-off phases.

30|$|Because of huge {{production}} and inadvertent use of nanomaterials, the whole environment is affected. Although, {{many of them}} are useful, some are <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> plants, algae and microorganisms. They may, therefore, pose potential risk to the environment. Nanomaterials are frequently used in plant growth, cosmetics, drug delivery, photonic crystals, analysis, food, coatings, paints, bioremediation, catalysis and material science [1 – 12]. Keller and Lazareva [13] have reported that about 3000 tons of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticles are produced every year and more than 50 % of which is used in personal care products [14]. Copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles cause membrane damage to Escherichia coli as demonstrated by K+ leakage [15]. A study on Zebrafish (Danio rerio) has shown that as exposure days of TiO 2 nanoparticles were increased, the number of viable embryos was decreased [16]. Some nanomaterials are <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> flora and <b>fauna</b> as they are used to inhibit their growth to prevent further multiplication [17, 18]. Biouptake and accumulation of nanomaterials in plants may increase shoot length and decrease root length and their proliferation [19, 21]. The toxicity response depends on the concentration, particle size and shape of the nanomaterials [22]. Some studies have demonstrated that nanoparticle exposure improves free-radical scavenging potential and antioxidant enzymatic activities and alters microRNAs expression that regulates different morphological, physiological and metabolic processes in plants [22]. The toxicity of the free metal ions {{has been shown to be}} greater than that of the nanoparticles. For instance, silver nanoparticles are less <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> plants than the silver ions [23] mainly due to greater solubility of AgNO 3 and greater mobility of Ag+ ions in aqueous medium. Lipid peroxidation is an important parameter which indicates the cell membrane integrity [24 – 26]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is known to damage cell membrane through lipid peroxidation leading to ion leakage and disruption of the cellular metabolism leading to cell death. ROS also cause oxidative damage to photosynthetic apparatuses and biomolecules [27, 28]. Thus, plants protect cellular and sub-cellular system from the cytotoxic effects of active oxygen radicals with antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD; catalase, CAT; peroxidase, POD and ascorbate peroxidase; etc.) and low molecular weight antioxidants (ascorbate, glutathione, proline, carotenoids, a-tocopherols and phenolics, etc.) and non-enzymatic components (carotenoids, ascorbate and tocopherol, etc.) [26, 29 – 31]. These components minimize the oxidative damage during exposure to metal oxide nanoparticles [18, 32, 33]. Zea mays exposed to CeO 2 nanoparticles [34] did not show lipid peroxidation and any physiological changes, although activity of catalase, ascorbate and upregulation of heat shock proteins was observed. However, no elevation of lipid peroxidation in rice treated with CeO 2 nanoparticles (0 – 500  mg/L) was recorded but ion leakage was observed at higher doses [35].|$|R

Maximum mite control was achieved eight times faster with citral than menthol in fumigation assays. ...|$|R
50|$|On March 15, 2017 the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) {{announced}} recommendations proceeding from a {{risk assesment}} of glyphosate performed by ECHA's Committee for Risk Assesmant (RAC). Their recommendations maintained the current classification of glyphosate {{as a substance}} causing serious eye damage, and as a substance <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> aquatic life. However, the RAC did not find evidence implicating glyphosate to be a carcinogen, a mutagen, as <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> reproduction, nor as <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> specific organs.|$|R
