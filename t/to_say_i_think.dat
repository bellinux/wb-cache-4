500|$|Comedy Central {{originally}} ordered {{only six}} episodes of South Park {{for the first}} season's initial run. However, when the show {{proved to be a}} success, they requested an additional seven, the first ones of which creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had to produce quickly. [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first of those new seven episodes to be produced. It was also the first South Park Halloween episode. The script was written by Parker, Stone and writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker and Stone, who made the pinkeye a major element of the plot because they associate the illness with the elementary school experience. Parker said, [...] "Pinkeye is just such a huge part of your life when you're in third grade. Pinkeye is the thing every third grader gets and it's just such a bizarre thing." [...] In writing the episode, Parker said he wanted to convey his belief that Halloween is a positive holiday, especially for children: [...] "Halloween's a great thing. That was part of what we wanted (<b>to</b> <b>say).</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> kids having this kind of mythology is great." ...|$|E
500|$|Casey Luskin of the Discovery Institute, which {{promotes}} intelligent design, contested this, saying, [...] "the problem for their logic is that ID {{is not an}} arbitrary explanation, because we have much experience with intelligent agents producing the type of informational complexity we see in nature." [...] Columnist Jeff Jacoby wrote in The Boston Globe that intelligent design [...] "isn't primitivism or Bible-thumping or flying spaghetti. It's science." [...] This view of science, however, {{was rejected by the}} United States National Academy of Sciences. Peter Gallings of Answers in Genesis, a Young Earth Creationist ministry said [...] "Ironically enough, , in addition to mocking God himself, are lampooning the Intelligent Design Movement for not identifying a specific deity—that is, leaving open the possibility that a spaghetti monster could be the intelligent designer... Thus, the satire is possible because the Intelligent Design Movement hasn’t affiliated with a particular religion, exactly the opposite of what its other critics claim!" [...] Mark Coppenger, a pastor who teaches at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, commented, [...] "I'm happy <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> FSM hurts the evolutionists' program since, by mocking the Christian tradition... it reinforces the correct impression that there is genuine contempt for biblical faith in that camp... Besides, the parody is lame, and there are few things more encouraging than cheap shots from one's opponents." ...|$|E

"But I {{would like}} <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{there were seven}} non-orthodox, which means {{those who did not}} hold their brand of Trinitarianism, which we reject today, along with them. So, we {{probably}} would have been branded as Arian by the orthodox." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is I, Mr. Faulkner," [...] Julian replied quietly; [...] "and as I don't {{want to have}} {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that you had better go on your way without interfering with me." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{season was}} not without confrontation, as O'Neal in one team meeting said, [...] "I have {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Kobe is playing too selfishly for us to win." [...] O'Neal felt pressure to be leader of the team and was upset with Bryant's shot selection. Teammate Ron Harper helped mediate the differences between O'Neal and Bryant. According to Jackson, [...] "Kobe didn't have a selfish agenda; he just felt that {{the way he had}} been playing was the best way he could contribute. Gradually, he's seen there is a different way to contribute that incorporates more of the team." [...] Upon arriving to the Lakers that season, Winter said he was stunned to discover the level of hatred O'Neal expressed toward Bryant. [...] "There was a lot of hatred in [...] heart ... Kobe just took it and kept going." [...] O'Neal regularly expressed to management that he did not believe the team could win a championship with Bryant. Winter observed that O'Neal influenced the entire team against Bryant. Winter thought that Bryant {{made it a point to}} get the ball to O'Neal that year, but O'Neal did not appreciate what Bryant was doing to help him. During that season's All-Star Game, Bryant did not participate in the Slam Dunk Contest and a matchup against Vince Carter, following Jackson's request to pass on individual accomplishments to keep the focus on the team. During All-Star warm-ups, O'Neal mimicked Bryant's crossover dribble but threw the ball into the stands to accentuate Bryant's turnovers. O'Neal said it was an inside joke between Kobe and him. Jackson and Winter relied on the triangle offense to heal the relationship between O'Neal and Bryant. The coaches believed that the offense was so structured that the relationship between the two players would be smoother on the court. The coaches would also tell the team they did not see the selfishness in Bryant that the players saw. Winter even put together a video for O'Neal to show that Bryant was playing his role correctly.|$|E

6000|$|... "I've {{got this}} much <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Russell took Doring's gold piece, and I {{am not the}} only one that does either. If you think I'm wrong, ask Cal Blinker, the shellman. He heard almost as much as I did." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh; very well; very well.

6000|$|... "Mr. Buck," [...] {{said the}} King, [...] "I beg your pardon, {{for a number}} of {{beautiful}} and sacred thoughts, in which you were generally classified as a fool. But there is another thing to be considered. Suppose you send in your workmen, and Mr. Wayne does a thing regrettable indeed, but of which, I am sorry <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> him quite capable--knocks their teeth out?" ...|$|E

Lady Davenant used {{a good many}} French words, in the old-fashioned manner and with a {{pronunciation}} not perfectly pure: when she did so she reminded Laura Wing of Mrs. Gore's novels. 'But you shall be better protected than even by me. Nous verrons cela. Only you must stop crying--this isn't a crying country.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That may be so," [...] {{answered}} Suzanne, [...] "still I like to draw {{my water}} at the fountain itself. Yet, as he has gone, I beg {{you to listen to}} me, for when you have heard what I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that you will bring him back.

60|$|My next {{example was}} {{recently}} quoted from Shakespeare {{as an example}} of the poet's colour sense. Now, I do not think literature has anything to do with colour, or poets anyway the better of such a sense; and I instantly attacked this passage, since 'purple' was the word that had so pleased the writer of the article, to see if there might not be some literary reason for its use. It will be seen that I succeeded amply; and I am bound <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the passage exceptional in Shakespeare--exceptional, indeed, in literature; but it was not I who chose it.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{you have}} found out, I am a frank old woman and not afraid <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> Now, <b>I</b> {{want to ask you}} a question. If you liked a man who was far from rich, would you marry him?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1985 Time Out interview, Morrissey {{gave his}} {{views about the}} song:'I'm not afraid <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Band Aid was diabolical. Or <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Bob Geldof is a nauseating character. Many people find that very unsettling, but I'll say it as loud as anyone wants me to. In the first {{instance}} the record itself was absolutely tuneless. One can have great concern {{for the people of}} Ethiopia, but it's another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of Great Britain. It was an awful record considering the mass of talent involved. And it wasn't done shyly it was the most self-righteous platform ever in the history of popular music.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I... I... Well, we {{can talk}} about that when we meet. I mean, it's no good trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> over the 'phone, I'm sort of knocked out. I never dreamed... But, <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> what did you mean about Bruce?" ...|$|R
