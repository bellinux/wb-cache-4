25|$|The magical tale of Ambrosius Aurelianus {{and the two}} dragons found beneath Dinas Emrys. This {{origin of}} the later legend of Merlin is clearly a local tale that had {{attracted}} the names of Vortigern and Ambrosius to usurp the roles of earlier characters. Neither of them has any association with that remote part of Wales, but the character Vortigern is best known <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>because</b> of this tale.|$|E
25|$|Galen {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous {{scholars}} and physicians of classical antiquity. Today, the original texts of some of his works, and details of his biography, are lost, and are only known <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>because</b> they were translated into Arabic. Jabir ibn Hayyan frequently cites Galen's books, which were available in early Arabic translations. In 872 AD, Ya'qubi refers to some of Galens works. The titles of the books he mentions differ from those chosen by Hunayn ibn Ishāq for his own translations, thus suggesting earlier translations must have existed. Hunayn frequently mentions in his comments on works which he had translated that he considered earlier translations as insufficient, and had provided completely new translations. Early translations might have been available before the 8th century; most likely they were translated from Syrian or Persian.|$|E
25|$|ClassesT and L {{could be}} more common {{than all the other}} classes {{combined}} if recent research is accurate. Study of the number of proplyds (protoplanetary disks, clumps of gas in nebulae from which stars and planetary systems are formed) indicates that the number of stars in the galaxy should be several orders of magnitude higher than what was previously speculated. It is theorized that these proplyds are in a race with each other. The first one to form will become a protostar, which are very violent objects and will disrupt other proplyds in the vicinity, stripping them of their gas. The victim proplyds will then probably go on to become main-sequence stars or brown dwarfs of the L and T classes, which are quite invisible <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> <b>Because</b> brown dwarfs can live so long, these smaller bodies accumulate over time.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{they have}} written exhaustively on this topic, {{and their work}} did not reach us. There are many sciences. There have been {{numerous}} sages among the nations of mankind. The knowledge that has not come down to us {{is larger than the}} knowledge that has. Where are the sciences of the Persians that ‘Umar ordered to be wiped out {{at the time of the}} conquest? Where are the sciences of the Chaladaeans, the Syrians and the Babylonians, and the scholarly products and results that were theirs? Where are the sciences of the Copts, their predecessors? The sciences of only one nation, the Greeks, have come down <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>because</b> they were translated through Al-Ma'mun's efforts. He was successful in this direction because he had many translators at his disposal and spent much money in this connection.|$|E
500|$|When the British cabinet {{discussed}} {{the concept of}} the League during the First World War, Maurice Hankey, the Cabinet Secretary, circulated a memorandum on the subject. He started by saying, [...] "Generally it appears to me that any such scheme is dangerous <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> <b>because</b> it will create a sense of security which is wholly fictitious". He attacked the British pre-war faith in the sanctity of treaties as delusional and concluded by claiming: ...|$|E

It seems the Jets always lose <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>because</b> of penalties. But I like them and don't want any feud in case we visit New York December 29 [...] ". The Jets left their white road uniforms in Oakland to be laundered and sent to them in San Diego, where they were to play their next game. The uniforms were not seen again once the team removed them in the Oakland locker room, and Jets management hastily ordered the green home uniforms, as well as the white uniforms the team had worn in the preseason, to be shipped from New York.|$|E
