[...] "The success of Inchon {{was so great}} and the {{subsequent}} prestige of General MacArthur was so overpowering," [...] Collins later recalled, [...] "that the Chiefs hesitated thereafter to question later plans and decisions of the general, which should have been challenged." [...] In response to a rumor that the Eighth Army planned to halt at the 38th parallel and await United Nations authorization to cross, Marshall {{sent a message to}} MacArthur informing him that: [...] "We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of 38th parallel.
