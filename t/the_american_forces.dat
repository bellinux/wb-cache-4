5|$|In June 1942 Mutsu, {{commanded}} by Rear Admiral Gunji Kogure, {{was assigned to}} the Main Body of the 1st Fleet during the Battle of Midway, together with Yamato, Nagato, Hosho, the light cruiser Sendai, nine destroyers and four auxiliary ships. Following the loss of all four carriers on 4 June, Yamamoto attempted to lure <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> west to within range of the Japanese air groups at Wake Island, and into a night engagement with his surface forces, but <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> withdrew and Mutsu saw no action. After rendezvousing with the remnants of the striking force on 6 June, about half of the survivors from the sunken aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet were transferred to Mutsu. She arrived at Hashirajima on 14 June.|$|E
5|$|On May 26, 1828, Congress {{authorized}} {{a payment}} of $3,998.81 to Hazen's heirs in {{compensation for the}} half-pay lost {{to him when he}} joined <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nagumo quickly {{reversed}} {{his order}} to re-arm the bombers with general purpose bombs {{and demanded that}} the scout plane ascertain the composition of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force.</b> Another 20–40 minutes elapsed before Tones scout finally radioed {{the presence of a}} single carrier in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force.</b> This was one of the carriers from Task Force 16. The other carrier was not sighted.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Americans,</b> though hard pressed, {{managed to}} avoid being mangled or {{destroyed}} and fought a delaying battle while most of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force</b> escaped <b>the</b> trap.|$|R
50|$|The Tank Corps of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Expeditionary <b>Forces</b> was <b>the</b> {{mechanized}} {{unit that}} engaged in tank warfare for <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Expeditionary <b>Force</b> (AEF) on the Western Front during World War I.|$|R
5|$|Reacting {{quickly to}} the situation, the Japanese hurriedly {{evacuated}} Kokumbona and ordered the 2nd Division to retire westward immediately. The Americans captured Kokumbona on 23 January. Although some Japanese units were trapped between <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> and destroyed, most of the 2nd Division's survivors escaped.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>Forces</b> Network (AFN) {{provided}} {{coverage of}} the Super Bowl for U.S. forces stationed overseas and to all U.S. Navy ships at sea.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the last}} battle of the war fought on Quebec soil. Following the defeat, the {{remainder}} of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces,</b> {{under the command of}} John Sullivan, retreated, first to Fort Saint-Jean, and then to Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E
50|$|The battle {{lasted only}} ninety minutes. The British were outnumbered {{more than two}} to one, yet {{defeated}} <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force.</b> In doing so, however, they lost {{over a quarter of}} their men.|$|R
50|$|The County had an {{important}} role during the War of 1812. Fort Norfolk was built in Charlotteville (near Vittoria and Normandale) in 1813 with accommodation for 300 troops. The Battle of Nanticoke, against American troops, was {{an important}} event in 1813. In August 1812, Major General Isaac Brock gathered a force of about regulars and militia at Port Dover. Using boats on the lake, they reached Amherstburg (also in Upper Canada) and then attacked and captured <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Hull's Army at Detroit. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>forces</b> later burned Port Dover. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>forces</b> also burnt Port Dover, Port Ryerse and the Walsingham settlement in 1814.|$|R
50|$|Armstrong {{approved}} of Foote's action and reinforced the shore {{party with a}} detachment from San Jacinto. A few days later, after receiving assurances from Chinese officials, the Commodore decided to withdraw <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the First Battle of Frenchtown on January 18, 1813, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> under Lt. Colonel William Lewis were {{successful}} in forcing the retreat of the small British force stationed there. The British commander of the Fort Malden garrison in Amherstburg, Colonel Henry Procter, made plans to take back Frenchtown and he ordered troops to the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{the battle}} and the {{following}} siege, French-speaking Canadians were active {{on both sides of}} the conflict. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> received supplies and logistical support from local residents, and the city's defenders included locally raised militia. When the Americans retreated, they were accompanied by a number of their supporters; those who remained behind were subjected to a variety of punishments after the British re-established control over the province.|$|E
5|$|The Germans finally flanked <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> at dusk, {{capturing}} them. Only one American, {{a forward}} artillery observer, was killed, while 14 were wounded: German casualties totaled 92. The Germans paused, believing the woods {{were filled with}} more Americans and tanks. Only when SS-Standartenführer Joachim Peiper and his Panzer tanks arrived at midnight, twelve hours behind schedule, did the Germans learn the nearby woods were empty.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>force</b> {{surrendered}} {{in a field}} {{just south}} of the Thorold Tunnel, east of the present day Welland Canal. The prisoners were escorted first to DeCou's, then to the British base at Ball's Falls.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Pulang Lupa was an {{engagement}} fought on September 13, 1900, during the Philippine-American War, between {{the forces of}} Colonel Maximo Abad and Devereux Shields, in which Abad's men defeated <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> goal of <b>American</b> armed <b>forces</b> was to {{reinforce}} {{the remnants of the}} South Korean Army (ROK) in fighting back the North Korean invasion (but only in the southeastern part of South Korea, around the major seaport of Pusan) to prevent the complete collapse of the South Korean Army and of the South Korean Government. However, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> armed <b>forces</b> in <b>the</b> Orient had been decreasing steadily since the end of World War II, by mid-1950, there were no American troops in South Korea, and <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force</b> in Japan had dwindled drastically.|$|R
5|$|The Spanish Crown {{sent the}} 1st, 2nd and 3rd Puerto Rican Provisional Battalions to defend Cuba against the American invaders. The 1st Puerto Rican Provisional Battalion, {{composed}} of the Talavera Cavalry and Krupp artillery, was sent to Santiago de Cuba where they battled <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> in the Battle of San Juan Hill. After the battle, the Puerto Rican Battalion suffered a total of 70% casualties which included their dead, wounded, MIA's and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} {{a turning point in the}} war for North Korean forces, which had seen {{previous}} victories owing to superior numbers and equipment. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> now had a numerical superiority and more equipment, including tanks and weapons capable of defeating the powerful North Korean T-34 tanks.|$|E
5|$|After chasing {{away the}} Japanese forces at Koli Point, the U.S. renewed the western {{offensive}} towards Kokumbona on 10 November with three battalions under the overall command of U.S. Marine Colonel John Arthur. In the meantime, fresh Japanese {{troops from the}} 228th Infantry Regiment of the 38th Infantry Division landed by Tokyo Express over several nights beginning on 5 November and effectively resisted the American attack. After making small advances, at 13:45 on 11 November Vandegrift suddenly ordered all <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> {{to return to the}} east bank of the Matanikau.|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese counterattacked <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force,</b> and {{severely}} damaged {{the aircraft carrier}} [...] on 19 March. While the task group subsequently retired toward a fueling rendezvous, moving slowly to protect the damaged ships, Japanese aircraft continued the harassment.|$|R
5000|$|The battle, which <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force</b> won while killing Brulé {{women and}} {{children}} as well as warriors, was a punitive expedition for the [...] "Grattan Massacre" [...] in August 1854 and for raids by Lakota in its wake.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the battle, Wadsworth {{was taken}} {{prisoner}} when <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force,</b> cut off on the Canadian side of the Niagara River, surrendered to avoid a massacre by Indians under John Brant attached to the British force.|$|R
5|$|After the Americans {{attacked}} the Philippines, Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands beginning on 10 October, the Japanese implemented their {{plan for the}} defense of these areas that required the transfer of most of Air Group 652 to Formosa and Luzon to attack <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces,</b> with only a few aircraft retained for carrier operations. Most of these aircraft were lost for little gain as the Americans suppressed Japanese defenses in the Philippines, preparatory to the actual invasion.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> were able to gather information {{about what was happening}} in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensity}} of the situation, Texas put to sea on 13 May and headed directly to operational duty without benefit of the usual shakedown cruise and post-shakedown repair period. After a five-day stop at Hampton Roads from 14–19 May, she joined Rear Admiral Fletcher's force off Veracruz on 26 May. She remained in Mexican waters for just over two months, supporting <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> ashore. On 8 August, she left Veracruz and set a course for Nipe Bay, Cuba, and from there steamed to New York, where she entered the Navy Yard on 21 August.|$|E
5000|$|... 0730: Lead ships Coghlan and Richmond made {{radar contact}} with the two {{trailing}} Japanese transports and a destroyer on course 080° at 13 kn. A navigating officer {{on one of the}} transports visually observed <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force</b> minutes later.|$|R
50|$|The 27th Infantry Regiment was {{established}} by act of Congress on 2 February 1901 and saw its first combat action while serving as part of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force</b> sent to quell the Philippine Insurrection {{on the island of}} Mindanao.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{since it}} had been discovered, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force</b> retired from <b>the</b> area. Aylwin soon left TF 11 to escort the fleet oiler [...] to Pago Pago, Samoa, {{and then back to}} Pearl Harbor, {{reaching}} port on 8 March.|$|R
5|$|Early on May 6, three Royal Navy ships sailed into Quebec Harbour. Troops {{on these}} ships were {{immediately}} sent {{into the city}} and, not long after, General Guy Carleton formed them up and marched {{them out to the}} American siege camp. General John Thomas, then in command of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces,</b> had already been making arrangements to retreat, but the British arrival threw his troops into a panic. He led a disorganized retreat that eventually reached Sorel on about May 18.|$|E
5|$|In July 1972, {{it became}} the basis for the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Center, Vietnam Field Office. It served in the region for several years and earning ten {{campaign}} streamers before being deactivated during <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> pullout from the region. The brigade was reactivated in Korea in the 1980s to provide command and control for all U.S. Pacific military police forces, and has since been moved to Hawaii, where much of U.S. Army Pacific is located.|$|E
5|$|In late December 1776, Morris {{completed}} {{his commitment to}} the Connecticut militia and immediately accepted a commission in the Continental Army as a first lieutenant. After serving as a recruiting officer in Litchfield, Morris joined General George Washington and the army at Peekskill. On October 3, 1776, General Washington commanded this army in the Battle of Germantown. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> were ultimately unsuccessful in this battle and Morris was taken as a prisoner of war on October 4, 1776.|$|E
60|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> advanced, <b>the</b> {{artillery}} on {{both sides}} opened fire. The leading columns of the colonists soon snowed signs of disorder. The Seventeenth Regiment fixed bayonets and with great gallantry charged the enemy in front of them, driving them back with considerable slaughter; and so far did they advance that they were separated from the other battalions, and cutting their way through <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force</b> <b>the</b> regiment pursued its march to Maidenhead. The Fortieth and Fifty-fifth fought stoutly, but were unable {{to make their way}} through <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force,</b> and fell back to Brunswick, while <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> occupied Princeton. At daybreak Lord Cornwallis discovered the retreat of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> army, and being apprehensive for the safety of Brunswick, where great stores of the army were accumulated, marched with all haste toward that town.|$|R
50|$|In Kamiakan's camp, {{plans for}} a night raid against <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>force</b> were drawn up but abandoned. Instead, early the next day, the Yakama {{continued}} their defensive retreat, tiring <b>American</b> <b>forces</b> who eventually broke off the engagement. In {{the last day of}} fighting the Yakama suffered their only fatality, a warrior killed by U.S. Army Indian Scout Cutmouth John.|$|R
