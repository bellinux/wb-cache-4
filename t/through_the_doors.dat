5|$|Southern's {{emergency}} call {{is transferred from}} his superior, Sir William Frazer, to International Rescue. Landing outside the Plutonium Store in Thunderbirds 1 and 2, Scott and Virgil use the Laser Cutter Vehicle to burn <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> Inside the vault, Virgil releases Southern from the robot. As the time nears 30 minutes past noon, Scott, in possession of the three bracelets, takes off in Thunderbird 1; he jettisons them over the sea, where they explode harmlessly. On Jeff's orders, Lady Penelope and Parker intercept the Erdman Gang at their rendezvous and use FAB 1's cannon to shoot down the leader, Dempsey and Kenyon before they can escape in a helijet. Southern recovers from his ordeal at the Creighton-Ward Mansion.|$|E
5|$|Verger bribes Justice Department {{official}} Paul Krendler {{to accuse}} Starling of withholding {{a note from}} Lecter, leading to her suspension. Lecter lures Starling to Union Station. Verger's men, having trailed Starling, capture and bring Lecter to Verger. Verger intends to feed Lecter alive to a herd of wild boars bred specifically for this purpose. After her superiors refuse to act, Starling infiltrates Verger's estate. After neutralizing the two guards and freeing Lecter, she is shot by a third guard who was in hiding. Lecter picks up an unconscious Starling just before the boars break <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> Verger orders his physician Cordell Doemling to shoot Lecter, but, with Lecter's suggestion, Cordell shoves his hated boss into the pen. Lecter carries Starling and watches the boars eat Verger alive.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E

25|$|The van Eycks' Ghent Altarpiece, then as {{now famous}} as a supreme example of Early Netherlandish {{painting}} and already a major tourist attraction, just restored in 1550, was saved by dismantling it and hiding it in the cathedral tower. A first attack on August 19 was deterred by {{a small number of}} guards.

25|$|The rest of {{the crew}} make a last stand against the Reavers to buy Mal time to {{broadcast}} the recording. Through a message recorded by Mr. Universe into his sex robot before his death, Mal learns of a backup transmitter. Sustaining heavy injuries, the crew retreats behind a set of blast doors that fail to properly close. A Reaver shoots through the opening and severely wounds Simon, prompting River to dive <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and close them as the Reavers drag her away. At the backup transmitter, Mal incapacitates the Operative and forces him to watch the broadcast recording. Mal returns to the crew, and the blast doors open to reveal that River has killed all the Reavers. Alliance troops arrive, but the Operative orders them to stand down.|$|E

25|$|Denmark {{also began}} {{a number of}} reforms aimed at urbanizing the Greenlanders, principally to replace their {{dependence}} on (then) dwindling seal populations and provide workers for the (then) swelling cod fisheries, but also to provide improved social services such as health care, education, and transportation. These well-meaning reforms {{have led to a}} number of problems, particularly modern unemployment and the infamous Blok P housing project. The attempt to introduce European-style urban housing suffered from such inattention to local detail that Inuit could not fit <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> in their winter clothing and fire escapes were constantly blocked by fishing gear too bulky to fit into the cramped apartments. Television broadcasts began in 1982. The collapse of the cod fisheries and mines in the late 1980s and early 1990s greatly damaged the economy, which now principally depends on Danish aid and cold-water shrimp exports. Large sectors of the economy remain controlled by state-owned corporations, with Air Greenland and the Arctic Umiaq ferry heavily subsidized to provide access to remote settlements. The major airport remains the former US air base at Kangerlussuaq well north of Nuuk, with the capital unable to accept international flights on its own, owing to concerns about expense and noise pollution.|$|E
25|$|In a {{separate}} case {{investigated by the}} after the war, the KBZPNP commission requested the prosecution of the commanders of the 10th and 17th Divisions, which {{took part in a}} mass murder of several dozen Poles in the village of Włyń near Łódź. All cases of the murder of Polish civilians in that village were turned down by the German prosecutors' office on 22 April 1974. The German authorities argued, that it is not impossible that all the civilians trying to escape from the German forces were in fact partisans. This was the reasoning in the case of certain Ochecki who was shot to death while trying to rescue his cattle from a barn set in flames by the German soldiers. The German authorities argued that it was fair to assume {{that he was trying to}} escape from the German soldiers. The same reasoning was given in the case of a mentally sick person shot the same day. In the case of Wawrzyn Piecyk, who was killed while being wounded and unconscious, it was argued that he might have been pretending to be unconscious in order to escape from the German soldiers, while the case of Józef Jawor, a man who did not stop when requested to and instead hid in his house, where he was shot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> was explained as a killing done during a fight. The case of Maria Konieczna, a deaf woman who was shot after not responding to a German soldier, was considered a common crime, while the killing of Józef Gałka was explained as legitimate, since a picture of his brother in Polish military uniform found in Gałka's wallet was a proof that he might have been a partisan himself. In the same decision, the German authorities declared that the patients of the mental institution in the town of Warta, killed by the soldiers of the 17th Division in the hospital and dressed in hospital pyjamas, were victims of a common crime rather than a war crime or a murder.|$|E

Aside from this episode, press reports concerning the Concert for Bangladesh shows were overwhelmingly positive.|$|E

[...] While there, Kinsler had a [...]335 batting average, [...]416 on-base percentage, and [...]536 slugging percentage, with 16 steals in 17 attempts.

It measured twelve inches and was fabricated {{in less than a}} week. The shot of the Enterprise leaving Spacedock was difficult to produce because the interior dock miniature had disappeared. Stock footage from The Voyage Home was used for one shot to compensate. Since the only other shot needed was the Enterprises point of view leaving Spacedock <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> it was the only section recreated for the film.|$|E
500|$|There {{were reports}} of rioting in Buffalo, New York, and certain other cities, {{but the first}} drawing of draft numbers—on July 11, 1863—occurred peaceably in Manhattan. The second drawing was held on Monday, July 13, 1863, ten days after the Union victory at Gettysburg. At 10 a.m., a furious crowd of around 500, led by the {{volunteer}} firemen of Engine Company 33 (known as the [...] "Black Joke"), attacked the assistant Ninth District provost marshal's office, at Third Avenue and 47th Street, where the draft was taking place. The crowd threw large paving stones through windows, burst <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> and set the building ablaze. When the fire department responded, rioters broke up their vehicles. Others killed horses that were pulling streetcars and smashed the cars. To prevent {{other parts of the}} city being notified of the riot, they cut telegraph lines.|$|E

Prohibited by law from purchasing marijuana outside the premises, Randy and the other self-irradiated men begin protesting for larger marijuana dispensary doors. As politicians discuss the issue, the marijuana dispensary owner suggests that marijuana simply be legalized, arguing that people are abusing the medicinal system anyway. A local doctor then opines that the ban on KFC had led to the rise in testicular cancer because the chicken was somehow preventing it. Colorado bans marijuana once again. KFC reopens locations in the state, which are now re-branded as [...] "Medicinal Fried Chicken."

500|$|Judge Snyder {{is about}} to convict Bart when Principal Skinner bursts <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> disheveled and unshaven, and {{explains}} that neither Bart nor the mobsters assaulted him. Rather, when Fat Tony and his henchmen had come to his office meekly, Principal Skinner had yelled at them to not interfere with student discipline, and they left sheepishly. After Principal Skinner returned to his house, he became trapped beneath tons of old newspapers in his garage, and was stuck there for over a week, until {{he was able to}} escape. Bart is cleared of all charges, despite the counsel for the prosecution unsuccessfully trying to convince the Judge to strike Principal Skinner's speech from the record. Fat Tony tells Bart {{that he did not want}} to get him into any trouble on his behalf, but Bart decides to resign after learning that [...] "crime doesn't pay".|$|E
500|$|Collins was short, no {{more than}} [...] and slight. As a batsman, {{he was not an}} extravagant strokeplayer, preferring to avoid risk and leave balls on a good length where possible. He batted with very little backlift and at first {{inspection}} could seem strokeless, scoring only from pushes and prods, nudges and dabs. His patience was renowned with the contemporary cricket writer Ray Robinson remarking [...] " [...] had an implacable trench warfare style that in difficult times earned admiration from his own side, put bowlers on the road to exasperation and sent onlookers <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of bars." [...] His one bold shot was an over-the-shoulder hook shot, finishing standing on his right foot, his left foot six inches in the air. Deficient in driving power, bowlers learnt to lessen his scoring power by pitching the ball well up. He often batted without the protection of gloves, especially on easy pitches.|$|E
