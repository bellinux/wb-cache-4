5|$|In 1981, {{the site}} was {{proposed}} for commercial development, provoking an energetic campaign by the Chiswick Wildlife Group, formed in March 1982, which became the local branch of the London Wildlife Trust. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> site {{was one of the}} first to be highlighted by the London Wildlife Trust on its formation in October 1981. The campaign led to a Public Inquiry in July 1983, which determined that the site should be devoted to nature conservation. This was the first time anywhere in the United Kingdom that a Public Inquiry had ruled in favour of nature in a city, and the Gunnersbury Triangle example became a test case.|$|E

5|$|In October 1966, strike force F-105 Thunderchiefs were {{equipped}} with QRC-160 radar jamming pods whose effectiveness virtually ended their losses to surface-to-air missiles.

To protect the F-4s, rules of engagement that allowed the MiGCAP to escort the strike force {{in and out of}} the target area were revised in December to restrict MiGCAP penetration to the edge of SAM coverage. MiG interceptions increased as a result, primarily by MiG-21s using high-speed hit-and-run tactics against bomb-laden F-105 formations, and although only two bombers had been lost, <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> force was perceived as serious.|$|E

40|$|In {{the article}} the author {{examines}} the theoretical foundations of {{evaluation of the}} effectiveness of the state mechanism of response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military security. Also the author defines the area of the methodological problems of the construction of scorecard of such evaluation. Comparative analysis of <b>the</b> approaches <b>to</b> evaluation of <b>the</b> effectiveness of the state mechanism of response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military security, namely economic, social, legal, socially oriented, expert, pragmatic, allowed defining the last one as the most promising. Pragmatic approach is not confined only <b>to</b> distinction of <b>the</b> resulting and economical effectiveness, but also allows defining purposeful effectiveness of the public policy {{from the point of view}} of correspondence of its aims <b>to</b> <b>the</b> normative ideals and value standards, which are accepted by the certain society on the certain stage of its development. <b>The</b> author suggests <b>to</b> distinguish between general and current effectiveness of the functioning of the state mechanism of response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military security. General effectiveness is a level of national interests protection in the military sphere. Current effectiveness is determined by the work efficiency of public authorities and bodies of state military administration, which consists in the development, adoption and organization of implementation of administrative decisions concerning state response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military security. The proposed method for estimating the complex effectiveness provides a more precise tool for evaluation of the public authorities performance in the field of response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military security, which greatly increases the practical significance of the results of this assessment...|$|R
5|$|In the {{two centuries}} since the hurricane, the oceans rose about , the {{wetlands}} around New Orleans have diminished, and the elevation has dropped due to subsidence.

The 1812 hurricane was not a worst-case scenario for New Orleans, as a stronger and larger hurricane would have caused more damage.

5|$|After O'Grady {{was shot}} down, {{tensions}} increased greatly between NATO and the Bosnian Serbs. A number of US commanders called for immediate retaliatory air strikes; however, the Serbs still held {{the majority of}} the hostages seized after the bombing of Pale. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hostages prevented NATO from acting more forcefully, and the Serbs released 121 hostages immediately after the incident in an effort to cool tensions. Nonetheless, the situation remained explosive for the next six days until O'Grady was rescued on 8 June by the 3rd Battalion 8th Marines 2nd Marine Division, ending the calls for immediate offensive action. Shortly thereafter, the Serbs released the remaining hostages. As a result of the incident, NATO ordered that all further sorties be accompanied by aircraft designed for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD).|$|E
5|$|Following Thermopylae, the Persian army {{proceeded}} to sack and burn Plataea and Thespiae, the Boeotian cities {{that had not}} submitted, before it marched on the now evacuated city of Athens. Meanwhile, the Greeks (for the most part Peloponnesians) preparing to defend the Isthmus of Corinth, demolished the single road that led through it and built a wall across it. As at Thermopylae, making this an effective strategy required the Greek navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring {{the passage of the}} Persian navy across the Saronic Gulf, so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese. However, instead of a mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Greeks to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet. Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis, the Greek fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet in the Battle of Salamis, which essentially ended <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Peloponnese.|$|E

5|$|The Athenians and Eretrians sent a {{task force}} of 25 triremes to Asia Minor. Whilst there, the Greek army {{surprised}} and outmaneuvered Artaphernes, marching to Sardis and there burning the lower city. However, this was {{as much as the}} Greeks achieved, and they were then pursued back to the coast by Persian horsemen, losing many men in the process. Despite the fact their actions were ultimately fruitless, the Eretrians and in particular the Athenians had earned Darius's lasting enmity, and he vowed to punish both cities. The Persian naval victory at the Battle of Lade (494 BC) all but ended the Ionian Revolt, and by 493 BC, the last hold-outs were vanquished by the Persian fleet. The revolt was used as an opportunity by Darius to extend the empire's border to the islands of the East Aegean and the Propontis, which had not been part of the Persian dominions before. The completion of the pacification of Ionia allowed the Persians to begin planning their next moves; to extinguish <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> empire from Greece, and to punish Athens and Eretria.|$|E
5|$|When World War I {{began in}} August 1914, she was {{commanded}} by Captain Kanji Katō.

She was ordered to guard the convoy, over Katō's protests, when {{the presence of the}} Emden was discovered in the Cocos Islands on 9 November. The Australian light cruiser HMAS Sydney was detached from the convoy to sink the Emden instead. With the ending of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> convoy, Ibuki was transferred to the Second South Seas Squadron at Truk in the Caroline Islands.

5|$|In September 1854, the Anglo-French {{army that}} had been at Varna was ferried across the Black Sea and landed on the Crimean Peninsula. They then fought {{their way to the}} main Russian naval base on the peninsula, the city of Sevastopol, which they placed under siege. The Russian {{garrison}} eventually withdrew from the city in early September 1855, freeing the French and British fleets for other tasks. A discussion ensued over what target should be attacked next; the French and British high commands considered driving from the Crimea to Kherson and launching major campaigns in Bessarabia or the Caucasus. Instead, at the urging of French commanders, they settled on a smaller-scale operation to seize the Russian fort at Kinburn, which protected the mouth of the Dneiper. The British argued that to seize Kinburn without advancing to Nikolaev would only serve to warn the Russians of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> port. Fox Maule-Ramsay, then the British Secretary of State for War, suggested that without a plan to exploit the capture of the fortress, the only purpose of the operation would be to give the fleets something to do.|$|E
