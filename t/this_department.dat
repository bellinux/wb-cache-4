5|$|The {{indigenous}} population was originally animist, {{but while the}} fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane.

5|$|Paris's {{manufacturing}} {{is mostly}} focused in its suburbs, {{and the city}} itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers, {{most of which are}} in the textile, clothing, leather goods, and shoe trades.

Most of this is due to companies relocating outside the Paris region. The Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000. Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroen plants (<b>this</b> <b>department</b> alone employs 33,000), but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroen assembly plant.|$|E
