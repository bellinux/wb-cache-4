40|$|Accelerator Driven systems (ADS) {{have been}} {{proposed}} as safe and reliable nuclear systems for energy production and, especially, for the <b>transmutation</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste,</b> thus contributing to a safer and non-proliferating use of nuclear energy for peaceful uses. The ADS can operate at a higher safety level, since, being driven by an external source, is always characterized by a sub-criticality condition and can thus be shut down by simply switching off the source. To ensure that the system always remain at a sub-critical level, an on-line reactivity monitoring is needed during both normal operation and transient conditions. Research programs such as MUSE, FREYA and GUINEVERE {{were involved in the}} development of reactivity measurement methods for ADS. At Politecnico di Torino a method that is suitable for both on-line and off-line reactivity monitoring has been developed and tested. The method has been given the name MAρTA (Monitoring Algorithm for Reactivity Transient Analysis). The method is based on an inverse point kinetic approach which reconstructs the reactivity from the system neutron flux or power measurement obtained instantaneously by a localized neutron detector. The adoption of point kinetics for the reactivity reconstruction is due to the simplicity of the mathematical formulation of the inverse approach. However, the accuracy of the reactivity prediction by point kinetics can deteriorate owing to spatial and spectral effects. Furthermore the kinetic parameters are needed through evaluations or independent measurements. The research activity during the Ph. D. program has been devoted to assess the MAρTA method for reactivity predictions using computationally simulated experiments, evaluated by means of time-dependent diffusion calculations. A technique to improve the prediction when strong spatial and spectral effects are present is proposed and tested. A method for the measurement of the ratio between the effective fraction of delayed neutrons and the effective mean prompt generation time through oscillated experiments has also been proposed and tested. The method has also been applied to real experimental cases available from the Kyoto University Critical Assembly (KUCA).

40|$|Since its discovery, the {{phenomenon}} of nuclear fission {{is the object of}} extensive theoretical and experimental studies. However, we are still far from a complete understanding of the fission process. Nuclear theory can satisfactorily explain the process of neutron-induced fission at thermal neutron energies, but it meets problems at high neutron energies. However, new applications are nowadays developed involving neutron-induced fission in this energy domain. An example of such an application is accelerator-driven systems (ADS) which are dedicated to <b>transmutation</b> <b>of</b> highly <b>radioactive</b> nuclear <b>waste.</b> Conceptual studies of ADS require new nuclear data on neutron-induced reactions within a wide incident energy range. Along with structural, spallation target and other materials, data on neutron-induced fission are especially required for two nuclides, 232 Th and 238 U. At present, however, there are no published neutron-induced fission yield data for either 232 Th or 238 U at energies above 20 MeV. In this thesis, I present measurements of fission fragment mass yields at neutron energies from 10 to 60 MeV for 232 Th and 238 U. The experiment was done at the Louvain-la-Neuve quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam facility. A multi-section Frisch-gridded ionization chamber was used as the fission fragment detector. The fission fragment mass yields were measured at peak neutron energies of 33, 45, and 60 MeV. In addition, data for the neutron-energy intervals 9 - 11, 16 - 18, and 24 - 26 MeV were also extracted from the low-energy tail. The measurement results show that the symmetric fission component increases with incident neutron energy for both uranium and thorium, but it is more enhanced for thorium. The uranium results were compared to the only existing set of experimental data for neutron energies above 20 MeV. Reasonable agreement was found. However, our data show a lower symmetric fission component. For thorium, the present data are the first above 20 MeV. Model calculations with the TALYS code have also been done. This code is based on the multi-modal random neck-rupture model extended for higher excitation energies.

It {{could also be used}} to dispose of surplus weapons grade plutonium or as an actinide burner for <b>transmutation</b> <b>of</b> high level <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste.</b> AFR- 300 uses metallic fuel and sodium coolant. The design of AFR- 300 takes account of the successful design and operation of EBR-II, but the AFR- 300 design includes a number of advances such as an advanced fuel cycle, inspectability and improved economics. One significant difference between AFR- 300 and EBR-II is that AFR- 300 is considerably larger. Another significant difference is that AFR- 300 has no auxiliary EM pump in the primary loop to guarantee positive core flow when the main primary pumps are shut down. Thus, one question that has come up in connection with the AFR- 300 design is whether natural circulation flow is sufficient to prevent damage to the core if the primary pumps fail. Insufficient natural circulation flow through the core could result in high cladding temperatures and cladding failure due to eutectic penetration of the cladding by the metal fuel. The rate of eutectic penetration of the cladding is strongly temperature dependent, so cladding failure depends on how hot the cladding gets and how long it is at elevated temperatures. To investigate the adequacy of natural circulation flow, a number of pump failure transients and a number of design options have been analyzed with the SASSYS- 1 systems analysis code. This code has been validated for natural circulation behavior by analysis of Shutdown Heat Removal Tests performed in EBR-II. The AFR- 300 design includes flywheels on the primary pumps to extend the pump coastdown times, {{and the size of the}} flywheels can be picked to give optimum coastdown times. One series of transients that has been run consists of protected loss-of-flow transients with various values for the combined moment of inertia of the pump, the motor and the flywheel giving coastdown times from 70 seconds to 586 seconds. In this transient series both the main pump motors and the pony motors lose power. Another series of loss-of-flow cases involved staggered failures of the pony motors. The main pump motors fail, the reactor scrams, and the pumps coast down to pony motor speed. Then at various times the pony motors are assumed to fail. If the pony motors fail at the wrong time, then the resulting transient can be more severe than if the pony motors failed at the same time as the main motors. A third series of cases involved a reactor scram followed by failure of both the main pump motors and the pony motors at various times. For all of these cases, satisfactory natural circulation behavior can be obtained if the right design options are used...|$|R

40|$|The {{once through}} nuclear fuel cycle {{adopted by the}} {{majority}} of countries with operating commercial power reactors imposes a number <b>of</b> concerns. The <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> created in the once through nuclear fuel cycle has to be isolated from the environment for thousands of years. In addition, plutonium and other actinides, after the decay of fission products, could become targets for weapon proliferators. Furthermore, {{only a small fraction of}} the energy potential in the fuel is being used. All these concerns can be addressed if a closed fuel cycle strategy is considered offering the possibility for partitioning and <b>transmutation</b> <b>of</b> long lived <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste,</b> enhanced proliferation resistance, and improved utilization of natural resources. It is generally believed that dedicated advanced reactor systems have to be designed in order to perform the task <b>of</b> nuclear waste <b>transmutation</b> effectively. The development and deployment of such innovative systems is technically and economically challenging. In this thesis, a possibility of constraining the generation <b>of</b> long lived <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> through multi-recycling <b>of</b> Trans-uranic actinides (TRU) in existing Light Water Reactors (LWR has been studied. Thorium based and fertile free fuels (FFF) were analyzed as the most attractive candidates for TRU burning in LWRs. Although both fuel types can destroy TRU at comparable rates (about 1150 kg/GWe-Year in FFF and up to 900 kg/GWe-Year in Th) and achieve comparable fractional TRU burnup (close to 50 a/o), the Th fuel requires significantly higher neutron moderation than practically feasible in a typical LWR lattice to achieve such performance. (cont.) On the other hand, the FFF exhibits nearly optimal TRU destruction performance in a typical LWR fuel lattice geometry. Increased TRU presence in LWR core leads to neutron spectrum hardening, which results in reduced control materials reactivity worth. The magnitude of this reduction is directly related to the amount of TRU in the core. A potential for positive void reactivity feedback limits the maximum TRU loading. Th and conventional mixed oxide (MOX) fuels require higher than FFF TRU loading to sustain a standard 18 fuel cycle length due to neutron captures in Th 232 and U 238 respectively. Therefore, TRU containing Th and U cores have lower control materials worth and greater potential for a positive void coefficient than FFF core. However, the significantly reduced fuel Doppler coefficient of the fully FFF loaded core and the lower delayed neutron fraction lead to questions about the FFF performance in reactivity initiated accidents. The Combined Non-Fertile and UO 2 (CONFU) assembly concept is proposed for multi- recycling of TRU in existing PWRs. The assembly assumes a heterogeneous structure where about 20 % of the UO 2 fuel pins on the assembly periphery are replaced with FFF pins hosting TRU generated in the previous cycle. The possibility of achieving zero TRU net is demonstrated. The concept takes advantage of superior TRU destruction performance in FFF allowing minimization of TRU inventory. At the same time, the core physics is still dominated by UO 2 fuel allowing maintenance of core safety and control characteristics comparable to all-UO 2. by Evgeni Shwageraus. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Ion beams are very efficient tools for the simulation of the radiations produced in nuclear reactors or in storage form. In this article, we summarize the work made by combining advanced techniques (RBS/C, XRD, TEM, AFM) to study the structural modifications produced in ion-irradiated cubic zirconia single crystals. Ions with energies in the MeV–GeV range allow exploring the nuclear collision and electronic excitation regimes. At low energy, where ballistic effects dominate, the damage exhibits a peak around the ion projected range; it accumulates with a double-step process by the formation of a dislocation network. At high energy, where electronic excitations are favored, the damage profiles are rather flat up to several micrometers; the damage accumulation is monotonous (one step) and occurs through the creation and overlap of ion tracks. These results may be generalized to many nuclear ceramics...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale <b>transmutation</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste,</b> {{that might}} be in plenty {{produced}} in consequence of industrial reprocessing the irradiated nuclear fuel, would be based, most probably, on applying of intense neutron fluxes (both thermalized and fast) provided by fission reactors and accelerator-driven target-blankets, A lack of the reliable experimental data concerning some bothering nuclides makes difficult to ground practic~ expediency of the very transmutation approach. So, up to recently consistent appraisals not always could be done even for rather elaborated systems with neutrons of thermal spectrum (say, transmuting rate of 137 Cb/gOSr through capture of thermal neutron). Similarly, {{in the case of}} minor actinides (with relatively high fission thresholds) a scarcit y of the relevant database enables to estimate, for instance, a burning down of these nuclides in complicated hard neutron spectra (including neutron fields around spallation target driven by NGeV proton/deuteron beams of NMW power), in essential, only on the basis of general considerations. In order to narrow a gap between the experimental data spreading under an ideology of accelerator based large-scale neutron production (say) for purposes of nuclear fue...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{in nuclear}} energy and <b>transmutation</b> <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> require neutron data for {{conceptual}} and performance studies, {{to determine the}} viability of advanced ideas such as an Accelerator Driven System and to fix the safety margins of any new concepts. IRMM's neutron data-measurement program addresses data needs associated with Accelerator Driven Systems, management of radioactive waste, the thorium fuel cycle, safety issues of conventional reactors. Ongoing and recently completed activities include capture and total cross-section measurements for 127, 129 I, 206 Pb, and 232 Th; precision total cross-section measurements for 240, 242 Pu; inelastic-scattering measurements for 52 Cr, 58 Ni, 209 Bi, and 207 Pb; (n, 2 n) measurements for 207 Pb, and (n,xp); and (n,x alpha) and (n,xn) cross-section measurements with the activation technique. Capture, total, and inelastic cross-section measurements {{make use of the}} pulsed white neutron source Gelina, whereas activation cross sections are determined at the Van de Graaff laboratory. An overview will be given of the above-mentioned activities and an outlook will be provided for the measurements in the near future. JRC. D. 5 -Neutron physic...|$|E
40|$|The issue <b>of</b> {{disposal}} <b>of</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>waste</b> in Japan {{is extremely}} important especially after the accident of Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Power Plant {{at the time of}} the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11, 2011.
