5|$|The Achaean League chose <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> fight Rome but was swiftly defeated. In 146 BC (the {{same year}} as the {{destruction}} of Carthage), Corinth was besieged and destroyed, {{which led to the}} league's surrender. After nearly a century of constant crisis management in Greece, which always led back to internal instability and war when she withdrew, Rome decided to divide Macedonia into two new Roman provinces, Achaea and Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|In late 1401, the new {{war against}} the Order {{overstretched}} {{the resources of the}} Lithuanians, who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces. Another of Władysław's brothers, the malcontent Švitrigaila, chose <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> stir up revolts behind the lines and declare himself grand duke. On 31 January 1402, he presented himself in Marienburg, where he won the backing of the Knights with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy.|$|E
5|$|On October 29, 2014, {{controversy}} arose over a {{story that}} Baker told the previous night about a fisherman and his two sons in New Bedford. In the following days, The Boston Globe and The Standard-Times were unable to find the fisherman. This story, which Baker claims to have occurred in 2009, has been attributed by a professor from Northeastern University as a potential false memory. Coakley seized on <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> launch an attack on Baker, and visited New Bedford to meet with fishing industry leaders.|$|E

25|$|Dorgon chose <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> intervene: {{galloping}} around Wu's right flank, the Qing cavalry charged Li's {{left wing}} at Yipianshi ("Lone Rock", north of Shanhai Pass). When they saw mounted warriors with shaved foreheads rushing at {{them out of}} the storm, Shun troops broke their lines and fled. With their left wing shattered, the Shun army disbanded; thousands of Shun soldiers were massacred as they retreated chaotically toward Yongping.|$|E
25|$|Seeing his flank turned, Gérard gave {{instructions}} for a retreat. Apparently Jarry was acting {{commander of the}} II Corps 2nd Division, because he and Rottembourg joined their divisions and made an orderly withdrawal after abandoning Laubressel. Their movement was supported by cavalry and artillery. Wrede chose <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> directly assault the Guillotière Bridge with four Bavarian battalions while shifting other troops to his left. In the confusion, Duhesme missed the first orders to pull back and was nearly surrounded by enemies when Gérard sent them a second time. Hounded by the Austrian Knesevich Dragoons Nr. 3 and the Szekler Hussars Nr. 11, Duhesme's troops nevertheless fought {{their way back to}} Saint-Parres-aux-Tertres after suffering 400 casualties and losing two guns. The Crown Prince remained inactive on the left, allowing Molitor's XI Corps and Milhaud's cavalry to fall back without interference.|$|E

500|$|Many {{references}} in Arbuthnot's diary, however, are less respectful than those she accorded to the Duchess of Kent. Wellington and Arbuthnot often travelled together, and {{a visit to}} Blenheim Palace they shared in 1824 provoked a scathing entry in her journal concerning Wellington's fellow duke the 5th Duke of Marlborough, of whom she wrote: [...] "The family of the great General is, however, gone sadly to decay, and are but a disgrace to the illustrious name of Churchill, which they have chosen <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> resume. The present Duke is overloaded with debt, is very little better than a common swindler".|$|E

500|$|The game concept {{itself is}} based on an earlier title that Blow had envisioned but never completed. In this {{unfinished}} title, there was a side gameplay aspect that has a [...] "magic moment", according to Blow, that would have made the title exciting. The Witnesss gameplay {{is based on}} distilling out this [...] "magic moment" [...] from the previous concept game, and wrapping it within its own game and story. Blow has compared <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> a spoiler for a movie, and thus has avoided disclosure of the mechanic or other aspects of the game. The maze panel idea bore out from an earlier idea that Blow had around 2002 for a game involving wizards which the player would cast spells through mouse gestures, a popular element of video games at the time, with the ability to modify the effect of the spells by slight alterations of specific gestures; elements of The Witnesss story borrow from this game concept.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} notable verses in the song {{discusses}} the harsh effects of drugs, their role in destroying many of Kiedis' relationships, {{and their impact on}} his happiness. Based on one of Kiedis' experiences, the verse of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] illustrates his efforts to enter gang territory under a bridge to purchase drugs. Kiedis pretended that a sister of one of the gang members was his fiancée to be permitted inside. Although he successfully acquired the drugs, Kiedis considers <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> be one of the worst of his life as it demonstrated the level to which he was willing to sink in order to feed his addiction. For over 20 years, Kiedis refused to acknowledge the location of the bridge, though he noted that it is in downtown Los Angeles. Using clues provided by Kiedis in his autobiography Scar Tissue, writer Mark Haskell Smith concluded that the bridge that inspired the song was located in the city's MacArthur Park, although this contradicts Kiedis own assertion that the bridge was underneath a freeway. Other possible cited locations have included the Belmont Tunnel about half a mile from MacArthur Park, and more recently, the overpass where Interstate Highway 10 (the Santa Monica Freeway) crosses over Hoover Street close to downtown L.A.|$|E
500|$|With {{the death}} of Whitney Houston {{three days before the}} episode aired, a great deal of {{attention}} was given to Amber Riley's performance of Houston's hit during the episode, [...] "I Will Always Love You", and its unexpected function as a tribute to the singer. Reviews were glowing: Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "gorgeous, lush take" [...] that was [...] "definitely an episode highlight", and Bell described is as [...] "a beautiful cover", [...] "the perfect song for Mercedes to sing to Sam" [...] and a [...] "haunting performance". Flandez wrote that it was a [...] "heart-rending love song that becomes a homage of the 48-year-old fallen star", and [...] "brought goosebumps"; the shot near the end, [...] "of Mercedes dressed in a sweetheart gown, standing alone, reaching for the stars, was memorable". The Washington Post Jen Chaney said that [...] "Riley deserves a standing ovation", and that she sang the song with [...] "a power motivated by genuine emotions that tied in directly to her storyline"; the [...] "heartbreaking context of Houston's death ... immediately elevated <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> the very best one of Glee entire third season." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide listed the rendition as one of Glee best performances.|$|E
500|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline, Shannon {{does not go}} back with Boone. In [...] "LA X", Boone goes back alone on Flight 815 and sits beside Locke, where he finds out about Locke supposedly going on a Walkabout in Australia. In a parallel with the island timeline, Boone tells Locke if they crashed, he would follow him. Once the plane lands, Boone shakes Locke's hand and exits the plane. Boone reappears in the final episode of Lost. In [...] "The End", we see Hurley and Sayid talking in a car on a dark street, and they witness a thug beating up a guy (Boone) outside of a bar. Shannon shouts [...] "Leave my brother alone," [...] and Sayid {{gets out of the}} car to intervene. His and Shannon's memories are restored the moment they touch. Boone, having conspired with Hurley to bring Shannon and Sayid together, wanders over to the car. He jokes with Hurley about how he had to take a beating and [...] "thanks for taking your time." [...] He also comments how difficult it was to get Shannon to return from Australia with him, but he and Hurley agree the effort was worth it for <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> have her and Sayid's memories restored. Boone is one of the first people Jack greets in the church where everyone reunites to move on to the afterlife together.|$|E

The next time, Richards blew the tuba with both lungs. [...] "I still can't hear you", said Singer.

2500|$|Throughout June the Portland Whigs {{were very}} close to forming a {{coalition}} government {{and it was the}} Duke of Portland's need to win Fitzwilliam's support for such a policy that alone stopped him taking the decision. Fitzwilliam met him at Burlington House on 25 May in which he told Fitzwilliam he had met Pitt the previous day, with the Prime Minister telling him for his wish for a coalition as [...] "the expulsion of that evil spirit ...and [...] that his wish and object was that it might make us act together as one great Family... lamented the scantiness of Cabinet employments he had it in his power at <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> <b>to</b> offer us" [...] but assured him that they would be offered when they became available. Fitzwilliam declined to meet Pitt with the Duke of Portland on 13 June as he was organising the Volunteers in the West Riding but his objection went deeper: [...] "However frequently I have thought on the subject...it never occurs to me without presenting itself in some new point of view, which generally tends to render decision more difficult". He would not take that decision until Pitt clarified his offer of positions for Whigs in any prospective government. The Duke of Portland claimed he could not further negotiate with Pitt without Fitzwilliam's support, with Fitzwilliam replying that without a declaration from Pitt that the main war aim was the restoration of the House of Bourbon he could not take office but he reassured him that if he joined the government he would have his support. Fitzwilliam also still thought the way Pitt had come to power in 1783 was [...] "a severe blow to the spirit of the constitution and to Whiggism, which is the essence of it".|$|E
