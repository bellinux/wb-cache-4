5|$|The 6th Airlanding Brigade advance {{started on}} 17August along two axes, with the 12th Devons on the left, the 2nd OBLI on <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 1st RUR in reserve. At Longuemare the 12th Devons {{had to fight}} through the German rearguard, and the 1st RUR took over the advance {{on the left and}} reached Cabourg without meeting any further resistance.|$|E

Once inside, the pilot sits {{low in the}} cockpit, {{protected}} by the bathtub assembly, which makes for a cramped cockpit. Visibility from the cockpit is limited, being a trade-off for improved pilot protection. Rearwards visibility is poor, though a periscope is fitted {{on top of the}} canopy to compensate.|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{deployed}} his smaller army {{in waiting}} near Bryennios's camp, and divided {{it in two}} commands. The left, which confronted Bryennios's strongest division, was commanded by himself and contained the Frankish knights to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Immortals to the Franks' left. The right command was under Constantine Katakalon, and comprised the Chomatenoi and the Turks. The latter, according to the Alexiad, were given the role of flank guard (plagiophylakes) and tasked with observing and countering the Pechenegs. Conversely, on the extreme left Alexios formed his own flanking detachment (apparently drawn from among the Immortals), concealed from enemy view inside a hollow. Given his inferiority, Alexios was forced {{to remain on the}} defensive. His only chance at success was that his out-flankers, concealed by the broken terrain, would surprise and create enough confusion among Bryennios's men for him and his strong left wing to break through their lines.|$|E

5|$|By December 1944 {{the brigade}} was {{preparing}} for Christmas leave, when news of the German offensive in the Ardennes broke. As part of the First Allied Airborne Army, 6th Airborne Division was available {{as a component of}} the strategic reserve for the Allied forces in northwest Europe. The other two divisions available in reserve, the American 82nd and 101st Airborne, were already at Rheims in northern France, and the 6th Airborne was sent by sea to Belgium to assist the defence. With 29 German and 33 Allied divisions involved, the Battle of the Bulge was the largest single battle on the Western Front during the war. On Christmas Day the division moved up to take position in front of the spearhead of the German advance; by Boxing Day they had reached their allocated places in the defensive line between Dinant and Namur. The 3rd Parachute Brigade were on the left, 5th Parachute Brigade on <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 6th Airlanding Brigade in reserve. By the time they arrived in position the German advance had faltered.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cylinder}} valve models have axial spindles - {{in line with}} the cylinder axis, and are not handed. Standard side-spindle valves have the valve knob on the diver's right side when back-mounted. Side-spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with the knob to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other with the knob to the left, but in all cases the valve is opened by turning the knob anticlockwise, and closed by turning it clockwise. This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes. Left hand side-spindle valves are used by sidemount divers.|$|E
5|$|The cover also {{features}} a blue dragon eating a human, the design {{of which was a}} direct reference to the sea serpent image from Olaus Magnus's book History of the Northern Peoples. The use of a dragon eating a man is to symbolise former member Hester being consumed by depression, symbolised by the dragon being blue, and this brought his time on earth to an early end. The cover art is almost completely composed of newspaper cuttings collaged together, even the image of the man and the dragon are newspaper cuttings which Seymour painted onto. Only the tree on <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> title text are not composed of newspaper cuttings. The tree is to pose as a simile for the tree under which Hester took his life in 2005.|$|E

Over the next days the German advance was halted and forced back, until at the end of January 1945, the brigade crossed into the Netherlands. Here the division was made responsible for the area along the River Maas, between Venlo and Roermond. The brigade carried out patrols, {{on both sides of the}} river, against their opponents from the German 7th Parachute Division. Near the end of February the division returned to England to prepare for another airborne mission, to cross the River Rhine into Germany.|$|E
5|$|The first {{engagement}} that Australian {{troops were}} involved in during the Second World War came at Bardia, a major Italian military outpost {{in the north of}} Libya. The 16th Brigade broke through Bardia's western defensive perimeter at dawn on 3 January 1941, when the 2/1st Battalion breached the wire defences and swung left before advancing. The 2/2nd Battalion followed suit, swinging to <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 2/3rd then moved straight through the breach. Late in the day, a counter-attack by Italian tanks threatened the 2/3rd Battalion's headquarters, until a hastily organised defensive action led by the commanding officer, England, and a platoon of anti-tank guns restored the situation. Meanwhile, the 17th Brigade led a diversion to the south. Although the 16th Brigade was able to capture Bardia in the late afternoon of 4 January, resistance continued, and fighting did not cease until the next morning. Over 40,000 Italians were captured along with significant amounts of equipment and material– including food and ammunition– which was in short supply. A significant amount of alcohol was also captured by the Australians in Italian dugouts inside the 2/3rd's position around Wadi-el-Ghereida. During this period, the 2/3rd lost five officers and 56 men killed or wounded.|$|E
