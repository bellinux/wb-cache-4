5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> {{the smallest of}} the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.|$|E

5|$|In a 1993 paper, David Wonnacott, Barry J. Kellett and David J. Stickland {{identified}} {{this system}} as a candidate to evolve into a Type Ia supernova or a cataclysmic variable.

5|$|It {{has also}} been argued against folk {{psychology}} that the intentionality of mental states like belief imply that they have semantic qualities.

5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{destructive}} hurricanes in U.S. history have impacted Texas. A hurricane in 1875 killed about 400 people in Indianola, followed by another hurricane in 1886 that destroyed the town. These events allowed Galveston to take over as the chief port city. The 1900 Galveston hurricane subsequently devastated that city, killing about 8,000 people or possibly as many as 12,000. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history.|$|E

5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, <b>this</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> possible to extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort {{have proved to be}} very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E

It is more common in the developed world and is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract in developed countries. Rates of endometrial cancer have risen in a number of countries between the 1980s and 2010. This is believed to be due to the increasing number of elderly people and increasing rates of obesity.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} dengue recover without any ongoing problems. The {{fatality}} rate is 1–5%, {{and less than}} 1% with adequate treatment; however those who develop significantly low blood pressure may have a fatality rate of up to 26%. Dengue is common in more than 110 countries. In 2013 it causes about 60 million symptomatic infections worldwide, with 18% admitted to hospital and about 13,600 deaths. The worldwide cost of dengue case is estimated US$9 billion. For {{the decade of the}} 2000s, 12 countries in Southeast Asia were estimated to have about 3million infections and 6,000 deaths annually. It is reported in at least 22 countries in Africa; but is likely present in all of them with 20% of the population at risk. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> {{one of the most common}} vector-borne diseases worldwide.|$|E

When only counting time spent as a tropical storm or hurricane – 20.75days – Nadine is the third longest-lasting, behind only Hurricane Ginger in 1971 and the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane. When Nadine was upgraded to a hurricane at 1800UTC on September14, it marked the third-earliest forming eighth hurricane, behind only an unnamed system in 1893 and Ophelia in 2005.|$|E
