5|$|In a {{study of}} spider populations in western Tennessee, Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiderlings were {{reported}} <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> from egg sacs in mid summer. The spiders hibernated through the winter in an immature form and reached sexual maturity around late April.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of many stick insects, {{including}} Timema, {{are attractive}} to ants, who carry them away to their burrows {{to feed on}} the egg's capitulum, while leaving {{the rest of the}} egg intact <b>to</b> <b>hatch.</b> The emerging nymph passes through six or seven instars before reaching adulthood.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{would be}} divided into batches of 13, and placed under broody chickens. In {{the last week of}} the four-week {{incubation}} period the eggs would be sprinkled daily with warm water to soften the shells and allow the ducklings <b>to</b> <b>hatch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The egg {{is almost}} spherical, with the poles only very weakly flattened. It is ivory white {{changing}} to dark greyish white prior <b>to</b> <b>hatching.</b>|$|R
50|$|The nest, {{built by}} the female, is a cup of plant {{material}} into which she lays typically four eggs. The female alone incubates for 12-14 days <b>to</b> <b>hatching.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{meaning of}} the word evolves in ancient Indian literature. The {{earliest}} discussions of tapas, and compound words from the root tap (Sanskrit: तप) relate to the heat necessary for biological birth. Its conceptual origin is traced to the natural wait, motherly warmth and physical [...] "brooding" [...] provided by birds such as a hen upon her eggs - a process that is essential <b>to</b> <b>hatching</b> and birth; the Vedic scholars used mother nature's example to explain and extend this concept <b>to</b> <b>hatching</b> of knowledge and spiritual rebirth.|$|R
5|$|A {{chain of}} victims soon {{succumb to the}} eggs {{contained}} in the toxic smoke, {{all of whom are}} found with their bodies covered in the tobacco beetles. While interviewing Weaver, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is exposed to the smoke, later coughing up blood and needing his lungs invasively cleared as the beetles begin <b>to</b> <b>hatch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ralph learns he {{can obtain}} a medal from the first-person shooter, Hero's Duty. After disrupting a game session, Ralph scales the game's central beacon and obtains a medal, only <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> a Cy-Bug, {{one of the}} game's antagonists, which can adapt to and devour other environments. Ralph and the Cy-Bug stumble into an escape pod, which is {{launched}} out of the game, and crash land in Sugar Rush, a candy-themed kart racing game.|$|E
5|$|Tree sparrows {{are also}} subject to {{bacterial}} and viral infections. Bacteria {{have been shown}} to be an important factor in the failure of eggs <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> and in nestling mortality, and mass deaths due to Salmonella infection have been noted in Japan. Avian malaria parasites have been found in the blood of many populations, and birds in China were found to harbour a strain of H5N1 that was highly virulent to chickens.|$|E
50|$|Hatch marks can {{probably}} be traced <b>to</b> <b>hatching</b> in art works, where {{the pattern of}} the hatch marks represents a unique tone or hue. Different patterns indicate different tones.|$|R
25|$|The {{process from}} {{spawning}} <b>to</b> <b>hatching</b> follows a similar trajectory in all species, the main variable being {{the amount of}} yolk available to the young {{and when it is}} absorbed by the embryo.|$|R
60|$|MY DEAR SIR: Yesterday {{morning the}} court {{overruled}} the demurrer <b>to</b> <b>Hatches</b> {{return in the}} mandamus case. McClernand was present; said nothing about pleading over; and so I suppose the matter is ended.|$|R
5|$|After Marge leaves Bart with Nelson, Bart discovers two {{eggs in a}} bird's nest. Since he {{does not}} want the babies to die like their mother, he decides <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> the eggs, and {{secretly}} keeps the eggs warm in his treehouse. After Bart spends more time in his treehouse, Marge starts to suspect he is up to something. After Marge finds out what Bart has been doing, she tells him she is proud of him. With Marge's help, the eggs eventually hatch, but the Simpson family is shocked when instead of birds, a pair of lizards emerge from the eggs, whom Bart names Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr.|$|E
5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, while others have developed a number of mechanisms for {{holding on to the}} eggs until they are ready <b>to</b> <b>hatch.</b> Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E
5|$|Incubation takes 56days, and {{the male}} stops {{incubating}} the eggs shortly before they hatch. The temperature of the nest rises slightly during the eight-week period. Although the eggs are laid sequentially, they tend <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> within two days of one another, as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly. During the process, the precocial emu chicks {{need to develop a}} capacity for thermoregulation. During incubation, the embryos are kept at a constant temperature but the chicks will {{need to be able to}} cope with varying external temperatures by the time they hatch.|$|E
5000|$|Egg stage: Spawning <b>to</b> <b>hatching.</b> This {{stage is}} used instead of using an {{embryonic}} stage because there are aspects, such as those {{to do with the}} egg envelope, that are not just embryonic aspects.|$|R
40|$|Oxygen fluxes through artificially created salmon redds {{within four}} UK rivers were {{quantified}} and assessed against survival <b>to</b> <b>hatching</b> of Atlantic salmon embryos. All sites recorded high spatial variability in survival. Minimum survival <b>to</b> <b>hatching</b> was zero at all sites. Maximum survival <b>to</b> <b>hatching</b> ranged from 35 % to 91 %. Mean survival <b>to</b> <b>hatching</b> ranged from 8 · 7 % to 71 %. Intra- and inter-site variations in rates of oxygen supply were observed. Generally, interstitial dissolved oxygen concentrations declined over the incubation period from a maximum recorded directly after redd creation, although localized fluctuations were recorded. Similarly, interstitial flow velocities declined over the incubation period from a maximum directly after redd creation {{to a minimum}} at <b>hatching.</b> With respect <b>to</b> the causes of embryo mortalities, oxygen supply was {{shown to be a}} stronger determinant of survival than interstitial oxygen concentration or interstitial flow velocity. To improve delineation of potential causes of embryo mortalities in the field, the statistical analysis was integrated within mass transfer theory of the processes controlling respiration to determine the likely mechanisms inhibiting respiration. Based on this analysis, mortalities were assessed to have resulted from periods of lethal oxygen concentrations, from periods of interstitial flow velocities that were insufficient to remove metabolic waste, or from combinations of oxygen concentration and interstitial flow that did not support respiratory requirements. A set of oxygen-supply-related thresholds for assessing incubation habitat quality are proposed...|$|R
50|$|Long-billed gnatwrens build a deep cup nest {{very low}} in a small plant or sapling. The two white eggs are {{incubated}} by both parents for 16-17 days <b>to</b> <b>hatching,</b> with a further 11-12 days to fledging.|$|R
5|$|Mated females then seek a {{suitable}} place to begin a colony. There, they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs. The females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones. The first workers <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> are known as nanitics, and are weaker and smaller than later workers, but they begin to serve the colony immediately. They enlarge the nest, forage for food, {{and care for the}} other eggs. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, a process akin to swarming in honeybees.|$|E
5|$|Since leaving politics, Baird has {{accepted}} several private sector appointments. In June 2015 {{he was hired}} as a strategic adviser <b>to</b> <b>Hatch</b> Ltd, an international engineering and consulting firm for companies in the resource industry. In October 2015 he joined political risk consulting firm Eurasia Group as a senior adviser, where he offers strategic insight to companies on how global politics affects business. He has also been hired as an adviser to Barrick Gold and Bennett Jones, and accepted an appointment {{to the board of directors}} of Canadian Pacific Railway.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of D.sayi begins with copulation, which {{normally}} takes place shortly after the female has moulted, while her exoskeleton is still soft. Spawning occurs within hours or days of copulation, and the eggs are brooded on the female's pleopods (swimmerets) until they are ready <b>to</b> <b>hatch.</b> Females have been found carrying eggs from April to October; {{in a study of}} crabs caught at Gloucester Point, Virginia in 1978, females were observed to carry between 686 and 14,735 eggs. The number of eggs increases with carapace width according to a power law; extrapolation of the power law suggests that the largest D.sayi females are capable of carrying over 32,000 eggs each.|$|E
50|$|The small cup nest {{is built}} in a tree and the normal clutch is two brown-blotched white eggs. The female incubates the eggs for 13 days <b>to</b> <b>hatching,</b> with another 15 days before the chicks fledge.|$|R
50|$|Note: Amber's chick <b>hatched</b> <b>to</b> Amber and Violet, Thalia and Topanga <b>hatched</b> <b>to</b> Thumbelina and Flannigain, and Aurora <b>hatched</b> <b>to</b> Amber and Violet. Amber's chick is {{no longer}} {{mentioned}} on Lowry Park Zoo's website, and is presumed dead.|$|R
50|$|The life stages {{from the}} {{initiation}} of a clutch, through <b>to</b> <b>hatching</b> and fledging are a direct response to {{the availability of the}} berries as a food source, with fledging occurring just before berry ripening has reached its peak.|$|R
5|$|The {{social life}} of a crocodilian begins while it {{is still in the}} egg, because the young start {{communicating}} with each other before they are hatched. It has been shown that a light tapping noise near the nest will be repeated by the young, one after another. Such early communication may help them <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> simultaneously. Once it has broken out of the egg, a juvenile produces yelps and grunts, either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli and even unrelated adults respond quickly to juvenile distress calls.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{begins in}} a {{farmyard}} which {{is home to}} a duck called Jemima Puddle-duck. She wants <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> her own eggs, but the farmer's wife believes ducks make poor sitters and routinely confiscates their eggs to allow the hens to incubate them. Jemima tries to hide her eggs, but they are always found and carried away. She sets off along the road in her poke bonnet and shawl to find a safe place away from the farm to lay her eggs.|$|E
5|$|This kiwi {{is highly}} aggressive, and pairs will defend their large territories (49 acres) against other kiwi. Great spotted kiwi are nocturnal, and will sleep {{during the day}} in burrows. At night, they feed on {{invertebrates}} and will also eat plants. Great spotted kiwi breed between June and March. The egg is the largest of all birds {{in proportion to the}} size of the bird. Chicks take 75 to 85 days <b>to</b> <b>hatch,</b> and after hatching, they are abandoned by their parents.|$|E
25|$|Crocodilian {{sense of}} smell is also very well developed, aiding them to detect prey or animal {{carcasses}} that are either on land or in water, from far away. It is possible that crocodiles use olfaction in the egg prior <b>to</b> <b>hatching.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{typically}} found as territorial pairs. The female lays two purple-marked creamy white {{eggs in a}} deep cup nest in a shrub, which are incubated by both sexes for 14 days <b>to</b> <b>hatching.</b> The chicks fledge in another 12-13 days.|$|R
50|$|The African {{olive pigeon}} builds a large stick nest up to 15 m {{high in a}} tree and lays one (rarely two) white eggs. The eggs are {{incubated}} for 17-20 days <b>to</b> <b>hatching,</b> and the chicks fledge in another 20 days.|$|R
5|$|After {{the female}} lays the egg, the male incubates the egg while the female guards the nest. Males only leave the nest {{for a few}} hours to hunt, and during this time, the female takes over. It takes 75 to 85days for the egg <b>to</b> <b>hatch.</b> The kiwi chick takes 2 to 3 days simply to get out of its egg. Kiwi chicks are precocial, and are {{abandoned}} by their parents after hatching. After ten days, chicks venture out of the burrow to hunt. Most chicks are killed by predators {{in the first six months}} of their life. Great spotted kiwis reach full size at year six. Unlike most birds, female great spotted kiwis have two ovaries. Most birds have only one. Great spotted kiwis are distinguishable from other kiwi species by the fact that they can only produce one egg a year, as it takes so much energy to produce the massive egg.|$|E
5|$|Brood parasitism, {{in which}} an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E
5|$|Constantine of Baberon, the regent for Isabella of Cilicia, {{offered her}} hand to Bohemond's son, Philip, because he needed Bohemond's {{assistance}} against Kayqubad I, Sultan of Rum. Bohemond accepted the offer and his son married Isabella in June 1222. Bohemond and Philip repelled a Seldjuq attack against Cilicia. Philip's blatant favoritism towards his Frankish retainers enabled Constantine of Baberon <b>to</b> <b>hatch</b> a plot against him. Philip and his supporters were captured and imprisoned {{at the end of}} 1224. Bohemond tried to ensure his son's liberation through negotiations. He appealed to Pope Honorius III, but the pope confirmed his excommunication and forbade the Templars to assist him. Bohemond persuaded Kayqubad I to invade Cilicia. Although Bohemond's son had already been poisoned, Constantine of Baberon promised that Philip would be released if Bohemond come to Cilicia. Shortly after Bohemond's departure, Shihab ad-Din Toghril, atabeg of Aleppo, broke into the Principality of Antioch. After learning of his son's death and Toghril's invasion, Bohemond hurried back.|$|E
40|$|We report {{preliminary}} {{findings on the}} development of Lernaea cyprinacea from cleavage <b>to</b> <b>hatching.</b> The eggs are centrolecithal with superficial cleavage. Nucleoli were found in the nuclei of the perilecithal syncytium. Gastrulation occurs by in situ aggregation of cells, without evident morphogenetic movements...|$|R
50|$|The female {{builds a}} cup nest, {{typically}} 2 to 9 m {{above the ground}} in a tree or hedge. The 1-3 (usually 2) eggs are incubated solely by the female for 14-15 days <b>to</b> <b>hatching,</b> and the chicks fledge in another 16 days.|$|R
