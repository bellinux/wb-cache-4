5|$|In August 1923 Moriarty died, and Fortune—who {{had never}} been {{particularly}} popular among his followers—tried <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> she should be their new leader. A few accepted her offer, but many others instead accepted the leadership of Stafford-Allen. Meanwhile, Fortune's parents relocated to the garden city of Letchworth, Hertfordshire in 1922, and {{it was here that}} Fortune carried out what she deemed to be additional communications with the Masters through trance mediumship between 1923 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|In the present, when Eddie, Pink, and White return, Orange tries <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Blonde {{planned to}} kill them and steal the {{diamonds}} for himself. Eddie kills Nash and accuses Orange of lying, since Blonde was loyal to his father. Joe arrives with news that the police have killed Blue. He is about to execute Orange, but White intervenes and holds Joe at gunpoint. Eddie points his own weapon at White, creating a Mexican standoff. All three shoot; both Cabots are killed, and White and Orange are wounded.|$|E
5|$|Upon Irataba's {{return from}} Washington D.C., {{he met with}} the Mohave while dressed in his major general's uniform, with medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and he told the Mohave about all the things he had seen. He tried <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, {{stressing}} their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E

The appearance of this sun dog so soon before the battle seems to have frightened his troops, but Edward of York appears <b>to</b> have <b>convinced</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> it represented the Holy Trinity and that therefore God was on their side. He later took it as his emblem, the [...] "Sun in splendour". The event was dramatized by William Shakespeare in King Henry VI, Part 3(See below) and in Sharon Kay Penman's The Sunne In Splendour.|$|R

5|$|The key to Ferdinand was {{the threat}} to Genoa. Intelligence {{intercepts}} showed that the Abwehr (German military intelligence) listed {{it as one of}} the main areas they expected an Allied attack. It was not possible to hide the buildup of naval and amphibious forces in the region, which were easily accessible to German aerial reconnaissance. German commanders identified both Genoa and southern France as the only logical targets, so the task for Allied double agents was <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the former was the true goal. The deception was maintained on the invasion date itself, with a tactical deception. The Dragoon fleet travelled on a course toward Genoa until late at night on 14 August, when they turned west toward their real target.|$|E
5|$|Banza was {{appointed}} {{minister of finance}} and minister of state in the new government. The regime first secured diplomatic recognition from President François Tombalbaye of neighboring Chad, whom Bokassa met in Bouca, Ouham. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along the southern border of Chad at Fort Archambault, the two decided to help one another if either {{was in danger of}} losing power. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, French President Charles de Gaulle decided to make an official visit to the Central African Republic on 17 November 1966. To the new government, this visit meant that the French had accepted the new changes in the country.|$|E

50|$|One {{reason for}} the lack of support of this {{philosophical}} position is how strange it would be for a solipsist to preach solipsism - as if <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> everyone around <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they are purely a figment of the author's own imagination. The very idea of communicating philosophical ideas would be arbitrary to a true solipsist, as according to them, there is no other mind with whom they would communicate their beliefs.|$|R

Although his entreaties did not work, as President Nixon was eventually forced to resign rather than face impeachment, he did earn a Presidential letter of thanks (see the letter at the bottom of this article). He died in his sleep while on vacation in Florida, on January 20, 2016.|$|E
25|$|The action {{takes place}} in Jerome's very untidy and {{neglected}} flat. Before the play begins, Jerome has arranged a meeting with wife Corinna and Mervyn Bickerdyke from the Department of Child Wellbeing, <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> it will be appropriate for Geain {{to stay with him}} for long visits. Geain is also due to come to the meeting. To help to convince them, Jerome plans to hire an actress, Zoe Mill, from an escort agency, to pose as his fiancée. The first act takes place one week before the meeting as he interviews Zoe for the job. Before she arrives, Jerome activates his NAN 300F – a female android (or gynoid) whom he calls Nan. He treats Nan, who was originally designed to look after children, almost like a pet. Much of the play's humour originates from her idiosyncrasies as she collides with the furniture, blurts out unexpected remarks, and performs her tasks incompetently – such as serving a drink with the tumbler upside down.|$|E

[...] Although initially taken aback, McCartney appreciated Godrich's tenacity and honesty.|$|R
50|$|Following {{additional}} landings on Mindanao, U.S. Eighth Army troops {{continued their}} steady advance against stubborn resistance. By {{the end of}} June, the enemy pockets were compressed into isolated pockets on Mindanao and Luzon where fighting continued until the Japanese surrender on August 15, 1945. However, some units of the Japanese Army were out of radio contact with Tokyo, and it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> some of <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Japan had surrendered. As at many Pacific Islands, major Japanese officials, including members of the Imperial Family, visited in person <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the soldiers that they must surrender by order of the Emperor.|$|R
25|$|In summer 1923, {{mandated}} by Foreign Affairs Minister Ion G. Duca of the PNL, {{he played a}} part in negotiations to restore contacts with the Russian government. He was in Paris, meeting with the Romanian communist Christian Rakovsky, who was the Soviet Ambassador to France. They discussed the litigious issue of Bessarabia, which the Bolsheviks still refused to recognize as part of Romania: Pântea was supposed <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the union had been a legitimate affair, and, according to Pântea, Rakovsky showed himself unusually receptive. With a delegation which included Constantin Langa-Rășcanu, Mircea Djuvara, Petru Cazacu and Anton Crihan, Pântea represented Romania in bilateral talks with a delegation from the Soviet Union, headed by diplomat Nikolay Krestinsky. These negotiations took place in Vienna during late March 1924. In conversation with Krestinsky, Pântea even transmitted the government's offer to renounce claims to the Romanian Treasure in Russia, in exchange for the Soviet recognition of the 1918 union.|$|E

While she is gone, King Arthur, who just escaped from the jail and is being tracked down by Mary Margaret, Merida and the dwarves, stumbles upon Hades, but he kills Arthur as he sees him as a threat. Zelena finds Regina and Robin Hood and tries <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Hades has changed his ways. Emma, David and Henry are reunited with Snow and Merida and explain the details of Hades' {{deception}} but Emma's vengeance against Hades is making her too emotional. Zelena and Hades {{are talking about the}} others not believing that he changed. Hades gets a weapon, known as the Olympian Crystal (Zeus's thunderbolt), which can kill anybody, even a god. He also suggests that they leave Storybrooke but Zelena is not so sure if she wants to. As Emma, Merida and David find Arthur's body at the Storybrooke Bridge, David tries to calm down a furious Emma, who's trying to protect Storybrooke from Hades' wrath.|$|E
25|$|Feeling {{discontent with}} Cotonang, in December 1960, {{many of its}} workers started to boycott work, {{demanding}} better working conditions and higher wages. The discontent was seized by infiltrated indoctrinators of the Congolese PSA (African Solidarity Party) to foment an uprising of the local peoples. At that time, the only Portuguese Army unit stationed in the region was the 3rd Special Caçadores Company (3ª CCE), tasked with the patrolling and protection of the border with the ex-Belgian Congo. Despite receiving complains from local whites who felt their security threatened, the Governor of the Malanje District, Júlio Monteiro - a mixed race Cape Verdean - did not authorized the 3ª CCE to act against the rebellious and also forbade the acquisition of self-defense weapons by the white population. From the 9th to 11 January 1961, the situation worsened, {{with the murder of}} a mixed race Cotonang foreman and with the surrounding of a 3ª CCE patrol by hundreds of rebellious. Finally, on 2 February, the clashes between the rebels and the security forces erupted, with the first shots being fired, causing 11 dead. By that time, the uprising had spread to the whole Malanje District and threatened to spread to the neighboring districts. The rebellious leaders took advantage of the superstition beliefs of most of their followers <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> the bullets of the Portuguese military forces were made of water and so they could do them no harm. Probably because of this belief, the rebels, armed with machetes and canhangulos (home-made shotguns), attacked the military en masse, in the open field, without concern to protect themselves, falling under the fire of the troops.|$|E
60|$|Prejudices are unmanageable things, and {{the good}} aunts, like most women, possessed a {{plentiful}} supply, so Rose found it like beating her head against a wall <b>to</b> try and <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> Archie was wise in loving poor Phebe. His mother, who had hoped to have Rose for her daughter not because of her fortune, but the tender affection she felt for her put away her disappointment without a word and welcomed Phebe as kindly as she could for her boy's sake. But the girl felt the truth with the quickness of a nature made sensitive by love and clung to her resolve all the more tenaciously, though grateful for the motherly words {{that would have been}} so sweet if genuine happiness had prompted them.|$|R
5000|$|Operation Volcano was an unmitigated {{military}} {{success and}} represented the largest Israeli military undertaking since its War of Independence. It also represented another humiliation for the Egyptian army {{in a string}} of military setbacks beginning with Operation Black Arrow in February 1955. The defeat at Sabcha did not dissuade President Nasser of Egypt from declaring “victory” over the Israelis and paying tribute to [...] "the heroes of the battle at el-Sabcha." [...] Nasser flew correspondents to the battle site and attempted <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them,</b> without success, <b>that</b> the bodies of dead Egyptians strewn about the battlefield were actually Israelis. A skeptical press corps remained unconvinced by Egyptian propaganda claims. Operation Volcano put to an end, once and for all, Egyptian military encroachments into the Demilitarized Zone and established Israel's sovereignty over the Nitzana/Auja region.|$|R
60|$|Hence it is said, 'The {{preparations}} of {{the heart}} in man, &c., is from the Lord.' And again, 'God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me' (Job 23:16). The heart, as it is by nature hard, stupid, and impenetrable, so it remains, and so will remain, until God, as was said, bruiseth it with his hammer, and melts it with his fire. The stony nature of it is therefore said {{to be taken away}} of God. 'I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you,' saith he, 'an heart of flesh' (Eze 36:26). I will take away the stony heart, or the stoniness, or the hardness of your heart, and I will give you a heart of flesh; that is, I will make your heart sensible, soft, wieldable, governable, and penitent. Sometimes he bids men rend their hearts, not because they can, but <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> rather, <b>that</b> though it must be so, they cannot do it; so he bids them make themselves a new heart, and a new spirit, for the same purpose also; for if God doth not rend it, it remains unrent; if God makes it not new, it abides an old one still.|$|R

500|$|There {{was still}} little urgency in the United States, which unlike Britain {{was not yet}} engaged in World War II, so Oliphant flew there in late August 1941, and spoke to American {{scientists}} including his friend Ernest Lawrence at the University of California. He not only managed <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> an atomic bomb was feasible, but inspired Lawrence to convert his [...] cyclotron into a giant mass spectrometer for isotope separation, a technique Oliphant had pioneered in 1934.

[...] So for me {{there was a certain}} amount of guilt associated, like 'Do I know my son's hobby? Do I know my son's best friend?' etc." [...] The scene in which Bart welds on his racer resulted in an argument between the staff of the show and the Fox network's censors. The censors were concerned that children would imitate Bart by misusing welding tools; however, the staff was able <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> very few children have access to welding tools.|$|E

At breakfast she renewed the reasoning with which she had maintained her position the night before; the travellers entered into a full expression of their joy at being home again; March asked what had become of that stray parrot which they had left in the tree-top the morning they started; and Mrs. March declared that this was the last Silver Wedding Journey she ever wished to take, and tried <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> all <b>that</b> she had been on the verge of nervous collapse when she reached the ship.

6000|$|But {{what part}} {{is played by}} the theory of {{evolution}} in this view of ethics? So far as I can discern, the ethical system of the Stoics, which is essentially intuitive, and reverences the categorical imperative as strongly as that of any later moralists, might have been just what it was if they had held any other theory; whether that of special creation, on the one side, or that of the eternal existence of the present order, on the other.[Note 16] To the Stoic, the cosmos had no importance for the conscience, except in so far as he chose to think it a pedagogue to virtue. The pertinacious optimism of our philosophers hid from them the actual state of the case. It prevented <b>them</b> from seeing <b>that</b> cosmic nature is no school of virtue, but the headquarters of the enemy of ethical nature. The logic of facts was necessary <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>them</b> [76] <b>that</b> the cosmos works through the lower nature of man, not for righteousness, but against it. And it finally drove <b>them</b> to confess <b>that</b> the existence of their ideal [...] "wise man" [...] was incompatible with the nature of things; that even a passable approximation to that ideal was to be attained only at the cost of renunciation of the world and mortification, not merely of the flesh, but of all human affections. The state of perfection was that [...] "apatheia"[Note 17] in which desire, though it may still be felt, is powerless to move the will, reduced to the sole function of executing the commands of pure reason. Even this residuum of activity was to be regarded as a temporary loan, as an efflux of the divine world-pervading spirit, chafing at its imprisonment in the flesh,-until such time as death enabled it to return to its source in the all-pervading logos.|$|R
