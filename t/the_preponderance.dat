5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} the {{defendant}} has to prove incompetence by <b>the</b> <b>preponderance</b> of the evidence, but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as clear and convincing evidence. The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|The Federal {{government}} retired Jones in 1952 {{and replaced}} him with Air Marshal Donald Hardman, RAF, who proceeded to re-organise the RAAF command-and-control system along functional lines, establishing Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. The first was re-formed {{from the existing}} Eastern Area Command, which was considered a de facto operational organisation owing to <b>the</b> <b>preponderance</b> of combat forces within its sphere. The second was re-formed from Southern Area Command, as it was already the hub of training services, controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. The third and final functional command was formed from the extant Maintenance Group headquarters in Melbourne. The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of all operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and North-Eastern Area Commands.|$|E
5|$|The Madras Presidency had {{the highest}} {{literacy}} rate of all the provinces in British India. In 1901, Madras had a male literacy rate of 11.9 percent and a female literacy rate of 0.9 percent. In 1950, when the Madras Presidency became Madras State, the literacy rate was slightly {{higher than the national}} average of 18 percent. In 1901, there were 26,771 public and private institutions with 923,760 scholars of whom 784,621 were male and 139,139 female. By 1947, the number of educational institutions had increased to 37,811 and the number of scholars to 3,989,686. Apart from colleges, in 1947 there were 31,975 public and elementary schools, 720 secondary schools for boys and 4,173 elementary and 181 secondary schools for girls. Most of the early graduates were Brahmins. <b>The</b> <b>preponderance</b> of Brahmins in the universities and in the civic administration {{was one of the main}} causes for the growth of the Anti-Brahmin movement in the presidency. Madras was also the first province in British India where caste-based communal reservations were introduced.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} decoration was extraordinarily rich. The walls were decorated with marble, {{the roof was}} gilded, while the narthex featured a depiction of the baptism of Constantine the Great. Fragments of ivory, amethyst, gold and colored glass, originally inlaid in the marble sculptures, have also been found at the site, as well as fragments of mosaics. The deliberate evocation of the Solomonic Temple was further reinforced by <b>the</b> <b>preponderance</b> of motifs such as palm trees, pomegranates and lilies in the church's decoration. A notable characteristic, {{which has not been}} attested before in Constantinopolitan art and architecture, is the extensive use of Sassanid Persian decorative motifs such as friezes of running palmette and pomegranate leaves or symmetric geometric and vegetal patterns. Persian motifs became increasingly popular in the 6th century, and were also used in the decoration of the Hagia Sophia. Another exceptional find are ten relief plaques bearing the images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Apostles; such images are very rare due to the destruction of human representations in the Iconoclasm of the 8th and 9th centuries.|$|E
5|$|While local {{sources of}} gold are attested during the Aksumite era, silver {{seems to have}} been rarer in Aksum. No mention of silver mines in the region exist until the 15th and 16th centuries. Though silver was {{imported}} as attested by the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, given <b>the</b> <b>preponderance</b> of silver coins, it could not have been the only source of silver in Aksum. Furthermore, a significant number of the silver coins contain gold inlays (presumably to increase the value), which would have been unnecessary if silver were so rare {{that it had to be}} mainly imported. Silver may have been obtained from the refinement of gold, which sometimes occurs naturally with silver in an alloy called electrum. Copper and bronze do not seem to have existed locally in the Aksumite empire, though they were noted as imports in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.|$|E

5|$|In a 5–4 opinion {{written by}} Justice Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Appellate Division's ruling, holding that states seeking to sever parental rights irrevocably must show at least {{clear and convincing}} {{evidence}} of neglect.

The ruling has since been criticized for its intrusion into state affairs.

25|$|Except for <b>the</b> <b>preponderance</b> of firearms, {{these reforms}} {{remained}} in place {{throughout the history}} of the mercenary troops, first of the States of Holland, and later of the States-General (though they are often ascribed to Orange's son Maurice of Nassau). In the interim between 1576 and 1588, however, <b>the</b> <b>preponderance</b> of the forces fighting for the States-General, either in its own pay, or in the pay of foreign allies, like the duke of Anjou and the Earl of Leicester, did not follow this organisational model. These forces can, however, not be seen as predecessors of the States Army. That army only took shape after the Union of Utrecht was formed in 1579 and the influence of the States of Brabant and the States of Flanders in the States-General was eliminated due to the territorial gains of the duke of Parma who conquered their territories. The core of that new army were the troops raised by Holland on the model introduced after 1572.|$|E

40|$|Vestibular {{findings}} {{in a group}} of 35 patients with spasmodic torticollis without other otological or neurological symptoms were reviewed. The most consistent abnormality, present in more than 70 % of cases, was a directional preponderance of vestibular nystagmus in the dark in a direction opposite to the head (chin) deviation. Rigidly clamping the head to a rotating chair did not abolish <b>the</b> directional <b>preponderance.</b> In <b>the</b> presence of optic fixation <b>the</b> directional <b>preponderance</b> was less frequent and its severity tended to diminish {{as a function of the}} duration of the disease. Smooth pursuit and optokinetic nystagmus were only occasionally affected. The results are indicative of primary involvement of the vestibular system in spasmodic torticollis and are discussed in terms of a break-down of the central mechanisms conveying sensory information responsible for head and eye orientation...|$|R
50|$|The Calvinist {{communities}} {{were in a}} somewhat sorry state.

In 1654, after the First Bremian War, the city ceded the area to Swedish Bremen-Verden, which subjected the Calvinists there to supervision by the Lutheran consistory. Under Lutheran pressure only six congregations stood fast to Calvinism.

25|$|The {{vibrating}} lever, or half-trunk engine, was {{a development}} of the conventional trunk engine conceived by Swedish-American engineer John Ericsson. Ericsson needed a small, low-profile engine like the trunk engine to power the U.S. Federal government's monitors, a type of warship developed during the American Civil War that had very little space for a conventional powerplant. The trunk engine itself was however unsuitable for this purpose because <b>the</b> <b>preponderance</b> of weight was {{on the side of}} the engine containing the cylinder and trunk, a problem which could not be compensated for on the small monitor warships.|$|E
25|$|In 1844, Paul Thénard, {{son of the}} French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard, used a {{cold trap}} to {{separate}} diphosphine from phosphine that had been generated from calcium phosphide, thereby demonstrating that P2H4 is responsible for spontaneous flammability associated with PH3, and also for the characteristic orange/brown color that can form on surfaces, which is a polymerisation product. He considered diphosphine’s formula to be PH2, and thus an intermediate between elemental phosphorus, the higher polymers, and phosphine. Calcium phosphide (nominally Ca3P2) produces more P2H4 than other phosphides because of <b>the</b> <b>preponderance</b> of P-P bonds in the starting material.|$|E
