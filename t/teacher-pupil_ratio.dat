Are the separate facilities and educational opportunities offered to these Negro plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, [...] "equal" [...] in the constitutional sense, to those available at Claymont High to white children, similarly situated? The answer to this question is often much more difficult than appears, because many of the factors to be compared are just not susceptible of mathematical evaluation, e. g., aesthetic considerations. Moreover, and of real importance, the United States Supreme Court has not decided what should be done if a Negro school being compared with a white school is inferior in some respects and superior in others.

But, under this approach, how is one to deal with a situation where, as here, the mental and physical health services at the Negro school are superior to those offered at [...] the white school while the teacher load at the Negro school is not only substantially heavier than that at the white school, but often exceeds the State announced educationally desirable maximum <b>teacher-pupil</b> <b>ratio.</b> The answer, it seems to me is this: Where the facilities or educational opportunities available to the Negro are, as to any substantial factor, inferior to those available to white children similarly situated, the constitutional principle of [...] "separate but equal" [...] is violated, even though the State may point to other factors as to which the Negro school is superior.

Furthermore five teachers and two staff members from two different NGOs were asked about the role of young people in improving the quality of basic education. Results show that in general the quality of basic education is poor. The young people came up with many issues regarding the quality, for instance the content of education is not contextualized, teachers or not well trained, <b>teacher-pupil</b> <b>ratios</b> are too high and {{there is a lack of}} materials. To improve this quality is especially the responsibility of the government, according to young people. The actions of young people themselves are classified into four strategies (i. e. socialization, influence, power, and partnership) on three different impact scales (i. e. individual, community/inter-organisational, and national/international). The results show that most of the efforts of young people to improve educational quality in Mali are on the community scale and on the national scale. On community level the major strategy that is employed by young people is socialisation, that is, awareness-raising. On national scale the only strategy that young people use is influence through advocacy. Partnership was never mentioned as a strategy. According to teachers youth do not have a role in improving educational quality; this should be done by parents. Factors that enhance the role of youth are their rights and support by NGOs.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. The South African Education {{system has}} gone through much {{transformation}} and seen {{significant changes in the}} past decade in order to provide quality education and reformation. However, many under-resourced schools, such as rural schools, still face unacceptably high <b>teacher-pupil</b> <b>ratios</b> and large classes in their schools (Prinsloo, 2006). Rathogwa (2006) confirms that rural schools have been historically disadvantaged with limited resources and poor infrastructure. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the perceptions and experiences of educators, Heads of department (HODs) and principals about how they coped with large classes. The study was conducted in three rural primary schools situated in the Inanda Area. The study adopts a qualitative research approach. Within this approach, a case study design was adopted. The data collection methods comprise of observations and semi-structured interviews with educators, HODs and principals. The overall findings of the research show that these schools are faced with a plethora of challenges because of their large classes. The findings show that large classes result in poor achievement levels, poor quality of work and disruptive behaviour amongst the learners. Furthermore the educators are faced with heavy workloads which increase teacher apathy, teacher stress and low teacher morale amongst the educators. The schools attempt many strategies as a means to overcome their challenges. Some schools employ the following strategies: they have a strict code of conduct; they reward appropriate behaviour; they counsel difficult learners, they engage in co-operative learning, they employ qualified staff members and engage in group work. From the data collected, principals motivate staff members by having weekly staff meetings to resolve their staff conflicts. Moreover some schools have more strategies than other schools...|$|R
40|$|Rethinking {{education}} {{in rural areas}} firstly requires reviewing different legislation from a historical perspective and then reconsidering the place of {{education in}} the current rural development debate. To a large extent, rural areas have been neglected in development policies and similarly, the rural dimension of basic education issues, especially in South Africa, has been largely overlooked. Basic facts and figures, as elaborated in this thesis, shed light on the need to devote more attention to rural education. In this thesis, South African legislation in relation to basic education for Black people in rural areas during the colonial period up to the democratic era was investigated. The impact of South African legislation on Black education in rural areas is difficult to unravel and solve overnight since its thinking and practice was consolidated over centuries. However, an attempt was made to determine what the policymakers, mostly White dominated governments who ascribed to segregatory and racial attitudes, did to ensure that different policies enshrined in various legislation impacted negatively on education of people predominantly residing in rural areas. The research affirmed that education of Black people in rural areas was, in most instances negatively impacted by policies of previous White governments. The apartheid government (1948 - 1993) used poor funding strategies to ensure that there were low <b>teacher-pupil</b> <b>ratios</b> and teacher qualifications. Unequal pattern of education spending continued well into the democratic era. This poor funding which impacted negatively on, especially rural schools, made infrastructural provision in rural areas difficult. Even though the democratic government have competitive legislative policies in place, it was concluded that educational policies since 1994 were hastily implemented and insufficient consideration has been given to the contextual realities in South African schooling, particularly in rural areas. Hence the democratic government still need to give grave attention to the issue of education in rural areas. Educational StudiesDED (HISTORY OF EDUCATION...|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the impact of {{educational}} policy on the National Senior Certificate: Pre- 1994 and Post democracy South African case. The qualitative approach was used in this study, and the research findings were based on the analysis of documents. The transition from apartheid education to the present education system in South Africa has not been without challenges. In the past, South African education reflected the fragmented society in which it was based. Outcomes based education (OBE) /Curriculum 2005 (C 2005), since its inception, was riddled with challenges. OBE/C 2005 by its nature is complex. It is not user-friendly for developing countries such as South Africa. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the impact of educational policies on the 2008 National Senior Certificate results. Historical-educational research is undertaken with the view of putting the education phenomenon into proper perspective. Venter (1985) is of the opinion that historical education investigation refers to the systematic placing of historical education variables in the spotlight. The general, continual pedagogical and fundamental problems are accentuated against the multiplicity of historical detail. This then makes historical-educational research an orderly (systematic and controlled) process of knowledge enrichment (Venter & Van Heerden 1989 : 106). The National Senior Certificate was established in terms of National Education Act 27 of 1996. Curriculum 2005 has been described in policy documents as a “paradigm shift” because it represents a radical departure from the previous curriculum in terms of the following: theoretical underpinnings, structure and organisation, teaching and learning process, and assessment (South Africa, Department of Education 1997 : 1). Pre- 1994, the researcher discovered that the education of black people in rural areas in particular and South Africa in general was, in most instances, negatively impacted by policies of the previous government (1948 - 1953). The apartheid government used poor funding models to ensure that there were low <b>teacher-pupil</b> <b>ratios</b> and teacher qualifications were of unequal standard. Unequal pattern of spending continued well into the post- 1994 democratic era. This poor funding model which impacted negatively on rural schools made infrastructural provision in rural areas difficult. Post - 1994 democratic dispensation, the researcher discovered that the government have competitive legislative policies in place, but the challenges lay in the fact that those policies were impulsively implemented. Hence the many challenges. This is shown by the frequency of curriculum changes which took place in a very short space of time. Stakeholders played a major role in insuring that schools received quality service by challenging some of the decisions the government was taking. The government has had to take the recommendations into account. Public Administration and ManagementM. Admin. (Public Administration...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{researchers}} and policymakers {{have studied the}} effects of class size by using student-teacher ratio (or its related inverse, <b>teacher-pupil</b> <b>ratio),</b> but class size is not accurately captured by this metric. As Michael Boozer and Cecilia Rouse explain in “Intraschool Variation in Class Size: Patterns and Implications,” student-teacher ratio gives an imprecise view of class size because teachers may be unevenly distributed across classrooms. [...] Some teachers have light course loads as they are assigned to spend {{most or all of}} their time coaching other teachers. These coaches would nevertheless factor into the calculation of student-teacher ratio. In other classes - say, an inclusion class with special education students - two teachers may jointly teach a class of thirty-four students. Although student-teacher ratio would describe this class’ size as seventeen, these teachers continue to face thirty-four students during instruction. In general, average class size will be larger than student-teacher ratio anytime a school assigns more than one teacher to some classrooms. In poor and urban districts, where schools enroll higher numbers of students needing specialized instruction, student-teacher ratios will therefore be especially imprecise measures of class size.|$|E

Due to data limitations we concentrate on the Anatolian High Schools (AHS) in Istanbul. This choice gives us the opportunity to control for the student quality by making use of the minimum OKS score required for admission to each AHS. Using YGS scores for 2010 & 2011 and OKS scores for 2006 & 2007 corresponding to the same cohort, we find that student quality explains the transition to higher education examination outcomes to a large extent. Holding constant student quality however, we find no evidence that class size or the <b>teacher-pupil</b> <b>ratio</b> affects average YGS score of AHS. This {{can be explained by the}} relatively standardized school resources devoted to AHS. The results are robust to different scorings of YGS and to the inclusion of clustering...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings of}} a study that {{examined the relationship between}} the performance (as measured by test results) of pupils in classrooms with fall-time teacher aides. The Student Teacher Achievement Ratio project (STAR) was implemented in Tennessee from 1985 through 1989 to study the effects of class size on student achievement and development in grades K- 3. Data for this paper were derived from an analysis of data from Project STAR and its derivative studies. Project STAR compared the results of three situations: (1) small classes with a 1 : 15 <b>teacher-pupil</b> <b>ratio</b> (S condition); (2) regular classes with a 1 : 24 <b>teacher-pupil</b> <b>ratio</b> (R condition); and (3) regular classes with a full-time teacher aide (RA condition). In nearly all comparisons, the small classes had the. highest student test outcomes, followed by regular-sized classes with aides and regular-sized classes. However, pupils who were retained a grade before entering the STAR program benefitted most in their test scores from the RA condition and often least from the S condition. Implications are that retention fails to help students improve test outcomes and that small-class intervention does not remedy already-defined test-score deficits after students have experienced regular classes. Thirteen tables and an appendix containing statistical data are included. (LMI) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the original document...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the Grade Point Average (GPA) {{of more than}} 5, 000 undergraduates at the University of California, San Diego. Personal background strongly affects GPA. Graduates of different high schools obtain significantly different GPAs, even after controlling for personal background. These school effects in part reflect the incidence of poverty {{and the level of}} education among adults in the school neighborhood. Teachers' experience in the student's high school bears a positive and significant link to the student's university GPA, but the effect is small. No such positive link with GPA emerged for the <b>teacher-pupil</b> <b>ratio</b> or teachers' level of education. ...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we report}} {{the results of}} an {{empirical}} study of the impact of school inputs on pupils` performance in private (independent) schools in the United Kingdom. We use a new school-level panel dataset constructed from information provided by the Independent Schools Information Service (ISIS). We show a consistent negative relationship between the pupil-teacher ratio at a school and the average examination results at that school. Our estimates indicate that the relationship persists even when we are estimating added-value models conditional on previous exam results. The results are noteworthy in comparison with studies for the state sector, relatively few of which have found a consistent and significant effect. school resources, exam performance, <b>teacher-pupil</b> <b>ratio,</b> private schools...|$|E
