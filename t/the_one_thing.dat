5|$|In 1898, Bresslau met {{her future}} husband, Albert Schweitzer at a wedding. Shortly thereafter, they {{developed}} a relationship that included separation, independence, and non-exclusive behaviors. This allowed both to develop their lives while enjoying each other's companionship, conversation, and virtues. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that united the pair was their shared ideology: {{to take care of}} others.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he has {{a powerful}} pen, and when he chooses can use expressive English. He evidently strives {{to be fair to}} friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he is much like many others in this respect. Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life and soul, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> for which he lives.|$|E
5|$|While on a {{shopping}} {{trip to the}} Springfield Mall, Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water fountain and reaches in to grab it (fearing Ralph might take it) and falls in. The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping his every move. At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010 series Lost Girl, {{there was}} a Norn who could be petitioned to change fate, for a price. Her price was always <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> her {{petitioner}} values most, whether they realize it or not.|$|E
25|$|There is also Agnes’s fear {{of going}} insane and {{her fear of}} confrontation; Tobias’s fear of having another child; Julia’s fear of growing up and her fear of being {{displaced}} in her parents’ lives; and Claire’s fear of life and her fear of love, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that she desperately wants.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1910, Foster {{started talking about}} {{reviving}} {{the concept of an}} all-black league. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he was insistent upon was that black teams should be owned by black men. This put him in direct competition with Strong. After 1910, Foster renamed his team the Chicago American Giants to appeal to a larger fan base. During the same year, J. L. Wilkinson started the All Nations traveling team. The All Nations team would eventually become one of the best-known and popular teams of the Negro leagues, the Kansas City Monarchs.|$|E

25|$|Going back {{to those}} studio days for me and John Paul Jones, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> you didn't do was speed up, because if you sped up you wouldn't be seen again. Everything had to be right on the meter all the way through. And I really wanted to write {{something}} which did speed up, and took the emotion and the adrenaline with it, and would reach a sort of crescendo. And that {{was the idea of}} it. That's why it was a bit tricky to get together in stages.|$|E
25|$|Obviously {{it was one}} {{of those}} things that {{reinforce}} that I can't have alcohol. I got away from <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that kept me on the straight and narrow and that was my relationship with the Lord. That should always come first. Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, I have not had another thought like that. I know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E

She further said that “What happened cost and I was the one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E

In the mean time Princess Esma Sultan carefully arranged the training and education of Perestu.
