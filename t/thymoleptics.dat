40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that <b>thymoleptics</b> of the Imipramine type owe their anti-depressant activity to a blockade of a mechanism {{in the brain}} which usually is called the membrane pump. This is an active transport mechanism by which biogenic amines, released from nerve endings, are taken up again into the nerve terminals. Evidence for such a mem brane pump blocking effect by Imipramine and related drugs was first obtained in peri pheral sympathetic nerves. Sigg and co workers reported in 1959 that Imipramine and related drugs potentiated the effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation and of admini stered noradrenaline (Sigg 1959 and Sigg...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: Olanzapine is an {{atypical}} {{antipsychotic drug}} {{with a more}} favourable safety profile than typical antipsychotics with a hitherto unknown topographic quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) profile. OBJECTIVES: We investigated electrical brain activity (QEEG and cognitive event related potentials, ERPs) in healthy subjects who received olanzapine. METHODS: Vigilance-controlled, 19 -channel EEG and ERP in an auditory odd-ball paradigm were recorded before and 3 h, 6 h and 9 h after administration of either a single dose of placebo or olanzapine (2. 5 mg and 5 mg) in ten healthy subjects. QEEG was analysed by spectral analysis and evaluated in nine frequency bands. For the P 300 component in the odd-ball ERP, the amplitude and latency was analysed. Statistical effects were tested using a repeated-measurement analysis of variance. RESULTS: For the interaction between time and treatment, significant effects were observed for theta, alpha- 2, beta- 2 and beta- 4 frequency bands. The amplitude of the activity in the theta band increased most significantly 6 h after the 5 -mg administration of olanzapine. A pronounced decrease of the alpha- 2 activity especially 9 h after 5 mg olanzapine administration could be observed. In most beta frequency bands, and most significantly in the beta- 4 band, a dose-dependent decrease of the activity beginning 6 h after drug administration was demonstrated. Topographic effects could be observed for the beta- 2 band (occipital decrease) and a tendency for the alpha- 2 band (frontal increase and occipital decrease), both indicating a frontal shift of brain electrical activity. There were no significant changes in P 300 amplitude or latency after drug administration. Conclusion: QEEG alterations after olanzapine administration were similar to EEG effects gained by other atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as clozapine. The increase of theta activity {{is comparable to the}} frequency distribution observed for <b>thymoleptics</b> or antipsychotics for which treatment-emergent somnolence is commonly observed, whereas the decrease of beta activity observed after olanzapine administration is not characteristic for these drugs. There were no clear signs for an increased cerebral excitability after a single-dose administration of 2. 5 mg and 5 mg olanzapine in healthy controls...|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} distinction most {{predictive of}} response to pharmacological treatment, according to available controlled studies, is between mood disorders with psychotic features and disorders in which psychosis persists {{in the absence of}} mood syndromes The treatment of acute mania and schizophrenia overlap considerably in terms of the typical and atypical neuroleptics, but begin to diverge with the recognized mood stabilizers for bipolar affective illness lithium, carbamazepine, and valproate which are substantially less effective in schizophrenia than in affective illness. Polypharmacy is a critical issue in the treatment of schizophrenia. Citrome et al. [1] reported that 43. 4 % of the inpatients diagnosed as having schizophrenia received a mood stabilizer. There are few controlled studies of the newer <b>thymoleptic</b> agents such as sodium valproate or of the newer antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients.

5000|$|Benzedrine is a {{trade name}} for amphetamine. The Council of Europe says it first {{appeared}} in sport at the Berlin Olympics in 1936. It was produced in 1887 and the derivative, Benzedrine, was isolated in the U.S. in 1934 by Gordon Alles. Its perceived effects gave it the street name [...] "speed". British troops used 72 million amphetamine tablets in the Second World War [...] and the RAF got through so many that [...] "Methedrine won the Battle of Britain" [...] according to one report. The problem was that amphetamine leads {{to a lack of}} judgement and a willingness to take risks, which in sport could lead to better performances but in fighters and bombers led to more crash landings than the RAF could tolerate. The drug was withdrawn but large stocks remained on the black market. Amphetamine was also used legally as an aid to slimming and also as a <b>thymoleptic</b> before being phased out by the appearance of newer agents in the 1950s.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{progress}} of positron emission tomography (PET) {{as a tool for}} understanding the psychobiology of mood disorders, particularly major depression and bipolar disorder. Method: Review of the literature on functional imaging of mood disorders. Results: Functional imaging techniques have been used in psychiatric research as a noninvasive method to study the behaviour and function of the brain. Techniques used so far have involved the manipulation of emotion in healthy volunteers, the evaluation of depressed (unipolar and bipolar as well as secondary depression), manic, and normal subjects under resting and various activation conditions, such as cognitive activation, acute pharmacological challenge, and chronic <b>thymoleptic</b> treatments. As a result, functional imaging studies tend to support abnormalities in specific frontal and limbic regions. Conclusion: Different PET methods demonstrate consistent abnormalities in the prefrontal, cingulate, and amygdala regions. These findings are in agreement with past animal and clinical anatomical correlates of mood and emotions.

40|$|Objectives: To {{report on}} the design, {{significance}} and potential impacts of the first documented human clinical trial assessing the anxiolytic and <b>thymoleptic</b> efficacy of an aqueous monoextract of Piper methysticum (kava). The significance of the qualitative element of our clinical trial is also explored. The Kava Anxiety Depression Spectrum Study (KADSS) is a 3 -week placebocontrolled, double-blind, cross-over trial involving 60 adult participants (18 — 65) with elevated stable anxiety and varying levels of depressive symptoms. Aims: The aims of KADSS are: (1) to determine whether an aqueous standardised extract of kava is effective {{for the treatment of}} anxiety; (2) to assess the effects of kava on differing levels of depression; and (3) to explore participants’ experience of taking kava via qualitative research. The study also provides preliminary assessment of the safety of an aqueous extract of kava in humans. Conclusion: If results reveal that the aqueous kava preparation exerts significant anxiolytic effects and appears safe, potentially beneficial impacts may occur. Data supporting a safe and effective kava extract may encourage a re-introduction of kava to Europe, UK and Canada. This may provide a major socioeconomic benefit to Pacific Island nations, and to sufferers of anxiety disorders...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{adolescents}} {{or young}} adults (aged 16 to 22 years) who met DSM-III-R criteria for bipolar disorder were treated for persistent depressive symptoms (greater than three weeks) with adjunctive light therapy (10, 000 lux given twice per day). Patients were evaluated using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Symptoms Check List (SCL- 58). Three patients showed a marked response of greater than 70 % decrease of their baseline score. Two patients had a moderate decrease (40 % to 74 %) and two patients obtained mild to no response. There were no reported side-effects. Paired t-tests done on pre- and post-BDI scores (pre mean = 21. 2 sd +/- 10. 0; post mean = 11. 1, sd +/- 8. 8; paired t = 4. 31; p > 0. 0051) and pre- and post-SCL- 58 scores above baseline of 58 (pre mean = 57. 4, sd +/- 24. 4; post mean = 28. 7, sd +/- 18. 6; paired t = 5. 50; p > 0. 0015) showed significant improvement.

40|$|Rationale: Kava (Piper methysticum) is a psychotropic plant {{medicine}} {{with history}} {{of cultural and}} medicinal use. We conducted a study comparing the acute neurocognitive, anxiolytic, and <b>thymoleptic</b> effects of a medicinal dose of kava to a benzodiazepine and explored {{for the first time}} specific genetic polymorphisms, which may affect the psychotropic activity of phytomedicines or benzodiazepines. Methods: Twenty-two moderately anxious adults aged between 18 and 65 years were randomized to receive an acute dose of kava (180 mg of kavalactones), oxazepam (30 mg), and placebo 1 week apart in a crossover design trial. Results: After exposure to cognitive tasks, a significant interaction was revealed between conditions on State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State anxiety (p= 0. 046, partial {eng} 2 = 0. 14). In the oxazepam condition, there was a significant reduction in anxiety (p= 0. 035), whereas there was no change in anxiety in the kava condition, and there was an increase in anxiety in the placebo condition. An increase in Bond-Lader 'calmness' (p= 0. 002) also occurred for the oxazepam condition. Kava was found to have no negative effect on cognition, whereas a reduction in alertness (p< 0. 001) occurred in the oxazepam condition. Genetic analyses provide tentative evidence that noradrenaline (SLC 6 A 2) transporter polymorphisms may have an effect on response to kava. Conclusion: Acute 'medicinal level' doses of this particular kava cultivar in naive users do not provide anxiolytic activity, although the phytomedicine also appears to have no negative effects on cognition...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The Treatment of Early Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Study is a {{publicly}} funded clinical trial designed {{to compare the}} therapeutic benefits, safety, and tolerability of risperidone, olanzapine, and molindone in youths with early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The rationale, design, and methods of the Treatment of Early Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Study are described. METHOD: Using a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design at four sites, youths with EOSS (ages 8 - 19 years) were assigned to an 8 -week acute trial of risperidone (0. 5 - 6. 0 mg/day), olanzapine (2. 5 - 20 mg/day), or molindone (10 - 140 mg/day). Responders continued double-blind treatment for 44 weeks. The primary outcome measure was responder status at 8 weeks, defined by a 20 % reduction in baseline Positive and Negative Symptom Scale scores plus ratings of significant improvement on the Clinical Global Impressions. Secondary outcome measures included assessments of psychopathology, functional impairment, quality of life, and medication safety. An intent-to-treat analytic plan was used. RESULTS: From February 2002 to May 2006, 476 youths were screened, 173 were further evaluated, and 119 were randomized. Several significant study modifications were required to address safety, the use of adjunctive medications, and the termination of the olanzapine treatment arm due to weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: The Treatment of Early Onset Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Study will inform clinical practice {{regarding the use of}} antipsychotic medications for youths with early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Important safety concerns emerged during the study, including higher than anticipated rates of suicidality and problems tapering <b>thymoleptic</b> agents before randomization...|$|R
40|$|The <b>thymoleptic</b> drug {{citalopram}} (CIT) {{belongs to}} the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is today extensively used in psychiatry. Further clarification of the enantiomer-selective distribution of racemic CIT in both clinical and toxic doses is highly warranted. By a steady-state in vivo paradigm, rats underwent chronic systemic exposure for 10 days by using osmotic pumps and the total {{as well as the}} individual distributions of the S- and R-enantiomers of CIT, and its metabolites in serum and two different brain regions, were analysed. In serum, the S/R ratios in the groups treated with 10, 20, or 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 day− 1 were 0. 94, 0. 83, and 0. 34, respectively. The ratios were almost the same in the brain regions. In the group treated with 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 day− 1, the serum and brain total CIT levels were found to be 20 times and 6 [*]–[*] 8 times higher than in the rats treated with 10 or 20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 day− 1, respectively. In all groups, the CIT levels were higher in brain tissue as compared to serum. In a spontaneous open-field behavioural test, a correlation between clinical and toxic drug concentrations was observed. In conclusion, the R-enantiomer was present in an increased proportion compared with the S-enantiomer when higher steady-state CIT concentration was prevailing. This is of particular interest, since the S-enantiomer is responsible for the inhibition of serotonin reuptake in vitro. The present data may be of importance, as full understanding on where different racemic or enantiomeric drug effects of CIT and its main metabolites are unravelled...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{response}} of 62 outpatients with DSM-IV bipolar disorders to open-label adjunctive zonisamide was evaluated in a prospective 8 -week acute trial, {{followed by a}} 48 -week continuation trial, conducted from June 2001 through May 2002. Method: During the acute trial, response to zonisamide was assessed weekly for the first 4 weeks and every 2 weeks for the second 4 weeks with the Clinical Global Impressions scale modified for bipolar illness (CGI-BP), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and the Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology (IDS). During the continuation trial, patients were assessed with these scales every 4 weeks. Patients' weights and side effects were also evaluated. Outcome measures were analyzed with repeated-measures analyses of variance. Results: Patients with manic symptoms at study entry (N = 34) displayed significant reductions in CGI-BP-Mania Severity and YMRS scores in the acute and continuation (N = 19) trials (p values <. 0001 and <. 001, respectively). Patients with depressive symptoms at study entry (N = 22) showed significant decreases in CGI-BP-Depression Severity and IDS scores in the acute trial (p values <. 001 and <. 05, respectively), but only 9 patients entered the continuation trial. Among these 9 patients, maintenance of antidepressant response was mostly maintained. Initially euthymic patients (N = 6) showed no change in any rating scale scores acutely, but 2 of 4 patients who entered the continuation trial developed depressive symptoms. The 62 patients as a group showed significant weight loss in both trials (p values <. 001). However, 20 patients (32 %) discontinued zonisamide for worsening mood symptoms. Conclusion: Adjunctive zonisamide was associated with beneficial effects on mood and body weight in some patients with bipolar disorders, but was also associated with a high discontinuation rate due to worsening mood symptoms. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are necessary to determine zonisamide's <b>thymoleptic</b> properties, if any, in bipolar disorders...|$|R
