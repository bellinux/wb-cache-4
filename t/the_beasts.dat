5|$|Brought to Constantinople, Xiphias was tonsured and banished to Antigone, {{one of the}} Princes Islands. Following {{his return}} to the capital after his Georgian expedition, Basil II had most of his co-conspirators imprisoned and their estates confiscated. The patrikios Pherses the Iberian was executed, while two {{imperial}} chamberlains were also killed: one by Basil's own hand, and the other, who had tried to poison the Emperor, was thrown to <b>the</b> <b>beasts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Constantine's {{share of}} the Empire {{consisted}} of Britain, Gaul, and Spain. He therefore commanded {{one of the largest}} Roman armies, stationed along the important Rhine frontier. After his promotion to emperor, Constantine remained in Britain, driving back the tribes of the Picts and secured his control in the northwestern dioceses. He completed the reconstruction of military bases begun under his father's rule, and ordered the repair of the region's roadways. He soon left for Augusta Treverorum (Trier) in Gaul, the Tetrarchic capital of the northwestern Roman Empire. The Franks, after learning of Constantine's acclamation, invaded Gaul across the lower Rhine over the winter of 306–307AD. Constantine drove them back beyond the Rhine and captured two of their kings, Ascaric and Merogaisus. The kings and their soldiers were fed to <b>the</b> <b>beasts</b> of Trier's amphitheater in the adventus (arrival) celebrations that followed.|$|E
5|$|In this {{relatively}} liberal environment Jan accompanied the servants in their work, {{listening to their}} stories, learning {{the ways of the}} countryside, and trying to help as best he could. As his knowledge and confidence increased Jan began {{to go out into the}} countryside by himself, exploring the hills and valleys which surrounded him. Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd — first of the pigs and poultry in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect; Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the natural increase of <b>the</b> <b>beasts</b> under their care. As time passed Jan gradually built up a respectable holding of livestock.|$|E

5|$|Lions {{continue}} to be featured in modern literature, from the messianic Aslan in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and following books from The Chronicles of Narnia series written by C. S. Lewis, to the comedic Cowardly Lion in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The advent of moving pictures saw the continued presence of lion symbolism; {{one of the most}} iconic and widely recognised lions is Leo the Lion, which has been the mascot for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios since the 1920s. The 1960s saw the appearance of what is possibly the most famous lioness, the Kenyan animal Elsa in the movie Born Free, based on the true-life book of the same title. The lion's role as king of <b>the</b> <b>beasts</b> has been used in cartoons, such as the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} also {{nominated}} for Best Picture and Best Sound. It {{was the first}} animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture, and remained the only animated film nominated until 2009 when the Best Picture field was widened to ten nominees, and it remains the only animated film nominated for the award when it had five nominees. It became the first musical in twelve years to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture of the Year, following All That Jazz (1979), {{and the last one}} to be nominated until Moulin Rouge! (2001), ten years later. It lost the Best Picture award to The Silence of the Lambs. With six nominations, the film currently shares the record for the most nominations for an animated film with WALL-E (2008), although, with three nominations in the Best Original Song category, Beauty and <b>the</b> <b>Beasts</b> nominations span only four categories, while WALL-Es nominations cover six individual categories.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Alcmaeon of Croton in Magna Grecia, first {{considered}} the brain to be {{the seat of the}} mind. Also in {{the fifth century}} BC in Athens, Hippocrates believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence. Aristotle, in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence, and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than <b>the</b> <b>beasts</b> because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness. Aristotle did describe the meninges and distinguished between the cerebrum and cerebellum. Herophilus of Chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries BC distinguished the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and provided the first clear description of the ventricles; and with Erasistratus of Ceos experimented on living brains. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources. Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their deaths. Anatomist physician Galen in the second century AD, {{during the time of the}} Roman Empire, dissected the brains of sheep, monkeys, dogs, and pigs. He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the cerebrum was soft, it must be where the senses were processed. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles.|$|E

25|$|In this view, {{the beast}} {{from the sea}} is {{interpreted}} as the state or any human kingdom that is in opposition to God. This would include the Roman Empire but would broadly apply to all empires. Scholars take their cue from the parallels between Revelation 13 and Daniel 7, noting that in Daniel 7:17 that <b>the</b> <b>beasts</b> are revealed as kingdoms. Therefore, given that the beast of Revelation thirteen is a composite of <b>the</b> <b>beasts</b> of Daniel, one should similarly interpret this beast as a kingdom, more specifically a composite of all kingdoms. Similarly, in some idealist circles, {{it is suggested that}} the beast represents different social injustices, such as exploitation of workers, wealth, the elite, commerce, materialism, and imperialism. Various Christian anarchists, such as Jacques Ellul, have associated the State and political power as the beast.|$|E

The cat roars loudly and Badger arrives, asking <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> to take him instead of Mossy. <b>The</b> <b>Beast</b> tells <b>the</b> animals he could easily slay them all, but just then they all hear the loud cry of another cat in the distance. The two cats call {{to each other and}} <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> rushes out of the park to join the female that was calling to him. The animals realize that spring must be the mating season for <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> and celebrate that <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> has finally left the park.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the final}} {{confrontation}} between Batman and <b>the</b> <b>Beast,</b> C.I.A.

25|$|Incan culture {{involved}} the alpaca, {{as well as}} llamas and guanacos, in ritual sacrifice.

50|$|Jimmy and Enrique flee {{to a small}} cave with <b>the</b> <b>Beast</b> in pursuit.
