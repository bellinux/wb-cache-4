30|$|To {{quantify}} {{the overall effect}} of various parameters on the alignment of fibres, the <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> was determined according to Eq. (4). It {{can be seen that}} the series reinforced with long fibres (60  mm) had somewhat higher <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> than short fibres (35  mm), for both fibre content and range from 0.610 to 0.776 (see Table  6). The {{reason for this is that}} the short fibres more likely rotate through the flow of fresh materials and result in lower alignment in the direction of flow. As it can be seen from Table  6 no clear relationship between <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> and fibre content can be found. However, the scatter of the <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> values was rather low. Once again this could be related to constant casting procedure. Therefore, it can be inferred that through the casting in flow method, the orientation of long fibres could be controlled at a very satisfactory level in laboratory conditions.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{calculation}} method is explained {{to predict the}} total number of fibres crossing a rectangular section. The largest part of the paper deals with the theoretical calculation of an <b>orientation</b> <b>factor.</b> The <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> is defined here as the average length of the projection on the longitudinal axis of all fibres crossing a section, divided by the fibre length. Once the <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> is found, a simple calculation gives the number of fibres crossing a crack. Since the proposed approach is to a large extent new, {{there is a need for}} verification with test results. For this reason a fibre counting was done on 107 Rilem beam specimens, involving different fibre types.

A rectangular steel fibre reinforced beam and a conventionally reinforced I-beam have also been tested for comparison. The concrete used is a self-compacting concrete with a B 45 classification. The concrete contains 1 %vol (78, 5 kg/m 3) steel fibres with end-hooks of type Dramix 3 D 65 / 60. The load-deflection and load-shear crack opening response has been analysed for all beams and been compared with each other. A fibre count has also been conducted to investigate the influence the element size has on the fibre orientation. The results have been compared with guidelines from COIN and Model Code based on residual flexural tensile strengths from small beam tests according to NS-EN 14651. The report also gives an introduction of steel fibre reinforced concrete and design guidelines used to estimate the shear capacity. The results show that steel fibres {{have a significant effect}} on the shear capacity. All beams had more capacity than expected based on calculations made prior to testing. The ultimate shear capacity seems to be higher for I-beams than rectangular beams. A high fibre <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> in the longitudinal direction is found in the web in all beams, though a low representation of fibres around the tensile reinforcement.

However, because lipids are intrinsically nonfluorescent, fluorescence studies of membranes depend {{on the use of}} extrinsic probes, whose properties and behavior inside the bilayer are often poorly understood.

Its theoretical value for the socalled dynamic isotropic limit is usually used(2 / 3), but this approximation is debatable because of the intrinsic anisotropic nature of bilayers.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{intrinsic}} polarized fluorescence {{to calculate the}} <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> in the amorphous regions of polymer fibers will be investigated {{with the help of}} computer simulations to test the limits of this procedure. For that a computer program was developed to simulate the fluorescence experiment. At first a model, which describes the order of the molecules in an oriented, not crystalline fiber, was formed and implemented in MatLab. On the basis of a given <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> or given moments P 2 and P 4 a fitting ''most probable'' orientation distribution function was determined. Subsequently a group of unit vectors was calculated, which were aligned according to this orientation distribution function. At higher spinning speed (for PET between 3500 and 4000 m/min) the molecular deformation and orientation induces crystallisation in the preoriented amorphous phase. So the fiber model consisting of a group of orientation vectors had to be extended {{in such a way that}} the formation of crystallites could be calculated. The developed simulation program works on the basis of these calculated models. It simulates the fluorescence experiments and the measurement of the fluorescence radiation and calculates the <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> with the method of polarized intrinsic fluorescence. The results can be compared with the input values. All calculations and diagrams are realized by Matlab-functions. The graphical user interface is a Visual C++ program, which enables the user to input, change and save data in the in windows usual way. To carry out simulations matching with measured data of real experiments, it was necessary to calculate models with the same parameters for total orientation, crystallity and crystalline orientation like real fiber samples with known spinning speed and draw ratio. With these models the fluorescence experiment was simulated and the <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> was calculated from the results of the simulation and compared with the equivalent value measured in experiments with real fibers.

Most of the applications require self-localization of the mobile device.

On the other hand, self-localization method using images have been developed, and the accuracy of the method is increasing. This paper develops the self-localization method by integrating sensors, such as POS and cameras, on mobile devices simultaneously.

Many transactions, such as real-time multimedia and audio-video transmission have strict demand for QoS parameters, which requires that we find a QoS routing in multi-constrained conditions. Generally, multiconstrained QoS routing is an NP-Complete problem. The drawbacks of the ad hoc network—poor quality of network links, frequent topology change and low capacity, make it more complicated for the QoS guarantee because the time and information needed for the algorithm to search path is relatively limited. We propose a modified ant colony algorithm based on the <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> to solve multi-constrained QoS routing problem by recurring to GPS location.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The {{establishment}} of any thermal model of reactor fuel requires {{a thorough understanding}} of the behavior of the thermal conductivity. This is especially true in the case of sphere pac fuels where the conductivity is a function of many variables beyond those normally affecting conventional fuels. One of these variables, packing density, is not fully accounted for in present unit cell models of thermal conductivity. In this thesis, a method has been developed whereby the effect of packing density and its importance can be evaluated for any type of unit cell. The effect of packing density is due to the random orientation of the unit cells in the bed with respect to heat flow. The calculation of the "cell orientation effect" must therefore account for each cell in the packing. This requirement resulted {{in the development of the}} RANDPAC code - a Monte Carlo program for simulating the packing of spheres in a cylinder. RANDPAC generates and provides detailed information concerning the location and coordination of every sphere in a random cylindrical bed. By coupling this information with data pertinent to the characterization of the unit cells in the bed, the effective conductivity of the bed relative to the unit cell conductivity (the cell <b>orientation</b> <b>factor)</b> can be evaluated. This procedure is carried out by the ORIENT code. Evaluation of the <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> for a unit cell currently in use has shown that packing density has a significant effect which cannot be ignored in modeling sphere pac fuels. Additionally, the variation of the <b>orientation</b> <b>factor</b> is seen to be strongly dependent on both cell geometry and the variation of cell geometry with changes in packing factor. Further improvements need to be made to the RANDPAC code to allow these dependencies to be better quantified...|$|R
