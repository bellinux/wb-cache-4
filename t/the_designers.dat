40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{recognizing}} design targets. We looked into {{the origin of the}} design process and found that stimulating <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> to feel discomforts can help <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> identify design targets. In other words, we propose extroverted (to receive stimulation from the external surroundings), non-verbal (not expressed with words), and pseudo-discomforting (to give <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> anxiety) stimulators (to make <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> excite internally) for recognizing design targets, and we confirmed the effect through design education and product design...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{studies the}} {{interaction}} between a designer {{and a group of}} strategic and self-interested users who possess information <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> does not have. Because the users are strategic and self-interested, they will act to their own advantage, which will often be different from the interest of <b>the</b> <b>designer,</b> even if <b>the</b> latter is benevolent and seeks to maximize (some measure of) social welfare. In the settings we consider, <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> and <b>the</b> users can communicate (perhaps with noise), <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> can observe <b>the</b> actions of the users (perhaps with error) and <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> can commit to (plans of) actions – interventions – of its own. <b>The</b> <b>designer’s</b> problem is to construct and implement a mechanism that provides incentives for the users to communicate and act {{in such a way as}} to further the interest of <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> – despite <b>the</b> fact that they are strategic and self-interested and possess private information. To address <b>the</b> <b>designer’s</b> problem we propose a general and flexible framework that applies to many scenarios. To illustrate the usefulness of this framework, we discuss some simple examples, leaving further applications to other papers. In an important class of environments, we find conditions under which <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> can obtain its benchmark optimum – the utility that could be obtained if it had all information and could command the actions of the users – and conditions under which it cannot. More broadly we are able to characterize the solution to <b>the</b> <b>designer’s</b> problem, even when it does not yield the benchmark optimum. Because the optimal mechanism may be difficult to construct and implement, we also propose a simpler and more readily implemented mechanism that, while falling short of the optimum, still yields <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> a “good ” result...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} Source engine, <b>the</b> <b>designers</b> found that the game's scope exceeded their resources. Bloodlines has several styles of gameplay, requiring different interfaces, animations and artificial intelligence for stealth and melee combat, and first- or third-person capability. Compared to contemporary first-person shooters, with 10 to 20 animated character models, Bloodlines had over 150 characters with 3,000 unique animations, in {{addition to}} boss characters, with their own styles of movement. <b>The</b> <b>designers</b> underestimated {{the length of time}} required to develop and improve these systems. The game's scope suffered from content not being removed when necessary; other components would be endlessly refined without being finalized, preventing the developers from focusing on other parts of the game system. All content additionally required approval by White Wolf and Activision.|$|E

"For human artifacts, we know <b>the</b> <b>designer's</b> identity, human, and the {{mechanism}} of design, as we have experience based upon empirical evidence that humans can make such things, {{as well as many}} other attributes including <b>the</b> <b>designer's</b> abilities, needs, and desires. With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on <b>the</b> <b>designer's</b> identity, do not propose a mechanism, and <b>the</b> <b>designer,</b> he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed {{that in the case of}} human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of <b>the</b> human <b>designer,</b> but we do not know any of those attributes for <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> of biological life.

Therefore, equivalent patience and culture of the mind are required in order to reach the area of the skill. In this study, it was developed of design support system with the mechanism which promotes the improvement in the design workmanship of <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> and new concept.

5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by <b>the</b> <b>designers</b> to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by <b>the</b> <b>designers.</b> To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} improvement and expansion of the assistance given to <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> by <b>the</b> computer in the design of cold formed sections. The main contributions have been in four areas, which have consequently led to the fifth, the development of a methodology to optimise designs. This methodology can be considered an `Expert Design System' for cold formed sections. A different method of determining section properties of profiles was introduced, using the properties of line and circular elements. Graphics were introduced to show the outline of the profile on screen. The analysis of beam loading has been expanded to beam loading conditions where the number of supports, point loads, and uniform distributive loads can be specified by <b>the</b> <b>designer.</b> <b>The</b> profile can then be checked for suitability for the specified type of loading. Artificial Intelligence concepts have been introduced to give <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> decision support from the computer, in combination with the computer aided design facilities. The more complex decision support was adopted through the use of production rules. All the support was based on the British standards. A method has been introduced, by which the appropriate use of stiffeners can be determined and consequently designed by <b>the</b> <b>designer.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> methodology by which <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> is given assistance from the computer, without constraining <b>the</b> <b>designer,</b> was developed. This methodology gives advice to <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> on possible methods of improving the design, but allows <b>the</b> <b>designer</b> to reject that option, and analyse the profile accordingly. The methodology enables optimisation to be achieved by <b>the</b> <b>designer,</b> designing variety of profiles for a particular loading, and determining which one is best suited...|$|R
