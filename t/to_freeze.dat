5|$|Cubzac's {{climate is}} oceanic, {{part of the}} Dfb group in the Köppen climate classification. Periodically, the river Dordogne causes flooding. Nowadays Cubzac is {{protected}} by a dam, but is still vulnerable to flooding during high tides and strong winds. Flooding occurred last in the 1999 Martin and 2010 Xynthia storms. The 1999 storm destroyed many trees from the Terrefort castle park. In 1708, a temperature extremum of -15°C caused the river and vineyards <b>to</b> <b>freeze.</b>|$|E

5|$|A mercury–thallium alloy, {{which forms}} a {{eutectic}} at 8.5% thallium, is reported <b>to</b> <b>freeze</b> at−60°C, some 20°C below the freezing point of mercury. This alloy {{is used in}} thermometers and low-temperature switches. In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones and olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble thallium salts are added to gold plating baths {{to increase the speed}} of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins <b>to</b> <b>freeze,</b> American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E

5|$|In his youth, McLachlan {{was an avid}} cyclist, accrediting this to {{the fact}} that his home town Vancouver was not cold enough for ponds <b>to</b> <b>freeze</b> over to play ice hockey on. During his teenage years, he trained upwards of six hours a day, and won several {{national}} championships in the sport. He qualified to represent Canada in the 1976 Summer Olympics, but the lack of funding for cycling in North America at the time would have necessitated him funding his own journey and leaving school to do so; McLachlan opted instead to remain in education and focus on his interest in photography.|$|E
5|$|Not all ticks in an infective {{area are}} {{infected}} with pathogens, and both attachment of the tick and a long-feeding session seem to be necessary for transmission of these diseases to take place. Thus tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours. Adult ticks can be removed with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, disinfecting the wound. It is also possible <b>to</b> <b>freeze</b> them off with a medical wart remover. If the tick's head and mouthparts break off during removal, they can be removed with tweezers like a splinter.|$|E

The latter two, however, were unimpressed {{with the}} long-range variant, preferring a shorter-range aircraft, which was {{better suited to}} their route structure. Singapore Airlines was also an expected customer because it {{was looking for a}} replacement for the A310. Airbus intended <b>to</b> <b>freeze</b> the design in late 2001, with the first flight scheduled for the third quarter of 2003 and entry into service within a year.

5|$|The {{drive to}} capture wildlife, and {{particularly}} slow lorises, is increasingly dominated by demands from wealthy urban areas, replacing the subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas. In {{the case of}} long-lived primates, such as the slow lorises, populations replenish themselves slowly. Slow lorises are particularly vulnerable because they tend <b>to</b> <b>freeze</b> when spotted. Lastly, increased access to new technologies, such as improved transport, guns, wire snares, and spotlights, have facilitated hunting and pushed extraction levels beyond the point of sustainability. These new factors threaten slow loris survival.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{was that the}} silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm <b>to</b> <b>freeze,</b> disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this {{hypothesis was}} incorrect. It was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, researchers found that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury's successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation.|$|E
5|$|While Finn distracts her, the Ice King {{uses his}} ice powers <b>to</b> <b>freeze</b> Bubblegum.

However, there are not enough pieces to complete her, and so she ends up reverting to a 13-year-old girl. Finn, who is also 13, is excited, but the Ice King temporarily gives up his pursuit of Bubblegum due to her age. As the episode ends, it is revealed that the Lich has once again possessed the body of the snail, who angrily waves goodbye to the camera.|$|E

40|$|This study {{concerned}} the response <b>to</b> <b>freezing</b> of Neurospora crassa conidia in four different states: air-dry, hydrated in water, hydrated in Vogel medium lacking only sucrose, or hydrated in complete Vogel medium. All hydrated conidia were incubated {{in one of}} the above media for various times before freezing and were then washed and frozen in distilled water. Viability was estimated by three techniques, and the agreement among them was good. Hydration of air-dry conidia was found to be very rapid and, once hydrated, the conidia were much more sensitive <b>to</b> rapid <b>freezing</b> than they were before hydration. Rapidly cooled conidia survived <b>freezing</b> <b>to</b> a much higher extent when the warming rate was rapid than when it was slow; slowly cooled conidia showed little or no dependence on the warming rate. This sensitivity to rapid cooling and slow warming was attributed to the effects of intracellular ice. The sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>freezing</b> could be reversed by dehydrating the conidia in vacuo before freezing; thus, it was concluded that {{the presence or absence of}} water is the determining factor in the initial sensitivity due <b>to</b> <b>freezing.</b> In water, the sensitivity remained constant from 2 min to 15 days after hydration. Although conidia hydrated in growth medium lacking sucrose remained metabolically inactive, their sensitivity <b>to</b> rapid <b>freezing</b> decreased as a function of time in the medium before freezing. The reason for this decreased sensitivity is not understood. Conidia hydrated in complete growth medium (i. e., containing sucrose) became metabolically active and, after the initial sensitivity associated with hydration, became increasingly more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>freezing</b> as a function of their time in the medium. Drying itself was deleterious to metabolically active conidia, and those that survived dehydration did not exhibit a large absolute increase in resistance <b>to</b> subsequent <b>freezing.</b> The increase in sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>freezing</b> and <b>to</b> drying seems associated with the presence of metabolic activity; however, the precise cause of the sensitization remains obscure...|$|R
40|$|Background: Tropical alpine plants {{experience}} daily freezing risk, {{yet little}} is known about the interaction between their surroundings and thermal traits. Existent studies are based on information taken over short periods of time, which does not allow to understand the effects of inter-annual climate variations on plants. Aims: To evaluate if Werneria nubigena and Xenophyllum rigidum present similar response mechanisms <b>to</b> <b>freezing,</b> determine if their inner leaf temperature (ILT) is controlled by microhabitat conditions, and if the exotherm temperature variation depends on the correspondent response <b>to</b> <b>freezing.</b> Methods: We measured the ILT and the micro environmental temperature, and evaluated the exotherm and freezing injury temperature (LT 50), on the Antisana Volcano. Results: The thermal niche of both species was warmer than the registered ILT. The exotherm and LT 50 relation revealed that both species presented a tolerance mechanism <b>to</b> <b>freezing</b> with an inversed relation with elevation. Microhabitat substrates (rock and vascular plants) surrounding the plants determined the exposure <b>to</b> <b>freezing</b> for both species, having a significant inverse relation with the ILT. Conclusions: Our results indicate that independently of their tolerance mechanism, microhabitat conditions could be the primary filter when determining the exposure of these tropical alpine species <b>to</b> air <b>freezing</b> temperatures...|$|R

5|$|In the game, players fight various monsters as they {{explore the}} pyramid's halls and catacombs. Players may pick up weapons and {{ammunition}} {{left behind by}} others to supplement their arsenal. As additional levels are unlocked, new weapons become available, including machine guns and grenade launchers. Players can absorb {{a certain amount of}} damage, but once their health reaches zero, they must resume their progress at the last saved checkpoint. Resting in place replenishes health but saps game time and leaves the player open to attack. Scattered throughout the levels are other items players may use. Potions have different effects: rare blue potions, for example, rid the player character of poison and damage. Otherwise items provide points or cash; every four points increases the player character's maximum health by two units. Crystals can be used against enemies <b>to</b> <b>freeze,</b> burn, or otherwise harm them.|$|E
5|$|Miyuki is {{considered}} one of the strongest magicians in the world and is a candidate to succeed the Yotsuba. Her specialty is freezing magic, and her unique magic allows her <b>to</b> <b>freeze</b> a person's consciousness. In addition, half of her magic casting abilities is used to seal Tatsuya's powers. Before the family vacation in Okinawa, Miyuki treated Tatsuya coldly akin to how the other Yotsuba clan members did. She begins to warm up to him and when Tatsuya saves her life, devotes her existence to him. It evolves to the point she disdains the touch of other males and expresses jealousy towards females around Tatsuya. Genetically different from Tatsuya, despite being born from the same parents, Miyuki professes her love to him following their engagement under Maya's orders. She is voiced by Saori Hayami.|$|E

40|$|The AC {{impedance}} spectroscopy (ACIS) is an electrochemical {{technique used}} to characterize materials in various research fields owing to its non-destructive nature. The ACIS, accordingly, {{appears to have}} a potential as a non-destructive technique to investigate the durability of cement paste. An understanding of the mechanism of frost action occurring within cement paste, a key binding component of concrete, is necessary to improve the durability of concrete with respect <b>to</b> <b>freezing</b> and thawing, particularly where the winter is severe. In addition, the research on the effectiveness of the wollastonite micro-fibres, a cost-effective naturally occurring calcium silicate, as a reinforcing material to improve the durability of cement paste is demanded due to worldwide concerns of material shortages. Three primary objectives in this study are to further the understanding of the mechanism of frost action within cement paste subjected <b>to</b> <b>freezing</b> and thawing, <b>to</b> investigate the potential of the ACIS as a new technique to determine the durability of cement paste with respect <b>to</b> <b>freezing</b> and thawing and to investigate the durability of the wollastonite micro-fibre reinforced cement paste <b>to</b> <b>freezing</b> and thawing.

5|$|On {{the south}} side of the outer defences, facing the river, are the West and East Lines of gun positions. These were built in the 18th century and have been subject to {{considerable}} erosion and silting; 12 of the original 14 gun positions on the West Line remain but only one of the East Line has survived. In between the lines is a quay, designed to allow the delivery of supplies from the Thames, and the remains of the tracks from the narrow gauge railway built during the First World War. A sluice gate in the south-west corner managed the water in the moats, and allowed them to be drained completely should the surfaces begin <b>to</b> <b>freeze</b> over in winter and provide an advantage to any attackers. To the west of the outer defences is the World's End pub, originally the local ferry house, dating from 1788.|$|E
5|$|Prime was {{released}} for the GameCube in five versions. The original North American and Japanese NTSC versions {{and the second}} North American version, which contained minor changes, all used a loader that sometimes caused the game <b>to</b> <b>freeze</b> in specific rooms. The European PAL version resolved these glitches and contained altered elements of the gameplay to prevent sequence breaking, a slower loader that prevented the occasional crashes, slightly different story details, and narration in the opening and closing scenes. Some of these changes were carried over from the PAL version to the NTSC region's Player's Choice re-release, along with additional changes not made in other releases. This version, which was bundled with a silver GameCube, also contained a second disc featuring a preview trailer and a demo for Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, a timeline of Metroid games, and an art gallery.|$|E

To get the evidence they need, Ros is sent undercover to the London Stock Exchange, where Meynell is targeting the bank Highland Life. After starting a rumour about the bank, he starts betting against it. When the chairman of Highland Life, Francis Debham (Simon Williams), attempts to keep the bank afloat, Meynell doubles his position, bankrupting Highland Life. Ros uses the opportunity to swipe a memory card from Meynell's mobile phone, containing his secure email account that could prove his guilt. However, they find nothing relevant.
