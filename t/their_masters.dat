5|$|Concerns {{were raised}} about {{these changes in}} society. William Langland wrote the poem Piers Plowman {{in the years before}} 1380, praising peasants who {{respected}} the law and worked hard for their lords, but complaining about greedy, travelling labourers demanding higher wages. The poet John Gower feared England might see an uprising similar to the French Jacquerie revolt of 1358, in which the peasants had risen up against <b>their</b> <b>masters.</b> There was a moral panic about the threat posed by newly arrived workers in the towns and the possibility that servants might turn against <b>their</b> <b>masters.</b> New legislation was introduced in 1359 to deal with migrants, existing conspiracy laws were more widely applied and the treason laws were extended to include servants or wives who betrayed <b>their</b> <b>masters</b> and husbands. By the 1370s, there were fears that if the French invaded England, the rural classes might side with the invaders.|$|E
5|$|This process {{affected}} the southern and western parts of present-day Mali most significantly, {{but in the}} northern and eastern parts of the colony large numbers of slaves remained in servitude to <b>their</b> <b>masters.</b> According to rough estimates, throughout the area of present-day Mali about one-third of former slaves {{moved away from the}} slavery relationship, while two-thirds remained with <b>their</b> <b>masters.</b> In the 1920s, most Tuareg households still had slaves who tended to the house and animals.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{a million}} slaves in French West Africa {{responded to this}} by moving away from <b>their</b> <b>masters</b> and {{settling}} elsewhere. The French supported these efforts by creating settlements around the Niger River and digging wells for communities elsewhere so they could farm away from their former masters.|$|E
50|$|Two of Huang Yaoshi's apprentices, Chen Xuanfeng and Mei Chaofeng, fell in {{love and}} were afraid of informing <b>their</b> <b>master</b> of <b>their</b> wedding plans as they were unsure whether <b>their</b> <b>master</b> would give them his blessings or violently object. They eloped, stole <b>their</b> <b>master's</b> copy of the Nine Yin Manual, and fled from Peach Blossom Island.|$|R

50|$|Freedpersons, or liberti, were ex-slaves {{who were}} freed. Although free, many liberti {{continued}} to work for <b>their</b> previous <b>master.</b> When freed, liberti took on the name of <b>their</b> <b>master,</b> thereby continuing the family name. By taking <b>their</b> <b>master's</b> name, liberti were {{considered part of the}} familia, not just the domus. Like slaves, freedmen and freedwomen, with their families, were provided burial space with the familia.|$|R

Prince Escalus of Verona intervenes and declares that further breach of the peace will be punishable by death. Later, Count Paris talks to Capulet about marrying his daughter Juliet, but Capulet asks Paris to wait another two years and invites him to attend a planned Capulet ball. Lady Capulet and Juliet's nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris's courtship.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his service}} as governor, Morehead resumed his legal {{practice}} in Frankfort, Kentucky. In March 1837, he {{was commissioned by}} Governor James Clark {{to act as an}} agent for the state, selling bonds to fund internal improvements. He returned to the state House from 1837 to 1838, representing Franklin County. He was president of the Kentucky Board of Internal Improvements from 1838 to 1841, and in 1839, he and John Speed Smith were chosen as commissioners to the state of Ohio to secure the return of Kentucky-owned slaves as property of <b>their</b> <b>masters.</b> They were successful in this endeavor.|$|E
5|$|However, slaves did {{belong to}} their master's household. A newly-bought slave {{was welcomed with}} nuts and fruits, just like a newly-wed wife. Slaves took part {{in most of the}} civic and family cults; they were {{expressly}} invited to join the banquet of the Choes, second day of the Anthesteria, and were allowed initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries. A slave could claim asylum in a temple or at an altar, just like a free man. The slaves shared the gods of <b>their</b> <b>masters</b> and could keep their own religious customs if any.|$|E
5|$|On {{the issue}} of slavery, Smith took {{different}} positions. Initially he opposed it, but during the mid-1830s when the Mormons were settling in Missouri (a slave state), Smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly anti-abolitionist essay. Then in the early 1840s, after Mormons had been expelled from Missouri, he once again opposed slavery. During his presidential campaign of 1844, he proposed ending slavery by 1850 and compensating slaveholders for their loss. Smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites, and he welcomed slaves into the church. However, he opposed baptizing them without permission of <b>their</b> <b>masters,</b> and he opposed interracial marriage.|$|E

5|$|Settling in the {{transitional}} area between agricultural lands and the steppe, the Khitans became semi-sedentary like their Xianbei predecessors of the Northern Wei, {{and started to}} use Chinese methods of defence. In 1026 walls were built through central Manchuria north of Nong'an County to {{the banks of the}} Songhua River. When the Jurchens, once Liao vassals, rose up to overthrow <b>their</b> <b>masters</b> and established the Jin dynasty, they continued Liao's wall-building activities with extensive work begun before 1138. Further wall construction took place in 1165 and 1181 under the Jin Emperor Shizhong, and later from 1192 to 1203 during the reign of his successor Emperor Zhangzong.|$|E
5|$|Although {{potentially}} dangerous objects and money were confiscated and stored when a prisoner first entered the Bastille, most wealthy prisoners continued {{to bring in}} additional luxuries, including pet dogs or cats to control the local vermin. The Marquis de Sade, for example, arrived with an elaborate wardrobe, paintings, tapestries, a selection of perfume, {{and a collection of}} 133 books. Card games and billiards were played among the prisoners, and alcohol and tobacco were permitted. Servants could sometimes accompany <b>their</b> <b>masters</b> into the Bastille, as in the cases of the 1746 detention of the family of Lord Morton and their entire household as British spies: the family's domestic life continued on inside the prison relatively normally. The prisoners' library had grown during the 18th century, mainly through ad hoc purchases and various confiscations by the Crown, until by 1787 it included 389 volumes.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} the reorganized Lithuanians {{returned}} to the battle, attacking von Jungingen from the rear. The Teutonic forces were by then becoming outnumbered by the mass of Polish knights and advancing Lithuanian cavalry. As von Jungingen attempted {{to break through the}} Lithuanian lines, he was killed. According to Cronica conflictus, Dobiesław of Oleśnica thrust a lance through the Grand Master's neck, while Długosz presented Mszczuj of Skrzynno as the killer. Surrounded and leaderless, the Teutonic Knights began to retreat. Part of the routed units retreated towards their camp. This move backfired when the camp followers turned against <b>their</b> <b>masters</b> and joined the manhunt. The knights attempted to build a wagon fort: The camp was surrounded by wagons serving as an improvised fortification. However, the defense was soon broken and the camp was ravaged. According to Cronica conflictus, more Knights died there than on the battlefield. The battle lasted for about ten hours.|$|E

5|$|Germanicus {{was given}} the title of {{quaestor}} in AD 7, five years before the legal age of 25, and in that year was sent to assist Tiberius {{in the war against}} the Pannonians and Dalmatians. According to Cassius Dio, Augustus sent Germanicus to Illyricum because Tiberius' lack of activity made Augustus suspect that he was delaying to remain under arms as long as possible under the pretense of war. Germanicus brought an army of levied citizens and manumitted slaves that were bought from <b>their</b> <b>masters</b> to reinforce Tiberius in Siscia, his base of operations in Illyricum. In late autumn/early winter additional reinforcements arrived at Siscia from Moesia and the East: three legions from Moesia led by Aulus Caecina Severus and two from Anatolia led by Silvanus with Thracian cavalry and auxiliary troops. While this did show that Augustus took the threat seriously, Tiberius had some soldiers sent back, because he had more than he needed.|$|E
5|$|Indications {{are that}} society in North Britain {{contained}} relatively {{large numbers of}} slaves, often taken in war and raids, or bought, as St. Patrick indicated the Picts were doing from the Britons in Southern Scotland. Slavery probably reached relatively far down in society, with most rural households containing some slaves. Because they were taken relatively young and were usually racially indistinguishable from <b>their</b> <b>masters,</b> many slaves {{would have been more}} integrated into their societies of capture than their societies of origin, in terms of both culture and language. Living and working beside their owners they in practice may have become members of a household without the inconvenience of the partible inheritance rights that divided estates. Where there is better evidence from England and elsewhere, it was common for such slaves who survived to middle age to gain their freedom, with such freedmen often remaining clients of the families of their former masters.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} of both {{government and private}} slaves were born slaves. Government slaves could be granted freedom by the emperor if they were deemed too elderly, if the emperor pitied them, or if they committed a meritous act worthy of a manumission. In one exceptional case, the former slave Jin Midi (d. 86 BCE) {{became one of the}} regents over the government. Private slaves could buy their freedom from their master, while some masters chose to free their slaves. Although slaves were subject to beatings if they did not obey <b>their</b> <b>masters,</b> it was against the law to murder a slave; kings were stripped of their kingdoms after it was found that they had murdered slaves, while Wang Mang even forced one of his sons to commit suicide for murdering a slave. An edict of 35 CE repealed the death penalty for any slave who killed a commoner.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} slaves in Indiana were {{owned by the}} French traders who entered the region and introduced the practice to the native tribes. Jesuit priests encouraged the tribes they lived among to adopt slavery {{as an alternative to}} executing their prisoners in war. According to some classical historians, the decline of cannibalism among the tribes was {{a direct result of the}} rise of slavery. Early slaves were often Native Americans who were sold to pay debts. The early slaves typically performed manual labor, helping the traders transport their goods and to build forts and trading posts. While part of new France, laws were enacted to give slaves some protection from <b>their</b> <b>masters.</b> Torture and mutilation of slaves was forbidden, and families were prevented from being forcibly broken up. Other laws allowed slaves to be seized by creditors as payment. Other laws required that if a master had children by a slave, the slave and her children were then to be freed. Their status under the French laws was similar to that of minors.|$|E
5|$|This {{navigation}} {{plan was}} abandoned when both Prince of Wales and Borrowdale {{lost sight of}} Alexander and Friendship during a severe storm in late July, and found themselves alone and off course {{by the time the}} weather cleared. The two lost ships anchored while <b>their</b> <b>masters,</b> John Mason in Prince of Wales and Hobson Reed in Borrowdale, consulted. Neither considered it likely they could reach the Lord Howe Island rendezvous. They were also reluctant to hazard the voyage to Batavia through the Great Barrier Reef without Alexander in the lead. Instead, they agreed to turn their ships southeast into the open ocean and to return to England by sailing the other way around the world, via Cape Horn and Rio de Janeiro and then northeast across the Atlantic to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{development}} of international trade, the elementary principles of credit and banking were developed. Both Jewish and Italian merchants had regular banking agents in Syria, who transacted business on behalf of <b>their</b> <b>masters.</b> Bills of exchange were also used by them in their dealings {{with one another and}} money was deposited in various banking centers throughout Syria. The encouragement of trade and industry provided the Ayyubid sultans with the funds needed for military expenditure as well as for developmental and everyday lifestyle works. Special attention was made to the economic state of the empire under al-Adil and al-Kamil. The latter maintained a strict control over expenditure; it is said that on his death he left a treasury which was equivalent to the budget of one full year.|$|E
