Although the city was his first love, rising starlet Jasmine (Sonakshi Sinha) wins his heart. Khan advances Jasmine's career by rigging awards, and showers her with gifts; he becomes obsessed with her. He sends Aslam and another trustworthy aide, Jimmy, to kill Rawal. Jimmy fails, accidentally killing his girlfriend, Mona, and flees. He is soon captured by the police, hot on Khan's trail after learning about his arrival in Bombay. Jimmy, loyal to Khan, does not crack during his interrogation and is freed {{due to lack of}} evidence. The police intend to draw Khan out from hiding; he has eluded them for twelve years, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>their</b> last chance to take him on Indian soil.|$|E

They are the 27th overall championship team and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>their</b> first reign as a team. Místico and Valiente have previously held the championship with Máscara Dorada. 25 different teams have held the title, combining for 27 individual title reigns. Only two teams have held the title more than once, the first champions Los Infernales and the team of Héctor Garza, Hijo del Fantasma and La Máscara. Black Warrior, Blue Panther and Dr. Wagner Jr. hold {{the record for the}} longest single reign of any team, but due to the uncertainty of when the championship was vacated it can only be verified that they held them for a minimum of 1,141 days. Dr. Wagner Jr.'s four reigns combine to 2,051 days, the highest of any wrestler. Héctor Garza's five individual reigns is the record for the most reigns of any individual wrestler. All title matches take place under two out of three falls rules.|$|E

25|$|There is also {{research}} into {{individual differences in}} female resistance to mate guarding. A recent study by Abell and Brewer (2016) has focused on machiavellianism. They found that women high in this trait {{are more likely to}} resist mate guarding attempts and use covert tactics to do so. They suggest that this reflects the characteristics of machivellianism – using glibness and manipulation to get what is wanted and it is argued that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>their</b> way of controlling their partners. This is supported by the finding that females who are more controlling themselves will use more mate guarding resistant tactics too.|$|E

25|$|Nearly all Asian {{characters}} in mainstream American comics {{are capable of}} martial arts, and for several Asian characters, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>their</b> only skill or ability. An overwhelming number of Asian characters, particularly those of Japanese descent, are portrayed as masters of ninjutsu or {{the ways of the}} samurai, and are frequently introduced as teachers of non-Asian protagonists. Examples include Marvel's Shang-Chi, Colleen Wing, Psylocke although she is actually British in an Asian body, Silver Samurai, DC's Katana, Lady Shiva, and Cassandra Cain. Frequently, martial arts masters are associated with Asian religions, such as Buddhism, and a common archetype is that of the elderly, wise monk.|$|E
25|$|Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling, a pub {{filled with}} {{frightening}} thugs, but who instead are charmed by Rapunzel's innocence. Royal soldiers led {{by one of}} the royal army's lead horses, Maximus, arrive in search of Flynn. Rapunzel and Flynn escape but are then trapped in a flooding cave. Resigned to his fate, Flynn reveals his real name: Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel starts to reveal that her hair glows when she sings, but then realizes that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>their</b> key to escape. Her hair provides enough light {{to find a way out}} of the cave. Eugene and Rapunzel take refuge in a forest where Gothel, now in league with the Stabbingtons, gives the crown to Rapunzel and suggests using it to challenge Eugene's interest in her.|$|E
25|$|When it was rediscovered by officialdom in 1785, {{the site}} was known to the local Totonac, whose {{ancestors}} may also have built the city, as El Tajín, which was said to mean “of thunder or lightning bolt”. Related to <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>their</b> belief that twelve old thunderstorm deities, known as Tajín, still inhabit the ruins. However, a series of indigenous maps dating {{from the time of}} the Spanish conquest, found in nearby Tihuatlan and now known as the Lienzos de Tuxpan, suggest that the city might then have been called “Mictlan” or “place of the dead”, a common denomination for ancient sites whose original names have been lost. This name also appears in the Matricula de Tributos, a surviving Aztec tribute record, which later formed part of the Codex Mendoza. This may therefore be linked to another Totonac meaning claimed for El Tajín: “place of the invisible beings or spirits”.|$|E

25|$|It {{is illegal}} to drive a {{non-exempt}} vehicle that requires a test on public roads without a current MOT, except when driving to or from (subject to insurance terms and conditions) a booked MOT Test or to have remedial work done to rectify failures in a previous test. Possession of an up-to-date VT20 test certificate is a pre-requisite for obtaining Vehicle excise duty, and advertisements for used cars frequently say how many months are left to run on the current MOT (i.e., VT20 certificate; although the VT20 points out that it does not, in any way, guarantee road-worthiness {{at the time of}} sale). A vehicle could suffer major damage after an MOT has been carried out, but the certificate would still be valid, and obtaining a new one is not required by law (some insurance companies may require a new test, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>their</b> practice, not law). However, driving a vehicle which is in a dangerous condition on a public road is always illegal, irrespective of its test status.|$|E
25|$|Universal Disk Format (UDF) version 1.50 {{and above}} has {{facilities}} to support rewritable discs like sparing tables and virtual allocation tables, spreading usage {{over the entire}} surface of a disc and maximising life, but many older operating systems do not support this format. Packet-writing utilities such as DirectCD and InCD are available but produce discs that are not universally readable (although based on the UDF standard). The Mount Rainier standard addresses this shortcoming in CD-RW media by running the older file systems {{on top of it}} and performing defect management for those standards, but it requires support from both the CD/DVD burner and the operating system. Many drives made today do not support Mount Rainier, and many older operating systems such as Windows XP and below, and Linux kernels older than 2.6.2, do not support it (later versions do). Essentially CDs/DVDs are a good way to record {{a great deal of information}} cheaply and have the advantage of being readable by most standalone players, but they are poor at making ongoing small changes to a large collection of information. Flash drives' ability to do <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>their</b> major advantage over optical media.|$|E
25|$|As the {{production}} of radioactive atoms by the ISOL technique depends on the free atom chemistry of the element to be studied, there are certain beams which cannot be produced by simple proton bombardment of thick actinide targets. Refractory metals such as tungsten and rhenium do not emerge from the target even at high temperatures due to their low vapour pressure. In order to produce these types of beams, a thin target is required. The Ion Guide Isotope Separator On Line (IGISOL) technique was developed in 1981 at the University of Jyväskylä cyclotron laboratory in Finland. In this technique, a thin uranium target is bombarded with protons and nuclear reaction products recoil out of the target in a charged state. The recoils are stopped in a gas cell and then exit through a small hole {{in the side of}} the cell where they are accelerated electrostatically and injected into a mass separator. This method of production and extraction takes place on a shorter timescale compared to the standard ISOL technique and isotopes with short half-lives (sub millisecond) can be studied using an IGISOL. An IGISOL has also been combined with a laser ion source at the Leuven Isotope Separator On Line (LISOL) in Belgium. Thin target sources generally provide significantly lower quantities of radioactive ions than thick target sources and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>their</b> main drawback.|$|E
