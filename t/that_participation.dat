One faction (MDC-M), now led by Arthur Mutambara contested the elections to the Senate, while the other, led by Tsvangirai, opposed to contesting the elections, stating <b>that</b> <b>participation</b> in a rigged election is tantamount to endorsing Mugabe's claim that past elections were free and fair. The opposition parties have resumed participation in national and local elections as recently as 2006. The two MDC camps had their congresses in 2006 with Tsvangirai being elected to lead MDC-T, which has become more popular than the other group.|$|E

It enables them to influence their budget targets. This study, however, proposes <b>that</b> budgetary <b>participation</b> is needed only if subordinates perceive their organizations' performance evaluation and reward allocation systems as unfair. In such situations, budgetary participation may be useful for communicating grievances and for rectifying unfairness. This suggests <b>that</b> budgetary <b>participation</b> {{may be more effective}} in enhancing managerial performance when procedural justice is low than when it is high. These expectations are supported by the results of the study. 22 page(s...|$|R

25|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Manchester Institute of Sport and Physical Activity (MISPA) at the Manchester Metropolitan University and the Youth Sports Trust, Wright Robinson has taken part in a ten-year research project. The project was designed to support the school's strategic aim of raising academic standards and increasing whole school participation in Physical Education and Sport. In ten years over 10,000 children and 1,000,000 hours of PE have been assessed. The evidence shows <b>that</b> <b>participation</b> in physical activity enables young people to significantly improve their physical competence, confidence and self-esteem. More active pupils were also found to generally achieve higher academic attainment with 62% of physically active pupils achieving five or more A*-C GCSE grades including mathematics and English compared to 38% of the least active pupils.|$|E
25|$|The IRS {{previously}} {{instituted a}} qualified intermediary (QI) program under Internal Revenue Code § 1441, which required participating foreign financial institutions to maintain {{records of the}} U.S. or foreign status of their account holders and to report income and withhold taxes. One report included a statement of a finding <b>that</b> <b>participation</b> in the QI program was too low to have a substantive impact as an enforcement measure and was prone to abuse. An illustration of the weakness in the QI program was that UBS, a Swiss bank, had registered as a QI with the IRS in 2001 and was later forced to settle in the UBS tax evasion controversy with the U.S. Government for $780 million in 2009 over claims that it fraudulently concealed information on its U.S. person account holders. Non-resident U.S. citizens' required self-reporting of their local assets was also found to be relatively ineffective.|$|E

25|$|The {{first phase}} of postmodernity {{overlaps}} the end of modernity and is regarded by many as {{being part of the}} modern period (see lumpers/splitters, periodization). Television became the primary news source, manufacturing decreased in importance in the economies of Western Europe and the United States but trade volumes increased within the developed core. In 1967–1969 a crucial cultural explosion took place within the developed world as the baby boom generation, which had grown up with postmodernity as its fundamental experience of society, demanded entrance into the political, cultural and educational power structure. A series of demonstrations and acts of rebellion – ranging from nonviolent and cultural, through violent acts of terrorism – represented the opposition of the young to the policies and perspectives of the previous age. Opposition to the Algerian War and the Vietnam War, to laws allowing or encouraging racial segregation and to laws which overtly discriminated against women and restricted access to divorce, increased use of marijuana and psychedelics, the emergence of pop cultural styles of music and drama, including rock music and the ubiquity of stereo, television and radio helped make these changes visible in the broader cultural context. This period is associated with the work of Marshall McLuhan, a philosopher who focused on the results of living in a media culture and argued <b>that</b> <b>participation</b> in a mass media culture both overshadows actual content disseminated and is liberating because it loosens the authority of local social normative standards.|$|E

500|$|Canada is a {{signatory}} to the Kyoto protocol which legally requires signatory {{countries to}} set up compatible carbon trading markets. In direct defiance of this international legal obligation, in March 2007, Baird indicated that he wanted Canadian companies to be banned, or at least severely restricted, from participating in the international carbon market. Several European countries had already set up a trading system to allow companies that reduce their emission levels below government targets to sell [...] "credits" [...] on an international market. Many industry leaders argued that Canada should adopt a similar policy. Then-opposition leader Stéphane Dion argued <b>that</b> <b>participation</b> will allow Canadian firms to make [...] "megatonnes of money". Baird however described some carbon markets as [...] "shaky," [...] and argued that trade should be restricted to within Canada, or perhaps within North America. In April he indicated that Canadian businesses would soon gain the right to earn credits by investing in overseas environmental projects.|$|E
500|$|The Book of Lucifer {{contains}} a long chapter titled [...] "Satanic Sex", discussing Satanism's view on sexual activity {{as well as}} misconceptions surrounding these views. He denies the belief that sex {{is the most important}} element in LaVeyan Satanism, and <b>that</b> <b>participation</b> in orgies or other promiscuous behavior is forced. He explains that sexual freedom is encouraged, but only in the sense that believers should be free to explore their own sexualities as they please, without harming others. Along with the rumors regarding Satanic views on sex, LaVey also addresses those about animal and human sacrifice. He explains that the only time a LaVeyan Satanist would perform a human sacrifice would be to accomplish two goals: to [...] "release the magician's wrath" [...] as he or she performed a curse, and to kill someone who deserved to die. He considers the action of hurting another person a request to be destroyed, and explains that the Satanist is morally required to grant this request {{in the form of a}} curse. LaVey also says that a Satanist would never sacrifice a baby or an animal, as they are pure carnal beings and considered to be sacred. In The Book of Lucifer, LaVey outlines LaVeyan Satanism's views on death. He explains that one who has lived a full life will dread death, and that this is the way it should be. He also does not agree with the idea of reincarnation. He encourages a strong will to live, comparing it to animals' instincts to fight viciously for their lives. Suicide is discouraged except in cases of euthanasia, where it would end extreme suffering. Because the Satanist is considered his or her own god, birthdays are celebrated as the most important holidays. Following one's birthday in importance are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween. Solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated.|$|E
