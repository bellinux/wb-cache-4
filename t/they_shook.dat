5|$|Soriano's final {{assignment}} was command of I Corps and Fort Lewis, beginning in August 2002. Under his leadership, Fort Lewis became a force provider for Operation Iraqi Freedom, {{including the first}} deployment of the Stryker with the 2nd Infantry Division. In June 2004, as the commander of Fort Lewis, Soriano ordered the court-martial of Ryan G. Anderson, {{who was convicted of}} providing aid to al-Qaeda and was sentenced in September 2004 to life in prison with the possibility of parole after Soriano removed the death penalty as a possible sentencing option. In September 2004, Soriano met with Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo at Malacanang, who he had met before during Arroyo's state visit in May 2003,As <b>they</b> <b>shook</b> hands, the President said Soriano thanked her for going to his hometown of Alcala, Pangasinan to save his fellow townmates from discrimination after the countrys first two reported deaths from Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome were from Alcala. }} after being invited by General Narciso Abaya, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. In November 2004, Soriano turned over command of I Corps and Fort Lewis to Lieutenant General James M. Dubik, and finally retired from active duty on 1 March 2005.|$|E
5|$|The nine {{remaining}} gliders transporting {{the airborne}} troops assigned to Group Granite successfully {{landed on the}} roof of Fort Eben-Emael, using arrester-parachutes to slow their descent and rapidly bring them to a halt. The airborne troops rapidly emerged from the gliders and began attaching explosive charges to those emplacements {{on the top of the}} Fort which housed the artillery pieces that could target the three captured bridges. In the southern part of the Fort, Objective No. 18, an artillery observation casemate housing three 75mm artillery pieces was damaged with a light demolition charge and then permanently destroyed with a heavier charge, which collapsed the casemate's observation dome and part of the roof of the Fort itself. Objective No. 12, a traversing turret holding two more artillery pieces was also destroyed by airborne troops, who then moved to Objective No. 26, a turret holding another three 75mm weapons; although explosives were detonated against this and the airborne troops assigned to destroy it moved off, this proved to be premature as one of the guns was rapidly brought to bear against the attackers, who were forced to assault it for a second time to destroy it. Another pair of 75mm guns in a cupola was disabled, as was a barracks known to house Belgian troops. However, attempts to destroy Objective No. 24 proved to be less successful; the objective, twin turrets with heavy-calibre guns mounted on a rotating cupola, was too large for airborne troops from a single glider to destroy on their own, forcing troops from two gliders to be used. Primitive unlined shaped charges were affixed to the turrets and detonated, but whilst <b>they</b> <b>shook</b> the turrets they did not destroy them, and other airborne troops were forced to climb the turrets and smash the gun barrels.|$|E

500|$|At the {{interrogation}} centre he was poorly fed and physically weakened. It {{was part of}} the German technique for weakening resistance to interrogation. The Germans had prepared a file on all famous RAF personnel based on information from British newspapers. They knew most of what had happened in his career and private life. While there, he was interrogated by the aide of Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring. The German questioned him about British defences and Supermarine Spitfires, {{as he was about to}} resume operations on Ju 88s. Jokingly, Braham advised him to steer clear of Spitfires. While at Oberursel the pilot who had shot him down—Leutnant Robert Spreckels of Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1 Fighter Wing 1)— arrived to meet him. Braham was one of his 12 air victories; a figure of 45 is often misquoted. An interpreter was provided. Braham promised to buy him a whisky when the Allies won the war. The statement came as a shock to Spreckels who believed firmly in a German victory. Braham came to respect Spreckels, their differences aside. He learned that Spreckels had lost his parents in a British air attack and was surprised when the German dismissed the fact with the words [...] "it is the war." [...] Both fighter pilots dissociated themselves with the bomber war. <b>They</b> <b>shook</b> hands and parted.|$|E
500|$|Michaels {{returned}} to WWE programming {{in a series}} of segments that aired on the August 10, 2009 episode of Raw, where he had, in storyline, left the WWE. Triple H met with Michaels at an office cafeteria in Texas where he was working as a chef; throughout the segments, Triple H would try to convince Michaels to return to WWE and reform DX. After several incidents during the segments, Michaels agreed to team with Triple H to face The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase) at SummerSlam. At the pay-per-view event, DX defeated Legacy. The two teams would exchange victories, with their feud concluding in October. Two months later, at , DX defeated Chris Jericho and Big Show to win the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match (TLC). On the January 4, 2010 episode of Raw, Michaels buried the hatchet with long-time rival Bret Hart, as <b>they</b> <b>shook</b> hands and hugged in the ring. In contrast to the storylines featured on the show, this was in fact a real-life reconciliation which laid to rest animosities surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. While some cast doubts on its sincerity, both men have confirmed that it was indeed genuine. DX lost the Unified Tag Team Championship in a Triple Threat match to the team of The Miz and Big Show on the February 8 episode of Raw, the match also included The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows). At the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Michaels cost The Undertaker the World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. At WrestleMania XXVI, Michaels lost to The Undertaker and, as a result, he was forced to retire due to the match stipulation, the same way HBK ended Ric Flair's career. The following night, on the March 29 episode of Raw, Michaels gave an emotional farewell speech, departing with the familiar sentence, [...] "Shawn Michaels has left the building." ...|$|E
