5|$|Advertising {{standards}} laws in many jurisdictions prohibit <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phrase kosher in a product's labelling {{unless the}} producer {{can show that}} the product conforms to Jewish dietary laws; however, different jurisdictions often define the legal qualifications for conforming to Jewish dietary laws differently. For example, in some places the law may require that a rabbi certify the kashrut nature, in others the rules of kosher are fully defined in law, and in others still it is sufficient that the manufacturer only believes that the product complies with Jewish dietary regulations. In several cases, laws restricting <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term kosher have later been determined to be illegal religious interference.|$|E
