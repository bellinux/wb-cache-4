25|$|The Single Action Army {{action is}} a {{refinement}} of the earlier Colt percussion revolvers and the Colt 1871 cartridge revolver. The cylinder is mounted on a central axis and operated by a hand with a double finger whose more extended action allowed the cylinder-ratchet to be cut in a larger circle, giving more <b>torsional</b> <b>force</b> to the cylinder. Three notches {{on the face of}} the hammer engage the sear portion of the trigger, affording four basic hammer positions. The hammer when fully lowered rests within the frame. Drawn slightly to the rear, the hammer engages the safety notch of the sear and holds the firing pin out of direct contact with a chambered cartridge. Like the earlier percussion revolvers, the Single Action Army was designed to allow loading of all of the chambers. The safety notch replaced pins on the rear of the percussion revolver cylinders, which served the same purpose as the safety position, by preventing hammer contact with the primer/percussion cap. However, many users adopted the practice of leaving one empty chamber under the hammer, because a sharp blow could damage the mechanism and allow a fully loaded revolver to fire. This practice is now universally recommended. Drawn back about half way, the hammer engages the second notch. This cams the cylinder bolt out of engagement and allows the cylinder to rotate for loading. Fully cocked, the revolver is ready to fire. Cartridge ejection is via the spring-loaded rod housed in a tube on the right side of the barrel.|$|E
50|$|A heel hook is a leg lock {{affecting}} multiple joints, and {{is applied}} by transversely twisting the foot either medially or laterally. The <b>torsional</b> <b>force</b> puts severe torque on the ankle, {{which in turn}} transfers torque to the knee.|$|E

30|$|In addition, use {{of larger}} metal heads have raised {{concerns}} regarding potential adverse local tissue reactions (ALTRs), secondary to corrosion and metal release at the head–neck taper junction. Increasing the head size generates larger <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> at the trunnion–head junction, and significantly increases the maximal principal {{stress in the}} neck medial area, regardless of the material used for the head. These <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> enhance tribocorrosion and could lead to ALTRs.|$|R

50|$|The onager (British /ˈɒnədʒə/, /ˈɒnəɡə/, U.S. /ˈɑnədʒər/) was a Roman siege {{engine that}} was a type of {{catapult}} that uses a <b>torsional</b> <b>force,</b> generally from twisted rope, to store energy for the shot. The onager consisted of a large frame placed {{on the ground to}} whose front end a vertical frame of solid timber was rigidly fixed. A vertical spoke that passed through a rope bundle fastened to the frame had a sling attached which contained a projectile.|$|E
5000|$|String {{vibrations}} cause minute length variations, or stretching. With {{varying degrees}} of stretching, the tension varies. This {{can be thought of}} as longitudinal vibration. The strings are anchored to the bridge and the pull of the strings is directed to the side of the anchoring point. This creates a <b>torsional</b> <b>force</b> deforming the soundboard. When tension increases, it will create a belly below the bridge (away from the strings) and a dip above the bridge (under the strings). This deformation creates more complex sound waves than the push/pull action.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the helical fiber is at a minimum when the fiber angle equals 54°44′ and is at maximum length when the fiber angle {{approaches}} 0° and 90°. Summed up, this means that helically arranged muscle fibers with a fiber angle greater than 54°44′ will create force for both torsion and elongation while helically arranged muscle fibers with a fiber angle less than 54°44′ will create force for both torsion and shortening. The fiber angle of the oblique or helical muscle layers must increase during shortening and decrease during lengthening. In addition to creating a <b>torsional</b> <b>force,</b> the oblique muscle layers will therefore create a force for elongation that may aid the transverse musculature in resisting longitudinal compression.|$|E

40|$|Statement of problem. The {{separation}} of core materials from titanium posts, {{which have a}} low modulus of elasticity, {{has been identified as}} a problem in restorative dentistry. Purpose. This study evaluated the resistance to <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> of various core materials adapted to differently conditioned titanium posts. Material and methods. Seven hundrd and twenty specimens were tested consisting of. 6 core materials and 5 surface conditioning techniques for 2 kinds of opaquers with 10 specimens in each group (6 X 5 X 2 X 10 = 600) plus 6 core materials and 2 opaquers were tested and considered as control groups on nonconditioned titanium posts, each group containing 10 specimens (6 X 2 X 10 = 120). The custom-made pure titanium posts were conditioned with the following products: Silicoater Classical, Silicoater MD, Rocatec, Kevloc, and Siloc surface-conditioning systems. Subsequently, 6 core materials with different compositions (Durafill, Adaptic, Coradent, Ti-Core, Hytac Aplitip, and Photac-Fil Aplitip) were applied to titanium posts that were previously coated with 2 types of light-polymerized opaquers, either Artglass or Dentacolor. Sixty air-abraded titanium posts (250 mum, 30 seconds) were used as controls for each core material. Following thermocycling (5 degrees- 55 degreesC, 30 seconds, 5000 cycles), maximum <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> were determined with an electronic torque movement key. Data were statistically analyzed by 1 -way analysis of variance followed by 2 -way analysis of variance (P Results. Significantly higher mean <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> were observed with respect to Siloc (20. 4 Newton decimeter [dNm]), Silicoater Classical (18. 6 dNm), Silicoatcr MD (18. 2 dNm), and Rocatec (17. 0 dNm) systems compared with the mean for the untreated control group (14. 6 dNm) (P. 001). The Kevloc system in combination with the Artglass opaquer and Photac-Fil Aplitip (0. 00 dNm) core material showed no resistance against <b>torsional</b> <b>forces.</b> Significant differences were observed between hybrid core materials and microfilled composite, compomer, or resin-modified glass ionomer core materials (P Conclusion. Within the limitations of this study, the resistance to <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> for the core materials on titanium posts increased with the use of chemical surface-conditioning techniques and varied in accordance with the opaquer type. Type of core material also significantly influenced the resistance after thermocycling...|$|R
50|$|The Warren truss {{consists}} of longitudinal members joined only by angled cross-members, forming alternately inverted equilateral triangle-shaped spaces along its length. This gives a pure truss: each individual strut, beam, or tie is only subject to tension or compression forces, {{there are no}} bending or <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> on them.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{models to}} explain the {{subsequent}} step - the formation of stalk and fusion pore - have been proposed. However, {{the exact nature of}} these processes remains debated. In accordance with the [...] "zipper" [...] hypothesis, as the SNARE complex forms, the tightening helix bundle puts <b>torsional</b> <b>force</b> on the transmembrane (TM) domains domains of synaptobrevin and syntaxin. [...] This causes the TM domains to tilt within the separate membranes as the proteins coil more tightly. The unstable configuration of the TM domains eventually causes the two membranes to fuse and the SNARE proteins come together within the same membrane, which is referred to as a [...] "cis"-SNARE complex. As a result of the lipid rearrangement, a fusion pore opens and allows the chemical contents of the vesicle to leak into the outside environment.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic {{tweezers}} as a single-molecule {{method is}} decidedly {{the most common}} use in recent years. Through the single-molecule method, molecular tweezers provide a close look into the physical and mechanical properties of biological macromolecules. Similar to other single-molecule methods, such as optical tweezers, this method provides a way to isolate and manipulate an individual molecule free from the influences of surrounding molecules. Here, the magnetic bead {{is attached to a}} tethering surface by the molecule of interest. DNA or RNA may be tethered in either single-stranded or double-stranded form, or entire structural motifs can be tethered, such as DNA Holliday junctions, DNA hairpins, or entire nucleosomes and chromatin. By acting upon the magnetic bead with the magnetic field, different types of <b>torsional</b> <b>force</b> can be applied to study intra-DNA interactions, as well as interactions with topoisomerases or histones in chromosomes [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Evans balance {{was described}} by Dennis F. Evans in 1973 based on a torsional balance developed in 1937 by Alexander Rankine. Evans used Ticonal bars with cadmium plated mild steel yokes as the magnets, a Johnson-Matthey gold alloy (hence the other name of the balance)for the suspension strip, all glued together with epoxy resin onto a phosphor brown spacer. The tubes were made from NMR tubes and the current came from CdS photocells. This original was modified {{with help from the}} Johnson-Matthey company Two pairs of magnets were glued between the arms of an H-frame. The sample was placed into the gap between one pair of magnets and a small coil in the gap between the second pair of magnets. This entire construction pivoted horizontally around a torsion strip. When a sample tube was placed between the first pair of magnets, the <b>torsional</b> <b>force</b> was restored by the current passed through the coil between the second pair of magnets, giving a reading on a display instead of a Helipot (as was used in the original).|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{the resistance of}} various post and core materials against <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> on differently conditioned titanium posts. Method and materials: One hundred fifty pure titanium posts (DIN 17850 -Ti 4 / 3. 7065) were conditioned utilizing Silicoater Classical, Silicoater MD, Rocatec, Kevloc, and Siloc. Subsequently, three post and core materials (Adaptic, Coradent, Ti-Core) were applied to titanium posts that were previously coated with a light-cured opaquer (Dentacolor). Thirty sandblasted titanium posts were used as reference for each core material. Following thermocycling (5 degreesC to 55 degreesC, for 30 seconds or 5, 000 cycles), maximum <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> were determined with an electronic torque movement key. Results: Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U-tests indicated significant differences between Adaptic, Coradent, Ti-Core (20. 9 dNm, 18. 84 dNm, and 18. 62 dNm, respectively). There {{were no significant differences}} between Silicoater Classical (18. 56 dNm), Silicoater MD (18. 18 dNm), and Rocatec (16. 95 dNm), while Siloc exhibited the highest results (20. 44 dNm). Kevloc demonstrated significantly lower results (10. 43 dNm) than those of other systems and the control group (14. 49 dNm). Conclusion: Resistance of core materials against <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> on titanium posts increased with the use of chemical surface conditioning techniques, while the system using only acrylization did not improve the resistance in comparison to the unconditioned posts...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the impact of femoral stem length on (1) the {{resistance}} to fracture of implanted stems subjected to <b>torsional</b> <b>forces,</b> and (2) the peri-prosthetic fracture patterns in a synthetic bone model.

30|$|Adequate {{exposure}} and accurate curettage {{are essential to}} maximize local control, regardless of whether adjuvants are used or not [15, 16]. The bone window must be large to allow an adequate curettage, especially in malignant lesions (to {{reduce the risk of}} recurrence). Therefore, this procedure often weakens the bone, with an increase of the <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> {{at the level of the}} bone window, making necessary the fixation with a plate.|$|R
50|$|The collagenous cardiac {{skeleton}} {{which includes}} the four heart valve rings, is histologically, elastically and uniquely bound to cardiac muscle. The cardiac skeleton also includes the separating septa of the heart chambers - the interventricular septum and the atrioventricular septum. Collagen contribution to the measure of cardiac performance summarily represents a continuous <b>torsional</b> <b>force</b> opposed to the fluid mechanics of blood pressure emitted from the heart. The collagenous structure that divides the upper chambers of the heart from the lower chambers is an impermeable membrane that excludes both blood and electrical impulses through typical physiological means. With support from collagen, atrial fibrillation should never deteriorate to ventricular fibrillation. Collagen is layered in variable densities with cardiac muscle mass. The mass, distribution, age and density of collagen all contribute to the compliance required to move blood back and forth. Individual cardiac valvular leaflets are folded into shape by specialized collagen under variable pressure. Gradual calcium deposition within collagen occurs as a natural function of aging. Calcified points within collagen matrices show contrast in a moving display of blood and muscle, enabling methods of cardiac imaging technology to arrive at ratios essentially stating blood in (cardiac input) and blood out (cardiac output). Pathology of the collagen underpinning of the heart is understood within the category of connective tissue disease.|$|E

30|$|Biomechanically, plate {{fixation}} {{is superior}} to intramedullary fixation because it better resists the bending and <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> that occur during elevation of the upper extremity above shoulder level [40].

30|$|The <b>torsional</b> <b>force</b> {{required}} to fracture the short-stem implanted femurs [mean 27.1  Nm, range 24.4 – 30.3, standard deviation (SD) 2.1] was {{significantly greater than}} that of the long stems (mean 24.2  Nm, range 21.1 – 30.1, SD 2.8) (Fig.  1; p =  0.03). The ranges of fracture torque for the short (24.4 – 30.3  Nm) and long (21.1 – 25.7  Nm) stems show only partial overlap, {{with the exception of a}} single outlier (30.1 Nm) in the long-stemmed group (excluding this value, the range was 21.05 – 25.70  Nm). The <b>torsional</b> <b>force</b> {{required to}} fracture the short-stem implanted cadaveric femur (27.8  Nm) was higher than that for the long stem (14.7  Nm).|$|E

[5] tested in vitro different levels of femoral neck preservation {{and their ability to}} neutralize <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> of femoral components: preservation of 50 % or more of cortical neck was able to produce acceptable micromotions, while 15 % or less produced macromotion with conventional designs.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{we found}} that the peri-prosthetic {{fracture}} pattern of the two stems were different. In spite of this, both patterns would require stem revision and hence present a similar revision dilemma. However, the new short-stemmed press-fit femoral component allows more femoral flexibility and confers a higher resistance to peri-prosthetic fracture from <b>torsional</b> <b>forces</b> than the long stem. This higher resistance to fracture is an important consideration when selecting implants for elderly female patients who are both more likely to fall and to have osteoporotic bone.|$|R
