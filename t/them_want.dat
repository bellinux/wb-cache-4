5|$|Following a {{distress}} signal, the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship {{stranded in the}} middle of an ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms after they are injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making <b>them</b> <b>want</b> to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from succumbing to the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made <b>them</b> <b>want</b> to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E

25|$|Since 1979, it {{has been}} {{prohibited}} for federal funds to cover abortion costs for Peace Corps volunteers. Even in instances of life endangerment, rape and incest, volunteers are not financially covered. 433 Peace Corps volunteers were interviewed and {{it was reported that}} many thought the funding ban on abortion coverage should be removed. This was a two-month interview with no eligibility restrictions. Abortion is such a controversial topic that this just made it much more difficult for the Peace Corps to handle. Volunteers do receive health care, including prescription medications, routine examinations, and emergency care, free of charge. These services are provided in-country through a Peace Corps Medical Officer. Peace Corps volunteers don't make much money, which adds to this issue in the news. The abortion topic is very active in the Peace Corps, because when volunteers become pregnant for any reason, they can no longer be volunteers, and a significant number of <b>them</b> <b>want</b> to remain volunteers. Many volunteers have the same or very similar story.|$|E

Since the band had never stayed in London before, they had trouble focusing. They decided to relocate in Liverpool, where they recorded some of the songs on Parachutes. Once there, vocalist Chris Martin said that they became obsessed with recording. [...] "In My Place" [...] was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's lead single {{because it was the}} track that made <b>them</b> <b>want</b> to record a second album, following a [...] "strange period of not really knowing what we were doing" [...] three months after {{the success of}} Parachutes.

500|$|Tripp {{attempts}} to describe homosexuality, {{the social context}} in which it occurs, and its biological and sociological implications. He acknowledges a debt to previous researchers, including the ethologist Frank A. Beach, the psychologist John Money, the biologist Alfred Kinsey, the sexologists Wardell Pomeroy and Clyde Martin, the anthropologist Paul Gebhard, and the psychologist George Weinberg. Based on his review {{of the history of}} sexual laws and customs, he concludes that homosexuality has been called an [...] "aberration" [...] or [...] "perversion" [...] due to moral assumptions rooted partly in religious beliefs. Exploring the question of a possible biological basis to homosexuality, Tripp focuses on the issue of hormones. He argues that the existing evidence is too inconsistent to show any connection between male homosexuality and hormone levels, with studies showing homosexual men as having hormone levels sometimes lower and sometimes higher than those of heterosexual men. Tripp maintains that future {{attempts to}} establish a connection will inevitably fail, due to their false underlying assumptions. Based on studies suggesting that sexual patterns depend on learning in primates and other animals, Tripp argues that human sexual orientation also depends on learning. He argues that a majority of people are heterosexual because their upbringing has made <b>them</b> <b>want</b> and expect to be heterosexual, and that while early favorable heterosexual experiences help reinforce heterosexuality, there is an uneven correlation between early sexual experience and adult sexual orientation. Tripp considers the context in which such experiences occurred to be crucial, writing that emotion or a sense of drama is needed to give them significance.|$|E

She stated that she almost always heard of a case of this type after it has caused problems with someone's job or marriage.|$|E
