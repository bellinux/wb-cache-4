40|$|Abstract: The {{ability to}} {{represent}} mental states {{of self and}} others to account for behavior is called theory of mind (ToM). This study examined whether ToM deficit in schizophrenia patients is a specific deficit in the cognitive component of interpersonal skills or a more global deficit, involving impaired information processing skills. Schizo-phrenia inpatients (N 41) were compared with a control group of healthy subjects (N 22) and to nonschizophrenia psychiatric patients (24 with affective disorders, seven with other psychosis) over a range of ToM tasks and another naive theory (theory of biology; ToB). Psychi-atric inpatients as a whole showed significant deficit compared with the control group of healthy subjects in <b>ToM</b> tasks. <b>The</b> schizophrenia <b>patients</b> showed significantly larger deficits compared with patients suffering from affective disorder, while <b>the</b> performance of <b>patients</b> with nonschizophrenia psychosis was intermediate. In contrast, no difference was observed {{in the performance of}} the different groups on the ToB tasks. The fact that a deficit was found in ToM but not in ToB suggests a specific deficit in a cognitive component of interpersonal skills in schizophrenia rather than a general deficit in information processing skills. Naive theories deficits in schizophrenia seem to be domain-dependent. Key Words: Theory of mind, theory of biology, schizophrenia, naive theory...|$|R
