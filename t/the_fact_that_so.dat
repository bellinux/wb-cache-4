25|$|However, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many Shakespearean {{scholars}} {{believed the}} play {{to have been}} written by someone other than Shakespeare, there were those throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century who argued against this theory. One such scholar was Edward Capell, who, in 1768, said that the play was badly written but asserted that Shakespeare did write it. Another major scholar to support Shakespeare's authorship was Charles Knight in 1843. Several years later, a number of prominent German Shakespeareans also voiced their belief that Shakespeare wrote the play, including A.W. Schlegel and Hermann Ulrici.|$|E
25|$|Meno {{proposes that}} virtue {{is the desire}} for good things {{and the power to}} get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not {{recognize}} evil. The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many.|$|E
25|$|Nationalists deplore <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> {{many people}} are {{stateless}} or live under inefficient and tyrannical regimes. Advocates {{of the society of}} states are concerned about rogue states and about the imperial ambitions of the powerful. Cosmopolitans believe that the contemporary world badly fails to live up to their standards, and that doing so would require considerable changes in the actions of wealthy individuals and states. It might, for instance, require them to transfer most of their wealth to the poor. It might require the building of international institutions able to limit, or even replace, the self-interested action of powerful states and corporations. It might require each of us to do much more than most now do.|$|E

500|$|Technical {{director}} Lisa Forsell {{explained that}} {{to enhance the}} richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: [...] "Digital matte paintings are {{a way to get}} a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It’s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you’ll see some that look like tire treads. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1977, during Queen Elizabeth II's Jubilee Year, {{the company}} gave a Royal Command Performance of Pinafore at Windsor Castle. [...] The company visited Denmark in 1970, Rome in 1974, and gave its last American tours in 1976 and 1978. [...] Its last tour, in [...] Australasia, {{conducted}} by the company's new musical director, Fraser Goulding, was a success in 1979. [...] Throughout the 20th century, until 1982, the company toured, on average, for 35 weeks per year (in addition to its 13-week London seasons), fostering a [...] "strong family atmosphere, reinforced {{by the number of}} marriages in the company and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many people stayed with it for so long." [...] Principal soprano Valerie Masterson married the company's principal flautist, Andrew March. [...] She explained, [...] "people didn't have flats or houses ... touring was your life." [...] Throughout its history, the company maintained strict moral standards, and it was sometimes referred to as the [...] "Savoy boarding school", enforcing policies regarding behaviour on and off stage, and even a dress code. [...] Soprano Cynthia Morey ascribed the strong affection that artists had for the company to [...] "the unique family atmosphere engendered by the company's direct descent from its creators, Gilbert, Sullivan ... Richard D'Oyly Carte, followed by his widow, Helen, his son Rupert, and finally his granddaughter Bridget." [...] The company also preserved, for over a century, what The Times called a [...] "unique performance style, which may be summarised as a combination of good taste and good fun".|$|E
500|$|As the wet {{season ended}} in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up {{to move to}} Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that [...] "God bless the best yaller woman he ever made" [...] and asked the {{listeners}} to join with him in rejoicing that [...] "she's so many shades removed from being entirely black". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "if we could bleach her by any means we would and thus make her acceptable in any company as she deserves to be". Seacole replied firmly that she did not [...] "appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger's, I should have been just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value." [...] She declined the offer of [...] "bleaching" [...] and drank [...] "to you and the general reformation of American manners". Salih notes the use of American pidgin, against Seacole's clear English, as representational of a supposed white moral and intellectual superiority. Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices, commenting that [...] "it is wonderful to see how freedom and equality elevate men". She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.|$|E
2500|$|Vermeer {{was rescued}} from near-total obscurity in the 19th century, {{by which time}} several of his works had been re-{{attributed}} to others. However <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many of his works were already in major collections, often attributed to other artists, demonstrates {{that the quality of}} individual paintings was recognised even if his collective oeuvre was unknown. [...] Other artists have continued to be rescued from the mass of little known painters: the late and very simple still lifes of Adriaen Coorte in the 1950s, and the landscapists Jacobus Mancaden and Frans Post earlier in the century.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1992 movie Wayne's World, Wayne (played by Mike Myers) takes {{a guitar}} and plays several {{notes of the}} song in the {{original}} theatrical release. In the scene, Wayne is almost immediately stopped by a store employee who points to a [...] "No Stairway" [...] sign. This alluded to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many people have attempted the song on guitar while at music stores, employees became sick of hearing it and banned patrons from playing [...] "Stairway", threatening them with removal. In the video releases and television airings of the movie, however, the notes are changed to a generic guitar riff due to licensing restrictions imposed by WMG and the band.|$|E
2500|$|Hymes clearly {{considers}} {{folklore and}} narrative {{a vital part}} of the fields of linguistics, anthropology and literature, and has bemoaned <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> few scholars in those fields are willing and able to adequately include folklore in its original language in their considerations (Hymes 1981:6-7). He feels that the translated versions of the stories are inadequate for understanding their role in the social or mental system in which they existed. He provides an example that in Navajo, the particles (utterances such as [...] "uh," [...] "So," [...] "Well," [...] etc. that have linguistic if not semantic meaning), omitted in the English translation, are essential to understanding how the story is shaped and how repetition defines the structure that the text embodies.|$|E

2500|$|Church {{construction}} [...] After the conquest, Spaniards' first {{efforts were}} directed at evangelization {{and the related}} task of building churches, which needed indigenous labor for basic construction, but they Nahuas elaborated stonework exteriors and decorated church interiors. Indigenous craftsmen were taught European motifs, designs and techniques, but very early work, called tequitqui (Nahuatl for “vassal”), includes elements such as flattened faces and high-stiff relief. The Spanish friars directing construction were not trained architects or engineers. They relied on indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches and other Christian structures, often in the same places as temples and shrines of the traditional religion. [...] "Although some Indians complained about the burden such labor represented, most communities considered a large and impressive church to be a reflection of their town's importance and took justifiable pride in creating a sacred place for divine worship." [...] <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many colonial-era churches have survived centuries it testament to their general good construction.|$|E
2500|$|Giant mammoths once {{populated}} the area, and {{the valley}} contains {{the most extensive}} mammoth kill sites in Mexico. Most of the sites are located on what were the shores of Lake Texcoco {{in the north of}} the Federal District and the adjacent municipalities of Mexico State such as in Santa Isabel Ixtapan, Los Reyes Acozac, Tepexpan [...] and Tlanepantla. Mammoth bones are still occasionally found in farmland here. They have been discovered {{in many parts of the}} Federal District itself, particularly during the construction of the city's Metro lines and in the neighborhoods of Del Valle in the center, Lindavista to the center-north and Coyoacán in the south of the city. The symbol for Line4's Bondojito station of the Mexico City Metro is a mammoth, due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many bones were uncovered during its construction. However, the richest site for mammoth remains in the valley is at the Paleontological Museum in Tocuila, a [...] site located near the town of Texcoco in Mexico State. Although there is some evidence around the old lakeshores that the first populations here survived by hunting, gathering and possibly by scavenging, but evidence from this time period is scarce.|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff's footballing {{principles}} {{have significantly}} influenced the football career of many players and managers, including Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, two devoted disciples and successors of the Cruyffian (Barça-Ajax) school of football. Without Cruyff operating {{behind the scenes}} as the spiritual father of Barça, {{there could be no}} Joan Laporta presidency, and Rijkaard and Guardiola, two largely unproven managers, could never have been appointed. Guardiola, a typical product (graduate) of Cruyffian school, who was the manager of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, stated: [...] "Throughout my career I've simply tried to instil what I learned from Johan Cruyff. He has had the biggest influence on football out of anyone in the world, first as a player and then as a coach. He taught me a lot {{and you can see that}} in <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>so</b> many of his former players are now coaches". Guardiola added, [...] "Johan Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] In regards to how the football world will remember Cruyff's posthumous legacy, he said, [...] "As a player and as a manager he won a lot of titles, but that's not his legacy. The titles only help. Johan has changed two clubs. Not only did he change Ajax, but also Barcelona – and then the Dutch and Spanish national teams, too. Forget the titles. I've won more titles than him. Messi, for example, is someone runs less and in that he's the best of Cruyff's alumni. (...) I would not have been capable of doing what he did at Barcelona. He changed everything. He did it all. What Cruyff's done for football cannot be compared. The statue thing is superficial. He has made us love this sport so openly that there's no way we can forget him." [...] Jürgen Klinsmann, the head coach of the United States national team, said about Cruyff's overall impact on contemporary football, [...] "More than an athlete, Cruyff was also a great thinker, someone who reinvented the sport... Cruyff has left us now, but his vision and philosophy will hopefully live forever. You can see it in the way Barcelona—one of two clubs Cruyff revolutionized, along with Ajax—still plays every week. It's a style that has admirers around the world. I think a lot of people share that [...] with him. You want to see this type of game, where you set the tone, you control the game, you make it fast, you make it attractive and attacking. He's always been famous for his version of the 4–3–3 with the wide wingers, all technically highly gifted and fast. This is his mark." ...|$|E
