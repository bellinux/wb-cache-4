The comedy often {{involves}} visual gags and puns, as well as jokes in reference to elements of Christianity and Buddhism; for example, Jesus creates wine from water in a public bath and Buddha shines when excited.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{seriousness}} of the episode, Richards included some wit and humour. For instance, the scene where Lucas bugs Lindemann's office and [...] "small talks" [...] Ros; the producers wanted the scene to be different from similar scenes from movies involving secret agents planting bugs in offices and homes. The producers also wanted to have Ruth return her confidence in her work, back to how she was before her departure. The finale also includes Lucas being confused over Sarah. The writing team wanted him to despise her as a villain, but at the same time, still maintain feelings for her. Following her death, they did not want Lucas <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>calm</b> and calculating when confronting the assassin, but instead make him [...] "lose it" [...] and then have him broken afterward.|$|E

500|$|A {{few moments}} after {{beginning}} the display, and while still ascending, the balloon {{was seen to}} be in flames. Some reports say that the balloon momentarily disappeared behind a cloud and that when it reappeared it was on fire—whatever the circumstances, the gas in the balloon was burning. Blanchard began to descend rapidly, but the balloon, caught in the wind, continued to move off from the pleasure gardens even as it went down. Some spectators thought these events {{were part of the}} show and applauded and shouted their approval. The balloon had not risen very high and, although the escaping gas was burning, the gas within the balloon maintained sufficient lift for a while to prevent the craft plummeting directly to the ground. By rapidly shedding ballast Blanchard was able to slow the descent. Most reports say she appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>calm</b> during the descent, but she was said to be wringing her hands in despair as the craft approached the ground. Rumours later circulated that she had gripped the chair of her craft so tightly that [...] "several arteries had snapt through the effort." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{displays}} news anchor {{reports about the}} Earth on course {{to pass through the}} tail of a comet named Eurydice, as well as displaying a worldwide panic. The rest of the video then is presented {{through the use of a}} handheld video camera. Grande is in a Fiat car as the passenger, with her boyfriend (played by Matt Bennett), who is recording. They are stuck in traffic as they try to leave the city, implied to be Los Angeles, California. While everyone around them is panicking, Grande seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>calm</b> as she wants to get a closer look at the comet. Impatient, she leaves the car while Bennett tries to stop her, and then follows. They make their way through the crowds, but are stopped by the police who are barricading the street. Meanwhile, the comet erupts in the sky and begins to crash to the ground as the song starts. Grande manages to get through but Bennett is unable to, so he goes through an open ambulance and manages to catch up with her in an alleyway with stairs leading up into an apartment complex. Ariana notices the comet in the sky. The two enter a home of a frightened family and try to leave through the other door, only for the comet to crash into the building, nearly killing both of them. Frightened, the two continue on and enter a room filled with television screens of the comet and an old man sitting at a desk. As the former two of them try to leave, the latter tries to stop them, but they knock him to the ground, and all the screens change to the same countdown timer. [...] Grande and Bennett eventually make their way up the rooftop after subduing the old man again, who had caught up with them. The camera is then set down, and shows the two of them embracing each other one last time until the comet crashes down, destroys everything and leads the Earth to an end.|$|E

2500|$|The {{official}} soundtrack album, Radiant Historia Original Soundtrack, {{was released}} through TEAM Entertainment on December 15, 2010. Critical {{reception of the}} album was positive among music critics. The game's reviewers also praised Shimomura's work. Atlus produced a CD containing five piano arrangements of tracks from the game, including a piano rendition of [...] "Historia". Titled Radiant Historia: Piano Selection, it released alongside the game for the first printing. The piano collection was suggested by Shimomura by Atlus. The core concept was for the tracks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>calm</b> and soothing even if their original forms were more energetic. The tracks were arranged for piano by Sachiko Miyano and performed by Febian Reza Pane. The recording sessions were produced and supervised by Shimomura. Reaction to the piano album was generally negative.|$|E
2500|$|Up to {{the last}} minute, Harkins and Felt {{remained}} unaware of the imminent coup, despite Đôn's fidgety behaviour. The pair had {{paid a visit to}} Đôn to discuss military issues at 09:15, but instead of the Vietnamese general hosting his American visitors as Joint General Staff headquarters, as was the norm, Đôn went to the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam office. Although Felt was surprised, the Americans did not realise the reason for the unusual venue and then pointed at a map and wondered why two airborne battalions appeared to be idling. Đôn replied that they were going into battle, and Harkins nodded, unaware that they were entering Saigon. Harkins had told the generals earlier that he opposed a coup, so Đôn avoided the topic. Felt had been told of the existence of coup plans by Lodge, who falsely informed him that it was not imminent, saying [...] "There isn't a Vietnamese general with hair enough on his chest to make it go." [...] Felt later said that Đôn appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>calm</b> and composed.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{members of}} the cast {{described}} Hustle's filming schedule as incredibly hectic. Vaughn said that [...] " [...] was offered to me, and I was told {{to get on a}} plane an hour after I got the phone call and start shooting the following day." [...] Speaking in 2009 after filming four series of the show, Lester explained that [...] "when we start shooting Hustle we film two episodes concurrently, with the scenes out of sequence. Knowing where you are in the intricate plots at any one moment is... challenging". Murray, by contrast, claimed that the hardest scene to film was from the fourth episode, when Danny loses spectacularly to Stacie in strip poker and ends up entirely naked. [...] "It was the toughest scene for me of the entire six months we spent filming the series... Stacie is supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>calm,</b> cool and collected... she looks down, checks him out and casually and suavely makes a comment. I kept looking down, dissolving into fits of laughter and was almost unable to deliver my line. So all you'll see is me laughing".|$|E
2500|$|Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on 21 April 1966, and {{approximately}} {{one hundred thousand}} Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on Palisadoes Airport in Kingston, having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was coming to visit them. Spliffs and chalices were openly smoked, causing [...] "a haze of ganja smoke" [...] to drift through the air. Haile Selassie arrived at the airport {{but was unable to}} come down the mobile steps of the airplane, as the crowd rushed the tarmac. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally, Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras Mortimer Planno, a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the emperor's descent. Planno re-emerged and announced to the crowd: [...] "The Emperor has instructed me to tell you <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>calm.</b> Step back and let the Emperor land". This day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement, and it is still commemorated by Rastafari as Grounation Day, the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after 2 November, the emperor's Coronation Day.|$|E
