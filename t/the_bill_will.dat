5|$|If the Council {{does make}} an adverse report, Parliament may amend {{the bill to}} rid it of any {{differentiating}} measures before sending {{it back to the}} Council for inspection. The MP having charge of the bill may give two clear days' notice of the amendments he or she proposes to move in Parliament to the provisions of the bill that were adversely reported upon by the Council. The bill then stands recommitted to a committee of the whole Parliament on those provisions, and the proposed amendments are considered. Parliament then resumes, and the MP having charge of the bill reports whether the amendments were agreed to by the committee. If so, the MP moves that the amended bill should be resubmitted to the Council. There is uncertainty as to whether the Council will have to make another report within any time limit, or if <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>will</b> then be directly presented to the President for assent.|$|E

25|$|SSS {{can make}} {{changes to the}} Handbook {{as long as there}} is a {{proposal}} made and brought to Senate's attention. If the motion passes, it goes to the Principal. If the Principal agrees, the proposed bill would then go to the Superintendent to look at. If the Superintendent agrees with the bill, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>will</b> then be brought upon the School Board to decide the proposed bill should be passed. If the bill passes, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>will</b> then be written into effect the next school year, and the affected area will be changed in the Handbook. Newfound SSS has changed some of the policies around school, including the usage of technology, as well as eating in the academic wings. If the motion fails, the proposal will go back to the appropriate committee in which they will make the necessary edits in order to improve the proposal. Most of the time the motion fails is because of the wording, or the proposal is not deemed necessary. In order for such proposal to pass, the motion must have the majority ruling in favor of the proposal.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 2016, Campeche's Governor, Alejandro Moreno Cárdenas, {{submitted}} a same-sex marriage bill to Congress. Shortly after, {{the two largest}} parties in the state, PRI and PAN, announced {{their support for the}} bill. On 4 May 2016, the President of the Board of Directors announced that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>will</b> be voted upon sometime in May 2016. On 10 May 2016, the state Congress voted 34–1 to approve the same-sex marriage bill. It was published in the official state gazette on 16 May 2016 and came into effect on 20 May 2016. The law, however, did not legalize adoption for same-sex couples.|$|E
25|$|The MP {{introducing}} <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>will</b> generally make {{a recommendation}} that the bill be considered by an appropriate Select Committee (see below). Sometimes, it will be recommended that a special Committee be formed, usually when the bill is particularly important or controversial. The House then votes {{as to whether the}} bill should be sent to the Committee for deliberation. It is not uncommon for a bill to be voted to the Select Committee stage even by parties which do not support it — since Select Committees can recommend amendments to bills, parties will often not make a final decision on whether to back a bill until the Second Reading.|$|E

25|$|On April 20, 2016, it was {{announced}} that Alexander Hamilton would remain the primary face on the $10 bill, {{due in part to the}} sudden popularity of the first Treasury Secretary after the success of the musical Hamilton on Broadway. It was simultaneously announced that Harriet Tubman's likeness would appear on the $20 bill while Andrew Jackson would now appear on the reverse with the White House. The new design for the reverse of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>will</b> feature the heroes of the Women's Suffrage Movement, including Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul, Sojourner Truth, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Lucretia Mott, and the participants of the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession who marched in favor of full voting rights for women in the United States.|$|E
25|$|As regards a bill {{mentioned}} in paragraph 1, the President, acting {{in accordance with}} the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the Tribunal is of the opinion that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal feels that the bill does have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill, the Prime Minister may direct that the bill be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>will</b> only become law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred the Bill to a Constitutional Tribunal, the bill is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill {{mentioned in}} paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules that the bill has a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put the bill to a referendum. This ensures that changes to the President's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.|$|E

500|$|The Indiana Senate and House of Representatives each [...] {{have several}} {{committees}} that {{are charged with}} overseeing {{certain areas of the}} state. Committees vary in size, from three to eleven members. The committees are chaired by senior members of the majority party. Senators and representatives can be members of multiple committees. Most legislation begins within the committees who have responsibility for the area that <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>will</b> affect. Once approved by a committee, a bill can be entered into the agenda for debate and vote in the full chamber. Although not common, bills can be voted on by the full house without going through the committee process.|$|E
500|$|To become law, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>will</b> {{need to be}} {{included}} in a final version of tax legislation from the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, pass both the House and the Senate, and finally be signed by the President. [...] In 2005, President Bush established an advisory panel on tax reform that examined several national sales tax variants including aspects of the FairTax and noted several concerns. These included uncertainties as to the revenue that would be generated, and difficulties of enforcement and administration, which made this type of tax undesirable to recommend in their final report. [...] The panel did not examine the FairTax as proposed in the legislation. The FairTax received visibility in the 2008 presidential election on the issue of taxes and the IRS, with several candidates supporting the bill. A poll in 2009 by Rasmussen Reports found that 43% of Americans would support a national sales tax replacement, with 38% opposed to the idea; the sales tax was viewed as fairer by 52% of Republicans, 44% of Democrats, and 49% of unaffiliateds. [...] President Barack Obama did not support the bill, arguing for more progressive changes to the income and payroll tax systems. [...] President Donald Trump has proposed to lower overall income taxation and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three.|$|E
2500|$|Cox aims {{to prevent}} {{discrimination}} against Muslim women and 'jurisdiction creep' in Islamic tribunals, {{which would be}} forced to acknowledge the primacy of English law under a bill introduced to the House of Lords in May 2012. [...] <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>will</b> introduce an offence carrying a five-year jail sentence for anyone falsely claiming or implying that sharia courts or councils have legal jurisdiction over family or criminal law. The bill, which will apply to all arbitration tribunals if passed, aims to tackle discrimination, which its supporters say is inherent in the courts, by banning the sharia practice of giving woman's testimony only half the weight of men's. [...] In a similar way to Jewish Beth Din courts, sharia tribunals can make verdicts in cases involving financial and property issues which, under the Arbitration Act 1996, are enforceable by county courts or the high court.|$|E

2500|$|June 15, 2005 - It is {{appearing}} {{less likely}} <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>will</b> {{be out of}} 3rd reading stage by the time MPs recess from the summer on June 23 (unless sittings area extended) due to Conservatives stalling the budget bill (C-48), and the Government wants to deal with C-48 before C-38. The Government can invoke closure and force a vote on C-38 immediately, but it seems unlikely to happen since even the Liberal Government has disgruntled MPs against C-38 [...] that want more debate now that the committee has reported. Weeks ago, Pat O'Brien left the Liberal caucus over the same-sex marriage legislation, that he felt was being rushed through the Commons. Cotler says the Government is where they expected to be which is now at Report Stage and that although {{he wants to see}} the legislation passed by the summer, he's only the Minister of Justice.|$|E
2500|$|Economist Arnold Kling {{said the}} bill [...] "maximizes {{rent-seeking}} (favoritism toward particular businesses) and minimizes carbon reduction". Other economists {{have argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>will</b> create significant financial costs. The Wall Street Journal accused the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) of significantly underestimating the bill's ultimate costs, pointing out supposed flaws in its calculations. The Wall Street Journal also suggested that the bill's costs would disproportionately affect lower-income households, for which the CBO estimates did not account. The New York Times reported that the bill's provisions to levy tariffs on Chinese imports due to carbon emissions could provoke a trade war. The Competitive Enterprise Institute argued that the bill was essentially the [...] "largest tax hike in world history". The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the petroleum and natural gas industry, said the bill would place [...] "disproportionate burden on all consumers of gasoline, diesel fuel, heating oil, jet fuel, propane and other petroleum products", and by 2035, it would cause gasoline prices in excess of $4.00 per gallon by today's standards.|$|E
