50|$|The {{principle}} is of ancient origin; as regards goods and chattels {{it was part}} of the ancient customs of London and the province of York, and as regards land descending <b>in</b> <b>coparcenary</b> (under which only one heir can claim an inheritance) it was always part of the common law of England under the name of hotchpot. Land which belongs or would belong to a child as heir need not be brought in to the common fund, even though such land was given during the father's life.|$|R
40|$|Introduced in the Rajya Sabha Monsoon Session, 2005. Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 {{deals with}} {{devolution}} of interest {{of a male}} Hindu <b>in</b> <b>coparcenary</b> property and recognises the rule of devolution by survivorship {{among the members of}} the coparcenary. The retention of the Mitakashara coparcenary property without including the females in it means that the females cannot inherit in ancestral property as their male counterparts do. The law by excluding the daughter from participating <b>in</b> the <b>coparcenary</b> ownership not only contributes to her discrimination on the ground of gender but also has led to oppression and negation of her fundamental right of equality guaranteed by the Constitution. Several states inlcluding Kerala have made necessary changes in the law giving equal right to daughters <b>in</b> Hindu Mitakshara <b>coparcenary</b> property. This amendment is proposed with the intention to remove the discrimination as contained in section 6 of Act by giving equal rights to daughters in the Hindu Mitakshara coparcenary property as the sons have. These proposals are based on the recommendations of the Law Commission of India as contained in its 174 th Report on â€œProperty Rights of Women: Proposed Reform under the Hindu Lawâ€.

50|$|<b>Tenants</b> <b>in</b> common have {{no right}} of survivorship, meaning that if one <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> common dies, that <b>tenant's</b> {{interest}} <b>in</b> the property {{will be part of}} his or her estate and pass by inheritance to that owner's devisees or heirs, either by will, or by intestate succession. Also, as each <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> common has an interest in the property, they may, {{in the absence of any}} restriction agreed to between all the <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common, sell or otherwise deal with the interest in the property (e.g. mortgage it) during their lifetime, like any other property interest.|$|R
500|$|There {{was another}} estate (manor) {{in the parish}} at that time called Sifletone, which also belonged to the Bishop of Baieux (Bayeux), and was entered into the Domesday Book: [...] "Vitalis holds of the bishop (of Baieux) Sifletone. It was taxed at three yokes. The arable land is one carucate. In demesne there is one caracate and an half, and six villeins, with one borderer, having half a carucate. There are six servants, and one mill of 10s. There are ten acres of meadow, and thirty acres of pasture.

In the time of king Edward the Confessor, two men, Leuuin and Uluuin, held this land <b>in</b> <b>coparcenary,</b> and could turn themselves over with this land to whomever they would." ...|$|R

40|$|The term 2 ̆ 2 {{partnership}} estates 2 ̆ 2 is used {{to designate}} a certain class of resulting trusts. These particular resulting trusts are classed with joint estates because, as a usual thing, the legal title is held by {{all the members of}} a partnership as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common, and in equity, the partners are considered as joint tenants for the purpose of administering the trust. But the legal title is not necessarily held by all the members as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common; for it may be vested in one of the partners as <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> severalty; in which case there is not only the resulting partnership trust, but an additional subordinate resulting trust to the partners as equitable <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common. The legal title may be in one or in several. As will be shown, the partners bear a two-fold relation to the beneficial interest in the property; for each has a separate and distinct lien on the property for any balance which may be found to be due him on an accounting; and as to this lien, his interest is purely potential: the balance on an accounting having been paid, the partners now own the residue of the beneficial interest as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common...|$|R
