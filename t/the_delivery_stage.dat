40|$|In recent years, {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) {{have attracted}} significant attentions from both academia and industry, and are widely proposed for {{a broad range of}} applications, where data collection is often a core service to facilitate sensed data being forwarded to a central base station for further processing. Powered by batteries and using wireless communications, a WSN is more flexible than its wired counterpart. However, wireless losses/collisions may be prevalent when nodes communicate with each other. Moreover, the lifetime of a WSN largely depends on that of individual nodes, which is further constrained by the generally non-replenishable batteries. Energy-efficiency thus becomes a critical concern that must be addressed. In practice, using WSNs for data collection can be broken into three major stages, namely, deployment, message dissemination and data <b>delivery.</b> <b>The</b> deployment <b>stage</b> focuses on best deploying the network in the sensing field. In the message dissemination stage, network setup/management and/or collection command messages are disseminated from the base station to all sensor nodes, where the challenges lie in how to disseminate messages with low transmission costs and latencies in the presence of error-prone wireless communications. <b>The</b> data <b>delivery</b> <b>stage</b> fulfills <b>the</b> main task of data collection. Based on the information indicated by the message dissemination stage, sensed data are gathered at different nodes and delivered to the base station, with application-specified Quality-of-Service requirements to be fulfilled. In this thesis, we tackle the design issues for each of these stages. For the deployment stage, we propose to use relay nodes for traffic relaying and suggest that the deployment {{should be aware of the}} data traffic to be collected by specific applications. We then discuss how to efficiently disseminate message in a low duty-cycle scenario, where nodes alternate between active and dormant states to conserve energy and thus extend the network lifetime. To address the traffic accumulation problem, particularly in <b>the</b> data <b>delivery</b> <b>stage,</b> we take a case study on high-rise structure monitoring application and propose to use elevators to facilitate data collection.

40|$|In the {{automotive}} segment, quality and reliability {{can no longer}} distinguish a premium vehicle from other automotive brands. Therefore premium manufacturers must compete on the perceived quality that a product exhibits, known as craftsmanship.

This means a company's New Product Introduction (NPI) process can have a significant effect upon craftsmanship. Also with more complex design and manufacturing processes being outsourced to the supply base, the relationship between suppliers and the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) is critical to craftsmanship definition and execution.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} coordinated scheduling of production and delivery subject to the production window constraint and the delivery capacity constraint. We have a planning horizon consisting {{of one or more}} delivery times each with a unique delivery capacity. There is a set of jobs each with a committed delivery time, processing time, production window, and profit. The company can earn the profit only if the job is processed in its production window and delivered before its committed delivery time. From the company point of view, we are interested in selecting a subset of jobs to process and deliver so as to maximize the total profit subject to the delivery capacity constraint. We consider both the single delivery time case and the multiple delivery time case. In both cases, the problem is strongly NP-hard since the subproblems at the production stage and at <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>stage</b> are both strongly NP-hard. Our goal is to design approximation algorithms. Suppose the jobs are k-disjoint, that is, the jobs can be partitioned into k lists of jobs such that the jobs in each list have disjoint production windows. When k is a constant, we developed the first PTAS for the single delivery case. For multiple delivery time case, we also develop a PTAS when the number of delivery times is a constant as well...|$|E

40|$|Managing the {{pesticide}} safety risk to provide end markets with safe {{fruit and vegetables}} raises complex issues due to the diversity and stringent nature {{of public and private}} safety requirements and the high cost of controlling the product and the production process. More often than not, this leads to the development of diversified and more integrated relationships between growers and their buyers. Our paper is a case study of the hybrid forms underlying such relationships. It begins by developing the analytical framework, drawing on transaction cost, positive agency, and property rights theories with a special focus on the model proposed by Ménard (The Handbook of Organizational Economics, Princeton, 1066 – 1108, 2013), positioning the hybrid forms along the two dimensions of decision rights and strategic resources. It then presents a selection of quantitative and qualitative findings obtained from data collected through face-to-face interviews with managers of fresh produce shipping firms in France and Chile. Both case studies confirm that the level of centralization increases with the buyer’s commercial reputation, the level of customer safety requirements (a key component in the marketing strategy of the buyer), and the level of asset specificity which is mostly embedded in the technical assistance and training provided by the buyer to the growers. Moreover, our paper establishes a clear divide between firms that only control product safety at <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>stage</b> and firms that also control safety throughout the production process and may take decisions on behalf of the grower before harvesting...|$|E

Among them, {{one of the most}} important applications is Sensor Data Collections, where sensed data are collected at all or some of the sensor nodes and forwarded to a central base station for further processing. In this paper, we present a survey on recent advances in this research area. We first highlight the special features of sensor data collection in WSNs, by comparing with both wired sensor data collection network and other WSN applications. With these features in mind, we then discuss the issues and prior solutions on the utilizations of WSNs for sensor data collection. Based on different focuses of previous research works, we describe the basic taxonomy and propose to break down the networked wireless sensor data collection into three major stages, namely, the deployment stage, the control message dissemination <b>stage</b> and <b>the</b> data <b>delivery</b> <b>stage.</b> In each stage, we then discuss the issues and challenges, followed by a review and comparison of the previously proposed approaches and solutions, striving to identify the research and development trend behind them.

Given that volunteering has become integral to <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> and <b>staging</b> of sporting events, it is important that research not only considers reasons and motivations for volunteering, but how participants cope and manage once their volunteer journey ends. The paper considers the notion of ‘role exit’ and contributes insight based on interviews with participants after an event to understand their feelings and emotions. The significance of this research is understanding exiting emotions and experiences, but because a lot of emphasis is placed on preparing volunteers ahead of an event, the end of the volunteer journey is often abrupt and therefore left underexplored. To ensure that the needs of contemporary volunteers are adequately managed, {{it is important to consider}} how individuals are impacted by volunteering and also how they reflect on experiences afterwards. Three themes that emerge from this study include: (1) sadness and loss; (2) transitioning emotions; and (3) coping and coming to terms.

40|$|This study investigates {{whether all}} {{expected}} costs {{over the life}} cycle of metallurgical research projects are included in initial, normal and final cost estimates, and whether these costs are managed throughout a project’s life cycle since there is not enough emphasis on the accurate estimation of costs and their management over {{the life cycle of}} metallurgical research projects. The study also determines during which phase of the life cycle of metallurgical research projects’ costs are normally determined, during which phase most of the costs are incurred, and during which phase costs are managed. Project life cycles, techniques of cost estimation and cost management are examined. A survey was used to gather information by means of face-to-face and telephonic interviews, as well as an electronic questionnaire. The total population of entities in South Africa that conduct metallurgical research projects is small, numbering only 12 in all. The ten entities that conducted the largest metallurgical research projects in terms of average size were selected for this study. The conclusion drawn from the survey was that all costs over the life cycle of metallurgical research projects are not taken into account in the initial cost estimate of a project. Costs are mainly managed during the growth phase of a project and not during the introduction phase, when 80 % of the costs are normally committed. The implication of this is that cost estimates for metallurgical research projects may not be accurate and costs are not necessarily managed properly throughout the life cycle of such projects. This may lead to cost overruns of project budgets, project budgets being depleted before <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>stage</b> and research sections running at a loss. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary The South Staffordshire Physical Activity Care Pathway (SS PACP) is a 'pilot' pathway {{that builds}} on the {{experience}} of the 'London' pilot, but was intended to differ in two key regards. Firstly, the SS PACP draws on Lifestyle Advisors (Health Trainers) to deliver the brief intervention stage of the pathway, and secondly, the SS PACP is being implemented in an area with a lower proportion of the population drawn from urban areas. Further fundamental differences were introduced during the development of the SS PACP, including a recruitment method that was not targeted at any particular group, and no screening via physical activity index (PAI) scores. Although 623 patients completed an enhanced general practice physical activity questionnaire (GP PAQ), only 124 (i. e., 20 %) indicated that they should be contacted by the lifestyle advisors. Interestingly, compared with those not requesting contact, those requesting contact {{were significantly more likely to}} have a high body mass index (BMI) and a low physical activity index (PAI). It was revealed that a lack of information at the point of completing the GP PAQ may have deterred a considerable number of patients from requesting contact from the lifestyle team. In addition, it appeared likely that investment in positive information emphasising the variety of physical activity opportunities and approaches, provided at the point of completing the GP PAQ, would offset preconceptions about potential barriers and align with common preferences. The provision of an adequate variety of physical activity opportunities and approaches would require 'start-up' investment, but the approach should become sustainable with increasing volume of patients progressing through the pathway. The cost of delivering the pathway is modest, so further investment would seem appropriate. Further investment in training to ensure greater 'buy-in' and familiarity with the pathway, along with enhanced communication systems between key stakeholders, should be a priority. Given the way in which this pilot PACP unfolded, it was evident at an early stage that this evaluation would have to focus on the 'upstream' factors and experiences at the initial stages of the pathway. As a result, further evaluation is required of <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>stage,</b> and the efficacy of the brief intervention in changing behaviour over the long-term.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{case study}} research into private vehicle use {{as it relates}} to the process of regeneration in the Thames Gateway. In doing so, it investigates two key contemporary transport policy issues. The first is the burgeoning debate surrounding the nature and extent of the relationship between transport investment and economic activity. Secondly, it explores the ways and means of encouraging more environmentally sustainable and equitable forms and levels of personal mobility. It argues that, in their present form, regeneration strategies will undermine attempts to promote and implement sustainable transport policies in the area. Part One of the thesis is a review of the theoretical literature and central government policy that focuses on the role of transportation in the regeneration process. It explores the implications of the new sustainability agenda for private car use against the background of the Thames Gateway. It concludes that the Thames Gateway offers both the physical opportunity for, and the legislative will to plan land use and transport together in an integrated manner. It recognises that the strategy needs to be capable of supporting the increased need for accessibility which regeneration requires, whilst simultaneously reducing many of the negative impacts of unfettered use of the private car. The chapter identifies a number of potential constraints on the realisation of such an approach at <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>stage.</b> Part Two presents the findings of the first stage of the empirical research. Through an analysis of local plans and proposals and interviews with key actors, it investigates the extent to which centrally defined policy is being adopted and applied at the local point of delivery. It finds that, despite incorporation of the rhetoric of sustainability within local development plans, fundamental contradictions in terms of the principles of sustainability exist within the transport policy statements of some authorities. Furthermore, sustainable policy aims, as they relate to planning the location and transportation needs of new developments, are often not applied in practice. Part Three assesses the implications of the current transport strategy on private car use in the Thames Gateway for future sustainability targets. It uses the data collected through the research from a local travel survey of car users, currently resident in the Thames Gateway area, to make projections for future car use in the context of a regenerated scenario, developed according to the present land use and transport policy framework. Future levels of CO 2 emissions arising from private vehicle use are estimated on the basis of current car use, identified within the survey sample population and proportionately extrapolated to the wider population. These are set against the wider context of national figures for CO 2 emissions and internationally binding government agreements to reduce these by the year 2005. On the basis of the evidence presented, the research concludes that the projected levels of CO 2 emissions arising from increased private vehicle use in the Thames Gateway, as a outcome of the regeneration process and based on a 'do nothing' transport policy scenario, run counter to the principles of sustainability...|$|E
40|$|The `Preliminary Low-Level Waste Feed Staging Plan` was updated {{to reflect}} the latest {{requirement}} in the Tank Waste Remediation Privatization Request for Proposals (RFP) and amendments. The updated plan develops the sequence and transfer schedule for retrieval of DST supernate by the management and integration contractor and <b>delivery</b> of <b>the</b> <b>staged</b> supernate to the private low-activity waste contractors for treatment. Two DSTs are allocated as intermediate staging tanks. A transfer system conflict analysis provides part of the basis for determining transfer system upgrade requirements to support both low-activity and high-level waste feed <b>delivery.</b> <b>The</b> intermediate <b>staging</b> tank architecture and retrieval system equipment are provided as a planning basis until design requirements documents are prepared. The actions needed to successfully implement the plan are identified. These include resolution of safety issues and changes to the feed envelope limits, minimum order quantities, and desired batch sizes...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Infection with Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus – GBS) is a {{frequent}} cause of serious complications in the neonatal period. Circa 10 – 30 % of pregnant women are carriers of this streptococcus. Current prophylaxis of GBS infections is an elementary way of defining {{whether there is a}} risk of the child’s infection. The achieved research result determines further perinatal proceedings. Aim of the research: To determine how such factors as age, residence, education, and current women’s parity influence their awareness concerning prophylaxis of infections with Streptococcus agalactiae. The research also analysed women’s knowledge of threats to their health related to the presence of GBS infections. Material and methods : Analysis of 164 author’s questionnaires completed by women giving birth at the labour ward in <b>the</b> early <b>delivery</b> <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> results were analysed in view of statistical accordance of measurable qualities by means of c 2 test. For statistical conclusions, the significance level of p < 0. 05 was adopted. Results and conclusions: Older pregnant women in comparison with the younger ones more frequently realise the importance of the GBS prophylaxis. Women from the urban environment have greater awareness of the GBS prophylaxis than women from the rural environment. An increase in the level of education is related to an increase in the GBS prophylaxis awareness. Women in their first pregnancy have a greater knowledge of the standards of pregnancy proceedings connected with GBS than women who have already given birth to a child...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Copper is {{essential}} micronutrient {{and has an}} important role in the human body. The serum copper increases during pregnancy and is doubled at full term. Lower levels of serum copper in pregnancy are connected with some pathological conditions. Objective. The aim of this study was to estimate the levels of serum copper in normal and pathological pregnancies, comparing them with values of serum copper in non-pregnant women, to determine if serum copper is lower in some pathological pregnancies and if this is of some importance. Methods. A total of 2170 plasma samples for copper analyses were made in the following groups: healthy non-pregnant women; healthy pregnant women from the 5 th- 40 th gestational week, during <b>the</b> first <b>delivery</b> <b>stage</b> and during <b>the</b> first three postpartum weeks, in pregnant women with habitual abortion, imminent abortion, abortion in progress, missed abortion (9 th- 24 th weeks), missed labour and premature rupture of membranes (29 th- 40 th weeks). Levels of serum copper were determined by colorimetric technique of bathocuproin with disulphate as a chromogen. Results. Serum copper values in non-pregnant women range from 11. 6 - 25. 8 μmol/L. In healthy pregnant women, there is a constant trend of the increase of serum copper. The mean serum copper values revealed three significant peaks at the 22 nd, 27 th and 35 th gestational week. Serum copper values in the patients with some pathological pregnancies in relation to the serum copper values of the healthy pregnant women were significantly lower. Conclusion. Serum copper values can be used as an indicator of some pathological pregnancies...|$|R
