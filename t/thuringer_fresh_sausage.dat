40|$|In this study, a polyphasic {{approach}} {{was used to}} study the ecology of <b>fresh</b> <b>sausages</b> and to characterize populations of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The microbial profile of <b>fresh</b> <b>sausages</b> was monitored from the production day to the 10 th day of storage at 4 °C. Samples were collected on days 0, 3, 6, and 10, and culture-dependent and -independent methods of detection and identification were applied. Traditional plating and isolation of LAB strains, which were subsequently identified by molecular methods, {{and the application of}} PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to DNA and RNA extracted directly from the <b>fresh</b> <b>sausage</b> samples allowed the study in detail of the changes in the bacterial and yeast populations during storage. Brochothrix thermosphacta and Lactobacillus sakei were the main populations present. In particular, B. thermosphacta was present throughout the process, as determined by both DNA and RNA analysis. Other bacterial species, mainly Staphylococcus xylosus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and L. curvatus, were detected by DGGE. Moreover, an uncultured bacterium and an uncultured Staphylococcus sp. were present, too. LAB strains isolated at day 0 were identified as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, L. casei, and Enterococcus casseliflavus, and on day 3 a strain of Leuconostoc mesenteroides was identified.

Forty kilograms of (20 kg camel and 20 kg beef) meat and 5 Kg of camel subcutaneous fat were used. Camel and beef meat as well as <b>fresh</b> <b>sausage</b> treatments were analyzed to determine proximate chemical composition, objective color, pH, oxidative rancidity (TBA value), cooking loss, water holding capacity, and sensory evaluation. Data were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance pertaining to factorial arrangement by SPSS version 10. 05 -computer program. The results showed that camel meat was significantly different from beef. It had higher moisture, pH, WHC, lightness (L), redness (a), and yellowness (b) colour and lower protein, fat, ash, cooking loss and oxidative rancidity -TBA value compared with beef. The interaction between the used levels of camel meat and storage periods was not significant (P> 0. 05). Increasing the level of camel meat from 0 % level to 100 % in <b>fresh</b> <b>sausage</b> formula resulted in a significant increase of moisture percentage, Lightness (L), redness (a) and yellowness (b) values and a decrease of the fat percentage. The protein and ash content were not significantly different among the treatments. Cooking loss percentage decreased significantly.

Increasing the storage period from day one to day 14 at - 18 Cْ resulted in a significant improvement of the WHC, increase of the PH, oxidative iv rancidity-TBA values and colour co-ordinates yellowness (b). Cooking loss, drip loss and colour co-ordinates lightness (L) decreased significantly while shrinkage and redness (a) decreased not significantly.
