Cherry's decision to advance the storylines by six months for the third season premiere came {{as a response to}} the series' problematic second season. Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season, as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season's storylines. [...] "One of the problems I had with Season 2 was that I had to keep going with the previous year's stuff," [...] he explained. [...] "I learned you have to go back to square one to build up the tension again." [...] The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed: [...] "I've been at Marc's door plenty of times [...] going, 'You've got to be kidding.'" [...] Cherry stated that the six-month time jump would help the storylines develop quicker, as the second season's storylines lagged. He added: [...] "And I'm going to work much harder <b>to</b> <b>criss-cross</b> all the women's stories so that their lives bump up against each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|The main {{thoroughfare}} of Huntington Beach, Beach Boulevard, was originally a cattle route {{for the main}} industry of the Rancho. [...] Since its time as a parcel of the enormous Spanish land grant, Huntington Beach has undergone many incarnations. One time it was known as Shell Beach, the town of Smeltzer, and then Gospel Swamp for the revival meetings that were held in the marshland where the community college Golden West College can currently be found. Later it became known as Fairview and then Pacific City, as it developed into a tourist destination. In order to secure access to the Pacific Electric Red Car lines that used <b>to</b> <b>criss-cross</b> Los Angeles and ended in Long Beach, Pacific City ceded enormous power to railroad magnate Henry E. Huntington, and thus became a city whose name has been written into corporate sponsorship, and like much {{of the history of}} Southern California, boosterism.|$|E
