The fort, named Fort Prince George, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and built Fort Duquesne.|$|E
50|$|After Hartmann {{concluded}} {{his investigation}} {{he returned the}} negatives to UPI, which then informed the <b>Trents</b> about them. In 1970 the <b>Trents</b> asked Philip Bladine, {{the editor of the}} News-Register (the successor of the Telephone-Register), for the negatives; the <b>Trents</b> noted that they had never been paid for the negatives and thus wanted them back. Bladine asked UPI to return the negatives, which it did. However, for some reason Bladine never told the <b>Trents</b> that the negatives had been returned. In 1975 the negatives were found in the files of the News-Register by Bruce Maccabee, an optical physicist for the U.S. Navy and a ufologist. After completing his own study of the photos, Maccabee ensured that the photos were returned to the <b>Trents.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1771, {{the people}} of Chester, fearing that the {{construction}} of the <b>Trent</b> and Mersey Canal would divert trade away from their city to Liverpool, announced in the Press that they would be applying to build a canal between Middlewich, on the <b>Trent</b> and Mersey, and Chester. The city was at the time served by the River Dee, and the River Dee Company had recently spent £80,000 on improvements to the river, but they realised that without a connection to the growing canal network, there was little future for the river or the Port of Chester. The idea had first been raised three years earlier, when merchants suggested a line from the <b>Trent</b> and Mersey to near Runcorn. There were no objections from the Corporation of Liverpool, but the canal company was non-committal. By 1770, the plans were a little clearer, with a main line from Chester to Middlewich and a branch to Nantwich. Although the Corporation of Chester subscribed £100 towards the scheme, and the Societies and Clubs of Chester put up another £2,000, there was little enthusiasm for it. Neither the Weaver Navigation nor the <b>Trent</b> and Mersey were supportive, as both might have lost some trade if the canal were built, and when the Duke of Bridgewater was approached for support, he replied that provided the canal did not physically link with the <b>Trent</b> and Mersey at Middlewich, he would not oppose the plans. Despite attempts at flattery, the Duke would not alter his position, and so the Company promoting the bill in parliament began with a serious disadvantage.|$|E

5|$|After holding Arkansas {{scoreless}} {{on their}} first possession of the third quarter, Alabama's Marquis Maze returned a Dylan Breeding punt 83-yards for a touchdown and a 24–7 Crimson Tide lead. On Alabama's next possession, <b>Trent</b> Richardson caught a screen pass from McCarron and ran it 61-yards for a touchdown and extended the Alabama lead to 31–7. The Razorbacks scored on the following possession when Wilson threw his second touchdown pass of the afternoon after he connected on a 19-yard pass to Cobi Hamilton. Eddie Lacy then scored the final points of the game late in the third on a four-yard touchdown run to give the Crimson Tide the 38–14 victory. The Alabama defense only allowed 17 rushing and 226 of total offense to the Razorbacks in the victory. For his 235 all-purpose yards and touchdown reception, <b>Trent</b> Richardson was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week.
