5|$|Critics {{classify}} Little Gidding as a poem of {{fire with}} an emphasis on purgation and the Pentecostal fire. The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter, with attention paid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of summer. The images of snow, which provoke desires for a spiritual life, transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire, earth, air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four. Following this is a discussion on death and destruction, things unaccomplished, and regret for past events.|$|E
5|$|December 2012 {{marked the}} {{conclusion}} of a b'ak'tun—a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in Central America prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the Olmec, it has become closely associated with the Maya civilization, whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900AD. The writing system of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered, meaning that a corpus of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the European conquest.|$|E

5|$|In Mexico, Paine {{produced}} rainfall along {{much of the}} coastline, with maxima in inland Oaxaca, Jalisco, and Sonora {{where it}} moved ashore. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the remnants of Paine in the United States, there was {{an extended period of}} heavy rainfall, which caused at least 10deaths, forced thousands of people from their homes, and resulted in heavy flooding damage. The moisture from Paine produced the highest daily rainfall for any station in Oklahoma. Severe river flooding occurred along the Osage and Arkansas Rivers. The overall flooding event caused $350 million in damage, of which half came from crop losses.|$|E
