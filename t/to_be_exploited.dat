5|$|A {{number of}} Anglo-Saxon {{charters}} document {{the incorporation of}} areas of moor in estates, suggested that the area continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exploited.</b> It {{is easy to see}} why the area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who some believe based his court in the hill fort at South Cadbury. According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the Norwegian state was {{severely}} weakened. In 1389 Norway {{entered into a}} personal union with Denmark and Sweden in the Kalmar Union. As the kings resided in Denmark, Norway was gradually reduced to a provincial status, and after the Reformation most of its separate institutions were abolished. The Danish government in Copenhagen regarded Norway as a backward province <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exploited,</b> but not worthy of investment in monumental architecture. Hence, ambitious Renaissance architecture is unusual in Norway compared to other European countries.|$|E
5|$|Other rooms {{include the}} casino, where creatures gamble for either {{pleasure}} or <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exploited</b> for gold, the Workshop, where traps and doors are produced, the torture chamber, where creatures are tortured. Traps include the Sentry trap, which shoots nearby enemy creatures, the Fear trap, which scares enemies away, and the Alarm trap, which alerts its owner if it detect enemy creatures nearby. Doors block enemies while still allowing its owner's creatures passage. They come in various forms, such as Wooden, Braced, Secret, and Magic. Secret doors imitate walls, and Magic doors defend themselves by shooting enemy creatures. Bridges connect areas and facilitate transport over water and lava tiles, the latter harming most creatures and burning Wooden Bridges. Stone Bridges are immune.|$|E

5|$|The {{addition}} of the extra docking port caused {{the adoption of the}} Almaz-derived twin-chamber propulsion system first used on Salyut 3 and 5, with the two engine nozzleseach producing 2.9kilonewtons of thrustmounted peripherally {{on either side of the}} aft port. Salyut 6 introduced a Unified Propulsion System, with both the engines and the station's control thrusters running on unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, drawn from a common set of pressurized tanks, allowing the refueling capabilities of the visiting Progress tankers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exploited</b> to the maximum effect. The entire engine and fuel storage assembly was contained within an unpressurized bay at the rear of the station, which was the same diameter as the main pressurized compartment. However, the replacement of the Soyuz engine used on previous stations with the bay meant that the station kept a similar overall length to its predecessors. The main engines could not be fired if the rear docking port was in use, hence any orbital maneuvers during this time had to be performed by the visiting spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} an {{important}} need to link the economic, cultural, and ecological imperatives of development in the context of tourism enterprises, there is the key question of implementation and how the idea of sustainable tourism enterprises can be translated into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous community should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exploited,</b> or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E

25|$|Envelopment in attack: {{the central}} cross. Attacking an {{opposing}} side from the flanks using crosses from the wings {{is among the}} oldest and most effective football tactics.

It also serves to illustrate the difficulties in defending against both types of passes.|$|E
