5|$|Earliest reports put {{the death}} toll at eight, but Xinhua later revised the count several <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{confirmed}} 53 deaths by 16 November. 26 bodies were identified using DNA tests.

5|$|Sometime between May and July 1108, Henry {{addressed}} a writ to Urse and the Bishop of Worcester from Reading. The royal document commanded the sheriff not summon the shire and hundred courts to locations different than customary nor that he summon them on dates {{other than those}} normal for such courts. From this, the historian Judith Green speculates that Urse had been summoning these courts at unusual <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> fining {{those who did not}} attend. The king specifically commanded that this procedure stop and then went on to detail the various courts which would hear what types of cases and the type of procedure {{that could be used in}} what type of case.|$|E

5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. Von Neumann showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E
5|$|As players hit various objects {{around the}} field, their score goes up. At certain scores, players gain a new ball. If the ball {{falls to the}} bottom, that round is over, and the players' scores are tallied, given bonuses for their achievements. In order to prevent players from losing a ball, the game {{features}} a Ball Saver, which allows the ball to fall without being lost. This eventually goes away, however. The game has a shop system that can provide boosts for players, such one that adds a Ball Saver. Coins are collected through various means, and are used to purchase items from this shop. If all balls are lost, the game is over. The other objective {{of the game is}} to complete the Pokédex, similar to other Pokémon titles. Occasionally, a hole will open in the field, where players can either gain bonuses, such as an added Ball Saver or a score increase, or allow them to go to a special mode. There are four primary modes - Catch 'Em Mode, Egg Mode, Evolution Mode, and Travel Mode. These modes are typically activated by going through a certain path on the board three <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> entering an area on the board, such as the Sharpedo, which will activate Catch 'Em Mode.|$|E
5|$|By the First Test at Trent Bridge, Miller was {{shouldering}} most of {{the bowling}} load. He sent down 52 overs in a rain-affected match, taking match figures of 6/127. He struggled with the bat, making a duck and four. The teams headed to Lord's where Miller had to carry the pace attack without the injured Davidson and Lindwall. Crawford and Ken Mackay were called in to make their debut and support Miller with the pace duties. Australia batted first and Miller managed 28. Australia managed only 285 and Crawford injured himself, exacerbating the burden on Miller. Miller had Peter Richardson and then bowled Tom Graveney with an outswinger. England were 2/32 and their captain Peter May received an inswinger from Miller first ball, which he inside edged onto his stumps, but the bail was not dislodged. The next day, Miller beat May four <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> had Watson caught in the gully in his third over. He then removed Bailey and Trueman. Miller's 5/72 was largely responsible for England falling for 171. Australia was in difficulty at 3/69 when Miller came to bat, hitting a counterattacking 30. Australia set England 371 to win. Miller removed Graveney {{at the start of}} the run chase. Resuming the next morning, he bowled Watson, and had May and Evans both caught behind. He bowled Johnny Wardle and took his only ten-wicket match haul in Tests. Australia won by 185runs and Miller had bowled 70.1overs for the match. His knee had taken a heavy toll and Miller was given an extended break had to play purely as a batsman in the Third Test at Headingley. Australia were caught on a wet wicket in response to England's 325, and Miller top-scored with 41 and Australia were forced to follow on. He had attempted to keep Laker and Lock at bay with his pads. In the second innings, Miller fell for 26 to Laker. Australia lost by an innings, for the first time in a Test in 18years.|$|E

25|$|Instructions were {{implemented}} {{in groups of}} 12 steps, called timing pulses. The timing pulses were named TP1 through TP12. Each set of 12 timing pulses was called an instruction subsequence. Simple instructions, such as TC, executed in a single subsequence of 12 pulses. More complex instructions required several subsequences. The multiply instruction (MP) used 8 subsequences: an initial one called MP0, followed by an MP1 subsequence which was repeated 6 <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> terminated by an MP3 subsequence. This was reduced to 3 subsequences in Block II.|$|E
25|$|As the graphs show, {{small numbers}} of each instar are present {{throughout}} the year, with the numbers in each life cycle segment rising to plateau levels at particular <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> falling away again. These pictured results are from observations covering a period when climate in the whole South West Pacific Area was subject to a major weather anomaly. Continued observations may well result in {{a change in the}} shape of the curves. One graph line, that of the gravid female type within the adult group, has been shown as incomplete. Positive recordings of winter occurrences of gravids have varied from nil to very small numbers in two of the eight years.|$|E
25|$|On 17 December 1986, {{the then}} {{director}} of El Espectador, Guillermo Cano Isaza, {{was assassinated in}} front of the newspaper offices by gunmen paid by Pablo Escobar, after publishing several articles critical of Colombia's drug barons. Cano left the headquarters around 19:00 in his family station wagon. After he made a U-turn on the Avenida El Espectador, one of the hitmen approached the wagon Cano was driving, shot him in the chest four <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> fled on a motorcycle identified with the licence plate FAX84. Cano was 61 years old, and had been a journalist for 44 years. His murder is still considered unpunished. The next day, El Espectadors main headline was Seguimos adelante ("We are going on").|$|E

25|$|A loincloth {{may take}} three major forms. The first, and simplest, {{is simply a}} long strip of {{material}} which is passed between the legs and then around the waist. Archaeologists have found the remains of such loincloths made of leather dating back 7,000 years. The ancient Hawaiian malo was of this form, as are several styles of the Japanese fundoshi. Another form is usually called a cache-sexe: a triangle of cloth is provided with strings or loops, which are used to fasten the triangle between the legs and over the genitals. Egyptian king Tutankhamun (1341 BC – 1323 BC) was found buried with numerous linen loincloths of this style. An alternate form is more skirt-like: a cloth is wrapped around the hips several <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> fastened with a girdle.|$|E
25|$|Training {{in music}} {{has also been}} shown to improve verbal memory in {{children}} and adults. Participants trained in music and participants without a musical background were tested for immediate recall of words and recall of words after 15 minute delays. Word lists were presented orally to each participant 3 <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> participants recalled as many words as they could. Even when matched for intelligence, the musically trained participants tested better than non-musically trained participants. The authors of this research suggest that musical training enhances verbal memory processing due to neuroanatomical changes in the left temporal lobe, (responsible for verbal memory) which is supported by previous research. MRI has been used to show that this region of the brain is larger in musicians than non-musicians, which may be due to changes in cortical organization contributing to improved cognitive function.|$|E
25|$|A parody website cheerupwillsmith.com, {{which was}} created {{for the purpose of}} cheering up Will Smith with the {{perceived}} failure of After Earth, gained some attention in the media,. Flyers were also posted in East Village, Manhattan requesting Scientology members to see After Earth a minimum of three <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> upload a positive video for Will Smith on that website. The site has a video mockumentary of two Sea Org members, along their way to see After Earth, recorded video praises for Will Smith from strangers and cajoled them into signing a billion-year contract with the Church of Scientology. When they delivered the signatures to a local branch of the church near Times Square, a church representative told them they were impersonating the church and threatened to call the police if they do not leave. The video and the site was created by Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler of the comedy duo The Good Liars who had previously pretended to be Time Warner Cable representatives asking people how they can make service worse for customers.|$|E

25|$|Inspired by Bruce Lee and Jean-Claude Van Damme {{martial arts}} films, Petrosyan decided to begin {{training}} in Muay Thai at {{fourteen years old}} but was initially {{turned away from the}} gym for being too small. He persisted, however, and eventually started his training under Alfio Romanut at the Satori Gladiatorium Nemesis gym and had his first fight at the age of sixteen. He continues to reside in Gorizia in Northern Italy and worked as a bricklayer early in his career. Giorgio Petrosyan will take the place in Italy, with the management of the manager Carlo Di Blasi, of the international celebrity of martial arts, Paolo The Flex Biotti, official TV sparring partner of Don Wilson, considered the Italian first response to Dida Diafat, Ramon Dekkers and Pennacchio, whose career in great ascent toward the martial arts movies industry and the world title will be blocked by a mortal car accident that will take him a few years to the wheelchair, after several operations Biotti will return to fight, but only a few <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{became one of the most}} famous sports manager in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The afternoon's final {{qualifying}} session {{took place}} in similar good weather conditions to the morning's running. The Ligier drivers {{were the first to}} set quick <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the leading drivers began to complete their first runs: Schumacher took provisional pole position with a time of 1:23.139, set twentyminutes into the session, and Berger went 0.5seconds to move up to third. Five minutes later, Hill lowered the benchmark to 1:23.294; Schumacher responded with a time of 1:22.742 eight minutes afterwards; and then Hill put pole position beyond the reach of anyone else after completing a lap in 1:22.115. Schumacher was unable to improve his time on his final run, and then Hill trimmed the pole time to 1:21.952 with his own last effort of the session. It was a dominant performance from the Williams team leader, who went fastest in each of the circuit's three timing sectors, and set three distinct lap times which were all faster than Schumacher's best. Whilst Hill was delighted with his performance, Schumacher found that his Benetton was more difficult to control, and he blamed the disruptive effect of his collision with Frentzen in the morning session for the 0.8second gap between him and Hill.|$|E
