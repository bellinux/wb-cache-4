5|$|A 1996 {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} 38 different Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> S.pungens was genetically similar to S.collinitus, S.neoalbidipes, S.pseudobrevipes, S.luteus, S.brevipes, S.weaverae, and certain isolates of S.granulatus.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that wild Asiatic dayflower populations found growing on copper mine spoils in eastern China {{exhibited}} very high concentrations of copper within the plants, more so than the 48 species tested. Commelina communis had sequestered some 361mg/kg of copper, while the plant with the next highest concentration, Polygonum macrathum, had 286mg/kg. Five of the species examined, including the Asiatic dayflower, also showed high concentrations of other metals such as zinc, lead, and cadmium. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the Asiatic dayflower is a good candidate for copper mine spoil revegetation and phytoremediation.|$|E
5|$|A Chinese study {{published}} in 2001 used the molecular biological technique {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} to analyze the differences in DNA sequence between 23 A.gallica specimens collected from the Northern Hemisphere. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns observed, there are four global A.gallica subpopulations: the Chinese, European, North American–Chinese, and North American–European geographical lineages. A 2007 study on the northeastern and southwestern Chinese distribution of Armillaria, using fruit body and pure culture morphology, concluded that there are several unnamed species (Chinese biological species C, F, H, J and L) that are similar to the common A.gallica.|$|E

25|$|Another isotopic {{method has}} been {{employed}} {{to investigate whether}} protein sources in human diets in the early Anglo-Saxon varied with geographic location, or with respect to age or sex.

25|$|The Y-chromosomal {{data has}} also {{revealed}} a common Finno-Ugric ancestry for the males {{of the neighboring}} Balts, speakers of the Indo-European Baltic languages. According to the studies, Baltic males are most {{closely related to the}} Finno-Ugric-speaking Volga Finns such as the Mari, rather than to Baltic Finns. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the territories of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been settled by Finno-Ugric-speaking tribes since the early Mesolithic period.|$|E
25|$|Experimental astroecology investigates {{resources}} in planetary soils, using actual space materials in meteorites. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Martian and carbonaceous chondrite materials can support bacteria, algae and plant (asparagus, potato) cultures, with high soil fertilities. The results support that life could have survived in early aqueous asteroids and on similar materials imported to Earth by dust, comets and meteorites, {{and that such}} asteroid materials {{can be used as}} soil for future space colonies.|$|E

25|$|According to a meta-analysis, it was {{discovered}} that direct lobbying is used alongside grassroots lobbying. There is evidence that groups {{are much more likely to}} directly lobby previous allies rather than opponents. Allies are also directly lobbied if a counter lobby is brought to light. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> groups lobby in ways designed obtain the most influence for their view. When groups have strong ties to a legislator's district, those groups will use a combination of grassroots and direct lobbying, even if the legislator's original position does not support theirs, which may help groups expand their supportive coalitions. When strong district ties are not present, groups tend to rely on direct lobbying with committee allies, because they assume that their political friends will be drawn to participate with the lobbyist view.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} over Lee's plans and his officers' implementation {{of them have}} led historians to question whether the charge could have succeeded if done differently. [...] One study used a Lanchester model to examine several alternative scenarios and their outcomes. [...] <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> Lee could have captured a foothold on Cemetery Ridge if he had committed several more infantry brigades to the charge; but this likely would have left him with insufficient reserves to hold or exploit the position.|$|E
