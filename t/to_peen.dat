NdFeB films, 5 μm thick and rich in Nd, were deposited on Si/SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 substrates, with or without buffer/capping layers of Ta. The coercivity of Ta-free samples (∼ 0. 5 T) is significantly less than that achieved in samples with Ta present as a buffer and/or capping layer (1. 7 - 1. 8 T). The as-sputtered Ta layers are under strong compressive stress due <b>to</b> <b>peening.</b> During post-deposition annealing to crystallize the Nd 2 Fe 14 B phase, stresses are relieved in the Ta layer. This leads in turn to a compressive stress in the NdFeB layer, inducing extrusion of a Nd-rich phase up through the NdFeB layer.

40|$|Abstract. It is {{well known}} that shot peening has a marked benefit both in crack {{initiation}} and in early crack propagation. This effect is attributed to the compressive residual stress state at the component’s surface due <b>to</b> shot <b>peening.</b> However, little information is published about the possible effect of shot peening in long crack propagation. The fatigue behaviour under crack propagation of an advanced nickel base superalloy has been studied at elevated temperature. Two specimen’s geometries were tested representing critical regions of a compressor disc in a gas turbine aero engine. Also, two types of surface conditions were considered: as machined and shot peened, with shot peening parameters based on previous optimization studies. A set of da/dN vs ΔK curves were obtained at elevated temperature for both specimen’s surface conditions and geometries, using ΔK solutions computed via FEM related to the crack front geometries identified by beach marking imposed to the fracture surface during experimental testing. The comparative analysis of the obtained experimental data seems to evince some beneficial effect for crack sizes deeper than the compressive residual stress layer due <b>to</b> shot <b>peening,</b> even for long crack propagation...|$|R

It is shown that masking gives rise to tensile surface residual stresses adjacent <b>to</b> the <b>peened</b> area. Peening of austenitic stainless steel produces surface martensite in amounts that depend upon the composition of the steel. Transformation of retamed austenite on peening of carburised steel is found to give a substantial improvement in the surface and sub-surface residual stresses. Shot peened austenitic stainless steel is found to lose its compressive surface residual stress on fatigue testing at high levels of applied alternat-ing stress. The fatigue and corrosion fatigue properties of the shot peened stainless steel are then found to be inferior to those of as-polished steel but are superior at lower stress levels.

Fatigue life predictions were compared with several experimental fatigue tests carried out on specimens, representative of a critical region of a compressor disc in a gas turbine aero engine. The results obtained showed that total fatigue life methods, even if combined with critical distance methods, give conservative results when shot peening is considered.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{different}} shot-peening treatments {{on the reverse}} and pulsating bending fatigue behaviour of Al 7075 T 651 was studied. The fatigue improvements {{with respect to the}} unpeened condition and the influence of the peening intensity on fatigue were discussed accounting for the effects of surface modifications and residual stresses. In particular, the extent of the residual stress redistribution during loading was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. No significant residual stress relaxation was observed in samples tested to a load level corresponding to the fatigue endurance at 5 ⋅ 106 cycles. Residual stress relaxation was observed only when the material plastic flow stress was achieved during the compressive part of the fatigue load cycle. Accordingly, shot peened samples with deep sub-superficial compressive residual stress peak showed a reversed fatigue endurance level corresponding to the condition of incipient plastic flow. This phenomenon was also accompanied by subsuperficial fatigue crack initiation. On the contrary, samples tested at shorter fatigue lives or under pulsating loading conditions showed crack initiation close to the surface. The initial and the stabilised residual stress profiles were considered for discussing the improvement in the fatigue behaviour due <b>to</b> <b>peening.</b> For this purpose, a multiaxial fatigue criterion was adopted to account for the biaxial residual stress field.
