5|$|ARC is {{an audio}} link meant to replace other cables between <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>and</b> the A/V {{receiver}} or speaker system. This direction is used when the TV {{is the one}} that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment. A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment. Without ARC, the audio output from the TV needs to be routed by another cable, typically TOS-Link or coax, into the speaker system.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the Cosmic Owl joins Prismo and Jake, {{and the two}} chat in a hot tub. While {{reaching}} for chips, the Cosmic Owl unmutes <b>the</b> <b>TV,</b> <b>and</b> Jake realizes that Finn is in trouble. Prismo explains that Jake can still save Finn by using his wish, but reveals that his wish must be very specific, as Prismo's wishes {{have a tendency to}} have a monkey's paw—an ironic twist—connected to them. After coaching by Prismo, Jake wishes that the Lich's original wish had been for Finn and Jake to return home. Prismo grants the wish, and Finn and Jake are indeed transported back to Ooo. Finn has no recollection of his time in the alternate reality, but Jake does.|$|E
5|$|Game Capture HD, which {{connects to}} gaming {{consoles}} to record gameplay, {{was introduced in}} 2012.

500|$|On {{a further}} {{visit to the}} set, Gerrold was called into Coon's office. He was {{informed}} {{that he needed to}} change the name of the fuzzies, as the legal department was concerned about similarities in the name with H. Beam Piper's 1962 novel Little Fuzzy. He subsequently came up with a variety of alternative names. Through a process of elimination, he ended up with the name [...] "tribble". He took the name to Coon, who hated it. But after seeing the alternatives, he agreed to it. Gerrold turned in the script on July 17, entitled [...] "You Think You've Got Tribbles...?". While Coon disliked the name of the small furry creatures, he bought the script. Gerrold's submitted script was within the standard page count for an episode, but, when it was retyped for distribution by the production's mimeo department, it ballooned from 60 to 80 pages due to Gerrold's not having used a typewriter with the 10 point pitch (10 characters per inch) Pica standard of <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>and</b> film industry.
