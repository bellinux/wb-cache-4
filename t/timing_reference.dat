The synchronization packet consists of four 10-bit words, the first three words are always the same—0x3FF, 0, 0; the fourth consists of 3 flag bits, along with an error correcting code.

30|$|The {{proposed}} cellular firefly synchronization (CelFSync) scheme {{takes into}} account these fundamental constraints, by resorting to an out-of-phase synchronization regime, introduced in Section 3.1. CelFSync relies on two synchronization sequences, one transmitted by BSs to adjust <b>timing</b> <b>references</b> of UTs, and a second one transmitted by UTs to adjust <b>timing</b> <b>references</b> of BSs, based on rules that are established in Section 3.2. The detection of the two distinct synchronization sequences in an asynchronous environment is discussed in Section 3.3. For ease of explanation, propagation delays are neglected in this section and are treated specifically in Section 4.|$|R
5000|$|Square {{waves are}} universally {{encountered}} in digital switching circuits and are naturally generated by binary (two-level) logic devices. They {{are used as}} <b>timing</b> <b>references</b> or [...] "clock signals", because their fast transitions are suitable for triggering synchronous logic circuits at precisely determined intervals. However, as the frequency-domain graph shows, square waves contain {{a wide range of}} harmonics; these can generate electromagnetic radiation or pulses of current that interfere with other nearby circuits, causing noise or errors. To avoid this problem in very sensitive circuits such as precision analog-to-digital converters, sine waves are used instead of square waves as <b>timing</b> <b>references.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A Honeywell ring laser {{gyroscope}} {{was used for}} spin rate determination and to obtain an inertial <b>timing</b> <b>reference</b> before the MHV separated from the second stage. [...] The infrared sensor was developed by Hughes Research Laboratories. The sensor utilized a strip detector where four strips of Indium Bismuth were arranged in a cross and four strips were arranged as logarithmic spirals. As the detector was spun, the infrared target's position could be measured as it crossed the strips in the sensor's field of view. The MHV infrared detector was cooled by liquid helium from a dewar installed {{in place of the}} F-15's gun ammunition drum and from a smaller dewar located in the second stage of the ASM-135. Cryogenic lines from the second stage were retracted prior to the spin up of the MHV.|$|E

5000|$|A Frame Synchronizer {{is used in}} television/video {{production}} to synchronize the timing of a video source signal to coincide with a central <b>timing</b> <b>reference</b> (usually a color black signal aka [...] "black burst" [...] that is distributed throughout a facility). The synchronizer accomplishes this by (first digitizing in an analog scenario and) writing the incoming digital video into a frame buffer memory using {{the timing of the}} sync information contained in that video signal. Simultaneously the digital video is being read back out of the buffer by an independent timing system that is [...] "genlocked" [...] to the house <b>timing</b> <b>reference.</b> As a result, the timing or alignment of the video frame can be adjusted so that the start of the upper left corner scan line of the image occurs simultaneously on all video equipment in the work flow. This is an absolute requirement for both analog and digital systems in order to perform video effects or glitch-free source switching. Note that frame synchronization can only be performed within a given television line standard.
