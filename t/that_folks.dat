2500|$|According to Metacritic, Robyn was {{the tenth}} best-reviewed album of 2008, {{as well as}} the best-reviewed pop album of the 2000–09 decade. Slant Magazine listed it as the second best album of 2008. Entertainment Weekly ranked it at number four on its list of the 10 Best CDs of 2008, praising Robyn as [...] "an autonomous, thrillingly {{eccentric}} dance diva capable of both wrenching techno ballads [...] and saucy, whip-smart kiss-offs". Pitchfork, on its list of the Top 50 Albums of 2005, placed the album at number thirty-nine on its list and hailed Robyn as [...] "one of the best things that happened to music this year <b>that</b> <b>folks</b> {{on the wrong side of}} the Atlantic never heard". Pitchfork also included it at number sixty-eight on its list of The Top 200 Albums of the 2000s and stated that [...] "obody [...] made a more lovable pop album this decade than Robyn", describing it as [...] "an indie-as-fuck fairytale: Freed from proto-Mouseketeer teen-pop servitude and inspired by the Knife, Robyn experiments across genres, emotes from the heart, and gradually amasses a netroots fanbase." [...] Aside from critics' lists, the album received a nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards, but lost out to Daft Punk's Alive 2007.|$|E

5|$|Such eliminativists have {{developed}} different arguments to show <b>that</b> <b>folk</b> psychology is a seriously mistaken theory {{and needs to}} be abolished. They argue <b>that</b> <b>folk</b> psychology excludes from its purview or has traditionally been mistaken about many important mental phenomena that can, and are, being examined and explained by modern neurosciences. Some examples are dreaming, consciousness, mental disorders, learning processes, and memory abilities. Furthermore, they argue, folk psychology's development in the last 2,500 years has not been significant and it is therefore a stagnating theory. The ancient Greeks already had a folk psychology comparable to modern views. But in contrast to this lack of development, the neurosciences are a rapidly progressing science complex that, in their view, can explain many cognitive processes <b>that</b> <b>folk</b> psychology cannot.|$|R

500|$|Philosophers {{who argue}} against eliminativism may take several approaches. Simulation theorists, like Robert Gordon and Alvin Goldman argue <b>that</b> <b>folk</b> {{psychology}} {{is not a}} theory, but rather depends on internal simulation of others, and therefore {{is not subject to}} falsification {{in the same way that}} theories are. Jerry Fodor, among others, argues <b>that</b> <b>folk</b> psychology is, in fact, a successful (even indispensable) theory. Another view is that eliminativism assumes the existence of the beliefs and other entities it seeks to [...] "eliminate" [...] and is thus self-refuting.|$|R
