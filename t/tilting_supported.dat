To evaluate the shock characteristics of the critical components, a new concept of three-dimensional shock response spectrum was proposed. The ratio of the maximum shock response acceleration of the critical components to the peak pulse acceleration, the dimensionless pulse duration, and the frequency parameter ratio of system or the angle of <b>tilted</b> <b>support</b> spring system were three basic parameters of the three-dimensional shock response spectrum. Based on the numerical results, {{the effects of the}} peak pulse acceleration, the angle of the <b>tilted</b> <b>support</b> spring, the frequency parameter ratio, and the mass ratio on the shock response spectrum were discussed. It is shown that the effects of the angle of the <b>tilted</b> <b>support</b> spring and the frequency ratio on the shock response spectrum are particularly noticeable, increasing frequency parameter ratio of the system can obviously decrease the maximum shock response acceleration of the critical components, and the peak of the shock response of the critical components can be decreased at low frequency ratio by increasing mass ratio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Orientation of {{the body}} {{has been shown to}} adapt to {{sustained}} stance on a <b>tilted</b> <b>support</b> surface in subjects who were blindfolded or who had their eyes closed. Postural adaptation occurs even when the lower limbs are constrained, suggesting that there is central adaptation of the perception of vertical. These studies, however, were performed in the absence of visual inputs and {{it is not clear whether}} the presence of visual inputs would alter a central adaptive response to a physical displacement in space. In this study we have explored the relative contributions of surface tilt and visual velocity on the initial process of realignment to the vertical. Pitch motion of the visual field was presented at varying velocities to eight subjects (29. 9 ± 2. 8 yrs) standing quietly on a 3 deg toes-up tilt of the base of support. Onset of virtual scene and platform movement were synchronized in all trials. We hypothesized that motion of the visual world would affect the ability to return to the initial vertical position while standing on a <b>tilted</b> base of <b>support.</b> We found that in the first few seconds following stance on a <b>tilted</b> base of <b>support,</b> orientation in space was greatly influenced by the velocity of visual scene motion.

To evaluate the methodology of tilt testing, the following were examined: reproducibility of results, tilt duration, angle of tilt, method of <b>tilt</b> <b>support</b> and effect of age in patients and control subjects. Seventy-one patients with recurrent unexplained syncope underwent 60 min of 60 ° tilt; 53 (75 %) had an abnormal test with vasovagal syncope at 24 ± 10 min (mean ± SD). Tilting to 60 ° resulted in an abnormal test in only 2 (7 %) of 27 control subjects without cardiovascular symptoms (p < 0. 001); and 5 (15 %) of 34 patients with syncope and documented conduction tissue disease (p < 0. 001). of 15 youthful fainters, 3 (20 %) had vasovagal reactions as did 1 (8 %) of 12 asymptomatic youthful control subjects. These 12 control subjects also underwent tilting with a saddle support and 7 (67 %) had vasovagal reactions. It is concluded that uk duration of lilting at 60 ° should be 45 min (mean time to syncope + 2 x SD in the 53 patients with abnormal results). Twenty percent of patients with an abnormal tilt test may not demonstrate syncope with repeat tilting. Saddle tilt testing in unexplained syncope may result in a loss of specificity. Tilting at < 60 ° results in a loss of sensitivity. Head-up tilt may be less useful in youthful subjects with vasovagal syncope than in other subjects...|$|R

40|$|Change to upright posture {{results in}} {{reductions}} in cerebral perfusion pressure due to hydrostatic pressure changes related to gravity. Since vestibular organs, specifically the otoliths, {{provide information on}} position relative to gravity, vestibular inputs may assist in adaptation to the upright posture. The goal {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of direct vestibular stimulation on cerebral blood flow (CBF). To examine the role of otolith inputs we screened 165 subjects for vestibular function and classified subjects as either normal or impaired based on ocular torsion. Ocular torsion, an indication of otolith function, was assessed during sinusoidal roll tilt of 20 degrees at 0. 01 Hz (100 sec per cycle). Subjects with torsion one SD below the mean were classified as impaired while subjects one SD above the mean were considered normal. During one session subjects were placed in a chair that was sinusoidally rotated 25 degrees in the roll plane at five frequencies: 0. 25 & 0. 125 Hz for 80 sec, 0. 0625 Hz for 160 sec and 0. 03125 Hz and 0. 015625 Hz for 320 sec. During testing, CBF (transcranial Doppler), blood pressure (Finapres), and end tidal CO 2 (Puritan Bennet) were measured continuously. Ocular torsion was assessed from infrared images of the eyes. All rotations were done in the dark with subjects fixated on a red LED directly at the center of rotation. In the normal group, dynamic tilt resulted in significant changes in both blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity that was related to the frequency of stimulus. In contrast the impaired group did not show similar patterns. As expected normal subjects demonstrated significant ocular torsion that was related to stimulus frequency while impaired subjects had minimal changes. These data suggest that vestibular inputs have direct effects on cerebral blood flow regulation during dynamic <b>tilt.</b> <b>Supported</b> by NASA...|$|R

The discordance may be explained by tilt down-to-the-northeast of the structural block that contains the intrusive suite of about 40 ° about a NW-SE trending axis, or perhaps more likely and based on additional geological evidence, by a combination of ∼ 20 ° of counterclockwise rotation about a vertical axis and a smaller amount of <b>tilt.</b> Vertical-axis-rotation is <b>supported</b> by paleomagnetic data from nearby localities, whereas a small magnitude of <b>tilt</b> is <b>supported</b> by geological field relations.

To reduce the resulting intra-individual disparity of postural responses, we have studied their evolution when repeating an unbalancing stimulation three times with eyes opened and then closed. A 6 °toe-up <b>tilt</b> of the <b>support</b> surface induces a backward fall of the body which is recorded by a multisegmental posturography with electromagnetic sensors (Statitest-Mumedia). The backward fall is normally prevented by a postural response which is quantified by its forward acceleration vector.

40|$|This study {{examines}} three hypotheses {{that have been}} proposed to explain the effects of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) in standing human subjects. The first assumes realignment to an altered representation of vertical. GVS-evoked body tilt produced under conditions of different stability was compared with perceptions of the vertical which subjects indicated by two means, a visual line and a manipulandum. GVS produced body tilt that increased in unstable conditions {{but there were no}} differences in the perceived vertical in any condition. The second hypothesis is that the altered vestibular signal is interpreted as a <b>tilt</b> of the <b>support</b> surface. The postural response evoked by <b>tilting</b> the <b>support</b> surface was compared with the GVS response under conditions of varying stability. These responses were different, particularly for the lower body where movements were oppositely directed. Standing on foam augmented GVS responses whereas standing with feet apart augmented platform-tilt responses. The third hypothesis is that GVS produces an illusion of movement, and this causes a reaction in the opposite direction. Perception of movement during GVS was determined in standing and immobilised subjects. Although immobilised subjects experienced illusions of movement in the direction opposite the sway response, this only happened after long periods of stimulation and never for standing where subjects accurately reported the true direction of sway. Thus, the results do not support any of these proposals. Instead, they and other observations support a simpler interpretation that the GVS signal is consistent with head movement and evokes an automated response to stabilise the head in space...|$|R
