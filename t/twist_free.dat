An implementation of Gatterdam's algorithm is presented to produce the so called associated automaton for a particular splicing system. In addition, since such an automaton solves the word problem for a given twist-free system, the implementation allows queries for membership in the language generated by twist-free systems. Also, the notion of cross-free automata is introduced and it is observed that Gatterdam's construction may only apply to such automata. Finally, a construction is provided which produces a cross-free automaton from any given crossed automaton...|$|E

For an homogeneous bulk system, both RSB schemes are known to yield identical free energies and observables.

40|$|One may impose to {{a system}} with {{spontaneous}} broken symmetry, boundary conditions which correspond to different pure states at two ends of a sample. For a discrete Ising-like broken symmetry, boundary conditions with opposite spins in two parallel limiting planes, generate an interface and a cost in free energy per unit area of the interface. For continuum symmetries the order parameter interpolates smoothly between the end planes carrying two different directions of the order parameter. The cost in free energy is then proportional to $L^{d- 2 }$ for a system of characteristic size L. The power of $L$ {{is related to the}} lower critical dimension, and the coefficient of this additional free energy vanishes at the critical temperature. In this note it is shown within a loop expansion that one does find the expected behavior of this <b>twist</b> <b>free</b> energy. This is a preamble to the study of situations where the broken continuum symmetry is believed to be more complex, as in Parisi's ansatz for the Edwards-Anderson spin glass.

40|$|The {{unilateral}} {{contact between}} an elastic rod and a rigid surface is encountered in numerous biological and engineering applications. Along continuous contacts, the {{centerline of the}} rod reflects the geometry of the constraining surface. This restriction of the rod axis to surface bound configurations enters its local equilibrium through a reaction pressure which ensures the compatibility between the deformation and the restraint geometry. The classic equations governing the static equilibrium of elastic rods are particularized to surface bound configurations by (i) specifying {{the location of the}} rod axis in terms of its coordinates in the parameter space associated with the constraining surface parameterization, and (ii) characterizing the orientation of its material frame through its rotation with respect to the surface normal. This formulation, which emphasizes the relations between the rod configuration and the geometry of the constraint, also leads to an expression for the reaction pressure. This approach is then validated on a spherical surface by comparing with known solutions for elastic curves, i. e., inextensible and <b>twist</b> <b>free</b> rods. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{field theory}} {{of a short}} range spin glass with Gaussian random interactions, is {{considered}} near the upper critical dimension six. In the glassy phase, replica symmetry breaking is accompanied with massless Goldstone modes, generated by the breaking of reparametrization invariance of a Parisi type solution. Twisted boundary conditions are thus imposed at two {{opposite ends of the}} system in order to study the size dependence of the <b>twist</b> <b>free</b> energy. A loop-expansion is performed to first order around a twisted background. It is found, as expected but it is non trivial, that the theory does renormalize around such backgrounds, {{as well as for the}} bulk. However two main differences appear, in comparison with simple ferromagnetic transitions : (i) the loop expansion yields a (negative) anomaly in the size dependence of the free energy, thereby lifting the lower critical dimension to a value greater than two given by d_c = 2 -η(d_c) (ii) the free energy is lowered by twisting the boundary conditions. This sign may reflect a spontaneous spatial non-uniformity of the order parameter. Comment: 15 pages, latex, no figur...|$|E
40|$|THESIS 9195 The main {{drivers of}} space weather, solar flares and coronal mass ejections, {{are thought to}} {{originate}} from active regions {{on the surface of}} the Sun. The mechanisms by which active regions produce these eruptive events remains unclear. In this thesis, numerous mathematical methods are developed to characterise the complexity of active region magnetic fields on the Sun. In the first section of the thesis, a box-counting method was used to measure the temporal evolution of the multifractal parameters of a sample of active regions. These results are compared to other multi-scale methods and changes in the temporal evolution of the multifractal spectrum are found to be associated with a regions flaring potential. As an expansion of the box-counting method, a wavelet-based multifractal method, the wavelet transform modulus methods (WTMM), was similarly used to characterise the changing properties of active region magnetic fields. A study of the multifractal properties of active and quiet Sun magnetic fields showed them to be statistically distinct and separable in wavelet transform space. As such, a segmentation procedure was developed to accurately recover the multifractal parameters of active region magnetic fields from the surrounding quiet Sun. Additionally, the temporal evolution of the fractal dimension and Holder exponent of active regions were examined for a possible relation to flaring. The complexity of the coronal field was investigated using extrapolation techniques. A linear force-free extrapolation method was developed to examine the changing topology of active region magnetic fields. Comparisons were made to EUV observations of the solar corona so as to constrain the extrapolations. Using the twin perspectives of the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft the 3 D topology of a coronal loop was identified and modelled with time.

50|$|California grunion spawn on beaches {{from two}} to six nights after the full and new moon {{beginning}} soon after high tide and continuing for several hours. As a wave breaks on the beach, the grunion swim as far up the slope as possible. The female arches her body while keeping her head up and excavates the semifluid sand with her tail. As her tail sinks, the female twists her body and digs tail first until she is buried up to her pectoral fins. After the female is in the nest, up to eight males attempt to mate with her by curving around the female and releasing their milt as she deposits her eggs about four inches below the surface. After spawning, the males immediately retreat toward the ocean. The milt flows down the female’s body until it reaches the eggs and fertilizes them. The female <b>twists</b> <b>free</b> {{and returns to the}} sea with the next wave. The whole event can happen in 30 seconds, but some fish remain on the beach for several minutes. Spawning may continue from March through August, with occasional extensions into February and September. However, peak spawning is from late March through early June. Once mature, an individual may spawn during successive spawning periods at about 15-day intervals. Most females spawn about six times during the season. Counts of maturing ova to be laid at one spawning ranged from about 1,600 to about 3,600, with the larger females producing more eggs. A female might lay as many as 18,000 eggs over an entire season. The milt from the male might contain as many as one million sperm. Males may participate in several spawnings per run.|$|R
40|$|Non-commutative {{connections}} of {{the second}} type or hom-connections and associated integral forms are studied as generalisations of right connections of Manin. First, it is proven {{that the existence of}} hom-connections with respect to the universal differential graded algebra is tantamount to the injectivity, and that every finitely cogenerated injective module admits a hom-connection with respect to any differential graded algebra. The bulk of the paper is devoted to describing a method of constructing hom-connections from twisted multi-derivations. The notion of a <b>free</b> <b>twisted</b> multi-derivation is introduced and the induced first order differential calculus is described. It is shown that any <b>free</b> <b>twisted</b> multi-derivation on an algebra A induces a unique hom-connection on A that vanishes on the dual basis for the module of one-forms. To any flat hom-connection ∇ on A one associates a chain complex, termed a complex of integral forms on A. The canonical cokernel morphism to the zeroth homology space is called a ∇-integral. Examples of <b>free</b> <b>twisted</b> multi-derivations, hom-connections and corresponding integral forms are provided by covariant calculi on Hopf algebras or quantum groups and on quantum spaces. The example of a flat hom-connection within the 3 D left-covariant differential calculus on the quantum group SL(2) is described in full detail. A descent of hom-connections to the base algebra of a faithfully flat Hopf-Galois extension or a principal comodule algebra is studied. As an example, a hom-connection on the standard quantum Podles sphere is presented. In both cases the complex of integral forms is shown to be isomorphic to the de Rham complex, and the ∇-integrals coincide with Hopf-theoretic integrals or invariant (Haar) measures.
