5|$|DragonFly {{originally}} {{used the}} FreeBSD Ports collection as its official package management system, but {{starting with the}} 1.4 release switched to NetBSD's pkgsrc system, which was perceived {{as a way of}} lessening the amount of work needed for <b>third-party</b> <b>software</b> availability. Eventually, maintaining compatibility with pkgsrc proved to require more effort than was initially anticipated, so the project created DPorts, an overlay on top of the FreeBSD Ports collection.|$|E

5|$|The Dream was {{released}} to mostly positive reception. While the Dream was praised for its solid and robust hardware design, {{the introduction of}} the Android operating system was met with criticism for its lack of certain functionality and <b>third-party</b> <b>software</b> in comparison to more established platforms, but was still considered to be innovative due to its open nature, notifications system, and heavy integration with Google's services.|$|E
5|$|The audio {{playback}} of the third-generation iPad has {{a frequency}} response of 20Hz to 20,000Hz.

A preliminary tear-down of the third-generation iPad by IHS iSuppli showed the likely costs for a 16GB Wi-Fi + Cellular model at $358.30, 32GB at $375.10, and 64GB at $408.70 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Development of Sonic Advance {{began after}} Sega shifted their focus to <b>third-party</b> <b>software</b> development, {{due to the}} {{underperformance}} of the Dreamcast. The company recruited Dimps—a Japanese development studio consisting of former Neo Geo Pocket Color programmers—to lead development, {{with the assistance of}} longtime series developer Sonic Team. While the game follows a similar style of gameplay to the Sega Genesis Sonic games, certain concepts and designs were re-used from newer titles such as Sonic Adventure. The game has since been ported to Nokia's N-Gage and Android devices, and is available on the Wii U via the Virtual Console.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, Smartsheet started {{introducing}} closer integrations with Microsoft Office products, in part {{thanks to}} changes Microsoft was making in {{their products to}} work better with <b>third-party</b> <b>software.</b> In January 2015, Smartsheet added support for Microsoft's identity management software Azure Active Directory, which allowed users to log into products like Excel and Smartsheet with the same login. Users can also now make changes to smartsheets directly from Microsoft Outlook. In 2016 Smartsheet introduced Sights, a configurable dashboard that shows metrics such as how a team is performing against key performance indicators.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Sega, facing {{financial}} {{troubles with}} the underperformance of their Dreamcast console, shifted from first to <b>third-party</b> <b>software</b> publishing, with Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo's Game Boy Advance (GBA) being their primary focuses. A team of developers {{was formed to}} begin development on Sonic the Hedgehog Advance (later renamed Sonic Advance), a Sonic title for the GBA that would commemorate the series' tenth anniversary. Development was led by Dimps—a team formed by several former Neo Geo Pocket Color developers and funded by Sega, Sony, and Bandai—with assistance from Sonic Team. Several of the team members had previously worked on the critically-acclaimed Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure (1999) for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012, The FreeBSD Security Team {{announced}} that hackers gained unauthorized access {{on two of}} the project's servers. These servers were turned off immediately. More research demonstrated that the first unauthorized access by hackers occurred on 19 September. Apparently hackers gained access to these servers by stealing SSH keys from one of the developers, not by exploiting a bug in the operating system itself. These two hacked servers were part of the infrastructure used to build <b>third-party</b> <b>software</b> packages. The FreeBSD Security Team checked the integrity of the binary packages and {{announced that}} no unauthorized change was made to the binary packages, but they stated that they can't guarantee the integrity of packages that were downloaded between 19 September and 11 November.|$|E

5|$|The iPad 2 has a 25W·h {{rechargeable}} {{lithium-ion polymer battery}} {{that lasts}} 10 hours, like the original iPad. It is charged via USB or included 10 W, 2 A power adapter. The battery is 2.5mm thick, 59% smaller than the original and has three cells instead of two. The improvements allowed the injection-molded plastic support frame to be omitted. The 10 W USB power adapter provides 4x {{the power of a}} conventional USB port. The tablet has an audio frequency response of 20 Hz to 20kHz. Without <b>third-party</b> <b>software</b> it can play the following audio formats: HE-AAC, AAC, Protected AAC, MP3, MP3 VBR, Audible formats (2, 3, 4, AEA, AAX, and AAX+), ALAC, AIFF, and WAV.|$|E
