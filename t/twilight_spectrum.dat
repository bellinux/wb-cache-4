40|$|Echelle {{spectra of}} 10 bright asteroids are {{presented}} and compared against an observed <b>twilight</b> <b>spectrum</b> and a computed Solar spectrum. Spectra covering a 2130 A spectral range centered on 5785 A are of high resolving power and high {{signal to noise}} ratio. So we focus on a comparison of detailed properties of spectral lines and not on albedo variations. It is shown that the normalized Solar and asteroid spectra are identical except for radial velocity (RV) shifts which can be predicted at the accuracy level of 1 m/s. So asteroids are proposed as new and extremely accurate radial velocity standards. Predicted and measured RVs of observed asteroids indeed match within limits of accuracy of the instrument. There are numerous absorption lines in the reflected Solar spectrum. This allows a direct mapping of the resolving power of a spectrograph between and along echelle spectral orders. So asteroid spectra {{can be used to}} test wavelength calibration and resolving power of spectrographs on the ground as well as in space, including the Gaia mission of ESA. All spectra are also given in an electronic form. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures. Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics. Online material to be available via CD...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} {{for the analysis}} of <b>twilight</b> airglow <b>spectra</b> that may be contaminated by atmospheric continuum emission of unknown brightness. The necessity of correcting for this continuum emission when measuring weak airglow features in twilight is illustrated by application of the method to the neutral iron line at 3860 A...|$|R
40|$|Zenith {{skylight}} {{is often}} distinctly blue during clear civil twilights, {{and much of}} this color is due to pre-ferential absorption at longer wavelengths by ozone’s Chappuis bands. Because stratospheric ozone is greatly depleted in the austral spring, such decreases could plausibly make Antarctic twilight colors less blue then, including at the zenith. So for several months in 2005, we took digital images of twilight zenith and antisolar skies at Antarctica’s Georg von Neumayer Station. Our colorimetric analysis of these images shows only weak correlations between ozone concentration and twilight colors. We also used a spectroradiometer at amidlatitude site to measure zenith <b>twilight</b> <b>spectra</b> and colors. At both locations, spectral extinction by aerosols seems as important as ozone absorption in explaining colors seen through-out the twilight sky. © 2011 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 010. 1030, 010. 1290, 010. 1690, 010. 3920, 010. 4950, 330. 1730. 1...|$|R
40|$|Evening <b>twilight</b> <b>spectra</b> of the OI 8446 A {{emission}} {{were obtained}} during May and June of 1993 using a single-etalon, pressure scanning, Fabry-Perot interferometer {{located in the}} Millstone Hill Optical Facility. The goals of this work are to positively identify the 8446 A emission in the twilight airglow and to determine the intensity decay {{as a function of}} solar depression angle. Also, a study of the relative triplet line strengths is performed in hopes of establishing the importance of the primary excitation mechanisms (photoelectron impact or Bowen fluorescence) during the twilight period. Although absent in most of the data, a distinct auroral influence is also found to contribute considerably, on occasion, to the emission over Millstone Hill. The ratio of the combined 8446. 26 A and 8446. 38 A intensities to the 8446. 76 A intensity varies as 0. 13 +/- 0. 03 per degree of solar depression angle, indicating that secondary excitation mechanisms are becoming increasingly important as evening twilight progresses. Bowen fluorescence is not found to be the primary excitation mechanism at any time during twilight, contributing just a few Rayleighs at most. These observations are an important first step toward a better characterization of highly variable thermospheric oxygen concentrations through ground-based measurements of the OI 8446 A emission...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the first nightside EUV and FUV airglow limb spectra of Titan showing {{molecular}} emissions. The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) observed photon emissions of Titan's {{day and night}} limb-airglow and disk-airglow on multiple occasions, including during an eclipse observation. The 71 airglow observations analyzed in this paper show EUV (600 - 1150 Å) and FUV (1150 - 1900 Å) atomic multiplet lines and band emissions arising from either photoelectron induced fluorescence and solar photo-fragmentation of molecular nitrogen (N[SUB] 2 [/SUB]) or excitation by magnetosphere plasma. The altitude of the peak UV emissions on the limb during daylight occurred inside the thermosphere at the altitude of the topside ionosphere (near 1000 km altitude). However, at night on the limb, a subset of emission features, much weaker in intensity, arise in the atmosphere with two different geometries. First, there is a twilight photoelectron-excited glow that persists with solar depression angle up to 25 - 30 degrees past the terminator, until the solar XUV shadow height passes the altitude of the topside ionosphere (1000 - 1200 km). The UV <b>twilight</b> glow <b>spectrum</b> {{is similar to the}} dayglow but weaker in intensity. Second, beyond 120 ° solar zenith angle, when the upper atmosphere of Titan is in total XUV darkness, there is indication of weak and sporadic nightside UV airglow emissions excited by magnetosphere plasma collisions with ambient thermosphere gas, with similar N[SUB] 2 [/SUB] excited features as above in the daylight or twilight glow over an extended altitude range.
