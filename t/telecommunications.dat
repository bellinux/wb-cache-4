5|$|The <b>telecommunications</b> {{sector in}} Bahrain officially started in 1981 with the {{establishment}} of Bahrain's first <b>telecommunications</b> company, Batelco and until 2004, it monopolised the sector. In 1981, there were more than 45,000 telephones in use in the country. By 1999, Batelco had more than 100,000 mobile contracts. In 2002, under pressure from international bodies, Bahrain implemented its <b>telecommunications</b> law which included the establishment of an independent <b>Telecommunications</b> Regulatory Authority (TRA). In 2004, Zain (a rebranded version of MTC Vodafone) started operations in Bahrain and in 2010 VIVA (owned by STC Group) became the third company to provide mobile services.|$|E
5|$|Fabry-Pérot etalons {{are widely}} used in <b>telecommunications,</b> lasers and {{spectroscopy}} to control and measure the wavelengths of light. Dichroic filters are multiple layer thin-film etalons. In <b>telecommunications,</b> wavelength-division multiplexing, the technology that {{enables the use of}} multiple wavelengths of light through a single optical fiber, depends on filtering devices that are thin-film etalons. Single-mode lasers employ etalons to suppress all optical cavity modes except the single one of interest.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Post Office had a {{monopoly}} over <b>telecommunications</b> until 1987 when Telecom New Zealand was formed, initially as a state-owned enterprise and then privatised in 1990.

5|$|The {{effective}} capacity to exchange information worldwide through two-way telecommunication networks grew from 281 petabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, to 471 petabytes in 1993, to 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, and to 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007. This is the informational equivalent of two newspaper pages {{per person per}} day in 1986, and six entire newspapers {{per person per day}} by 2007. Given this growth, <b>telecommunications</b> play an increasingly important role in the world economy and the global <b>telecommunications</b> industry was about a $4.7 trillion sector in 2012. The service revenue of the global <b>telecommunications</b> industry was estimated to be $1.5 trillion in 2010, corresponding to 2.4% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP).|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} large firms also have their {{headquarters}} in Mogadishu. Among these is the Trans-National Industrial Electricity and Gas Company, an energy conglomerate founded in 2010 that unites five major Somali companies from the trade, finance, security and <b>telecommunications</b> sectors. Other firms based in the city include Hormuud Telecom, the largest <b>telecommunications</b> company in southern and central Somalia. Telcom is another <b>telecommunications</b> service provider that is centered in the capital. The local Somali Energy Company specializes in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power to residents and businesses within its service area in Banaadir. Villa and Mansion Architects, an international architectural firm founded by the Somali-British architect Alexander Yusuf, likewise has its regional offices in Mogadishu. Additionally, the International Bank of Somalia, which opened downtown in 2014, offers Islamic finance and international banking services via a swift code system.

5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of <b>telecommunications,</b> filters have been of crucial importance in a number of technological breakthroughs and have been the source of enormous profits for <b>telecommunications</b> companies. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise to filter theory, which initially took a very similar form, and the main application of filters was for use on telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of network synthesis techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, {{when all}} {{airframe}} maintenance at Laverton {{was transferred to}} Nos.2 and 3 Aircraft Depots, No.1 AD had serviced forty-two aircraft types throughout its existence. It continued to maintain aero engines, and began supporting <b>telecommunications</b> equipment as well. The aircraft engine repair facilities at No.1 AD were closed down in 1968. Staff were transferred to No.3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, {{to prepare for the}} introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber to Australian service and concentrate on maintaining the new aircraft's engines. No.1 AD's focus thereafter shifted to ground support, manufacturing, installing, servicing and providing training for navigational, air traffic control, <b>telecommunications</b> and motor transport equipment used by the Air Force and other sections of Defence and government. From 1968 to 1977, the depot was organised into two components, <b>Telecommunications</b> Installation and Maintenance Squadron and Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron. These were subdivided in February 1977 into <b>Telecommunications</b> Squadron (maintaining ground communications equipment for control towers, transmitters and receiving stations in Australia and the region), Radar Squadron (supporting surveillance systems at RAAF Bases Williamtown, Amberley, Townsville, Darwin and Pearce), Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron (maintaining motor transport, and other ground-based mechanical and electro-mechanical systems), and Intermediate Level Maintenance Squadron (communications, navigation and other ground-based maintenance at Laverton, as well as spectrometric analysis of oil used by the RAAF in aircraft and other equipment).|$|E

25|$|The British <b>Telecommunications</b> Act 1981 {{transferred}} {{the responsibility for}} <b>telecommunications</b> services from the Post Office, creating two separate corporations, Post Office Ltd. and British <b>Telecommunications.</b> At this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into British <b>telecommunications</b> industry. In particular, the Act empowered the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, as well as British <b>Telecommunications,</b> to license other operators to run public <b>telecommunications</b> systems. Additionally, a framework was established which enabled the Secretary of State to set standards with the British Standards Institution (BSI) for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties, and {{had the effect of}} requiring British <b>Telecommunications</b> to connect approved apparatus to its systems. The Secretary of State made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market, where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in 1981. In 1982, a licence was granted to Cable & Wireless to run a public <b>telecommunications</b> network through its subsidiary, Mercury Communications Ltd.|$|E
