5|$|The tour {{featured}} a 360-degree configuration, with <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> being placed {{closer to the}} center of the stadium's field than usual. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> design {{featured a}} large four-legged steel structure that held the speaker system and cylindrical video screen and hovered above the performance area. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> was surrounded by a circular ramp, which connected to <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> by rotating bridges. Fans with general admission tickets could be placed both outside the ramp as well as between the ramp and stage. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> had no defined front or back and was surrounded by the audience. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> design was able to increase the venues' capacities by about 15–20%. Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in this scheme, compared to flat fields or baseball stadiums, although a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated with a medium-sized company.|$|E
5|$|A Falls Count Anywhere {{match between}} Kurt Angle and Abyss followed, lasting 17 minutes. At {{one point during}} the {{encounter}} while Abyss {{was standing on the}} concrete floor and Angle was on <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> Angle performed a running leap off <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> into a somersault senton, connecting with Abyss on the floor. Angle was the victor in the bout, after throwing Abyss off of a scaffold through the Spanish announcers' table, then descending and covering Abyss for the pinfall.|$|E

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast shoot, The Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The network {{had gone to}} great expense to prepare the studio, including an estimated $100,000 to raise <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and install a separate revolving stage. Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home.

5|$|Although its {{population}} had dropped below a thousand {{by the late}} 1920s, in 1927 the state replaced <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> road with what eventually became Highway 82. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> road, it was closed during the winter months.

It includes the foundation of the gatekeeper's house and the remains of the gate.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> but not so close as to make a platform for climbing <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> He testified that he pulled one person off <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E
5|$|As an {{homage to}} the venue, <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> was {{decorated}} with roses. The multi-leveled set-up consisted of New York City fire escape routes. Other parts of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> had a ladder reaching the mezzanine floors and a replica of an F train carriage. Gaga's wardrobe was also rose themed, with leotards, hats and jackets, and instruments adorned with red roses. The main set list for the residency encompassed songs from The Fame, The Fame Monster, Born This Way, and Artpop. Some tracks were performed in acoustic versions.|$|E
40|$|We study a {{round-robin}} tournament with n symmetric players {{where in}} each of <b>the</b> n- 1 <b>stages</b> each of <b>the</b> players competes against a different player in the Tullock contest.

5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no curtains on <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> the performance begins with the actors entering <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and ends with their leaving <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E
5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair to the edge of <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E

50|$|When {{learning}} psychomotor skills, individuals {{progress through}} <b>the</b> cognitive <b>stages,</b> <b>the</b> associative <b>stage,</b> and <b>the</b> autonomic <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> cognitive <b>stage</b> {{is marked by}} awkward slow and choppy movements that the learner tries to control.

40|$|A {{minority}} {{of child abuse}} cases is recognized by professionals, making the role of non-professional bystanders essential. <b>The</b> <b>stages</b> of change construct, as proposed by the Transtheoretical Model, may provide a useful approach to explain non-professional helping behavior.

Data of 126 adult non-professional bystanders were analyzed. Respondents were questioned by telephone or via an Internet questionnaire, at baseline and after a follow-up of about two months later. Attitude toward helping was sig-nificantly less positive in pre-contemplation than in <b>the</b> other <b>stages,</b> and self-efficacy expect-ations were significantly higher in preparation compared with <b>the</b> other <b>stages.</b> Moreover, baseline preparators were more likely to con-duct future helping behavior than those in <b>the</b> two earlier <b>stages.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> <b>stages</b> of change mediated the relation between previous and future helping behavior.
