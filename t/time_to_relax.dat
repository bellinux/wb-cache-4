5|$|The Regent of Madiun, Raden Rangga Prawirasentika, {{participated in}} funding the {{construction}} of Taman Sari. Prawirasentika also beseeched the Sultan to be relieved of Madiun's tax obligation. He offered other alternative ways of payment. The Sultan accepted his proposal. In 1758, the Sultan commanded the Regent to supervise the making of bricks and various complements, which {{would be used to}} build a beautiful garden. The sultan wanted a place where he could spend some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>relax</b> after many years of wars that he had just experienced. Raden Tumenggung Mangundipura, under supervision of Raden Arya Natakusuma (who later became Sri Pakualam II), was responsible for the construction. The building was started in 1684 Javanese year (1758 AD). After finding out how large the complex was, Raden Rangga Prawirasentika realized that the cost would have been greater than the taxes. He resigned from the project and was replaced by Prince Natakusuma who continued the project to completion.|$|E

Houston's own account was that the battle lasted [...] "about eighteen minutes", before apprehending prisoners and confiscating armaments. When the Twin Sisters went up against the Mexican army's Golden Standard cannon, they performed so well that Hockley's unit was able to capture the Mexican cannon.|$|E
500|$|The game's swipe-based swordplay {{was based}} on Donald Mustard's desire for an {{uncommon}} gameplay based on nuanced sword fighting and parrying. He described the game's influences as the combat of Karateka and Prince of Persia combined with the [...] "lonely epicness" [...] of Shadow of the Colossus. Chair sought to develop an experience that could be picked up and played for a minute (a single battle) or {{for half an hour}} (a bloodline). They felt that many other developers accustomed to consoles were wrong to make iOS games that required long playing experiences to feel meaningful, and so Chair developed the bloodline concept as a natural breakpoint. They also felt that mobile games like Infinity Blade with constant action elements went too long without giving the player <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>relax</b> and resulted in player exhaustion, and so Chair kept their individual battles short with brief cinematic pauses in longer battles. Chair showed their playable demo at the Apple conference on September 1, 2010, after weeks of rehearsal, and attracted {{a lot of attention to}} the game. It was released on December 9, 2010. While Chair itself spent little on marketing, Apple used the game extensively in advertisements for its devices.|$|E

2500|$|At a {{press conference}} held on August 7, Rodriguez {{announced}} that he would play in his final game for the Yankees on the following Friday, August 12, against the Rays at Yankee Stadium. It was also noted that the Yankees would sign him to a new contract that would keep him in the organization through 2017 as a special instructor and advisor. In the offseason, Rodriguez would join the Yankees' front office as a special advisor. [...] The club commemorated Rodriguez' final game as a Yankee, thanking him in front of a sold-out crowd for his efforts with a tribute of highlights on the stadium videoboard, a presentation of a framed number 13 jersey and a base autographed by teammates. This was {{in stark contrast to the}} year-long farewell tour given to his former Yankee teammate Derek Jeter. At the plate, he batted third and started as the DH, going 1-for-4 with an RBI double. In the ninth inning, he was brought onto the field at third base for one batter − his only defensive appearance for the Yankees in 2016 − and departed the field to a [...] "raucous ovation" [...] from the fans. [...] The next day, the Yankees granted him his unconditional release. On August 15, many rumors traveled around the majors. The Miami Marlins were interested in signing him to play first base until his spokesman Ron Berkowitz emailed the media and said on behalf of Rodriguez, “I want to put all this talk to rest about Alex playing for any team this season. It’s not happening. Like he said Friday night, he is happy and he is going to take some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>relax</b> and hang with his family and friends.” Rodriguez ended the season playing 65 games with a [...]200 batting average, 9 home runs and 31 RBIs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} a general {{scheduling}} methodology for managing overruns in a real-time environment, where tasks may have different criticality and flexible timing constraints. The proposed method achieves isolation among tasks through a resource reservation mechanism which bounds the effects of task interference, but also performs efficient reclaiming of the unused computation <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>relax</b> the utilization constraints imposed by isolation. The enhancements achieved by the proposed approach resulted to be very effective with respect to classical reservation schemes. The performance has been evaluated by implementing the algorithm on a real-time kernel. The runtime overhead introduced by the scheduling mechanism has also been investigated with specific experiments, {{in order to be}} taken into account in the schedulability analysis. However, it resulted to be negligible in most practical cases. 1...|$|R
60|$|One {{afternoon}} {{in the beginning of}} October when the traffic was becoming brisk a tall man strode {{along the edge of the}} pavement with a lady on his arm. Angry glances struck upon their backs. The small, agitated figures--for in comparison with this couple most people looked small--decorated with fountain pens, and burdened with despatch-boxes, had appointments to keep, and drew a weekly salary, so that there was some reason for the unfriendly stare which was bestowed upon Mr. Ambrose's height and upon Mrs. Ambrose's cloak. But some enchantment had put both man and woman beyond the reach of malice and unpopularity. In his guess one might guess from the moving lips that it was thought; and in hers from the eyes fixed stonily straight in front of her at a level above the eyes of most that it was sorrow. It was only by scorning all she met that she kept herself from tears, and the friction of people brushing past her was evidently painful. After watching the traffic on the Embankment for a minute or two with a stoical gaze she twitched her husband's sleeve, and they crossed between the swift discharge of motor cars. When they were safe on the further side, she gently withdrew her arm from his, allowing her mouth at the same <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>relax,</b> to tremble; then tears rolled down, and leaning her elbows on the balustrade, she shielded her face from the curious. Mr. Ambrose attempted consolation; he patted her shoulder; but she showed no signs of admitting him, and feeling it awkward to stand beside a grief that was greater than his, he crossed his arms behind him, and took a turn along the pavement.|$|E
