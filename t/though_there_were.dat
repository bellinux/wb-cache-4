She was a light-skinned African-American; her husband Jacob {{and at least}} one of her sons were much darker than she was.|$|E
5|$|A Braxy-like disease {{originated}} in the Beverley-York region in 1915. Over the next 15 years it spread across most of the state's farming districts. Flock losses generally were around 5% <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> reported cases of 30% loss. In 1918 Professor Dakin of the University of Western Australia identified the disease as a toxaemia of bacterial origin {{but was unable to}} establish the source.|$|E
5|$|A set {{of events}} {{similar to those}} that doomed Star Dust also caused the crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 in 1972 (depicted in the film Alive), <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{survivors}} from that crash because it involved a glancing blow to a mountainside rather than a head-on collision.|$|E

5|$|Isa's {{relations}} with Baybars were generally on good terms, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> occasional exceptions. Isa accompanied al-Mustansir, the newly inaugurated Abbasid caliph, on his Mamluk-sponsored campaign to reclaim Iraq from the Mongols in 1260. However, al-Mustansir was killed {{en route to}} Baghdad in a Mongol ambush. The next year, Isa was present in Cairo to bear witness that al-Mustansir's successor and kinsman, al-Hakim, was indeed {{a member of the}} Abbasid line.|$|E
5|$|Records from 1801 {{show that}} at that time {{agriculture}} was {{the main component of}} Puddletown's economy, though cottage industry and artisan crafts were also an important element: 596 people in the parish were primarily employed in agriculture, with 221 employed in handicrafts, manufacture and trade. Cottage industry, often undertaken by women and children, was used to supplement agricultural income, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> fewer opportunities for this after the French Revolution.|$|E

5|$|The {{mission was}} {{reported}} as ready to go—"except for the weather"—on October 1. The major {{concern with the}} weather was a major tropical storm in the Atlantic, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> also worries over a series of typhoons in the Pacific which could pose a problem for recovery operations. On the evening of October 2, the decision was taken to launch the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{thought that}} they had inflicted more damage than was the case. The U.S. claimed to have shot down 70 Japanese {{aircraft}}, even <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only 42 aircraft in all. Actual Japanese losses—from all causes—in the engagement were 25 aircraft, {{with most of the}} crews of the lost aircraft not being recovered or rescued. The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one. The U.S. lost six aircraft in the engagement, with most of the crews being rescued.|$|E

5|$|In early 1973, {{with the}} ransom money still missing, The Oregon Journal republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 {{to the first}} person to turn in a ransom bill to the {{newspaper}} or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the Post-Intelligencer made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Tourist Trophy the Isle of Man had {{hosted the}} English trials for the Gordon Bennett Cup as the English {{government}} had banned motor racing on its roads. The Automobile Club {{wanted to run}} an event to help develop fuel efficiency in motor cars and opted {{to use the same}} route as had been used for the trials. In order to make the event relevant to those cars on general sale they imposed rules to prevent specialist race cars from entering, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> complaints that the rules were too restrictive and detracted from the spectacle.|$|E
5|$|Seeadler {{remained}} in East Africa {{for the next}} nine years, returning to Germany finally in January 1914. She had spent over thirteen years abroad since her 1899 modernization, the longest period of continuous overseas service of any major German warship. After arriving in Germany, she was decommissioned. She was not mobilized after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, being {{too old to be}} of any fighting value. She was instead used as a mine storage hulk outside Wilhelmshaven. On 19 April 1917, her cargo of mines exploded and destroyed the ship, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no casualties. Her wreck was never raised for scrapping.|$|E

5|$|The 2009 {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as an origin story, but the project {{evolved into a}} re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer {{to feel a little}} sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> subtle changes. Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.|$|E
5|$|The game {{made use}} of cutting edge {{technology}} such as force–feedback joysticks and controllers, 3D sound and Direct3D Hardware Acceleration and was largely well received. Critics noted that the game's graphics {{were some of the}} most technically impressive of the time. Overall, however, critics had mixed response for the graphics, as the demanding graphics resulted in poor draw distance; in particular, the PlayStation version struggled in this aspect. In general, the gameplay was favourably reviewed, with critics praising the solid, enjoyable missions, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> complaints regarding a poor control system and unfairly high levels of difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} at Rock Springs led to other incidents of anti-Chinese aggression, primarily in Washington Territory, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> incidents in Oregon {{and other states}} as well. Near Newcastle, Washington a mob of whites burned down the barracks of 36 Chinese coal miners. Throughout the Puget Sound area, Chinese workers were driven out of communities and subject to violence in Washington cities and towns, including Tacoma, Seattle, Newcastle, and Issaquah. Chinese workers were driven out of other Washington towns, but sources indicated, as early as 1891, that the above events were specifically connected to the wave of violence touched off at Rock Springs.|$|E

Approximately 200,000dwellings were damaged, including roughly 39,000 that were destroyed. Furthermore, 208people sustained injuries. Overall, damage in the island nation totaled $268million (1988USD), including $40million in crop damage and $228million in infrastructure damage.

5|$|The two Scharnhorst-class battleships {{were the}} first capital ships built for the Kriegsmarine {{after the end of}} World War I. They marked the {{beginning}} of German naval rearmament after the Treaty of Versailles. The class comprised two vessels: Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. The ships were armed with nine 28cm (11in) SK C/34 guns in three triple turrets, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> plans to replace these weapons with six 38cm (15in) SK C/34 guns in twin turrets.|$|E
5|$|An upper-level trough and a {{decaying}} {{cold front}} persisted across the western Atlantic Ocean in early October. The {{interaction between the}} two {{led to the formation}} of an area of low pressure on October 8 to the southwest of Bermuda. The system lacked a single well-defined circulation, though it possessed gale-force winds as it moved northwestward. The system gradually became better organized, and <b>though</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no signs of tropical development on October 9, computer models suggested a subtropical storm could form. On October 10, a well-defined low-level circulation developed as a band of clouds formed in the northern portion of the system. Shortly thereafter, curved bands developed in the northwestern portion of the center, while the strongest winds associated with the storm occurred more than 115miles (185km) from the center. Based on the broad wind field and the cloud signature, it is estimated the system organized into Subtropical Storm Nicole on October 10 while located about 140miles (225km) southwest of Bermuda.|$|E
