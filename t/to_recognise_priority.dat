40|$|The {{introduction}} of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) {{in the early}} 1990 s by international donors has led to some important new knowledge about availability and uses of water resources in Tanzania. However, {{more needs to be}} done <b>to</b> <b>recognise</b> the <b>priorities</b> of the rural majority of small-scale users, and not just those of donors, the environmental lobby and foreign investors in land and water. Greater efforts also need to be made by the basin offices to regulate high-impact users, and to work with existing district and local government structures that have developed and managed water to serve the rural majority since independence, rather than create additional top-down parallel institutional layers.

Burley also seems to have been the only 14th-century logician to have taken the position that, in line with modern views on the material conditional, the principle that [...] "from the impossible anything follows" [...] ("ex impossibili sequitur quidlibet") is both a necessary and sufficient condition for explaining the logical relationship between antecedent and consequent.He was also known for his commentaries on Aristotle's Physics, which include the quodlibet De Primo et ultimo instanti (around 1320) and the longer work Expositio in libros octo de physico auditu.Burley wrote 39 Commentaries on Aristotle and 32 Treatises and Questions (many unedited) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} in 2010 to identify Important Plant Areas (Key Biodiversity Areas for Plants) {{in the south}} and east Mediterranean region, in order to prioritise the best sites for plant conservation action. It follows a first work of identification of Important Plant Areas (IPAs) initiated for Algeria and relates exclusively to the flora of northern Algeria. These IPAs were delineated in northern Algeria for those sites harbouring a number of “IPA selection species” (threatened species and locally endemic or restricted range). Recent taxonomic revisions estimate the number of national endemics for the north of Algeria (excluding the Sahara) to be over 300 taxa. In the present study, data were extracted from the global list of 22 IPAs identified for the north of Algeria. The species considered are i) threatened species as defined by the 1997 IUCN global red list of plants, ii) locally endemic species, iii) nationally threatened species. Trigger species, identified by combining the criteria of endemism and rarity, are mainly Algerian national endemics but also include some Algerian-Moroccan and Algerian-Tunisian endemics. One hundred and fifty two (152) trigger species were identified and these species, which have high ecological value, can be used to characterize the particular floristic interest of a site and can therefore be a useful tool for conservation purposes. Important gaps in knowledge have been highlighted, in particular those relating to taxonomy and the lack of up-to-date field data. It is therefore essential to undertake in situ research in order to better understand the distribution and status of these species. A flexible approach <b>to</b> identifying and <b>recognising</b> <b>priority</b> sites for plants using surrogate criteria, supplemented by expert opinion, alongside existing globally standardised criteria, is therefore essential if the most important sites for plant diversity are to receive the conservation attention they deserve...|$|R

Membership of {{this zone}} allowed Madagascar to assure foreign {{currency}} cover for <b>recognised</b> <b>priority</b> imports, <b>to</b> provide a guaranteed market for certain agricultural products (bananas, meat, sugar, de luxe rice, pepper etc.) at above average prices, to secure private investment, and to maintain a certain rigour in the state budget. In 1960, 73% of exports went to the franc-zone, with France among the main trade partners, supplying 10 billion CFA francs to the Malagasy economy.|$|R
40|$|ICT {{development}} is a <b>recognised</b> <b>priority</b> of the Bulgarian government. There has always been high interest in learning and implementing information technologies. Interest towards Internet technologies has grown mostly on behalf of young people and the business. As of 1999, Bulgaria's government has periodically proclaimed the establishment of information society as a priority, and the country reports sustained progress in that area. We will review the state and development of ICT and Bulgaria's opportunities to integration in e-Europe, having in mind EU's priorities in that area: ICT infrastructure, Computer usage, Internet usage, e-Education, e-Health, e-government and e-commerce.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that the African region faces a number of serious oral diseases, either because of their high {{prevalence}} or because of the severe tissue damage or death that can occur. Previous approaches to oral health in Africa have failed <b>to</b> <b>recognise</b> the epidemiological <b>priorities</b> of the region or to identify reliable and appropriate strategies to assess them. Efforts have consisted of an unplanned, ad hoc and spasmodic evolution of curative oral health services. This document focuses on the most severe oral problems that people have to live with like noma, oral cancer and the oral consequences of HIV/AIDS infection. It proposes a strategy for assisting member states and partners to identify priorities and interventions at various levels of the health system, particularly at the district level. The strategy aims at strengthening the capacity of countries to improve community oral health by effectively using proven interventions to address specific oral health needs. The strategy identifies five main 'programmatic areas', including (i) the development of national oral health strategies and implementation plans, (ii) integration of oral health in other programmes, (iii) delivery of effective and safe oral health services, (iv) regional approach to education and training for oral health, and (v) development of effective oral health management information systems. Many of the programmatic areas share similar characteristics described as a 'strategic orientation'. These strategic orientations give effect to the concepts of advocacy, equity, quality, partnership, operational research, communication and capacity building. The WHO Regional Committee for Africa (RC) is invited to review the proposed oral health strategy for the African region for the period 1999 - 2008 and provide an orientation for the improvement of oral health in member states in the region.
