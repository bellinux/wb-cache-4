5|$|By mid-1944, {{his health}} had {{deteriorated}} to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was evacuated to Australia, {{and for a}} time was not expected to live. By early 1945 he had recovered sufficiently to be appointed to command the 6th Division. While flying to assume this new command, the RAAF Lockheed Hudson aircraft he was travelling in crashed into the sea, killing all on board.|$|E
5|$|Horsefield did not confine his {{scientific}} interests to botany, as he also studied algebra, mensuration and astronomy. Charles Horsefield had also encouraged {{his son in}} the last pursuit, taking him to meet Robert Ward, an astronomer in Blackley who had a telescope. John Horsefield developed {{an interest in the}} subject to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> constructed an orrery, much to the bewilderment of his neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Gerard was {{a patron}} of learning, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> urged {{at least one}} of his clergy to study Hebrew, a {{language}} not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of astrology, which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside York Minster after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch.|$|E
5000|$|Paire's {{style of}} play is characterised by its flashiness, unpredictability and at times inconsistency. The main {{strength}} of his game is his double-handed backhand, known for its speed and spin. Paire often uses topspin backhands cross court at great speed and acute angles {{to set up a}} powerful backhand down-the-line to finish off points. In contrast, his forehand is relatively less powerful and consistent, particularly when played on the defense, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> been known to hit backhands inside-out.|$|R
25|$|John venerated James Joyce to <b>the</b> same <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> worshipped Johann Sebastian Bach {{and read}} Joyce's Ulysses regularly. He visited Joyce's grave in Switzerland and {{attended}} {{an exhibition of}} paintings by Paul Klee. He traveled extensively around Germany, visiting all the places associated with Bach.|$|R
2500|$|Drudge {{has been}} called [...] "the Walter Cronkite of his era" [...] by Mark Halperin and John F. Harris, and [...] "the country's reigning mischief-maker" [...] by Todd Purdum of The New York Times. Michael Isikoff of Newsweek said [...] "Drudge is a menace to honest, {{responsible}} journalism. And to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> read and people believe what they read, he's dangerous." [...] According to Camille Paglia, he is [...] "the kind of bold, entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, information-oriented outsider we need far more of in this country." [...] David McClintick described him as, [...] "a modern Tom Paine, a possible precursor to millions of town criers using the Internet to invade the turf of bigfoot journalists." ...|$|R
5|$|In January 1566 Sultan Suleiman I {{had ruled}} the Ottoman Empire for 46 years {{and went to}} war for the last time. He was 72 years old and, {{although}} having gout to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was carried on a litter, he nominally commanded his thirteenth military campaign. On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left Constantinople {{at the head of}} one of the largest armies he had ever commanded.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's General Order Number 40 {{was quickly}} {{condemned}} by Republicans in Washington, especially by the Radicals, while President Johnson wholeheartedly approved. Heedless {{of the situation}} in Washington, Hancock soon put his words into action, refusing local Republican politicians' requests to use his power to overturn elections and court verdicts, while also letting it be known that open insurrection would be suppressed. Hancock's popularity within the Democratic party grew to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was considered a potential presidential nominee for that party in the 1868 election. Although Hancock collected a significant number of delegates at the 1868 convention, his presidential possibilities went unfulfilled. Even so, he was henceforth identified as a rare breed in politics: one who believed in the Democratic Party's principles of states' rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge's heart {{condition}} worsened, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was unable to}} attend his mother's funeral in 1970. He eventually required 24-hour care, and was transferred to Nuffield Hospital in Exeter, where he died in his sleep on 30 September 1971. His body was interned at the family plot in Heytesbury, Wiltshire. As the Branscombe house was owned by the Lethbridge Family Trust, Mina was obliged to move out after her husband's death, and she sold his belongings out of financial necessity. Mina also collected together Lethbridge's unfinished book {{with the help of}} writer Colin Wilson; together they assembled it into publishable form and it was brought out by Routledge in 1976 as The Power of the Pendulum.|$|E
5000|$|Already disliked, he {{delighted in}} his {{promotion}} as a Commissioner, {{and set about}} his task at Canterbury with enthusiasm, {{so much so that}} his parishioners would openly flock to attack him, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> soon <b>he</b> had to carry out his task with Cromwell's soldiers to protect him.|$|R

50|$|In 1836, in the employ of William Finden, Balmer began a {{publication}} called The Ports and Harbours of England. Although he produced many drawings for the book, {{it was never}} realised to <b>the</b> full <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had originally envisaged. He retired from London in 1842, and gave up painting. He died near Ravensworth, in Durham on 10 April 1846.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Rana Bahadur Shah's youth {{had been}} spent in pampered luxury. In 1794 Rana Bahadur came of age, {{and his first}} act was to re-constitute the government, with his uncle, Bahadur Shah, removed from all {{official}} position. In mid 1795, he became infatuated with a Maithili Brahman widow, Kantavati Jha, and married her on the oath of making their illegitimate half-caste son (as per the Hindu law of that time) the heir apparent, by excluding the legitimate heir from his previous marriage. By 1797, {{his relationship with his}} uncle, who was living a retired life, and who wanted to seek refuge in China on the pretext of meeting the new emperor, had deteriorated to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ordered his imprisonment on 19 February 1797 and his subsequent murder on 23 June 1797. Such acts earned Rana Bahadur notoriety both among courtiers and common people, especially among Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|While Rowley and Hamelin had sparred in the Indian Ocean, Corbet {{had made}} the lengthy journey back to Britain. During his time in command of Nereide, Corbet had already {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} strict disciplinarian, regularly beating his men for the slightest infractions, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had provoked a brief mutiny on Nereide in 1808. His reputation spread before him, and when he switched commands with Captain Richard Raggett of HMS Africaine, he was met with a storm of protest from Africaines crew. Although none of the men aboard Africaine had served with Corbet before, his preference for brutal punishment was well known in the Navy and the crew {{sent a letter to the}} Admiralty insisting that they would not serve under him. Concerned at what they considered to be mutiny, the Admiralty sent three popular officers to Africaine with the message that if the protest was quietly dropped there would be no courts-martial for mutiny but if not, the entire crew would be liable to attack. To emphasise the threat, the frigate HMS Menelaus was brought alongside with her gunports open and her cannon ready to fire. Chastened, the crew of Africaine allowed Corbet aboard and the frigate sailed for the Indian Ocean a few days later, carrying instructions for the authorities at Madras to prepare an expeditionary force to invade Isle de France.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Bhimsen {{was able}} to {{continue}} making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by stamping the royal seal issued {{in the name of}} King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen's decisions. Nevertheless, {{to make sure that the}} King, his wives – Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) – and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, General Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the royal palace to keep a watch on the royal family and to keep guard against any outside person. Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get an approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence. Similarly, the royal family were not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen's permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due to which he had grown to be uncritical and weak minded to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner. However, his wives were more alert and wary of Bhimsen since, according to Baburam Acharya, they received unfiltered news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their menstruation and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Majid Musisi was {{on track}} to make light work of Jimmy Kirunda's record of 32 goals a season when he netted a mindboggling 29 goals in the league's first round. In his final league appearance, he tormented KCC goalie Sadiq Wassa to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> scored his fourth in the 5-0 win, he simply walked off the field as if to suggest that {{domestic}} opposition no longer matched his ambitions. Nevertheless, he extended his league tally to 144 goals.|$|R
5000|$|<b>That</b> is, when <b>he</b> {{advanced}} {{towards the}} East in Babylon, the people, {{who had no}} shelter were the captured tribes of Israel. The reason the Quran mentions no more on the topic is because the whole epic is written in the Book of Kings, of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). The Quran simply says at 18:90, [...] "To <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> reached <b>the</b> rising-place of the sun, he found it rising upon a nation for which We had not kept any shelter from it." ...|$|R
5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, {{blond hair}} and blue eyes—changed radically {{over the course of}} time. As a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> sometimes <b>he</b> was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that caused his death.|$|R
25|$|McCreery {{regarded}} Montgomery as excessively cautious, {{and indeed}} some historians {{have suggested that}} Montgomery failed to press home his advantage after the Battle of Alamein to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might have done (see, for example, Corelli Barnett, The Desert Generals).|$|E
25|$|William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton with Jon Pertwee in The Three Doctors.

25|$|Collecting {{passport}} stamps {{as proof}} of travels was {{a major part of}} Giuliano's endeavour, and he describes being obsessed about his stamps, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> travelled with ink pads in five different colours so that he could assist immigration officers whose stamps may lack ink.|$|E
500|$|Myers {{was known}} as the [...] "Flying Dutchman" [...] and the [...] "Mohawk Dutchman" [...] because of his location, name, and being a balloonist.

25|$|Ulliott first won {{money in}} a noted poker tournament in 1993. Over the {{following}} years, Ulliott worked on his tournament game to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that,</b> during 1996, <b>he</b> won £100,000 in a two-week period at The Vic. His success at that time led to him and Whitaker going to Las Vegas, Nevada for the first time.|$|R
25|$|In appearance, Fox was dark, corpulent and hairy, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> {{was born}} his father {{compared}} {{him to a}} monkey. His round face was dominated by his luxuriant eyebrows, with the result <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was known among the Whigs as 'the Eyebrow.' Though he became increasingly dishevelled and fat in middle age, the young Fox had been a very fashionable figure; in particular, {{he had been the}} leader of the 'Maccaroni' set of extravagant young followers of Continental fashions. Fox enjoyed riding and cricket but, in the latter case, the combination of his impulsive nature and considerable weight led to his often being run out between wickets.|$|R
25|$|Although Sutcliffe {{as a boy}} {{was thought}} to have {{potential}} as a bowler, he specialised in batting to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> only bowled 993 deliveries, with 31 maiden overs, in his entire first-class career. He bowled a straightforward right-arm medium pace with little success, his best figures being 3–15 while his career average was a very high 40.21.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the minor}} Midrashim, esoteric {{attributes}} of Enoch are expanded upon. In the Sefer Hekalot, Rabbi Ishmael {{is described as}} having visited the 7th Heaven, where he met Enoch, who claims that earth had, in his time, been corrupted by the demons Shammazai, and Azazel, and so Enoch was taken to Heaven to prove that God was not cruel. Similar traditions are recorded in Sirach. Later elaborations of this interpretation treated Enoch as having been a pious ascetic, who, called to mix with others, preached repentance, and gathered (despite {{the small number of}} people on Earth) a vast collection of disciples, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was proclaimed king. Under his wisdom, peace is said to have reigned on earth, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is summoned to Heaven to rule over the sons of God. In a parallel with Elijah, in sight of a vast crowd begging him to stay, he ascends to Heaven on a horse.|$|E
25|$|Critics and admirers tend {{to agree}} that Blair's electoral success was based {{on his ability to}} occupy the centre ground and appeal to voters across the {{political}} spectrum, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has been fundamentally at odds with traditional Labour Party values. Some left-wing critics, such as Mike Marqusee in 2001, argued that Blair oversaw the final stage of a long term shift of the Labour Party to the right.|$|E
5000|$|After Godfrey's death, the see lay vacant until 1090 or 1091. The 19th century {{historian}} W. R. W. Stephens {{said that}} the cause of the vacancy was due to [...] "the grasping avarice of the red king, who protracted episcopal vacancies to <b>the</b> utmost <b>extent,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might enrich his own treasury with the temporalities of the sees." [...] The church and William II were certainly in conflict for much of his reign. When bishoprics and abbeys became vacant William was able to take the revenues from them until the post was filled by a new bishop or abbot, William would often auction these positions off to the highest bidder.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the siege}} Mutukan (Mö'etüken), son of Chagatai Khan and {{favourite}} grandson of Genghis Khan, {{was killed in}} battle by an arrow from the besieged walls. This death, compounded by the heavy casualties sustained by his forces during the siege and the realization of his own mortality, angered Genghis to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> once <b>he</b> captured Bamiyan he completely destroyed it and killed its entire and surrounding regions population. The destruction was so complete that even the Mongols referred to Bamiyan as [...] "the city of sorrows"(ie. city of woe), while another title was [...] "city of noise (or screams)" [...] - {{in reference to the}} cries of its murdered victims.|$|R
2500|$|Churchill had a [...] "limited {{understanding}} of Islam." [...] He primarily admired its martial aspects, the [...] "Ottoman Empire’s history of territorial expansion and military acumen", to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> in 1897 <b>he</b> wished {{to fight for}} the Ottoman Empire. According to Dockter, this was largely for his [...] "lust for glory". Churchill also believed that Islam and Christianity should be viewed as equals.|$|R
25|$|Sutcliffe {{developed}} severe arthritis {{in his old}} age, {{the disease}} crippling him to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> needed a wheelchair. He suffered personal tragedy in April 1974 when his wife Emmie, then aged 74, died as result of severe burns following a fire at the family home in Ilkley.

25|$|Sukanta Bhattacharya(15 August 1926 – 13 May 1947) was a Bengali {{poet and}} playwright.

During his life, his poems were not widely circulated, but after his death his reputation grew to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became one of the most popular Bengali poet of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Kamber {{turned his}} {{attention}} back to politics in 1992. He supported the U.S presidential candidacy of Sen. Tom Harkin. Although he did not become involved in a presidential campaign to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did in 1984, Kamber nevertheless played a big role in the 1992 election. In July of that year, he established a political action committee called Americans for Change. The group's goal was to raise $1 million to run attack ads against President George H. W. Bush.|$|E
