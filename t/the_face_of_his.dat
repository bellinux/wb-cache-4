5|$|After the hearing, Jones {{allegedly}} spat in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son's attorney, Carol Powell-Lexing, {{and supposedly}} pushed {{her to the}} floor. Jones denied assaulting Powell-Lexing, saying he would never get into a physical fight with a woman. Jones was charged with assault. Despite the alleged assault, Powell-Lexing continued as part of Bell's defense team.|$|E
5|$|Pierre Brasseur as Doctor Génessier, a University professor, {{physician}} {{and father of}} Christiane. Génessier experiments on his pet dogs and performs heterograft surgeries on women to try and restore <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> daughter Christiane. Brasseur previously worked with director Georges Franju in the drama, La Tête contre les murs (1958), again in a leading role playing a doctor.|$|E
5|$|At {{the climax}} of the film, to Tommy's horror the tree finally dies just before arrival, as Izzy had also died just before a cure. A final {{apparition}} of Izzi appears, comforting Tommy in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> accepted impending death and suggesting that they may share an afterlife now. He finally understands and embraces his death, moments before the star goes supernova, engulfing the ship and everything within. The traveler's body is absorbed, but the tree flourishes back to life being engulfed by the star dying inside the nebula. Izzi's apparition picks a fruit from the new tree of life and hands it to Tom, the present-day neuroscientist, who plants it in Izzi's grave.|$|E
50|$|Hewitt later made masks {{of human}} skin by slicing off <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> victims.|$|R
60|$|As he {{told the}} story, the incredulous smile faded from <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> listeners.|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't signify at all," [...] said Felix, looking {{round and}} seeing <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends on <b>the</b> {{other side of}} the bank.|$|R
5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and {{whether it would be}} right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Dhoni scored 148 in an ODI against Pakistan {{and kept}} his {{position}} as the ODI gloveman safe. Despite Dhoni’s heavy run-scoring in the ODIs, the selectors continued to persist with Karthik for the Tests in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> low scoring at both domestic and international level in the preceding 12 months. Karthik started the tour of Zimbabwe with 40 in a warm-up match against the Zimbabwe Board XI. The hosts, depleted due to political purges conducted by their government, were no match for India and lost by an innings and ten wickets respectively. India scored heavily against their weakened opponents, amassing 554 and 366 in their completed innings, but Karthik failed on both occasions, twice making a single.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Ohno is {{credited}} with popularizing and being <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sport. He said it is amazing being a role model to younger skaters. Growing up, {{he did not have}} that influence within his sport, but looked up to other athletes outside his sport, such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and Lance Armstrong. Training for short track has been the main focus of Ohno's life, but {{he has been able to}} work on other endeavors. He studied business at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.|$|E
60|$|At length {{a ray of}} {{intelligence}} burst upon <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hosts, and they rushed to a cupboard and brought out a small black bottle.|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] exclaimed Ian, {{starting}} and sitting bolt upright, while he gazed in <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> two comrades. [...] "Is it true? Have I killed the-- the--grizzly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea, my lords," [...] {{answered}} the old chief with a smile, which was reflected on <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> companions; [...] "if ye do this thing, {{we will be}} satisfied indeed." ...|$|R
5|$|A {{short while}} {{later at the}} Andronikov Monastery, a {{messenger}} arrives from Moscow to ask Andrei for his assistance in decorating the Annunciation Cathedral with Theophanes the Greek. Both Daniil and Kirill are agitated by the recognition that Andrei receives. Daniil refuses to accompany Andrei and reproaches him for accepting Theophanes’ offer without considering his fellows, but soon repents of his temper and tearfully wishes Andrei well when the younger monk comes {{to say goodbye to}} his friend. Kirill is jealous of Andrei and in a fit of anger, decides to leave the monastery for the secular world, throwing accusations of greed in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fellow monks, who also dismiss him. Kirill stumbles out of the monastery into the snowy countryside and is pursued by his dog, but Kirill savagely beats it with his walking stick and leaves it for dead. Andrei leaves for Moscow with his young apprentice Foma (Mikhail Kononov). Foma is another creative character, representing the light-hearted and practical-minded commercial artist. Still he seems to be contemplative enough to get along with Andrei.|$|E
5|$|Balchen's fleet was {{successful}} in driving off the French, who retired in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> superior fleet without firing a shot, and Hardy's convoy was escorted safely to Gibraltar. On {{the way to the}} Portuguese Coast, Balchen finally made his fortune in prize money, capturing six heavily laden French West Indiamen. On his return journey however, the fleet was sailing through the Western Approaches in early October when it was hit by a violent storm. Scattered across the Channel, they one by one returned to England in a battered and leaking condition until, a few days later, only HMS Victory was missing. Victory, Balchen's flagship, was, at the time, one of the largest ships in the world, holding a broadside of 100 guns. She was also very new, having been completed less than seven years before.|$|E
5|$|Davidson's family {{assumed that}} he would follow his father in {{becoming}} a priest and he was brought up strictly. When he was six he began attending Banister Court School in Southampton, an establishment founded initially for the sons of Merchant Navy officers. In 1890 Harold was sent to live with two maiden aunts in Croydon while he attended the Whitgift School. Here he became an enthusiastic amateur actor, encouraged by his friendship with a fellow-pupil, Leon Quartermaine, who later won recognition {{on the stage and}} in films. In February 1894 the pair appeared together in a school production of the farce Sent to the Tower. Under his aunts' influence, Davidson became a part-time worker at Toynbee Hall, an East End charity founded by Samuel and Henrietta Barnett which attracted many volunteers from schools and universities. Because of these distractions he neglected his school work and failed to win a scholarship that would enable him to attend Oxford University and study for holy orders. In <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's disapproval, he decided to pursue a career as a stage comedian.|$|E
50|$|Regarding those shot at Jarménil, {{the wife}} of Haut-du-Bois fighter Maurice Grosdemange from Archettes {{indicated}} that four men died there the same day. Mr Grosdemange would have cleaned <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> comrades at <b>the</b> age of 20.|$|R
5000|$|An unnamed, sadistic {{character}} chops off <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> (undescribed) victims, {{puts them}} in a jar, and keeps them in his basement. As with [...] "The Shakespeare Room", this story is mentioned by Michal only in passing.|$|R
60|$|His {{face was}} deadly pale. Either {{there was some}} {{suggestion}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fate in <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> audience, or some mysterious instinct told him <b>of</b> <b>his</b> danger. He attempted to speak, but faltered, tottered, and staggered to the wings.|$|R
5|$|John {{had lost}} most of his ancestral lands in France to King Philip II in 1204 and had {{struggled}} to regain them for many years, raising extensive taxes on the barons to accumulate money {{to fight a war}} which ended in expensive failure in 1214. Following the defeat of his allies at the Battle of Bouvines, John had to sue for peace and pay compensation. John was already personally unpopular with many of the barons, many of whom owed money to the Crown, and little trust existed between the two sides. A triumph would have strengthened his position, but in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> defeat, within a few months after his return from France John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule.|$|E
25|$|Any {{error that}} was {{reasonably}} available {{to be raised}} while the petitioner was in custody is waived, {{and it is the}} petitioner's burden on <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> petition to demonstrate that he could not have reasonably raised his claims during the time he was in custody.|$|E
25|$|In The Simpsons episode Bart the Lover, a {{photo of}} Howe was used by Bart as <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> alter-ego, Woodrow, a charming persona he invented to pose as a pen-pal suitor for his lovelorn teacher, Mrs. Krabappel, in order to play a {{practical}} joke on her.|$|E
60|$|Several {{times during}} the course of these {{proceedings}} Charley's eyes wandered among <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> entertainers, in <b>the</b> hope of seeing Redfeather among them, but without success; and he began to fear that his friend was not with the tribe.|$|R
2500|$|When Brewster {{returned}} to Buxton {{and to his}} portraits, [...] "he {{seems to have taken}} more care when painting <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subjects," [...] Genocchio wrote," [...] resulting in portraits that show an increased sensitivity to the characters <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subjects." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Crewe {{naturally}} {{expected to}} find visible effects of astonishment and joy on <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hearers at such not inconsiderable news. Mr. Flint, however, looked serious enough, though the senator smiled as he blew <b>his</b> smoke out <b>of</b> the window.|$|R
25|$|While batting in {{the second}} Test in the Australian 2006 tour of South Africa, Symonds was struck in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> helmet by a bouncer off Makhaya Ntini. Symonds {{required}} four stitches {{on the inside of}} his upper lip. Struggling for reliable impact, Symonds was again dropped {{at the end of this}} series.|$|E
25|$|Maklakov {{joined a}} {{moderate}} reform group in 1904 and played {{an active part}} in the organization of the Constitutional Democratic Party two years later, serving on its central committee. The most conservative of the Kadet leaders, Maklakov was anxious to preserve the party's unity, which appeared fragile in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> many ideological clashes with Paul Miliukov, reputed for his intransigent liberal individualism.|$|E
25|$|In Mark, Jesus is crucified {{along with}} two rebels, and the day goes dark for three hours. Jesus calls out to God, then gives a shout and dies. The curtain of the Temple is torn in two. Matthew follows Mark, adding an {{earthquake}} and the resurrection of saints. Luke also follows Mark, though he describes the rebels as common criminals, one of whom defends Jesus, who in turn promises that he (Jesus) and the criminal will be together in paradise. Luke portrays Jesus as impassive in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> crucifixion. John includes several of the same elements as those found in Mark, though they are treated differently.|$|E
25|$|At {{about this}} time the artist also began to sign and date his {{paintings}} more frequently. He also {{moved away from the}} large-format Grand Manner-influenced style and turned to smaller, more intimate portraits in which he focused more attention on <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> subjects.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{went back}} into the hall and searched all the rooms of the castle without finding a single person. On his return he {{stopped in front of the}} mirror and sorrowfully {{regarded}} <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends, who again seemed to plead for relief.|$|R
50|$|A man captures schoolgirls {{and takes}} them to an {{abandoned}} freight container in Shinjuku which he has decorated with enlarged black & white images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> previous victims. He smears the captive girls with paint and shaving cream, rapes, tortures and brutally murders them.|$|R
25|$|The second {{explosion}} killed twelve soldiers: ten {{from the}} Parachute Regiment {{and the two}} from the Queen's Own Highlanders. Mike Jackson, then a major in the Parachute Regiment, was at the scene soon after the second explosion and later described seeing body parts scattered over the road, {{in the water and}} hanging from the trees. He was asked to identify <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friend, Major Peter Fursman, still recognisable after it had been completely ripped from his head by the explosion and recovered from the water by divers from the Royal Engineers. Only one of Colonel Blair's epaulettes remained to identify him as his body had been vaporised in the blast.|$|E
500|$|About Amalric's son Baldwin IV, however, [...] "there was no ambiguity". Baldwin {{was nothing}} but heroic in <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{debilitating}} leprosy, and he led military campaigns against Saladin even while still underaged; William tends to gloss over campaigns where Baldwin was not actually in charge, preferring to direct his praise towards the afflicted king rather than subordinate commanders. William's history {{can be seen as}} an apologia, a literary defense, for the kingdom, and more specifically for Baldwin's rule. By the 1170s and 1180s, western Europeans were reluctant to support the kingdom, partly because it was far away and there were more pressing concerns in Europe, but also because leprosy was usually considered divine punishment.|$|E
500|$|In the novel, Pinfold {{initially}} {{dismisses the}} Box—described as resembling [...] "a makeshift wireless set"—as [...] "a lot of harmless nonsense", but, like Waugh, he is driven to revise {{his position in}} <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> persecution by the voices. He believes that [...] "Angel" [...] is using an adapted form of the Box, as developed by the Germans {{at the end of}} the war and perfected by the [...] "Existentialists" [...] in Paris—"a hellish invention in the wrong hands". At the end of his ordeal Pinfold muses that had he not defied Angel but instead compromised with him, he might have continued to believe in the Box's sinister capabilities. He is finally convinced of the non-existence of a box with such powers by the assurances of his priest, Father Westmacott.|$|E
6000|$|Fulkerson stopped, and ran {{his eyes}} eagerly over <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> three listeners, one after the other. March was a little {{surprised}} when Dryfoos turned to him, but that reference of the question seemed to give Fulkerson particular pleasure: [...] "What do you think, Mr. March?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Of {{course you}} won't be fool {{enough to think}} of going down the Ghauts, Hastings?' But I {{did not look at}} that as {{equivalent}} to a direct order--whatever I should do now," [...] the colonel put in, on seeing a furtive smile on <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> male listeners.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked upon}} {{the earth and the}} sky rather than upon <b>the</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fellows. <b>His</b> natural love <b>of</b> Nature had been {{intensified}} by his captivity, while a bitter contempt and suspicion of all men and women had grown up in his mind. He entered his father's house with reluctance and loathing.|$|R
