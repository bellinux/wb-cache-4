A spiral tubular member encircles the inner concentric cylinder and is contained within the space between the inner and outer cylinders. One portion is connected to the inner concentric cylinder and a second portion connected to the outer concentric cylinder. A heated fluid is conveyed through the tubular member and is periodically cooled causing the tubular member to expand and contract.

40|$|Stirling-cycle engines {{have been}} {{identified}} as a promising technology for the conversion of concentrated solar energy into usable electrical power. A 25 kW electric system takes advantage of existing Stirling-cycle engines and existing parabolic concentrator designs. In previous work, the concentrated sunlight impinged directly on the heater head tubes of the Stirling <b>Thermal</b> <b>Motors</b> (STM) 4 - 120 engine. A Sandia-designed felt-metal-wick heat pipe receiver was fitted to the STM 4 - 120 engine for on-sun testing on Sandia`s Test Bed Solar Concentrator. The heat pipe uses sodium metal as an intermediate two-phase heat transfer fluid. The receiver replaces the directly-illuminated heater head previously tested. The heat pipe receiver provides heat isothermally to the engine, and the heater head tube length is reduced, both resulting in improved engine performance. The receiver also has less thermal losses than the tube receiver. The heat pipe receiver design is based on Sandia`s second-generation felt-wick heat pipe receiver.

The engine and transmission were designed between 1974 and 1982, using foreign technology.

40|$|In most flat {{bimetallic}} strip applications, the bending is {{employed in the}} transverse direction, that is, upon the application of uniform heating to the entire strip, the initially straight strip bends transversely up from the flat plane. This study is concerned with a pre-curved {{bimetallic strip}} that upon heating up from the ambient, straightens up along the chord line tending to become flatter. The initial ambient radius of curvature of the strip is smaller, and upon heating, the radius of curvature becomes larger. By mounting the curved bimetallic strip with a rotational degree of freedom at each end, and fixing one end against displacement, a chord line displacement of the free end of the strip occurs when the strip is uniformly heated. It is this chord line case that this work investigates and characterises. This work provides a way of evaluating the net combined axial loading case whereby an external load {{is applied to the}} free end of the strip as it uniformly heated.

50|$|However, {{with both}} variable- and constant-flow systems, fully {{automatic}} balancing {{can enhance the}} performance of the HVAC system, eliminating any problems caused by high or excessive system pressures, including noise from the valves and, ultimately, poor control of room temperature. The way the system is balanced will also {{have a major impact on}} energy usage, by minimising pumping costs. In variable-flow systems the use of combination valves, when fitted with a 0 to 10 V, 3 point or <b>thermal</b> <b>motor,</b> integrates the three functions of motorised control valve, differential pressure control valve and a double-regulating valve commissioning set into one product. Applications for this type of product include the control of fan-coil units, chilled beams and air-handling units in variable-volume heating and cooling systems and the control of secondary flow on plate heat exchangers. This integrated approach significantly reduces installation and commissioning costs, since the three control functions are specifically matched to ensure optimum system performance and only one valve has to be mounted in the system instead of three. The problem of high and varying pressure drops across traditional 2-port control valves is also effectively eliminated, ensuring a control-valve authority of 100%. It also saves on space, an important concern in, for example, air handling unit installations where the available plant room space for valve installation is often severely restricted.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{electric}} vehicles {{are considered the}} best alternative to achieve sustainable urban mobility. However, the extended implementation is conditional to {{a sufficient number of}} charging stations and the design of a new power grid distribution. Indeed, the vehicle model that dominates the current market, electric or <b>thermal</b> <b>motors,</b> is ten times heavier than its useful weight (occupant plus luggage), so it is not efficient in the way it uses the energy. In this article, an ultra-light electric vehicle with his own photovoltaic generator is proposed as an adequate vehicle prototype for sustainable mobility. This kind of vehicle does not need many charging stations and, because of that, the implantation is less complex than for other commercial vehicles. To verify this proposal, a specific photovoltaic panel was designed, manufactured and evaluated for this kind of vehicles. It can reach a specific power of 27. 24 W/kg in STC, higher than commercial solar panels. An experimental study in a wind tunnel was conducted in order to know the influence of the photovoltaic generator in the drag coefficient, and to calculate the performance of the vehicle in an urban circuit. The most important results are that the vehicle, at STC, can circulate at a maximum speed of 35 km/h, without the need to charge the battery from the grid. For the same conditions, if the vehicle circulates at the maximum speed allowed in urban circuits, 50 km/h, it would have a range of 200 km per kWh charged from the grid. Universidad de Málaga.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a refrigerator is largely guided by the efficiency of its drive unit, namely, the compressor 2 ̆ 6 understanding the compressor behavior requires a detailed study of its dynamics, flow-thermals, electrical and controls aspects. Having a simulation model which captures these physics reasonably well is {{a critical part of}} the design and performance prediction of a compressor. The current paper describes a systematic approach of making a system level simulation framework by first developing individual models and then integrating them into a single framework to capture the multi-physics interaction of the different sub-components. This framework, developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK contains five modules, namely, Dynamics, <b>Thermal,</b> <b>Motor,</b> Controls and Post-processor. Dynamics is modeled as a spring-mass system with adjustable static equilibrium and head-crash prevention algorithm. The thermodynamics model essentially captures the valve physics. The valves in a reciprocating compressor contribute to pressure losses (pressure profile deviation from ideal suction 2 ̆ 6 discharge processes, valve dynamics, leakages, pressure pulsations) and thermal losses (refrigerant back-flow caused by incorrect valve timing). The starting point of simulating these details is considering the gas dynamics and coupling it to the valve motion. The prediction of this model is validated against test data of a baseline compressor. As part of the integrated design framework, a permanent magnet motor is simulated as a resistance-inductance network with a series, velocity dependent voltage. To impress the desired operating conditions (capacity, stroke, clearance etc.) upon the integrated system model, a set of controllers were designed to control the motor...|$|R

40|$|The Carnot {{efficiency}} of usual <b>thermal</b> <b>motors</b> compares the work {{produced by the}} motor to the heat received from the hot source, neglecting the perturbation of the cold source: thus, even if it may be appropriate for industrial purposes, it is not pertinent in the scope of sustainable development and environment care. In the framework of stochastic dynamics we propose a different definition of efficiency, which {{takes into account the}} entropy production in all the irreversible processes considered and allows for a fair estimation of the global costs of energy production from heat sources: thus, we may call it “sustainable efficiency“. It can be defined for any number of sources and any kind of reservoir, and it may be extended to other fields than conventional thermodynamics, such as biology and, hopefully, economics. Both sustainable efficiency and Carnot efficiency reach their maximum value when the processes are reversible, but then, power production vanishes. In practise, {{it is important to consider}} these efficiencies out of equilibrium, in the conditions of maximum power production. It can be proved that in these conditions, the sustainable efficiency has a universal upper bound, and that the power loss due to irreversibility is at less equal to the power delivered to the mechanical, external system. However, it may be difficult to deduce the sustainable efficiency from experimental observations, whereas Carnot’s efficiency is easily measurable and most generally used for practical purposes. It can be shown that the upper bound of sustainable efficiency implies a new higher bound of Carnot efficiency at maximum power, which is higher than the so-called Curzon-Ahlborn bound of efficiency at maximum power...|$|R

Using particle-based, mesoscopic simulations that maintain local momentum conservation, we analyze quantitatively how the coupling to the surrounding fluid affects ratchet motion.
