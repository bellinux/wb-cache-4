To separate the geodetic strain of <b>trend</b> <b>components</b> from these induced responses, state-space modeling is applied to volumetric strain data recorded with borehole Sacks-Evertson strainmeters, which have been operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) since 1976 {{in the area of}} an expected Tokai earthquake. Modeling reveals that no pre-slips occurred just before the earthquake at Suruga-bay in 2009 (M 6. 5), regardless of the clear <b>trend</b> <b>components</b> extracted at all stations. Coseismic strains at stations within and near the coastal area indicate extension, despite the contraction field predicted from the inversion of strong motions. This suggests that fluid movement is stimulated by variations of water volume, which are caused by seismic motions changing pore pressure in the sand layer. Liquefaction in the same area supports this hypothesis. Moreover, normalized <b>trend</b> <b>components</b> suggest that long-period waves of strain changes still exist, inducing further strain responses.

40|$|A geostatistical {{downscaling}} {{scheme is}} presented and can generate fine scale precipitation information from coarse scale Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data by incorporating auxiliary fine scale environmental variables. Within the geostatistical framework, the TRMM precipitation data are first decomposed into <b>trend</b> and residual <b>components.</b> Quantitative relationships between coarse scale TRMM data and environmental variables are then estimated via regression analysis {{and used to}} derive <b>trend</b> <b>components</b> at a fine scale. Next, the residual components, which are {{the differences between the}} <b>trend</b> <b>components</b> and the original TRMM data, are then downscaled at a target fine scale via area-to-point kriging. The <b>trend</b> and residual <b>components</b> are finally added to generate fine scale precipitation estimates. Stochastic simulation is also applied to the residual components in order to generate multiple alternative realizations and to compute uncertainty measures. From an experiment using a digital elevation model (DEM) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the geostatistical downscaling scheme generated the downscaling results that reflected detailed characteristics with better predictive performance, when compared with downscaling without the environmental variables. Multiple realizations and uncertainty measures from simulation also provided useful information for interpretations and further environmental modeling...|$|R

Using different measures, it is shown that the low frequency and <b>trend</b> <b>components</b> of stock prices are relatively important drivers of the S&P 500 index.

30|$|Beveridge and Nelson (1981) {{reject the}} {{imposition}} of a deterministic trend as the <b>trend</b> <b>component</b> of a series. They suggest that the <b>trend</b> <b>component</b> follows a stochastic process that may not necessarily be stationary. By means of a stationary ARIMA model in first differences, they estimate the <b>trend</b> <b>component,</b> while the cyclical component is estimated by residual. This procedure is applied to all macroeconomic indicators used by NBER for the classification of cycles. Each of the series is modeled as an ARIMA(p,  1, q) process, using the Box and Jenkins (1976) method for the identification of the parameters. Finally, a composite index is assembled by weighting the obtained cycles and then compare the results with the NBER chronology and that by Zarnowitz and Boschan (1977). Their results show a lead in the cycle periods and the same duration in the expansions and recessions. This is a contrast to NBER, which marks longer expansionary cycles and shorter recession periods.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Conventional Dickey-Fuller {{tests have}} very low {{power in the}} {{presence}} of structural breaks. Critical values are very sensitive to: the type of break, the timing and size of the break. Therefore, correct critical values are usually obtained by adding dummy variables to the Dickey-Fuller regression. From the empirical point of view almost any result from the test can be obtained by a convenient selection of dummy variables. In this paper we address the problem of testing for unit roots {{in the presence of}} additive outliers. We suggest to use a robust procedure based on running Dickey-Fuller tests on the <b>trend</b> <b>component</b> instead of the original series. Bootstrap on the Dickey{Fuller tests based on the <b>trend</b> <b>component</b> is proposed as a solution to the size problem of the test in the presence of MA(1) terms.
