40|$|A common {{prejudice}} {{describes the}} rural moneylender as a usurer and loan shark exploiting his poor debtors. But {{a closer look}} {{on the basis of}} economic anthropological and new institutional approaches exhibits a better image of the rural moneylender. In India, which is because of the moneylenders’ historical importance and its high rural branch density an appropriate example, the rural moneylender seems more of a social insider, whose information advantage in comparison to formal banks enables crediting even the non-bankable rural poor and saves costs for both parties. After credit disbursement the rural moneylender’s social and cultural closeness to his clientele, unconventional forms of securing the loans and <b>tailored</b> <b>debt</b> collection methods guaranty high repayment rates. Whether interest rates are too high or even usurious in this context has to be examined in every single case. Socio-cultural characteristics of the region and of the target group in consideration have {{to be taken into account}} thereby. There are three main factors that influence, whether a moneylender exploits his clientele or not: his intrinsic motivation, the power relations within the social group in consideration and the infrastructural parameters. Especially in phases of transition the power relations in the social group might be out of balance, informal norms - because of the increasing importance of formal rules - might loose their binding power, and therefore there might be incentives for moneylenders to exploit their customers. Instead of the interdiction of the moneylenders, to prevent exploitation the general framework should be designed and maintained as to reduce exploitation incentives to a minimum. The financial technology of rural moneylenders in India is especially advantageous for microcredits to poorer people and their flexibility as to credit and repayment patterns leads to excellent repayment rates. For India, rural moneylenders should therefore be considered more as complements to the formal rural financial sector. Their financial technology may also be replicable for microfinance institutions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} origins of World Bank {{indicators}} of debt distress and their employment as HIPC sustainability targets. These targets are interpreted as ‘switching values’, below which countries are (on average) expected to avoid debt service problems, but as such, they do {{not take into account}} that countries encounter debt service problems {{for a variety of reasons}} and at different levels of debt. It is likely that the ‘true’ switching value of the debt to export ratio of several HIPCs lies below the lower bound of the present target range. Regarding the ‘fiscal window’, the lack of analytical basis for a 280 percent target for the debt to revenue ratio is noted, and the consistency problems raised by the added ‘openness_tax’ condition are discussed. Moreover, the implications for economic performance of the pursuit for a s ustainable debt position remain a concern. It seems uncertain whether the development needs of HIPC countries can be accommodated within sustainable debt paths, as envisioned. The paper concludes that the sustainability targets, as presently applied, are not well supported in analytical terms. The rationale for adopting an average target range for the debt indicators involved remains weak, and the adoption of country_specific targets is suggested as a way to <b>tailor</b> <b>debt</b> relief more accurately to country needs.

While he is buying a cake on his way home, a car double-parks next to his, {{preventing}} his exit.
