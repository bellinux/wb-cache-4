He made portico-shaped bridges and suspended bridges over the Zambezi River and Save River in Mozambique, and <b>trussed</b> <b>beam</b> bridges, over the Mondego river in Figueira da Foz, over the Kwanza river in Angola, over the Limpopo river in Xai-Xai, and in Macau. His big span concrete arcs, {{as on the}} Arrábida bridge (Porto), and in re-reinforced concrete porticos, as on the S. João railway bridge, achieved world records for that time. Since <b>trussed</b> <b>beam</b> bridges, as the Figueira da Foz bridge, the first Portuguese trussed beams bridge, until suspended bridges without rigidity beam, stabilized by the suspended cable and the inclination of kingpost whole rigidity, as in Zambeze bridge, Edgar Cardoso branded by the difference the structures engineering evolution. The Macau Taipa bridge was a challenge because of its provoctive shape, a convex superstructure. Exceptionally large sizes were a characteristic of his last inventions, such as the S.

Pultrusion composite profiles and steel cables were considered as the materials of the <b>trussed</b> <b>beam</b> top chord, web and bottom chord, correspondingly. <b>Trussed</b> <b>beam</b> with strut frames, <b>trussed</b> <b>beam</b> with triangular web and <b>trussed</b> <b>beam</b> with vertical struts were compared {{from the point of view}} of maximum vertical displacements. The <b>trussed</b> <b>beam</b> with vertical struts is characterized by the increased deformability in case if the load is uniformly distributed by the half of the span. It was shown, that the application of additional diagonals allows to decrease the deformability of <b>trussed</b> <b>beam</b> with vertical struts. The dependence of load-bearing capacity on construction height and material consumption was obtained for the <b>trussed</b> <b>beam</b> with vertical struts with the 46 m span.

40|$|Abstract. An {{optimizing}} design idea {{is produced}} for {{the structure of}} top beam of electrostatic precipitator casing. The thermos cabinet and the original box shaped top beam of casing compose a <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> system whose overall section height is increased greatly, resultantly, the bend bearing capacity of <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> increases significantly {{than that of the}} original top beam of casing. Consequently, the wall thickness of box section of the original top beam can be reduced so that the steel consumption can be saved. Based on a practical project, the load effects on <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> were investigated, respectively, including the air pressure difference and the temperature difference among external layer, thermos cabinet and interior of casing. Besides, the evaluation method of internal force in <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> was investigated and the selective preference of <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> configuration was conducted. The unfavorable load cases of air pressure difference and temperature difference are proposed for <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> design. Besides, the accurate evaluation method of internal force and the design method for economical configuration of truss are proposed. In consideration of load bearing effect of thermos cabinet layer, the optimized design of <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> originating from box sectioned top beam can ensure the truss works safely and reduce the steel consumption significantly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. When the {{scaffold}} construction method is applied on long-span steel trussed arch bridges, reasonable {{setting of the}} temporary pier elevation has significant influence on assembly linearis and safety assembly of long-span steel trussed arch bridges with semi-cantilever.

40|$|The present paper {{investigates the}} lateral {{stability}} of unrestrained lattice girder. According to the European steel code, Eurocode 3, the unrestrained beam buckling resistance {{is a function}} of the theoretical lateral buckling moment of the beam. The expression of the lateral buckling moment is proposed by the Code for solid webgirder; however, no information is given for the case of <b>trussed</b> <b>beam.</b> Lattice girder, which can provide relatively light structures with high rigidity, are often used as beams, and when such unrestrained elements bend about their strong inertia axis, they exhibit a lateral buckling phenomenon. The paper presents a model that was developed for the analysis of the lateral buckling stability of trussed beams with constant cross section. Based on this model, an expression of the lateral buckling moment is established in the case of uniformly distributed loads...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the dynamic {{characteristics}} of truss structures made of the nonperiodic lattices, a cantilever <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> was analyzed for vibrations. In addition, three additional lattice configurations were also constructured along with two beams made of tetrahedrons. The relative frequency variations of the six cantilever <b>truss</b> <b>beams</b> for their first mode were examined. To make the comparison meaningful, the beam length, the number of lattice joints and the total weight were chosen to be identical within 2 percent differences. The frequencies of the four nonperiodic <b>truss</b> <b>beams</b> varied over 60 percent while those of the two beams of tetrahedron lattices only about 13 percent.

40|$|The {{results from}} {{experimental}} tests {{on a particular}} type of hybrid structure, known as steelconcrete <b>truss</b> <b>beams,</b> are described in this work. Steel-concrete <b>truss</b> <b>beams</b> are typically composed by a steel <b>truss</b> <b>beam</b> which is self bearing during the floor casting (first load phase) and then collaborates with the hardened concrete in the second load phase to give a composite resistant section. The particularity of the beams investigated in this work is that the lower current of the truss is formed by a longitudinal steel plate, having a rectangular section to support the slab and the concrete cast. This beam type is the original one invented by Salvatore Leone in the 60 s. In the experimental investigation 8 beams were tested, 4 of them were made only by the bare steel truss and the other 4 were completed with the concrete cast. The two beam sets have been submitted respectively to 6 and 4 tests. The beam sections, the static scheme, and the load positions were designed in order to investigate both the bending and shear failure modes. The main experimental results are reported and commented in the following...|$|R
40|$|The {{definition}} “hybrid trussed beams” {{indicates a}} particular type of steel-concrete structural elements which are composed by prefabricated steel trusses completed by in-situ casting of concrete (cast-in-place concrete). They can be classified among the partially prefabricated and composed structure. 	From their first ideation and introduction, that goes back in 1967 by means of S. Leone, the interest of the civil engineering for hybrid <b>trussed</b> <b>beams</b> has been continuously increasing and nowadays they cover a relevant part of the total demand of beam prefabrication in Italy and applications range from the more traditional residential and industrial constructions to the infrastructure realizations. 	The increasing appeal of hybrid <b>trussed</b> <b>beams</b> now claims the definition of a standard for their calculation and realization. Perhaps the theoretical studies and experimental investigations conduced in the past on this structures are partial and insufficient to give a complete and exhaustive explanation of their structural performance, specially for the aspects of ductility and shear resistance. An articulate experimental program have been planned at the University of Padova to give a contribution in this field. 	In this work the first results from tests conduced on simply supported beams to investigate the flexural and shear behavior of the hybrid <b>trussed</b> <b>beams</b> are reported. The tests have been conduced on a series of 8 classic beams (named REP® NOR beams) made with a lower steel plate. Four of these have been loaded as bare, without integrative casting, to simulate the working condition in the first phase. The remaining four were completed with the concrete casting and tested. Globally 10 destructive tests have been conduced, both in the shear and in bending fields. In the paper, after the description of the test setup, the experimental results will be listed.
