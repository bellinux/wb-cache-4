5|$|East Coker is {{the second}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets. It was started {{as a way for}} Eliot <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> writing poetry and was {{modelled}} after Burnt Norton. It was finished during early 1940 and printed for the Easter edition of the 1940 New English Weekly. The title refers to a small community that was directly connected to Eliot's ancestry and was home to a church that was later to house Eliot's ashes.|$|E

The West Indies racked up 448/9 despite no batsman reaching a century. England had a chance <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the match, but from 334/7, the unheralded batting of Marshall (72) and Ambrose (43*) took the tourists into a position of dominance.|$|E

5|$|Anderlecht {{began the}} second half the better of the two sides as they pushed forward {{in an attempt to}} extend their lead. Rensenbrink, in particular, was in good form as he caused {{numerous}} problems for Liverpool defender Emlyn Hughes, who started because of an injury to Phil Thompson after being absent himself for a lengthy period. Liverpool replaced David Johnson with midfielder Steve Heighway in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the match but it was to no avail as Anderlecht extended their lead late in {{the second half}} when Rensenbrink scored.

Vincenzo Nibali was forced to unclip himself from his bike, but avoided crashing. The peloton was reduced to around 40 riders {{at the foot of the}} climb. Although there were no bad injuries in the crash, Roche and Arashiro took some time to stand up, with Roche looking particularly dazed. Many of the riders who crashed attempted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the peloton, with Gerrans and Martin among them. Gerrans was forced to abandon the race shortly afterwards after he crashed for a second time.|$|E
5|$|During his suspension, Ramirez {{was allowed}} to work out at the Dodgers' {{facilities}} and he trained with Dodger coach Manny Mota. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> shape he was allowed a short rehab stint in the minor leagues. Ramirez played two games with the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes, where his appearance led to record crowds for the Isotopes. He played several games with the Single-A Inland Empire 66ers, homering in his first at-bat with the 66ers. Ramirez returned from his suspension and reclaimed his starting role with the Dodgers on July 3 against the San Diego Padres. On July 7, Ramirez was ejected by homeplate umpire John Hirschbeck after throwing his elbow guard in the air after being called out on strikes. Instead of causing conflict, Ramirez walked into the dugout where he remained {{the rest of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|In April 1945, {{after months}} of {{lobbying}} by Potts—who was keen <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> action himself after having been relieved of his previous command during the Kokoda campaign—the 7th Battalion was transferred to Torokina on Bougainville Island, where the Japanese garrison was still holding out. In June they moved up the Numa Numa Trail to Pearl Ridge in the central sector of the island where they relieved the 27th Battalion. Almost immediately they began aggressive patrols in order to dominate the Japanese in their area of operations and were tasked with the capture of several key positions including Wearne's Hill, Base Point 3, Tokua and Sisivie and to establish a forward position in the Wakunai Valley. Over {{the course of the}} next three months until the end of the war, the battalion captured 25 positions and killed around 200 Japanese soldiers.|$|E

In 1951, Smythe bought land for a farm in Caledon, Ontario, originally looking for a new location for a gravel pit. At first he kept only cattle, but in 1954 he decided <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> owning race horses, in partnership with Larkin Maloney, and an area was set aside to keep horses. Smythe learned about the business and went into breeding, buying mares in foal from top thoroughbred lines, and hiring future Hall of Fame trainer Yonnie Starr.|$|E

5|$|April brought further roster {{changes for}} the Hershey Bears, with Joel Rechlicz rejoining the team in {{exchange}} for Matt Clackson, and Stafford being traded for winger Dane Byers. Forward Michael Latta was also traded to Hershey, meaning the team had added seven new players to the roster via trades since January 31. The April trades were intended to add forward speed and depth to the team, but a late NHL trade deadline resulting from the lockout left only nine james to meld the new players into the line-up. After beating Syracuse 4–1 on April 5, Hershey fell into a four-game losing slump that briefly knocked them out of playoff contention. The first of those games, a 2-1 loss against Syracuse at home, drew a season-high attendance of 10,943. However, by April 12, a loss against Providence knocked them into ninth place, and last place in the East Division. Another loss {{the next day to}} Manchester left them tied with the Monarchs for last place at 75 points, a full four points behind Connecticut and Norfolk <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> the running for the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Fast {{recorded}} two assists {{during his}} October 30 debut with the Rangers AHL team, {{now called the}} Hartford Wolf Pack. However, he suffered a high ankle sprain after going into the boards during a November 2 game at Springfield. He missed the next 14 games as a result, not returning until December 20, but was given enough minutes upon his return that he was quickly able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> shape. Fast scored his first goal of the season on December 26, notching the game winner on the power play against Bridgeport Sound Tigers goalie Anders Nilsson. The game {{was part of a}} four-game point streak (two goals, two assists) that stretched from December 21 to December 29. Fast also set a team record on January 24 for fastest goal to start a period, scoring in the first seven seconds of the game against Springfield, beating Hartford's previous record by two seconds.|$|E

So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E
5|$|Although 52 {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only 43 could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Riggs clinched the third pole position of his career, and his third consecutive at Lowe's Motor Speedway, {{with a time of}} 28.203 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Kahne, his Evernham Motorsports teammate, and held the pole position until Riggs' lap. Kurt Busch originally qualified in third, but his car's right-rear shock absorber was found to have violated NASCAR regulations during the post-qualifying inspection because it did not bounce back. Busch was required to start from 42nd position after using a provisional. As a result, Casey Mears inherited third, Sadler fourth, and Harvick fifth. Burton, Martin, Clint Bowyer, Reed Sorenson and Johnson rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Kenseth, a Chase for the Nextel Cup driver, qualified eleventh, while Earnhardt took 16th and Kyle Busch 18th. The nine drivers who failed to qualify were Elliott, Kevin Lepage, Derrike Cope, Chad Chaffin, Hermie Sadler, Kirk Shelmerdine, Kenny Wallace (who crashed on his first timed lap), Morgan Shepherd (who elected not to set a lap time), and Carl Long (who crashed while attempting to record a timed lap). After the qualifier Riggs said that his team knew his car was good, and achieved a good draw by recording his lap time {{in the latter half of}} the session. He stated when returning to the track, his team wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>into</b> a rhythm of starting and finishing in a top position.|$|E
