5|$|With {{the opening}} of the New York – Pennsylvania Joint Bridge Commission, a {{predecessor}} of the current Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, in the 1920s to buy out these bridges from private ownership, the tolls along the bridges of the Delaware were beginning to come to an end. The Commission offered the Bridge Company an offer of $19,542.22 (1920s USD). The company took the offer and under new ownership, the tolls were eliminated. The bridge had more activity after the elimination of tolls and business continued to prosper. With the new owners, the bridge was kept under routine maintenance, and the bridge has continued to maintain a strong structure. Even with the floods from Hurricanes Connie and Diane of 1955 and the 1960s, the bridge survived with little to no structural damage. From May to October 1986, the commission closed the bridge to do some renovations. The wooden deck was replaced, the entire bridge was painted, and new guide rails were constructed. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that the 3 ton (6000lb) weight limit remained after the revamping. On November 14, 1988, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

40|$|When {{called upon}} {{to tell us what}} hedonism is, moral {{philosophers}} often start out by contradicting themselves. An extreme and blatant case would look like this: Hedonism: the view that (i) pleasure <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>is</b> intrinsically good, and (ii) pain <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>is</b> intrinsically bad; furthermore, the view that (iii) a complex thing such as a life, a possible world, or a total consequence of an action is intrinsically good iff it contains more pleasure than pain. The contradiction seems obvious, but since so many philosophers evidently don’t see it, perhaps it will be useful to employ the sledge hammer. According to the first clause, pleasure <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>is</b> intrinsically good. This implies that nothing distinct from pleasure is intrinsically good. Since pleasure (whatever precisely it may be) cannot be identified with any life or with any possible world, it would follow that no life or possible world is intrinsically good. Yet, according to the third clause, complex things such as lives and possible worlds are also intrinsically good when they contain a favorable balance of pleasure over pain. You cannot have it both ways: either (a) pleasure <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>is</b> intrinsically good (in which case no lives and no pos-sible worlds are intrinsically good), or else (b) some lives and some worlds are intrinsically good (in which case pleasure <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>is</b> intrinsically good). I claimed that many philosophers have contradicted themselves in this way. I will cite two prominent examples...|$|R
