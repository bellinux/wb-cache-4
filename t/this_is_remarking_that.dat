40|$|In <b>this</b> paper <b>is</b> <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> "mixed" {{strategies}} in games of electoral competition {{do not need}} to be interpreted as random moves. There are two a priori symmetric parties, and a finite (non spatial) set of alternatives. Parties are allowed to take unclear positions, by campaining on a "platform" that is a mix of several alternatives. Each individual nevertheless identifies a party with a single alternative, the number of individuals who identify a party with a given alternative being proportional to the importance of that alternative in the party's platform. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{starting}} point of <b>this</b> work <b>is</b> the <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> recent decades have been characterized by a rising complexity in {{the economic and political}} context both at the national and international level. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> due both to the European economic and monetary integration process and to the regional decentralisation process. With the aim of providing a useful tool of analysis for the decision-maker, a global regional model for the Italian labour market has been constructed on the basis of annual data from ISTAT-SVIMEZ over the 1970 - 2003 period. <b>This</b> model could <b>be</b> viewed as an extension to a multi-regional framework of the previous one-region model developed by Baussola (2007). The model shows good performance not only in representing regional labour market specificities, but also in reproducing national variable values. It is also robust and effective in a time-series context...|$|R
6000|$|In further {{evidence}} of <b>this</b> it may <b>be</b> <b>remarked,</b> <b>that</b> there has but recently disappeared from the salutations of men, an action having the same proximate derivation with the curtsy. That backward sweep of the foot with which the conventional stage-sailor accompanies his bow--a movement which prevailed generally in past generations, when [...] "a bow and a scrape" [...] went together, and which, within the memory of living persons, was made by boys to their schoolmaster with the effect of wearing {{a hole in the}} floor--is pretty clearly a preliminary to going on one knee. A motion so ungainly could never have been intentionally introduced; even if the artificial introduction of obeisances were possible. Hence we must regard it as the remnant of something antecedent: and that <b>this</b> something antecedent <b>was</b> humiliating may be inferred from the phrase, [...] "scraping an acquaintance;" [...] which, being used to denote the gaining of favour by obsequiousness, implies that the scrape was considered a mark of servility--that is, of serf-ility.|$|R
40|$|By way {{of paying}} tribute to Abdus Salam, I recall {{the ideas of}} higher {{unification}} that he and I initiated. I discuss {{the current status of}} those ideas in the light of recent developments, including those of: (a) gauge coupling unification, (b) discovery of neutrino-oscillation at SuperKamiokande, and (c) ongoing searches for proton decay. It <b>is</b> <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> the mass of clear support for an underlying unity of forces based on the ideas of (i) SU(4) -color, (ii) left-right symmetry and (iii) supersymmetry. The change in perspective, pertaining to both gauge coupling unification and proton decay, brought forth by supersymmetry and superstrings is presented. The beneficial roles of string- symmetries in addressing certain naturalness problems of supersymmetry, including that of rapid proton decay, are noted. In the last section, attention is drawn to the recent joint works with K. Babu and F. Wilczek, where the influence of neutrino masses and thus of the new SuperK result on proton decay <b>are</b> noted. In <b>this</b> context, it <b>is</b> <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> with neutrino masses and coupling unification revealed, the discovery of proton decay, that remains as the missing link, should not be far behind...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} Markov 2 ̆ 7 s {{principle}} is not derivable in dependent type theory with natural numbers and one universe. One tentative way to prove <b>this</b> would <b>be</b> to <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> Markov 2 ̆ 7 s principle does not hold in a sheaf model of type theory over Cantor space, since Markov 2 ̆ 7 s principle does not hold for the generic point of <b>this</b> model. It <b>is</b> however not clear how to interpret the universe in a sheaf model. Instead we design an extension of type theory, which intuitively extends type theory {{by the addition of}} a generic point of Cantor space. We then show the consistency of this extension by a normalization argument. Markov 2 ̆ 7 s principle does not hold in this extension, and it follows that it cannot be proved in type theory...|$|R
60|$|Weatherbee was a clerk who {{had known}} naught but clerking all his life; Cuthfert was a master of arts, a dabbler in oils, and had written not a little. The one was a lower-class man who {{considered}} himself a gentleman, {{and the other was}} a gentleman who knew himself to <b>be</b> such. From <b>this</b> it may <b>be</b> <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> a man can be a gentleman without possessing the first instinct of true comradeship. The clerk was as sensuous as the other was aesthetic, and his love adventures, told at great length and chiefly coined from his imagination, affected the supersensitive master of arts {{in the same way as}} so many whiffs of sewer gas. He deemed the clerk a filthy, uncultured brute, whose place was in the muck with the swine, and told him so; and he was reciprocally informed that he was a milk-and-water sissy and a cad. Weatherbee could not have defined 'cad' for his life; but it satisfied its purpose, which after all seems the main point in life.|$|R
6000|$|In Mangaia {{the myth}} of the origin of the cocoa-nut tree is a series of {{transformation}} scenes, in which the persons shift shapes with the alacrity of medicine-men. Ina used to bathe in a pool where an eel became quite familiar with her. At last the fish took courage and made his declaration. He was Tuna, the chief of all eels. [...] "Be mine," [...] he cried, and Ina was his. For some mystical reason he was obliged to leave her, but (like the White Cat in the fairy tale) he requested her to cut off his eel's head and bury it. Regretfully but firmly did Ina comply with his request, and from the buried eel's head sprang two cocoa trees, one from each half of the brain of Tuna. As a proof of <b>this</b> <b>be</b> it <b>remarked,</b> <b>that</b> when the nut is husked we always find on it [...] "the two eyes and mouth of the lover of Ina".(1) All over the world, from ancient Egypt to the wigwams of the Algonkins, plants and other matters are said to have sprung from a dismembered god or hero, while men are said to have sprung from plants.(2) We may therefore perhaps look on it as a proved point that the general savage habit of [...] "levelling up" [...] prevails even in their view of the vegetable world, and has left traces (as we have seen) in their myths.|$|R
500|$|Abbott began practising on the Oxford Circuit; while {{travelling}} {{there he}} had a fall from his horse, which broke his leg in two places and left him permanently lame. In 1802 he published a legal tract, On Merchants' Ships and Seamen, which was praised by his fellow lawyers and earned him {{a large amount of}} commercial work; it was later republished in the United States, where it was misattributed to Charles Abbot, the Speaker of the House of Commons. He would be [...] "as eminent and prosperous as a counsel can be at the English bar", although he refused to apply for silk. From 1802 to 1816 he served as [...] "Devil to the Attorney General", opening all government prosecutions, and was standing counsel for the Bank of England and many Deans and Prelates in the Church of England. By 1807 he was making £8,000 a year, and later exceeded <b>this</b> amount; it <b>was</b> <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> he earned more money than any other barrister of that time. Abbott was not a [...] "flashy" [...] barrister; although known as an excellent lawyer, his speeches were monotonous and he lacked an imagination.|$|R
60|$|The Major must {{be allowed}} to have had not a little merit and forbearance, and to have {{exhibited}} a highly creditable degree of family affection. The life at Fairoaks was uncommonly dull to a man who had the entree of half the houses in London, and was in the habit of making his bow in three or four drawing-rooms of a night. A dinner with Doctor Portman or a neighbouring Squire now and then; a dreary rubber at backgammon with the widow, who did her utmost to amuse him; these were the chief of his pleasures. He used to long for the arrival of the bag with the letters, and he read every word of the evening paper. He doctored himself too, assiduously,--a course of quiet living would suit him well, he thought, after the London banquets. He dressed himself laboriously every morning and afternoon: he took regular exercise up and down the terrace walk. Thus with his cane, his toilet, his medicine-chest, his backgammon-box, and his newspaper, this worthy and worldly philosopher fenced himself against ennui; and if he did not improve each shining hour, like the bees by the widow's garden wall, Major Pendennis made one hour after another pass as he could, and rendered his captivity just tolerable. After <b>this</b> period it <b>was</b> <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> fond of bringing round the conversation to the American war, the massacre of Wyoming and the brilliant actions of Saint Lucie, the fact being that he had a couple of volumes of the 'Annual Register' in his bedroom, which he sedulously studied. It is thus a well-regulated man will accommodate himself to circumstances, and show himself calmly superior to fortune.|$|R
60|$|Outside on the {{platform}} a few people lounged, waiting {{the arrival of the}} expected train. Among them was one whose bulky frame and firm strongly-lined countenance spoke of much power to dare and do. He was considerably above the middle height and somewhere about middle age. His costume was of that quiet unobtrusive kind which seems to court retirement, and the sharp glance of his eyes seemed to possess something of the gimblet in their penetrating power. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> no less a personage than Mr Sharp, the inspector of police on the Grand National Trunk Railway. Mr Inspector Sharp had evidently an eye for the beautiful, for he stood at the farther extremity of {{the platform}} gazing in rapt attention at the sun, which just then was setting in a flood of golden light. But Mr Sharp had also a peculiar faculty for observing several things at once. Indeed, some of his friends, referring to <b>this,</b> <b>were</b> wont to <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> a perfect Argus, with eyes in his elbows and calves and back of his head. It would seem, indeed, that this, or something like it, must really have been the case, for he not only observed and enjoyed the sunset but also paid particular attention to the conversation of two men who stood not far from him, {{and at the same time}} was cognisant of the fact that behind him, a couple of hundred yards or more up the line, a goods engine was engaged in shunting trucks.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{critics have}} been less kind however, arguing that if the later plays show a skilled and {{confident}} writer exploring serious issues of the human heart, Two Gentlemen represents the initial, primarily unsuccessful attempt to do likewise. In 1921, for example, J. Dover Wilson and Arthur Quiller-Couch, in their edition of the play for the Cambridge Shakespeare, famously stated that after hearing Valentine offer Silvia to Proteus [...] "one's impulse, upon <b>this</b> declaration, <b>is</b> to <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> there <b>are,</b> by <b>this</b> time, no gentlemen in Verona." [...] H.B. Charlton, writing in 1938, argues that [...] "clearly, Shakespeare's first attempt to make romantic comedy had only succeeded {{so far as it}} had unexpectedly and inadvertently made romance comic." [...] Another such argument is provided by Norman Sanders in 1968; [...] "because the play reveals a relatively unsure dramatist and many effects managed with a tiro's lack of expertise, it offers us an opportunity to see more clearly {{than anywhere else in the}} canon what were to become characteristic techniques. It stands as an 'anatomie' or show-through version, as it were, of Shakespeare's comic art." [...] Kurt Schlueter, on the other hand, argues that critics have been too harsh on the play precisely because the later plays are so much superior. He suggests that when looking at Shakespeare's earlier works, scholars put too much emphasis on how they fail to measure up to the later works, rather than looking at them for their own intrinsic merits; [...] "we should not continue the practice of holding his later achievements against him when dealing with his early beginnings." ...|$|R
