5|$|The {{final two}} {{locomotives}} Nos. 6256 and 46257 Sir William A. Stanier, F.R.S and City of Salford were given many new features. In order {{to raise the}} mileage between general overhauls from 70,000 to 100,000, measures were taken to decrease wear to the axle bearings and hornguides {{through the use of}} roller bearings and manganese steel linings. Other modifications included further superheating area, a redesigned rear frame and cast steel <b>trailing</b> <b>truck,</b> rocking grate, hopper ashpan and redesigned cab-sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) driving wheels which were lighter, yet stronger than the spoked equivalent. These proved to be successful and were later used on other Bulleid classes. The leading bogie was based upon that of the SR Lord Nelson class, although it had a 6ft 3 in (1.90 m) wheelbase as opposed to Maunsell's 7ft 6 in (2.28 m) design, and featured 3ft 1 in (0.94 m) BFB wheels. A long coupled driving wheelbase was incorporated into the design, to keep the locomotives within the lineal loading of the Southern Railway's narrower bridges. The supporting rear <b>trailing</b> <b>truck</b> was a one-piece steel casting that gave the smoothest of rides; the design was utilised in the future BR Standard Class 7.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, {{class leader}} N 110 was {{equipped}} with a two-cylinder Franklin booster engine which drove the <b>trailing</b> <b>truck</b> axle. Based {{on the success of}} this device, VR built all but two of the much larger X class 2-8-2s with booster engines. VR also modified the design of the Delta <b>trailing</b> <b>truck</b> on the second (1930-31 built) batch of N class locomotives to enable easy retrofitting of booster engines. Despite this, no further boosters were ever fitted, and in 1945, N 110's booster was removed and fitted to one of the two non-booster equipped X class locomotives.|$|E
50|$|K4s numbers 3676, 5399, and 5436 were {{fitted with}} booster engines on the <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> in 1941.|$|R
50|$|F. The {{horizontal}} centerline of {{the highest}} <b>truck</b> <b>trailing</b> arm mounting bolt must not be higher than the top surface of the <b>truck</b> <b>trailing</b> arm crossmember, at the respective <b>truck</b> <b>trailing</b> arm mounting bracket, when the vehicle is at inspection orientation.|$|R
50|$|As built, the Class GF had inside {{bearings}} {{in their}} two-wheeled <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> and considerable trouble was experienced with hot-boxes on these axles. Once these were modified to outside bearings, they {{proved to be}} very successful locomotives. Their good turn of speed and reasonably high tractive effort made the class a good utility locomotive.|$|R
25|$|X38 {{introduced}} a new welded fabricated <b>trailing</b> <b>truck</b> {{in place of the}} cast steel units previously imported from the Commonwealth Steel Company of Illinois, USA. This design innovation was fitted to all subsequent examples built.|$|E
25|$|The Sclass was VR's first three-cylinder locomotive, and Smith's {{design was}} {{influenced}} by Nigel Gresley's Great Northern Railway A1 class 4-6-2 with its Gresley conjugated valve gear. The Sclass also showed American design influence in its use of a delta <b>trailing</b> <b>truck</b> and bar frames rather than plate frames.|$|E
25|$|A 2-8-8-4 steam locomotive, {{under the}} Whyte notation, has two leading wheels, {{two sets of}} eight driving wheels, and a four-wheel <b>trailing</b> <b>truck.</b> The type was {{generally}} named the Yellowstone, a name given it by the first owner, the Northern Pacific Railway, whose lines run near Yellowstone National Park. Seventy-two Yellowstone-type locomotives were built for four U.S. railroads.|$|E
50|$|E. The {{left and}} right side <b>truck</b> <b>trailing</b> arms must be mounted to the <b>truck</b> <b>trailing</b> arm {{mounting}} brackets using a one-piece, minimum ¾ inch diameter magnetic steel bolt.|$|R
50|$|The 4-8-2+2-8-4 Double Mountain was {{probably}} the optimal Garratt wheel arrangement, with the four-wheeled leading bogies and the two-wheeled <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> on each engine unit ensuring stability at speed and with sixteen coupled wheels for traction. More coupled wheels would inhibit the locomotive on tight curves, while the only advantage of more non-coupled wheels would be to reduce the axle loading.|$|R
25|$|Steam Era Models has {{produced}} a brass and whitemetal kit for the X Class steam locomotive, items L10E for 1929-1935, L10R and L10W for the 1945-1962 period riveted and welded tenders respectively, with numbers included for X28, 29, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 46, 50 and 51. Alternative parts are also included for fabricated or cast <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> (under the cab), plate or lattice cowcatchers.|$|R
25|$|Superficially {{similar to}} the Mason Bogie is another design, the Forney locomotive. Like the Mason Bogie, the Forney has powered axles under the boiler and a <b>trailing</b> <b>truck</b> under the rear bunker and tank behind the cab. However, the Forney's driving wheels are fixed in the frame, rather than articulated. They were {{reasonably}} popular on American narrow gauge railroads.|$|E
25|$|A {{booster engine}} for steam {{locomotives}} {{is a small}} two-cylinder steam engine back-gear-connected to the <b>trailing</b> <b>truck</b> axle on the locomotive or, if none, the lead truck on the tender. A rocking idler gear permits it {{to be put into}} operation by the engineer. It would drive one axle only and could be non-reversible with one idler gear or reversible with two idler gears.|$|E
25|$|He {{did this}} by {{removing}} one boiler {{of the double}} Fairlie and retaining only one power truck at the front. A much larger cab was fitted, and a fuel bunker and water tank behind the cab, supported by a <b>trailing</b> <b>truck.</b> The advantages of the Fairlie design were kept; the swivelling driven truck for a greater ability to negotiate curves, and the large open space between the trucks to fit a large firebox unrestricted by the wheels.|$|E
50|$|The {{predecessor}} 4-8-2+2-8-4 Double Mountain {{was probably}} the optimal Garratt wheel arrangement, with the four-wheeled leading bogies and the two-wheeled <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> on each engine unit ensuring stability at speed and with sixteen coupled wheels for traction. More coupled wheels would inhibit the locomotive on tight curves, while the only advantage of more non-coupled wheels, such as on the Double Northern, was to reduce the axle loading.|$|R
50|$|Steam Era Models has {{produced}} a brass and whitemetal kit for the X Class steam locomotive, items L10E for 1929-1935, L10R and L10W for the 1945-1962 period riveted and welded tenders respectively, with numbers included for X28, 29, 33, 35, 36, 38, 39, 46, 50 and 51. Alternative parts are also included for fabricated or cast <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> (under the cab), plate or lattice cowcatchers.|$|R
50|$|One further 4-6-2 type was the G class. These {{were six}} three-cylinder Pacific {{locomotives}} that were rebuilt from three unsuccessful G class 4-6-2+2-6-4 Garratt locomotives by NZR’s Hillside Workshops in 1937. They were equipped with AB class boilers, new roller bearing <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks,</b> new cabs and Vanderbilt type tenders of similar design {{to that of}} the AB class. Like the Garratts they were created from, the rebuilds were not considered successful.|$|R
25|$|The NP's {{desire to}} burn low grade {{semi-bituminous}} coal from company-owned mines at Rosebud, Montana, {{played a part}} {{in the development of the}} 4-8-4 wheel arrangement for steam locomotives. With a BTU fifty percent lower than anthracite coal, the NP's locomotive design called for a much larger firebox, and thus an additional axle on the <b>trailing</b> <b>truck.</b> This led locomotive designers from the 4-8-2 Mountain to the 4-8-4 Northern, first produced by Alco for the NP in 1926 and designated the Class A by the railway.|$|E
25|$|The Rs were {{pressed into}} {{secondary}} passenger and goods service, roles {{for which a}} Hudson with large diameter driving wheels was sometimes a less than ideal choice. There was little opportunity to exploit their high speed capability. Furthermore, their relatively low factor of adhesion (4.08) and lack of fully compensated springing, coupled with the tendency of locomotives to transfer weight to the rearmost wheels under high drawbar pull conditions (which {{in the case of}} the R meant a weight transfer from the driving wheels to the unpowered <b>trailing</b> <b>truck)</b> caused them to slip when starting heavy goods trains.|$|E
25|$|As {{locomotive}} types {{began to}} diverge {{in the late}} 19th century, freight engine designs at first emphasised tractive effort, whereas those for passenger engines emphasised speed. Over time, freight locomotive size increased, and {{the overall number of}} axles increased accordingly; the leading bogie was usually a single axle, but a <b>trailing</b> <b>truck</b> was added to larger locomotives to support a larger firebox that could no longer fit between or above the driving wheels. Passenger locomotives had leading bogies with two axles, fewer driving axles, and very large driving wheels in order to limit the speed at which the reciprocating parts had to move.|$|E
50|$|Roller {{bearings}} {{supplied by}} Timken or SKF were {{used on the}} four wheel pilot and <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> {{as well as the}} six wheel tender trucks. The first 20 examples, (2100-2119) used friction bearings on the eight driving wheels, while the final 10 (2120-2129), intended for both freight and passenger service, had roller bearings throughout. The driving wheels themselves used the Boxpok design with a diameter of 70 in.|$|R
50|$|The boiler for the S1 was {{the largest}} built by the Pennsylvania Railroad, with 660 sq ft of direct heating surface and 500 1 inch tubes and flues. The six-wheel leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> were added, as the {{locomotive}} was too heavy for four-wheel units. The streamlined Art Deco styled shell of the locomotive was designed by Raymond Loewy, for which he received U.S. Patent No. 2,128,490. The cost of an S1 was $669,780.00, equal to $ today.|$|R
50|$|Similar to a boardslide {{only the}} skater turns 90 degrees {{so that the}} <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> are placed over the rail/ledge/coping and the skater slides on {{the middle of the}} board. Considered more complex than a boardslide due the {{rotation}} over the obstacle at the beginning into the trick and the re-entry or dismount. Note that in this case a frontside lipslide involves facing forwards while a backside lipslide involves facing backwards. Also known as a Disaster slide.|$|R
25|$|The K class 2-8-0 {{built by}} VR in 1922-23 was a success, {{but with a}} firebox mounted between frames {{engineered}} for broad gauge operation only, it was not readily gauge-convertible. Thus when additional branch line locomotives were required, the VR produced a 2-8-2 'Mikado' variant of the K, the first 2-8-2 tender engine in Australia. It retained the same wheels, cylinders, motion, {{and much of the}} frame of the K, but featured a longer boiler with a wider, larger grate, mounted above the frames and supported by a <b>trailing</b> <b>truck.</b> This enabled possible gauge conversion without radical re-engineering of the frames and grate.|$|E
25|$|The A1SLT had a {{preference}} for moving the engine to Sheffield Park by rail due to issues with the <b>trailing</b> <b>truck</b> potentially becoming damaged if the locomotive was transported by low-loader, but {{they would have been}} willing to move the engine by road if the Bluebell's extension was not completed in time for Tornado to visit, which it wasn't. However, repairs proved to be more extensive than previously thought, and {{the decision was made to}} withdraw the engine from the gala. However, in March 2013, the Bluebell Railway's extension was completed. Thus, Tornado in September 2013 hauled the first steam hauled railtour from London to Sheffield Park since 1963.|$|E

5000|$|Designed {{under the}} {{direction}} of engineer André Chapelon, this class demonstrated that large and powerful steam locomotives could run in general use on light rails of [...] with low speed limits. Their maximum axle load had been reduced to 10 tons, all were fitted with double Kylchap exhaust systems and their leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> had Athermos axle boxes. Three tender types could be coupled to them, one heavy and two light, for work in different areas.|$|R
50|$|The 2-6-6-4 was {{a fairly}} late development, {{a product of the}} superpower steam concept, {{introduced}} by the Lima Locomotive Works, which encouraged the use of large fireboxes supported by four-wheel <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks.</b> Such a firebox could sustain a rate of steam generation to meet any demands of the locomotive's cylinders, even at high speed. High speeds were certainly among the design goals for the 2-6-6-4; most of the type were intended for use on fast freight trains.|$|R
5000|$|Wheelbase: Overall, 9800 mm; <b>trailing</b> rear <b>truck,</b> 2600 mm. Track width: Front axle, 1250 mm (central {{distance}} between duplex tyres); middle and rear axle, 2000 mm.|$|R
2500|$|All but {{two were}} built with a {{featured}} a Franklin C2 type Booster engine on the <b>trailing</b> <b>truck</b> axle, following a successful {{trial of a}} booster on the smaller N class light lines 2-8-2. The booster allowed an additional [...] tractive effort at starting and low speeds to increase the hauling power of the locomotive, particularly on heavy grades. X36 and X37 were built without boosters and were rostered for 'plains working' on the relatively flat line between Gheringhap and Maroona stations. X37 was equipped with a booster in March 1932, however X36 was never fitted with one, even though its <b>trailing</b> <b>truck</b> axle was equipped with the necessary pinion gear wheel.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States and Australia, the <b>trailing</b> <b>truck</b> {{was often}} {{equipped}} with an auxiliary steam engine which provided extra power for starting. This booster engine was set to cut-out automatically at a certain speed. On the narrow-gauged New Zealand railway system, six Kb 4-8-4 locomotives were fitted with boosters, the only [...] engines {{in the world to}} have such equipment.|$|E
2500|$|They were {{equipped}} with the newest technology including the Worthington feedwater heater, superheater with front-end throttle, Cyclone front end, thermic syphons, a lateral cushioning device in the front pair of drivers on both engines and the front wheels and the <b>trailing</b> <b>truck,</b> as well as roller bearings on all axles, engine and tender, which gave them the reputation of [...] "yard creepers", because three men could move one on a level track with the cylinder cocks open.|$|E
50|$|The design flaws of the S1 {{related to}} curve {{compatibility}} and wheel slip led {{to only one}} example being produced. A revised, shorter design that used four wheel lead and <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> to place more weight on the drivers was developed for Baldwin's next iteration, the 4-4-4-4 T1. Unlike the S1, the T1 was actually used for long distance express service with such trains as the Broadway Limited and the Manhattan Limited, but the T1 was also plagued by wheel slip and related mechanical failures.|$|R
5000|$|In 1929, the ten [...] gauge South Australian Railways 500 class 4-8-2 Mountain {{types of}} 1926 were {{equipped}} with steam boosters {{in the form}} of small auxiliary steam engines to increase their power. This necessitated the replacement of their two-wheel <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> with four-wheel bogies. The booster contributed an additional 8000 lbf kN to the tractive effort and permitted an increase in the locomotive’s load across the Mount Lofty Ranges to 540 tons. In their new 4-8-4 configuration, they were reclassified to 500B class.|$|R
5000|$|After {{testing was}} complete, No. 3201 was {{assigned}} to the Munich No.1 locomotive shed. It did not distinguish itself in service, largely because its unique specification did not suit it to the duties of any other locomotive. However, it proved more efficient than the larger Bavarian S 3/6 4-6-2 [...] "Pacifics", although obviously with a lesser hauling ability. Its riding and tracking qualities came in for some criticism; this may have been because the leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>trucks</b> were not equalised with the driving wheels.|$|R
