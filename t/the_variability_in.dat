40|$|Isotope {{hydrograph}} separation (IHS) {{is a valuable}} tool to study runoff generation processes. To perform an IHS, samples of baseflow (pre-event water) and streamflow are taken at the catchment outlet. For rainfall (event water) either a bulk sample is collected or it is sampled sequentially during the event. For small headwater catchment studies, event water samples are usually taken at only one sampling location {{in or near the}} catchment because <b>the</b> spatial <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isotopic composition of rainfall is assumed to be small. However, few studies have tested this assumption. In this study, we investigated <b>the</b> spatiotemporal <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isotopic composition of rainfall and its effects on IHS results using detailed measurements from a small pre-alpine headwater catchment in Switzerland. Rainfall was sampled sequentially at eight locations across the 4. 3 km 2 Zwäckentobel catchment and stream water was collected in three subcatchments (0. 15, 0. 23, and 0. 70 km 2) during ten events. <b>The</b> spatial <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> rainfall amount, average and maximum rainfall intensity and the isotopic composition of rainfall was different for each event. There was no significant relation between the isotopic composition of rainfall and total rainfall amount, rainfall intensity or elevation. For eight of the ten studied events <b>the</b> temporal <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isotopic composition of rainfall was larger than <b>the</b> spatial <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rainfall isotopic composition. The isotope {{hydrograph separation}} results, using only one rain sampler, varied considerably depending on which rain sampler was used to represent the isotopic composition of event water. The calculated minimum pre-event water contributions differed up to 60 %. The differences were particularly large for events with a large spatial <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isotopic composition of rainfall and a small difference between the event and pre-event water isotopic composition. Our results demonstrate that even in small catchments <b>the</b> spatial <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rainfall isotopic composition can be significant and has to be considered for IHS studies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Stratification and {{nutrient}} loading are two primary factors leading to hypoxia in coastal systems. However, where {{these factors are}} temporally correlated, {{it can be difficult}} to isolate and quantify their individual impacts. This study provides a novel solution to this problem by determining the effect of stratification based on its spatial relationship with bottom-water dissolved oxygen (BWDO) concentration using a geostatistical regression. Ten years (1998 − 2007) of midsummer Gulf of Mexico BWDO measurements are modeled using stratification metrics along with trends based on spatial coordinates and bathymetry, which together explain 27 − 61 % of <b>the</b> spatial <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> BWDO for individual years. Because stratification effects explain only a portion of <b>the</b> year-to-year <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> mean BWDO; <b>the</b> remaining <b>variability</b> is explained by other factors, with May nitrate plus nitrite river concentration the most important. Overall, 82 % of <b>the</b> year-to-year <b>variability</b> <b>in</b> mean BWDO is explained. The results suggest that while both stratification {{and nutrient}}s play important roles in determining the annual extent of midsummer hypoxia, reducing nutrient inputs alone will substantially reduce the average extent. 1...|$|R
