5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ecology</b> {{of global}} carbon budgets gives {{one example of}} the linkage between {{biodiversity}} and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated to a large extent by <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic outgassing, the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500ppm.|$|E

50|$|A {{special issue}} of the Electronic Journal of Communication showcased the {{versatility}} of <b>the</b> communicative <b>ecology</b> approach (Hearn & Foth, 2007). In this issue, Allison (2007) looked at <b>the</b> communicative <b>ecology</b> from <b>the</b> perspective of the individual, whereas Wilkin, Ball-Rokeach, Matsaganis and Cheong (2007) used a panoptic perspective to compare <b>the</b> <b>ecologies</b> of geo-ethnic communities. Peeples and Mitchell (2007) used the model to explore the social activity of protest. Powell (2007) focused on a particular medium, public internet access, in an urban context.

5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich storehouse of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E
5|$|Bats play an {{important}} role in forest and cave ecology in Puerto Rico and help control mosquito populations. Most species (10 of 13) are cave-dwellers with low reproductive rates; the area with the highest species richness is the Caribbean National Forest, where eleven species occur. The red fig-eating bat (red fruit bat), endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, plays {{an important}} role in <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> of tabonuco forest in the Luquillo Mountains since it is believed to be the only seed disperser of bulletwood (Manilkara bidentata). Cave ecosystems are enhanced by bat feces (guano) since many of the invertebrate cave fauna are either guano scavengers, detritivores or predators of the former two.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, {{as are the}} kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved {{to protect them from}} the extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may also affect <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1953, Carson began {{library and}} field {{research}} on <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, The Edge of the Sea, {{which focuses on}} life in coastal ecosystems (particularly along the Eastern Seaboard). It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; The Edge of the Sea received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> of individual organisms, to those of populations, to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although population biology is more frequently used {{in the case of}} diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E

5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have also}} {{adversely}} impacted <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> of the Everglades by introducing numerous invasive species, which may prey on or compete with native species. A spectacular and particularly damaging {{example of this}} phenomenon is the recent proliferation of the Burmese python in the Everglades, as well as elsewhere in Florida. First observed in the wild in 1979 and not again until 1995, they have increased alarmingly since 2000. By 2011, decreases of 87.5%, 94.1%, 98.9% and 99.3% in sightings of bobcats, white-tailed deer, opossums and raccoons, respectively, were reported in park road surveys, while rabbits were no longer being seen at all.|$|E
5|$|In Winter of the Fisher, Cameron Langford relates {{a fictional}} {{encounter}} between a fisher and an aging recluse {{living in the}} forest. The recluse frees the fisher from a trap and nurses it back to health. The fisher tolerates the attention, but being a wild animal, returns to the forest when well enough. Langford uses <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> and known habits of the fisher to weave a tale of survival and tolerance in the northern woods of Canada.|$|E

5|$|Its name {{derives from}} potlatch, {{a type of}} {{ceremony}} held by the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest; one such tribe lived along the river {{for hundreds of years}} before the arrival of whites. Pioneers settled the watershed and established farms and ranches in the late 19th century. After that, logging eliminated most of the forests within the watershed and <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> of the river is {{still in the process of}} recovery. Fishing, hiking and camping are popular recreational activities on the river; 14 percent the watershed lies on public lands. Before logging and agriculture, many varieties of riparian and forest plants once populated the catchment, and several species of fish still swim the river and its tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Moser {{collected}} over 25,000 mycological specimens.

He circumscribed three new genera: Singeromyces (1966), Stephanopus (1975) and Anamika (2002). Much of his research covered four key areas: the taxonomy of Agaricales—including the classical morphotaxonomy and the chemotaxonomy of the order—the toxicity of the chemical constituents of members of the same order, and <b>the</b> <b>ecology</b> of ectomycorrhiza.|$|E
5|$|Plants convert {{carbon dioxide}} into biomass and emit oxygen into the atmosphere.
