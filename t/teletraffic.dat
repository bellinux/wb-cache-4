In the setting of stochastic geometry models, [...] Edgar Gilbert [...] in the 1960s proposed a mathematical model for wireless networks, now known as a Gilbert disk model, {{that gave rise to}} the field of continuum percolation theory, which in turn is a generalization of discrete percolation. Starting in the late 1970s, Leonard Kleinrock and others used wireless models based on Poisson processes to study packet forward networks. This work would continue until the 1990s where it would cross paths with the work on shot noise.|$|E
2500|$|The {{years after}} 1909 {{led to a}} number of studies and {{applications}} of the Poisson point process, however, its early history is complex, which has been explained by the various applications of the process in numerous fields by biologists, ecologists, engineers and others working in the physical sciences. The early results were published in different languages and in different settings, with no standard terminology and notation used. For example, in 1922 Swedish chemist and Nobel Laureate Theodor Svedberg proposed a model in which a spatial Poisson point process is the underlying process in order to study how plants are distributed in plant communities. A number of mathematicians started studying the process in the early 1930s, and important contributions were made by Andrey Kolmogorov, William Feller and Aleksandr Khinchin, among others. [...] In the field of <b>teletraffic</b> engineering, mathematicians and statisticians studied and used Poisson and other point processes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Teletraffic</b> {{science is}} the {{traditional}} term for all theoretical fundamentals and engineering practices to describe data flows in telecommunication networks, {{the performance of the}} usage of network resources, procedures for sizing of resources and engineering the networks for given traffic load and quality of service requirements. For more than 50 years of the 20th century, traffic or <b>teletraffic</b> has been identified primarily with telephone networks. With the huge development of computers, stored program control of network nodes and computer communication, the traditional <b>teletraffic</b> science field naturally extended to computer networks, mobile and wireless/optical networks, and for a wide spectrum of new applications. The convergence between the voice network, the Internet, the television and mobility raiseed new questions that request new models and tools to be developed. In addition, the development of community networks, home networking, multiple access networking technologies, and the advent of pervasive and ambient communications dictates new challenges to be addressed.Today, ITC addresses the emerging paradigms such as an increasing diversity of distributed applications and services over various media like mobile/optical networks, enabling new markets and economy.|$|E

50|$|<b>Teletraffic</b> {{engineering}} in telecommunications network planning ensures that network costs are minimised without compromising {{the quality of}} service (QoS) delivered to the user of the network. This field of engineering is based on probability theory {{and can be used}} to analyse mobile radio networks, as well as other telecommunications networks.|$|E
50|$|The {{growth of}} the PSTN meant that <b>teletraffic</b> {{engineering}} techniques needed to be deployed to deliver quality of service (QoS) guarantees for the users. The work of A. K. Erlang established the mathematical foundations of methods required to determine the capacity requirements and configuration of equipment {{and the number of}} personnel required to deliver a specific level of service.|$|E
50|$|This article {{discusses}} the mobile cellular network aspect of <b>teletraffic</b> measurements. Mobile radio networks have traffic issues {{that do not}} arise {{in connection with the}} fixed line PSTN. Important aspects of cellular traffic include: quality of service targets, traffic capacity and cell size, spectral efficiency and sectorization, traffic capacity versus coverage, and channel holding time analysis.|$|E
5000|$|The QoS in {{industry}} is also measured {{from the perspective}} of an expert (e.g. <b>teletraffic</b> engineer). This involves assessing the network to see if it delivers the quality that the network planner has been required to target. Certain tools and methods (protocol analysers, drive tests and Operation and Maintenance measurements), are used for this QoS measurement: ...|$|E
50|$|He was {{employed}} by AEG in Berlin (1921 - 23), worked for Reichspost (1923 - 33). In 1933, {{he was fired}} because he was Jewish. He moved to Paris, wherehe was consulting <b>teletraffic</b> engineer to various institutions from 1933 onwards.In 1977 was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize, although his age prevented him from receiving the prize in person.|$|E
50|$|As {{mentioned}} in the introduction, the purpose of <b>teletraffic</b> theory is to reduce cost in telecommunications networks. An important tool in achieving this goal is forecasting. Forecasting allows network operators to calculate the potential cost of a new network / service for a given QoS during the planning and design stage, thereby ensuring that costs are kept to a minimum.|$|E
5000|$|Self-similarity has {{important}} {{consequences for the}} design of computer networks, as typical network traffic has self-similar properties. For example, in <b>teletraffic</b> engineering, packet switched data traffic patterns seem to be statistically self-similar. [...] This property means that simple models using a Poisson distribution are inaccurate, and networks designed without taking self-similarity into account are likely to function in unexpected ways.|$|E
50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, a {{load profile}} is a graph {{of the variation}} in the electrical load versus time. A load profile will vary according to customer type (typical examples include residential, commercial and industrial), temperature and holiday seasons. Power producers use this information to plan how much electricity they will need to make available at any given time. <b>Teletraffic</b> engineering uses a similar load curve.|$|E
50|$|In {{probability}} theory the hypoexponential distribution or the generalized Erlang distribution is a continuous distribution, that has found {{use in the}} same fields as the Erlang distribution, such as queueing theory, <b>teletraffic</b> engineering and more generally in stochastic processes. It is called the hypoexponetial distribution as it has a coefficient of variation less than one, compared to the hyper-exponential distribution which has coefficient of variation greater than one and the exponential distribution which has coefficient of variation of one.|$|E
