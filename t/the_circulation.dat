5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave, {{which eventually}} became Erika, moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on August 31. Shortly after leaving the coast, it displayed a large low-level circulation, though as it tracked westward, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> failed to contract significantly. It slowly organized, and by September 3 the convection within <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> had sufficiently organized for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Six, while located about 1150miles (1850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20mph (32km/h) under the influence of a well-established subtropical ridge, and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed in late October. It became Tropical Depression Four-C on October 30 well southwest of Hawaii.

40|$|<b>The</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} atmospheric <b>circulations.</b> <b>The</b> main goal of this paper is to investigate whether <b>the</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> has changed in the past few decades as an integral part of global climate change. We focus on two key points: one is the horizontal scale of <b>the</b> Hadley <b>circulation,</b> and <b>the</b> other one is its strength. Using three meteorological reanalyses, we show that <b>the</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> has a significant expansion of about 2 to 4. 5 degrees of latitude in autumn for both hemispheres since 1979, and that two of the three reanalysis datasets show strengthening of <b>the</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> in Northern-Hemisphere winter. Trends derived from general circulation model simulations are compared with observed changes in <b>the</b> Hadley <b>circulation.</b> It is found that most simulations show poleward expansion of <b>the</b> Hadley <b>circulation,</b> with weaker magnitudes. However, most simulations display weakening of <b>the</b> Hadley <b>circulation,</b> rather than strengthening 1...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the dual}} blood {{supply to the}} lungs from both the {{bronchial}} and <b>the</b> pulmonary <b>circulation,</b> this tissue is more resistant to infarction. An occlusion of <b>the</b> bronchial <b>circulation</b> does not cause infarction, but it can still occur in pulmonary embolism when <b>the</b> pulmonary <b>circulation</b> is blocked and <b>the</b> bronchial <b>circulation</b> cannot fully compensate for it.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{pulmonary}} <b>circulation</b> is <b>the</b> {{portion of}} the circulatory system which carries deoxygenated blood away from the right ventricle of the heart, to the lungs, and returns oxygenated blood to the left atrium and ventricle of the heart. <b>The</b> term pulmonary <b>circulation</b> is readily paired and contrasted with <b>the</b> systemic <b>circulation.</b> <b>The</b> vessels of <b>the</b> pulmonary <b>circulation</b> are <b>the</b> pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary veins.|$|R
5|$|After {{turning back}} to the northwest, the {{convection}} around Linfa became even more symmetrical, although <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> became slightly elongated. At 06:00UTC on July4, the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity, with 10minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) according to the JMA. As Linfa neared the northern Philippines, the bulk of the convection was shifted to the southern periphery, due to the continued wind shear. Late on July4, the center of Linfa made landfall over Palanan, Isabela, on the island of Luzon. Moving westward across the island, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> became disorganized as the core convection diminished. By late on July5, Linfa emerged into the South China Sea. Once over open waters, Linfa began moving to the north-northwest, still moving around the subtropical ridge, and it was expected to move over Taiwan. <b>The</b> <b>circulation</b> remained well-defined but exposed, with the deep convection displaced to the south. With the isolated thunderstorms and unfavorable wind shear, the JTWC noted the potential for <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> to dissipate over open waters. By July7, easing wind shear allowed the convection to rebuild and for the structure to improve in organization. By that time, the future of the storm was still uncertain, although a turn to the northwest toward China was expected. Also on July7, PAGASA issued its final bulletin on the storm as Linfa exited their area of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Because of northeasterly shear, {{the center}} of <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> {{was removed from the}} convection, and the {{depression}} degenerated into a remnant low late on August 29. Many of the models had indicated that this was likely, but the National Hurricane Center (NHC) instead chose to forecast slight strengthening.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1834, threepence (3d) {{pieces were}} struck for circulation, bearing the same design as the Maundy 3d. <b>The</b> <b>circulation</b> pieces were {{initially}} struck {{for use in}} the West Indies, but beginning in 1845, were coined for use in Britain as well. Many of the 3d pieces presented to impoverished Maundy recipients were spent, and these are rarer than the other values today. Maundy 3ds may sometimes be distinguished from currency 3ds as dies with a more polished field were used for the Maundy pieces. The design of <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> 3d remained {{the same as that of}} the Maundy 3d until 1928, when a new design was introduced for the circulating coins.

5|$|Continuing to the west-southwest upon {{entering}} the basin, Evrina gradually weakened as the eye gradually dissipated. It soon encountered the same cooler waters of the southern Indian that affected previous storms Chikita and Davina. By April2, Evrina had weakened below tropical cyclone status, just 30hours after it was at peak intensity. Around that time, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> became exposed from the deepest convection, and the track shifted more to the west. On April5, Evrina weakened to tropical depression status. Two days later, the system turned toward the south, moving in a circular track around the island of Rodrigues while remaining far enough away not to cause any effects. On April8, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> turned to the east, dissipating two days later {{to the south of}} Rodrigues.|$|E
5|$|Further {{convective}} organization {{occurred as}} <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> consolidated, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert late on August6. The next day, the agency initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 16W about 780km (485mi) {{east of the}} Philippines island of Luzon. Subsequently, the depression maintained a northward track, due to its location along the northwest periphery of a near-equatorial ridge, {{as well as the}} presence of a tropical upper tropospheric trough. Although <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> was broad, the winds intensified enough for the JMA to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Rananim on August8.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lorenzo quickly {{developed}} a closed eyewall, which was observed on radar {{and provided a}} peak intensity estimate of 80mph (130km/h) at 0000UTC on September28. The cyclone maintained vigorous and symmetric convection across the center, although the structure deteriorated slightly before Lorenzo crossed the coast near Tecolutla, Veracruz at 0500UTC that day, with winds estimated around 75mph (120km/h). After making landfall, the hurricane rapidly weakened to tropical depression intensity. Progressing inland, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> became difficult to locate as the convection diminished to rainbands along the coast. Within 19hours after moving ashore, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> of Lorenzo dissipated, therefore ending its duration as a tropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|On August 14, Alma made {{landfall}} on Trinidad with {{winds of}} 55mph (90km/h), the southernmost landfall on that island since a storm in 1933. Even though the storm traversed Trinidad in only three hours, its time over land {{was sufficient to}} disrupt <b>the</b> <b>circulation.</b> The storm crossed the Gulf of Paria and made its second and final landfall on the Paria Peninsula of Venezuela, one of only four storms on record to do so; the others were in 1605, 1725, and 1933. The high mountains in Venezuela took a toll on the storm, ripping <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> and causing Alma to be downgraded to a tropical depression on August15. At 02:00UTC that day, Alma's circulation passed near Caracas. The convection rapidly diminished, and the storm's presence on satellite imagery faded, though the NHC noted the potential for redevelopment once it reached open waters. The storm did not survive its trek over land; late on August15, the NHC issued the final advisory after <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> dissipated near the border of Venezuela and Colombia. The remnants of Alma continued westward across South and Central America, reaching the Pacific Ocean where they would eventually restrengthen into Hurricane Joyce.|$|E
5|$|Reconnaissance Aircraft {{and surface}} reports {{confirmed}} {{the existence of}} a circulation. Dean moved northwestward at 22mph (35km/h), {{under the influence of the}} Bermuda High to its northeast. The storm strengthened slightly to reach winds of 60mph (95km/h) later on August 22, though <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> was exposed on the western edge of the convection due to the storm's quick forward motion and persistent wind shear. Initial forecasts predicted the shear to decrease, allowing Dean to attain hurricane status with winds of over 80mph (130km/h). However, an upper-level trough produced an increase of shear over the storm, and by August 23 Dean weakened to a tropical depression. Hours later, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> dissipated, and Dean degenerated into a tropical wave to the east of the Bahamas. Regeneration was considered unlikely at the time.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the {{previous}} depression and Tropical Storm Alda, Tropical Disturbance D2 developed in the Mozambique Channel, initially subtropical in nature. On February20, a cold front exited the African coast off Mozambique, spawning an area of convection. A weak low pressure area developed on February23, which proceeded to move southeastward. Due to unfavorable wind shear, the system failed to organize much, although initially it produced strong wind gusts. On February28, much of the convection was removed from <b>the</b> <b>circulation,</b> which looped over southwestern Madagascar to {{turn back to the}} west. On March4, when Tropical Storm Davina was named, the disturbance was renamed E1. The next day, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> executed a small loop, dissipating on March6 over eastern Mozambique.|$|E

40|$|Recent studies {{demonstrate}} that <b>the</b> Hadley <b>Circulation</b> has intensified and expanded {{for the past}} three decades, which has important implications for subtropical societies and may lead to profound changes in global climate. However, the robustness of this intensification and expansion that should be considered when interpreting long-term changes of <b>the</b> Hadley <b>Circulation</b> is still a matter of debate. It also remains largely unknown how <b>the</b> Hadley <b>Circulation</b> has evolved over longer periods. Here, we present long-term variability of <b>the</b> Hadley <b>Circulation</b> using <b>the</b> 20 th Century Reanalysis. It shows a slight strengthening and widening of <b>the</b> Hadley <b>Circulation</b> since <b>the</b> late 1970 s, which is not inconsistent with recent assessments.

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Gabrielle {{was located in}} an area of cooler air to its north, dry air to its south and west, southerly wind shear, and cooler water temperatures along its path. Despite these unfavorable conditions, a curved convective band developed in its northern and western quadrants, and <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> became better defined. Subsequently, the rainbands in its northeastern quadrant dissipated, leaving the well-defined center far removed from the convection. By later that day, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> began to become more involved with the remaining convection.

5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the depression was in an area not favorable for significant strengthening, due to land interaction and wind shear. It was tracking steadily northeastward, and as it {{moved closer to the}} coastline, the center of the depression was difficult to locate. However, the overall organization briefly improved, and in one forecast the depression was predicted to attain tropical storm status. Early on June4, convection weakened significantly, leaving the center partially exposed. Continued wind shear brought most of the associated thunderstorm activity onshore southwestern Mexico while the center of the depression remained just offshore. Late on June4, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> accelerated away from the deep convection as it passed a short distance south of Acapulco. Early on June5, <b>the</b> <b>circulation</b> dissipated, and later that night the remnants moved inland.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was located {{to the south}} of the subtropical ridge, resulting in a west-northwest track which brought the center over Guadeloupe. <b>The</b> <b>circulation</b> was initially broad, and dry air temporarily entrained the northwest quadrant of the storm. However, environmental conditions were favorable enough for further development, with a deepening trough to its west providing beneficial flow. Banding features improved around <b>the</b> <b>circulation,</b> and the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Jeanne on September 13 about 135mi (220km) southeast of Saint Croix. While crossing the Lesser Antilles, the storm brought locally heavy rainfall, with a total of 12inches (305mm) reported in Guadeloupe.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the tropical upwelling branch of <b>the</b> stratospheric Brewer–Dobson <b>circulation</b> are examined, with a particular focus {{on the role of}} <b>the</b> middle-atmosphere Hadley <b>circulation.</b> Upwelling is examined in terms of both <b>the</b> diabatic <b>circulation</b> and Lagrangian trajectories using a zonally symmetric balance model. The behavior of <b>the</b> wave-driven <b>circulation</b> in <b>the</b> presence of angular momentum redistribution by <b>the</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> is also considered.

It is found that <b>the</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> makes a significant contribution to annual mean tropical upwelling at the upwelling maximum {{in the vicinity of the}} stratopause, and can account for most of the annual mean upwelling seen in the GCM. In the mid- to lower stratosphere, the role of <b>the</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> is much weaker and wave drag appears to be required to explain the observed upwelling, although <b>the</b> Hadley <b>circulation</b> makes a nonnegligible contribution to the annual cycle of the upwelling. Subtropical wave drag can produce annual mean upwelling through a nonlinear mechanism; viscosity is not required. However, the magnitude of the observed upwelling suggests that wave drag must penetrate quite close to the equator...|$|R
