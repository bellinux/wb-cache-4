5|$|Systemin and AtPEP1 {{are found}} in the cell cytosol. <b>The</b> <b>precursor</b> to tomato systemin is {{transcribed}} as a 200 amino acid polypeptide. It does not contain a putative signal sequence suggesting that it is synthesised on free ribosomes in the cytosol. <b>The</b> <b>precursor</b> to AtPEP1 is a 92 amino acid polypeptide and also lacks a signal sequence. In tomato, mRNA encoding <b>the</b> <b>precursor</b> for systemin is present at very low levels in unwounded leaves but accumulates upon wounding, particularly in the cells surrounding the sieve elements of the phloem in vascular bundles of mid veins. <b>The</b> <b>precursor</b> accumulates exclusively in the phloem parenchyma cells of leaves in tomato after wounding. <b>The</b> <b>precursor</b> to potato systemin is also localised in a similar manner suggesting it is under the same cell-type-specific regulation in both species.|$|E

5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in {{the cell}} wall. <b>The</b> <b>precursor</b> for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide which has no structural homology to <b>the</b> <b>precursor</b> for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the secretory system. <b>The</b> <b>precursor</b> to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and petioles associated with parenchyma cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding {{it is thought that}} a protease from the cytosol, the cell wall matrix, or the pathogen, processes <b>the</b> <b>precursor</b> producing active HypSys peptides.|$|E
