50|$|Issue 1 {{introduces}} the basic gameplay {{concepts such as}} movement and combat. Central to the gameplay mechanic in Warheads: Medieval Tales is a <b>test</b> <b>table</b> which is used any time a character has to perform an action or determine the outcome of an event. In one axis of the <b>test</b> <b>table</b> is the POWER value {{and in the other}} is the RESISTANCE value, and by cross referencing these values, a player finds out how many standard six-sided dice to roll. How the power and resistance values are determined varies depending on the situation, but in general they are composed of the core stats of characters involved in the test, and any equipment or powers being used, and in some cases the difficulty of the action being attempted. Each die roll that scores 4 or more is considered a success (so in this way success is generally measured in degrees rather than being a binary success/failure result—though not in all cases). Dice rolls are modified by environmental factors and the skills of the characters involved, and as a consequence of these open-ended modifiers, dice rolls of 1 are always considered to be failures and dice rolls of 6 are always successes, regardless of modifiers. Each successful die roll made by a character earns it a point of experience (or XP). XP is also earned by achieving specific objectives in the set piece battles.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop a time-efficient tilt <b>table</b> <b>test.</b> BACKGROUNDCurrent protocols of tilt <b>table</b> <b>testing</b> are quite time-consuming. This study was designed to assess the diagnostic value, tolerance and procedural time of a single-stage isoproterenol tilt table protocol. METHODSA single-stage isoproterenol tilt <b>table</b> <b>test</b> was compared with the passive tilt <b>table</b> <b>test.</b> The study was prospectively designed in a randomized and crossover fashion. RESULTSThe study population consisted of 111 patients with a history of syncope (mean age 55 ± 20 years). Of the total, 62 patients (56 %; 95 % confidence interval, 46 % to 65 %) had a positive vasovagal response during isoproterenol tilt <b>table</b> <b>testing</b> and 35 (32 %; 23 % to 41 %) during passive tilt <b>table</b> <b>testing</b> (p = 0. 002). The mean procedural times of the study population were 11. 7 ± 3. 6 min and 36. 9 ± 13. 3 min for isoproterenol and passive tilt <b>table</b> <b>testing,</b> respectively (p < 0. 001). All patients tolerated single-stage isoproterenol testing. In the 23 control subjects (mean age 34 ± 11 years), the apparent specificities were 91 % (72 % to 99 %) and 83 % (61 % to 99 %) for passive and single-stage tilt <b>table</b> <b>testing,</b> respectively. CONCLUSIONSThe single-stage isoproterenol tilt <b>table</b> <b>test</b> was more effective in inducing a positive vasovagal response in an adult population than the standard passive tilt <b>table</b> <b>test,</b> and it significantly reduced the procedural time. The increase in positive yield was associated with a moderate decrease in apparent specificity. These observations support the conclusion that single-stage tilt <b>table</b> <b>testing</b> could be a reasonable diagnostic option in patients undergoing syncope evaluation...|$|R

The closed loop system performance of the controlled servo-hydraulic test facility is tested in various computer simulations using both, standard test signals and large test signals as system inputs. The simulation results turn out, that in case of standard input signals the test facility controller must include a linear <b>test</b> <b>table</b> mechanics model and a nonlinear servo-hydraulic actuator model. Additional simulations demonstrate the robustness of the control concept selected for standard test signals with respect to variations of plant parameters...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} study, both experimentally and analytically, {{is conducted}} {{to evaluate the}} feasibility of using appropriate shock <b>table</b> <b>tests</b> to mimic the drop impact environment for components and systems adopted in portable electronics. Firstly, experiments are carried out to observe the dynamic characteristics of typical portable electronic systems and components under drop impact. Then a series of shock <b>table</b> <b>tests</b> with different constraint conditions are designed to mimic the real-life impact state. By comparing the typical results from shock <b>table</b> <b>tests</b> and those from drop tests, the correlation of shock <b>table</b> <b>test</b> parameters and drop tests conditions is investigated. The results reveal that the conventional fully constrained shock <b>table</b> <b>test</b> cannot mimic the real-life drop impact conditions, while an appropriate shock <b>table</b> <b>test</b> method should allow the sample to rotate freely. Theoretical analysis is developed to explain {{the mechanics of the}} impact scenarios. It is found that due to Hertz contact spring effect and the rotational acceleration during the impact, the acceleration of the centroid sample is significantly different to that of the table. In addition, acceleration estimated by traditional force-divided-by-mass method may underestimate the real acceleration of components inside the products...|$|R
