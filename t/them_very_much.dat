5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{and after}} their meeting in 2010, players from both schools {{attributed}} {{the importance of}} the game to the negative feelings the programs have for each other. Virginia center Anthony Mihota said [...] "I guess it's because we don't like <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> Something about them that gets under our skin". [...] After Maryland's victory, Terp linebacker Adrian Moten commented, [...] "This was a big win in the rivalry. They hate us. We hate them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Iranian {{government}} {{responded that}} [...] "the Western media empire {{is trying to}} portray Iran as an anti-Semitic country". In addition, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that [...] "Jews are respected by everyone, by all human beings... some people think if they accuse me of being anti-Jew they can solve the problem. No, I am not anti-Jew... I respect <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>much...</b> We love everyone in the world– Jews, Christians, Muslims, non-Muslims, non-Jews, non-Christians".|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} <b>them</b> fight <b>very</b> <b>much</b> better {{now they have}} their emperor with them. You know, Wellington had all his work to beat them." ...|$|R
6000|$|He amused <b>them</b> all <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> {{stating that}} an omelet {{for an evening}} meal was [...] "an {{effective}} corrective of tired nerves" [...] and would enable him to sleep soundly all night.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{a feeling}} that it is still in the {{dangerous}} stage," [...] he said. [...] "But I will go." [...] He said this in a tone of desperation which amused <b>them</b> all <b>very</b> <b>much.</b>|$|R
2500|$|When {{discussing}} shooting format in an interview, Linklater {{discussed how}} insistent {{he was on}} shooting 35mm film:"We very intentionally shot {{in the same way}} throughout, just to get a unified look. 35mm negative is about the most stable thing you could shoot on. We kinda had that from the beginning. I remember it not even being a question. You know the HD formats, I didn't really like <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> at all. I'm just not warming up to them. But they change a lot. The film would have six different looks if we tried to keep up." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{took the}} title from {{a passage in}} Paradise Lost where Adam says to Eve that their {{expulsion}} from Paradise [...] "will prove no sudden but a slow pac'd evil,/ A Long Day's Dying to augment our pain," [...] and {{with the exception of}} the old lady Maroo, what all the characters seem to be dying of is loneliness, emptiness, sterility, and such preoccupation with themselves and their own problems that they are unable to communicate with each other about anything that really matters to <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> I am sure that I chose such a melancholy theme partly because it seemed effective and fashionable, but I have no doubt that, like dreams generally, it also reflected the way I felt about at least some dimension of my own life and the lives of those around me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of her essay, Clark {{considers}} the question of what makes a piece of literature a classic and why the idea of [...] "the classics" [...] is important to society as a whole. Clark says that [...] "teachers of English have been so long trained in the 'classics' that these 'classics' have become to <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> like the Bible, for the safety of which the rise of modern science causes such unnecessary fears." [...] She {{goes on to say that}} among the sources she consulted was a group of eighth-graders when she asked them the question: [...] "What do you understand by the classics in literature?" [...] Two of the answers Clark received were [...] "Classics are books your fathers give you and you keep them to give to your children" [...] and [...] "Classics are those great pieces of literature considered worthy to be studied in English classes of high school or college". Calvino agrees with the Ohio educator when he states [...] "Schools and universities ought to help us understand that no book that talks about a book says more than the book in question, but instead they do their level best to make us think the opposite." [...] Clark and Calvino come to a similar conclusion that when a literary work is analyzed for what makes it 'classic', that in just the act of analysis or as Clark says [...] "the anatomical dissection", the reader can end up destroying the unique pleasure that mere enjoyment a work of literature can hold.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh yes! one {{felt for}} <b>them</b> so <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> {{and they are}} so religious, so well principled, and all that one could wish; but family dissension is so dreadful. I am very little used to young men or boys, and I never knew {{anything}} like this.' ...|$|R
50|$|Expectedly, {{the people}} of Ugboland are {{predominantly}} fishermen and salt-makers which make <b>them</b> depend <b>very</b> <b>much</b> on water and consequently their close attachment to water elements. The Ugbo people and their other Ilaje kinsmen {{are all over the}} world engaged in high seas as well as in shallow waters.|$|R
6000|$|The {{story of}} Macbeth {{impressed}} <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> They knew {{the name of}} [...] Shakespeare, having seen his name over a public-house.|$|E

60|$|He fitted {{the key in}} the door, while Stephen and {{his mother}} smiled at each other at the thought of the rent. The gentleman opened the door, and stood aside to let <b>them</b> enter, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> as if he were showing them a palace for which he was the humble agent.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Gray and Rosie {{were all}} ready, {{and when they}} came to see the {{carriage}} which the boys had chosen for <b>them,</b> they were <b>very</b> <b>much</b> pleased with it.|$|R

6000|$|... "I can't blame <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> If {{they believe}} {{all that stuff}} about my mother and think that I knew it, why of course they're right in feeling as they do." ...|$|E
6000|$|But one {{day when}} he asked, 'How do you like 'em now?' her answer was unexpected. 'Much better than I did,' she said, quietly. 'I may like <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> some day.' ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Gill was at 'ome {{when they}} got there, and all three of <b>'em</b> was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{surprised}} that such a good-looking gal should take up with Sam's nevy.

50|$|Different markets {{exist for}} screens {{targeted}} {{for use with}} digital projectors, movie projectors, overhead projectors and slide projectors, although the basic idea for each of <b>them</b> is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the same: front projection screens work on diffusely reflecting the light projected on to them, whereas back projection screens work by diffusely transmitting the light through them.|$|R
60|$|The little High Ki {{remained}} as sweet and brave and lovable as ever, striving constantly to cheer and encourage her little band of defenders.

60|$|And {{this idea}} annoyed <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> Three days passed before they heard any news, {{and then the}} King of the Peacocks came and berated them {{through a hole in}} the wall.|$|E
60|$|There {{were many}} other turtles in the camp, and this turtle was kind and {{pleasant}} to them all, {{but he did}} not care for any of <b>them</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> and felt rather lonely.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} lady, scornfully, [...] "if you {{went and got}} your {{servants}} from an intelligence-office, and had to look up their references, you wouldn't hold <b>them</b> in <b>very</b> <b>much</b> honor. I tell you they look out for their interests as sharply as we do for ours, and it's nothing between us but a question of--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I. I'm {{supposed}} to be in training. Here I've been sitting gossiping when I ought to have been safely tucked up. I'll borrow your skull, if you can share it. Williams has had mine for a month. I'll take the little bones of your ear, too, if you are sure you won't need <b>them.</b> Thanks <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> Never mind a bag, I can carry <b>them</b> <b>very</b> well under my arm.

6000|$|... "I guess they'll {{know how}} to take care of {{themselves}} all right enough," [...] was Tom Rover's comment. [...] "But, just the same, we can't permit them to become too wild.

6000|$|... "I {{never did}} when I was a boy, but--well--I {{did have a}} couple of fights when I was on the cattle-boat and in England. Neither of <b>them</b> {{amounted}} to <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> though, I guess. I was scared stiff!" ...|$|R
