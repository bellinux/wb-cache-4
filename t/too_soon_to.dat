5|$|According to William of Newburgh {{writing in}} the 1190s, the plan failed because of Geoffrey’s early death in 1151. The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the {{paternal}} and maternal inheritances while he needed the resources to overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou. Henry’s brother Geoffrey died in 1154, <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.|$|E
5|$|The predominate storyline {{heading into}} the event was the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle, both members of The Angle Alliance group. On the February14 episode of Impact!, TNA held the scripted wedding of Angle's real-life wife Karen Angle and Styles despite Angle and Karen still being married on-screen. Afterwards, Karen and Angle {{separated}} in the storyline on the March13 episode of Impact!. TNA continued to build the situation with Angle attempting to reconcile with Karen on the May15 episode of Impact!. Karen refused Angle's request on the May22 episode of Impact!, leading to Angle turning on and assaulting Styles later in the episode due to his jealousy of the affection Karen showed for Styles. On the May29 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced Angle versus Styles for the event. Angle sustained a severe neck injury in early May with several TNA officials believing Angle would not recover in time to perform at the show. Angle was still in pain a few days prior to Slammiversary but was expected to perform normally despite some officials feeling it was <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> compete.|$|E

Competition was not for the usual Henley trophies but for different cups and some events were restricted to ‘armed services’ crews.|$|E

25|$|Smaller waves were {{recorded}} on tidal gauges {{as far away}} as the English Channel.

These air waves circled the globe several times and were still detectable on barographs five days later.|$|E
25|$|Following Havins's departure, viewers were adamant {{in their}} {{feelings}} that Babe {{should not have}} been recast; the views ranged from the decision having been made <b>too</b> <b>soon,</b> <b>to</b> recasting Babe having been unnecessary, to sentiment that only Havins is Babe. Voices expressing their discontent but also relaying their willingness to give the recast a chance were also present.|$|E

25|$|Prime Minister Ehud Olmert {{said the}} {{fighting}} in Lebanon would end when Hezbollah guerrillas freed two captured soldiers, rocket attacks on Israel stopped and the Lebanese army deployed along the border.

But Israel said it was <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> talk about deploying an international force.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{debate on}} this issue is still fresh; neither side can claim to know for certain which {{strategies}} will ultimately be effective in defeating non-state combatants. Opponents of the invasion strategy point {{to a lack of}} examples in which occupying or peacekeeping forces have met with conclusive success. They also cite continuing conflicts such as Northern Ireland, Israel, Chechnya, and Iraq, as well as examples which they claim ultimately proved to be failures, such as Lebanon, and Afghanistan. Supporters of the invasion strategy hold that it is <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> call those situations failures, and that patience is needed to see the plan through. Some say that the invasions themselves have, in fact, been successful, but that political opponents and the international media skew the facts for sensationalism or political gain.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} session of 6 July, Israeli {{witnesses}} and representatives testified {{in front of}} the committee, describing years of living under rocket attack. The last to take the floor during the session was Noam Shalit, father of the Israeli captive soldier Gilad Shalit who at that time had been imprisoned in Gaza for three years, with no visit by the Red Cross permitted. Later that day, pro-Palestinian witnesses and experts from Israel and the West Bank testified. The next day, a military expert testified on weapons use by Hamas and Israel and an international law expert testified at Goldstone's Gaza hearings. Following the two-day session, Goldstone said that the investigation entered its final phase, but that it was <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> conclude that war crimes were committed.|$|E
25|$|A large {{counter-attack}} {{was mounted}} on the French front on 22 March, which forced French cavalry and cyclists back over the Crozat Canal with many casualties but began <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> ambush a large force that included artillery, as had been intended. A Booby-trap exploded in Bapaume town hall on 25 March, killing Australian troops and two French Deputies; French civilians were left behind at Bouvincourt, Vraignes and Tincourt on 26 March and Villers Faucon, Saulcourt and Guyencourt were lost on 27 March, to attacks by British cavalry and armoured cars. Supplies of armour-piercing bullets had been sent forward by the Germans after Roisel was captured the day before, resulting in the armoured cars being peppered with bullet-holes. The armoured cars decoyed the German defenders, while cavalry got round the flanks and captured the villages.|$|E

This was the best result in the Libertarian Party's history by raw vote number, though under the 1.1 percentage of the vote won by Ed Clark in 1980.

500|$|It was The Orioles, however, {{who first}} {{developed}} the city's vocal harmony sound. Originally known as The Vibra-Naires, The Orioles {{were led by}} Sonny Til when they recorded [...] "It's <b>Too</b> <b>Soon</b> <b>to</b> Know", their first hit and a song that is considered the first doo wop recording of any kind. Doo wop {{would go on to}} have a formative influence on the development of rock and roll, and The Orioles can be considered the earliest rock and roll band as a result. The Orioles would continue recording until 1954, launching hits like [...] "In the Chapel in the Moonlight", [...] "Tell Me So" [...] and [...] "Crying in the Chapel".|$|E
500|$|Jim Farber of the New York-based Daily News {{wrote in}} his review: [...] "It suffers from a {{similarly}} meandering melody and ponderous progression. The grandeur of its arrangement easily upstages the tune", but [...] "even so, the luster of Adele's tone, and the bravura arc of her vocal, makes it enjoyable enough. And, fifty years down the line, isn't that all we really expect from a Bond product these days?" [...] Yahoo!'s Rob O'Connor gave the standalone song a positive review, but {{felt that it was}} <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> tell how the song would fit into the wider canon of Bond theme songs. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph was less complimentary, describing the song as [...] "classy", but at the same time, [...] "overly predictable".|$|E

500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{ranked the}} song amongst the top tracks on Kiss & Tell. Mikael Wood of Billboard gave the song a {{positive}} review, stating that it [...] "has a juicy and instantly memorable vocal hook". In {{a review of}} the album, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy coined the song [...] "electro-thumping", commenting that it was [...] "as innocent as the purity ring on Gomez's finger and showcases her polished vocals perfectly." [...] Copsey also stated that the impressive hooks present in the song do not appear on the album anywhere else. In a single review, Nick Levine also of Digital Spy said was the most Disney-affiliated single with club appeal since Miley Cyrus' [...] "See You Again". When commenting on whether Gomez would be a mainstay in music, Levine said, [...] "It's <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> tell - but most Scando-popettes would dye their locks brunette for this tune." [...] Although stating that it was very cliche, a writer for Popjustice said that the song [...] "seems like a boundary-smashing avant garde curiosity when you put it alongside most other Hollywood Records output." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com ranked [...] "Naturally" [...] at number eighty-four on his list of [...] "Top 100 Pop Songs of 2010".|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{complimentary}} {{towards the}} episode, praising the acting talent of January Jones and the ensemble cast {{as well as}} Jon Hamm's debut in the director's chair. Some, however, were not as impressed by the fat suit techniques used on January Jones to both hide her pregnancy and convey the character's weight gain. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+. He felt {{that some of the}} scenes were too on-the-nose and that some of the symbolism was a little overt. VanDerWerff specifically cited the scenes where Don talks with the young girl at the concert as on-the-nose, comparing Don in this scene to Joe Friday. He did, however, praise the subplot involving Betty's weight gain as well as the final scene. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said that all of the stories were linked by the threat of replacement and liked the interaction between Roger and Peggy, which he felt was a rare occurrence. He said that it was <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> judge the Ginsberg character and that the Betty storyline was the weakest of the main plots. Writer Myles McNutt found January Jones [...] "highly compelling" [...] and the storyline offering a [...] "decidedly human turn for the character, with her lunch with Joyce offering insight that we are robbed of without Betty having any friends to confide in normally." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews were decidedly more mixed to negative. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. The two wrote that [...] "Mulder catches up with the store and {{immediately}} this all becomes a little more formulaic." [...] The two praised the episode's teaser, referring to it as [...] "deathless prose", but were more critical of the plot, arguing that the episode [...] "feels <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> see yet more sequences of people standing around emoting as they watch the dying in the hospital", {{a reference to the}} show's earlier arc involving Scully's cancer. Shearman and Pearson, however, did compliment the performance of both Diewold and Anderson, and called the finale scene [...] "wonderful". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique, on the other hand, gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She heavily criticized the episode's characterization, noting that the episode's opening sequence was [...] "ludicrous" [...] and its revelations were [...] "out of the blue". Vitaris reasoned that, because Scully had spent time with her mother, remembered fondly her sister, and reconnected her faith in God in [...] "Redux II", [...] "this development just doesn't track." [...] Vitaris also criticized Mulder's antics, calling him a [...] "thug" [...] for beating up [...] "an unarmed man and kicking him while he's down." ...|$|E
