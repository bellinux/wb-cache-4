500|$|As {{a direct}} result of the rescue operation, five {{aircraft}} were lost, 11 people were killed, and two were captured. Additional aircraft were seriously damaged. Hambleton wrote from an Air Force hospital after he was rescued. [...] "I had to stand by and watch six young men die trying <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> It was a hell of a price to pay for one life. I'm very sorry." [...] His rescue was, according to Stars and Stripes, [...] "the biggest U.S. air rescue effort of the war." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS GEORGE. After what youve just done? Not {{if it was}} <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
60|$|VOICE. How funny! I couldn't cry now <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> (G. shivers.) I want to sing.|$|E
60|$|THE WOMAN. I took it <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> child's <b>life.</b> I {{thought it}} would get me to a doctor in time. It was choking with croup.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's one of 'em!" [...] I {{managed to}} scream before the fellow's fingers shut off my wind, and then I had my hands full trying <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> own <b>life.</b>|$|R
60|$|I made no reply, {{although}} she evidently paused {{to give me}} an opportunity to speak. I could not have uttered a syllable <b>to</b> have <b>saved</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> The pause was impressive, rather than long.|$|R
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> I {{could not}} speak {{afterward}} naturally, and from Sanjowlie to the Church wisely held my tongue.|$|E
60|$|So {{the blow}} fell. I turned away, for <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> the words would not come. He missed the reason of my silence.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I assure you, mademoiselle, that in {{this matter}} you misjudge him,' said I. 'As it happens, he {{interfered}} <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> last night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have guessed}} rightly. I met him abroad; I am not at liberty at present to say where. He {{rendered}} {{me one of}} the greatest services one man can render <b>to</b> another--he <b>saved</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and did much more; but upon that it is not now necessary to enter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I did," [...] said Rob, laughing; [...] "but I wouldn't {{have done}} it for the world--not even <b>to</b> have <b>saved</b> <b>my</b> own <b>life.</b> Good-by!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hate to do it--I hate to do it!" [...] she wailed, [...] "for {{there is}} no more of this magic {{compound}} in all the world. But I must sacrifice it <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> own <b>life.</b> A match! Give me a match, quick!" [...] and panting from lack of breath she gazed imploringly from one to another.|$|R
60|$|She {{said this}} with such deep pathos, while tears filled her eyes, that I {{could not have}} uttered a word of comfort <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "This is very tantalising," [...] she murmured. [...] "You {{are going}} <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> then, and {{afterwards}} treat {{me as though}} I were a leper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Tony, I {{little thought}} when I did you {{a service that}} it would be the means of you being able <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> some day." ...|$|E
60|$|I said no more. There {{was another}} outcry {{worse than the}} former. He {{looked at me with}} his dull grey eyes, and then took some more whiskey. He tried to draw me into a {{discussion}} about alcohol, professing <b>to</b> have <b>saved</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> with it. He seemed anxious to lay stress on the fact that I owed <b>my</b> <b>life</b> to him. I answered him distractedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mean!" [...] said he; [...] "nay, what didst thou mean, {{to cry out}} aloud in thy sleep, 'I am a thief, a pirate, a murderer, {{and ought}} to be hanged'? Why, thou wilt ruin us all. 'Twas well the Dutchman did not {{understand}} English. In short, I must shoot thee, <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> own <b>life.</b> Come, come," [...] says he, [...] "give me thy pistol." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen. I didn't {{know this}} was your room. I came here <b>to</b> get away--to <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I was pursued. I was spying on--on your father and his men. They heard me, but did not see me. They don't know who was listening. They're after me now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{care not}} <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> What is life to me, since he perhaps is gone {{who gave me}} that life, and for whom alone I lived!' ...|$|E
6000|$|I was dumb. My throat {{had closed}} up, and I {{could not have}} uttered a sound <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> The police had even got my name quite straight! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I couldn't waltz <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> Aubrey,' said Ethel; 'but if you {{can bear}} me through a polka as well as Harry did, you may try the next.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Strange! {{how little}} man does know or guess the secret {{thoughts}} of his fellow!" [...] said the hermit {{with one of}} his pitiful smiles. [...] "Revenge no place in me!--but I thank you, boy, for the kind thought as well as the effort <b>to</b> <b>save</b> me. <b>My</b> <b>life</b> is not worth much to any one. It will not matter, I think, if my enemy should succeed. Go now, Babu, and God be with you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] he said. [...] "I am, however, {{inclined}} <b>to</b> {{think you}} <b>saved</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> The man probably saw your hand {{go up and}} {{that made him a}} trifle too precipitate. Still, perhaps, he only wanted to look at your brother-in-law's papers and had no intention of stealing anything." ...|$|R
25|$|An online fan {{campaign}} attempted <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>My</b> So-Called <b>Life,</b> {{the first}} such event {{in the history of}} the World Wide Web. The arduous schedule and the mental and physical demands of the production of episodic television, however, caused difficulties for the young actors who had to balance schoolwork with rehearsal and time on the set. Herskovitz said Danes and her parents approached the show's creators and told producers that she did not want to be involved with the show if it continued for a second season.|$|R
6000|$|Almanz. Would you, <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> my love betray? Here; take me; bind me; {{carry me}} away; Kill me! I'll kill {{you if you}} disobey. [...] [To the Guards.|$|E
60|$|I felt {{my knees}} trembling; I {{could not have}} crossed the road at that moment {{if it had been}} <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> The boy looked up at me curiously.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My mare and foal,' {{replied the}} Prince, 'have {{run away from}} me, and have hidden {{themselves}} in the clouds; if you wish <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> restore both animals to me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But--but--can I {{do nothing}} of a {{different}} kind?" [...] said Lucetta. [...] "I am full of gratitude <b>to</b> you--you have <b>saved</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> And your care of me is like coals of fire on my head! I am a monied person now. Surely I can do something in return for your goodness--something practical?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. The {{delivery}} of any two {{is out of}} the question--would be so, even <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> own <b>life.</b> As for the Nest and its contents, I would very willingly abandon all, a few papers excepted, had I the smallest faith in the chiefs' being able to restrain their followers; but the dreadful massacre of William-Henry is still too recent, to confide in anything of the sort. My answer is given already, and we are about to part. Possibly, when they see us determined, they may lower their demands a little." ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{saw what}} I had done, {{and that my}} danger was over for the moment, without waiting to reload I dug the spurs into my horse's sides and galloped off to Nodwengu, passing between the groups of {{struggling}} men. On arriving unharmed at the town, I went instantly to the royal huts and demanded to see the King, who sent word that I was to be admitted. On coming before him I told him exactly what had happened--that I had killed two of Cetewayo's men in order <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> own <b>life,</b> and on that account submitted myself to his justice.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{it was my}} revolver. I had {{to shoot}} a sentry, <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> It's lucky we have got these life belts on, for I am sure we should never get across." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Tolman. [...] "Why, my good madam,--miss, I mean,--I couldn't {{explain it}} to you if it were <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> But what page is it?" [...] said he, looking at his watch.|$|E
6000|$|Almanz. Fate, {{thou art}} kind to strike so hard a blow: I am quite stunned, and past all feeling now. Yet--can {{you tell me}} you have power and will <b>To</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and at that instant kill? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Master Craddock, {{the pirate}} ship {{came back from}} its {{careening}} upon the very day that you left us. They laid us aboard, and, short-handed as we were, {{with the best of}} the men ashore with you, we could offer but a poor defence. Some were cut down, and they were the happiest. The others were killed afterwards. As <b>to</b> me, I <b>saved</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> by signing on with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, pretty mistress," [...] said Randall. [...] "'Tis no {{disguise}}, Tibble {{there can}} tell you, or my nephew. My disguise lies there," [...] {{pointing to his}} sober raiment. [...] "Thus only can I bring thee to the King's presence! Didst think it was jest? Nay, verily, I am as bound <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>my</b> sweet Stevie's <b>life,</b> <b>my</b> sister's own gallant son, as thou canst be to plead for thy betrothed." [...] Dennet winced.|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] {{and with}} the word I seemed to be pervaded by peace. [...] "I didn't know this was your room. I came in here <b>to</b> get away--to <b>save</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I was pursued. I was spying on Sampson and his men. They heard me, but did not see me. They don't know who was listening. They're after me now. I'm Special United States Deputy Marshal Sittell--Russell Archibald Sittell. I'm a Ranger. I'm here as secret aid to Steele." ...|$|R
