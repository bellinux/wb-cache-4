50|$|An object's {{dispatch}} table {{will contain}} the addresses of the object's dynamically bound methods. Method calls are performed by fetching the method's address from the object's dispatch table. The dispatch table {{is the same}} for all objects belonging to the same class, and is therefore typically shared between them. Objects belonging to type-compatible classes (for example siblings in an inheritance hierarchy) will have dispatch tables with the same layout: the address of a given method will appear at the same offset for all type-compatible classes. Thus, fetching the method's address from a given dispatch <b>table</b> <b>offset</b> will get the method corresponding to the object's actual class.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{influence of}} curve fitting techniques on hydrostatic characteristics of marine vessels. Three vessels having lengths of 32. 16 m, 70. 0 m and 25. 6 m are selected for this study. The hull geometries of these vessels {{are represented by}} three curve fitting techniques such as least square, cubic spline and B-spline methods. At first, hydrostatic characteristics of the vessels are calculated using data only available in <b>offset</b> <b>table</b> and then using more data generated by curve fitting techniques. Finally, results obtained by <b>offset</b> <b>table</b> data are compared to those by fitted data. It is seen {{that there are some}} influences of curve fitting technique on the hydrostatic characteristics of ship especially at lightly loaded condition...|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the high}} number of crystal pairs (several millions) in a PET scanner, timing offsets are {{determined}} per crystal. A timing offset for each detector crystal pixel is obtained by calculating the average offset values of each crystal pixel with the opposing pixels. This corrects for trigger variations, crystal differences, and for photomultiplier (PMT) timing differences. The final result is a look-up <b>table</b> with <b>offsets</b> per detector crystal. This correction is then introduced in the listmode data or offline in image reconstruction by adding the offsets of each of the crystals in the pair.|$|R
30|$|AlgorithmÂ  2 {{tries to}} turn off all UEs that cause high {{interference}} to the cluster-edge UEs, pushing interferers for later scheduling. One problem with this interference coordination is that it usually causes capacity loss because of more time slots needed. Here, maximizing network capacity during interference coordination is preferred. The following pseudo-code shows an algorithm for P 1 : utility maximization. In the code, Util are the values reported in the forbidden relationship <b>table,</b> and <b>offset</b> is value {{in the range of}} 0 to 1 to control the interferers that need to be turned off.|$|R
30|$|When {{the height}} of parent {{container}} offset is greater than 20 % of table height, the pull-down refresh is called. The pull-up refresh is called when the height difference between {{the height of}} parent container and the sum of <b>table</b> height and <b>offset</b> exceeds 10 % of the screen height.|$|R
50|$|The VHD format has a {{built-in}} limitation of just under 2 TiB (2040 GiB) for the size of any dynamic or differencing VHDs.

50|$|The {{computer}} programming portion of Hacking takes up {{over half of}} the book. This section goes into the development, design, construction, and testing of exploit code, and thus involves some basic assembly programming.

5000|$|After the {{scenario}} P&Ls are determined {{for each group}} of securities with the same underlying, P&L offsets are applied across pairwise security groups. These offsets are set by The Options Clearing Corporation and are informed by the degree of correlation between pairwise securities. The offset percentages for different types of indexes and different levels of aggregation are defined in an <b>offset</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{a direct}} {{approach}} to this pointer adjustment problem, the compiler can include an integer offset in each dispatch <b>table</b> entry. This <b>offset</b> {{is the difference between}} the reference's address and the address required by the method implementation. The code generated for each call through these dispatch tables must then retrieve the offset and use it to adjust the instance address before calling the method.|$|R
40|$|A servo-driven {{magnetometer}} <b>table</b> measuring <b>offset</b> from {{magnetic north}} {{has been developed}} by NASA to calculate payload azimuth required to point at a celestial target. Used {{as an aid to}} the study of gamma-ray phenomena, the high-altitude balloon-borne instrument determines a geocentric reference system, and calculates a set of pointing directions with respect to the system. Principal components include the magnetometer, stepping motor, microcomputer, and gray code shaft encoder. The single-chip microcomputer is used to control the orientation of the system, and consists of a central processing unit, program memory, data memory and input/output ports. Principal advantages include a low power requirement, consuming 6 watts, as compared to 30 watts consumed by the previous system...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{multipartite}} table methods (MTMs) {{to implement}} high-performance direct digital frequency synthesizers (DDFSs) is investigated in this paper. A closed-form expressions for the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) is obtained when a single <b>table</b> of <b>offset</b> (TO) {{is used in the}} multipartite approximation. In this case, the optimal design that minimizes storage requirement for a given SFDR can be obtained analytically. A numerical algorithm is also presented to obtain the optimal design also when two or more TOs are employed is the approximation. The VLSI implementation results and the comparison with previously proposed DDFS architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of multipartite table methods for the realization of high performance direct digital synthesizers...|$|R

40|$|This Operational Practice {{recommends}} {{the method of}} applying the Time Date Table (TDT) and Time <b>Offset</b> <b>Table</b> (TOT) sections for digital terrestrial television broadcasting in Australia. Important information for those involved in setting TDT and TOT in DVB-SI generation equipment {{can be found in}} the Annex. 2. APPLICATION Broadcast of the Time and Date Table (TDT) and Time <b>Offset</b> <b>Table</b> (TOT) provides a mechanism for broadcasters to signal the time of events in their broadcast stream and for receivers to display these times in a convenient manner for the viewer. The TDT carries UTC 1 time and date. This information is given in separate table sections due to the frequent updating of this information. The TOT also provides this information, but importantly also provides information for the local time offset. 3. AUSTRALIAN TIME ZONES Australia is divided into several timezones that span from + 8 hours to + 11 hours relative to UTC. From October to March, some Australian states change to daylight saving time creating both a north/south and east/west change in timezones. These are shown in Figure 1 below...|$|R
50|$|As online poker {{becomes more}} {{mainstream}} online poker professionals have begun using rakeback {{as a means}} of increasing profits or cutting their losses. Depending upon the stakes the player is playing, how many tables they are playing at once, and the number of hours played daily, online poker pros can earn thousands of dollars in rakeback every month. This gave rise to so-called rakeback pros, players using a less intensive losing strategy at many <b>tables</b> simultaneously while <b>offsetting</b> their losses through rakeback.|$|R
5000|$|Sort the <b>table</b> by the <b>offset.</b> (If two tuples {{with the}} same offset but {{opposite}} types exist, indicating that one interval ends just as another begins, then a method of deciding which comes first is necessary. Such an occurrence can be considered an overlap with no duration, {{which can be found}} by the algorithm by putting type &minus;1 before type +1. If such pathological overlaps are considered objectionable they can be avoided by putting type +1 before &minus;1 in this case.) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} way for computing {{the response of}} an adaptive dig-ital filter is to use sliding-block distributed arithmetic (SBDA). One disadvantage of distributed arithmetic {{is the amount of}} memory uti-lized. By encoding the memory <b>tables</b> in <b>offset</b> binary code (OBC), the size of the memory tables is reduced in half. However, the com-putational workload remains unchanged. By modifying the compu-tational flow, the computational workload can be reduced by almost half at the expense of slightly more memory. This modified SBDA structure is called SBDA-OBC. It has memory requirements 25 %- 50 % lower than SBDA {{depending on the size of}} the sub-filter. In terms of the computational workload, SBDA-OBC is most advanta-geous for large sub-filters and when the filter is split into few sub-filters. In this case, the computational workload is reduced almost in half. Index Terms â adaptive filtering, distributed arithmetic 1...|$|R
5000|$|When Randomized mmap (...) base is enabled, PaX {{randomly}} {{shifts the}} mmap (...) base, affecting the positioning of all libraries and other non-specific mmap (...) calls. This causes all dynamically linked code, i.e. shared objects, to be mapped at a different, randomly selected offset every time. Attackers requiring a {{function in a}} certain library must guess where that library is loaded in virtual memory space to call it. This makes return-to-libc attacks difficult; although shellcode injections can still look up the address of any function in the global <b>offset</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} of converting a standard <b>table</b> of <b>offsets</b> for a propeller design into a numerical {{description of the}} blade surface. This numerical surface description can then {{be used as a}} computer-aided design tool and also as a basis for producing data to drive a 3 -axis numerically controlled (N. C.) machine tool for the manufacture of the blade or blade mould. The report is divided into two main sections. The first section details the definition of the propeller numerical surface using quadratic parametric splines, and the elementary stress analysis and graphical output used {{in the development of a}} propeller design. The modified design was based on the Wageningen B 4. 40 propeller and was to be used for an investigation into ship propeller/rudder interactions. The second section covers the method by which the split female mould was N. C. machined for this modified propeller design...|$|R
50|$|Data {{references}} from position-independent code {{are usually}} made indirectly, through global <b>offset</b> <b>tables</b> (GOTs), which store the addresses of all accessed global variables. There is one GOT per compilation unit or object module, {{and it is}} located at a fixed offset from the code (although this offset is not known until the library is linked). When a linker links modules to create a shared library, it merges the GOTs and sets the final offsets in code. It {{is not necessary to}} adjust the offsets when loading the shared library later.|$|R
40|$|Current OSes {{include many}} logical sharing {{techniques}} (shared library, symbolic link, etc.) on memory and storage. Unfortunately they cause security and management problems which {{come from the}} dynamic management of logical sharing; e. g., search path replacement attack, GOT (Global <b>Offset</b> <b>Table)</b> overwrite attack, Dependency Hell, etc. This paper proposes that self-contained binaries eliminate the problems caused by logical sharing. The memory and storage overheads caused by self-contained binaries are mitigated by physical sharing (memory and disk deduplication). The effect of deduplication was investigated on the KVM virtual machine with KS...|$|R
50|$|The {{belief that}} {{security}} should be ubiquitous and unintrusive like air {{is part of}} the core philosophy behind cjdns. The routing engine runs in user space and is compiled by default with stack-smashing protection, position-independent code, non-executable stack, and remapping of the global <b>offset</b> <b>table</b> as read-only (relro). The code also relies on an ad-hoc sandboxing feature based on setting the resource limit for open files to zero, on many systems this serves block access to any new file descriptors, severely limiting the code's ability to interact with the system around it.|$|R
50|$|In {{the real}} world, a Bazeries {{cylinder}} has more disks (commonly, 20 or 30 rather than 10), and it less likely {{there would be}} a single crib that would span the entire cylinder. Nevertheless, the approach described above still works. Even if the cylinder had 30 disks and a crib only had five letters, Holmes could build up a <b>table</b> of the <b>offsets</b> for each of the 30 disks for the five letter pairs, and use it to narrow down the possibilities for the offset and the disks used for the crib.|$|R
30|$|While {{shoulder}} arthroplasty {{was initially}} intended for elderly patients with low functional expectations, TSA is now performed in younger patients with greater functional demands, which renders reconstruction of native anatomy {{all the more}} essential. Modern TSA implants allow for some adjustments of humeral head offset (Irlenbusch et al., 2011; Wirth et al., 2007), but some default designs assume it to be directly proportional to stem diameter, such that larger stems are designed with greater head <b>offsets</b> (<b>Table</b> 1). Our multivariable analysis suggests that this assumption is incorrect, as global head offset {{was not associated with}} intramedullary canal width, even when considering the effects of age, gender, and head retroversion.|$|R
5000|$|One {{solution}} to the fragile binary interface problem is to write a language that knows the problem exists, and does not let it happen in the first place. Most custom-written OO languages, {{as opposed to those}} evolved from earlier languages, construct all of their <b>offset</b> <b>tables</b> at load time. Changes to the layout of the library will be [...] "noticed" [...] at that point. Other OO languages, like Self, construct everything at runtime by copying and modifying the objects found in the libraries, and therefore do not really have a base class that can be fragile. Some languages, like Java, have extensive documentation on what changes are safe to make without causing FBI problems.|$|R
50|$|With {{the table}} {{mounted on a}} {{secondary}} table, the workpiece is accurately centered on the rotary table's axis, {{which in turn is}} centered on the cutting tool's axis. All three axes are thus coaxial. From this point, the secondary <b>table</b> can be <b>offset</b> in either the X or Y direction to set the cutter the desired distance from the workpiece's center. This allows concentric machining operations on the workpiece. Placing the workpiece eccentrically a set distance from the center permits more complex curves to be cut. As with other setups on a vertical mill, the milling operation can be either drilling a series of concentric, and possibly equidistant holes, or face or end milling either circular or semicircular shapes and contours.|$|R
