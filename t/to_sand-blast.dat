50|$|In 2007, Abdela {{came across}} the grave of Barbara Bodichonin the tiny churchyard of Brightling, East Sussex, about 50 mi from London. It {{was in a state}} of disrepair, with its {{railings}} rusted and breaking away, and the inscription on the tomb almost illegible. The historian Dr Judith Rowbotham at Nottingham Trent University issued an appeal for funds to restore the grave and its surroundings. About £1,000 was raised. The money was used under local supervision <b>to</b> <b>sand-blast</b> the railings and repaint them, and to clean the granite tomb.|$|E

Several other genes associated with the functionally important mechanisms relevant to bone healing such as Wnt signalling (CTNNA 1 FBX 4 FZD 6) angiogenesis (KDR) osteoclastogenesis (HSF 2 MCL 1) and proteolysis (HEXB TPP 1) were also differentially regulated These results suggest that chemical (hydrophilic) modification of the SLA surface may result in more successful osseointegration through BMP signalling (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserve...|$|R
40|$|Topographically and {{chemically}} modified titanium implants are recognized to have improved osteogenic properties; however, the molecular regulation {{of this process}} remains unknown. This study aimed to determine the microRNA profile and the potential regulation of osteogenic differentiation following early exposure of osteoprogenitor cells <b>to</b> <b>sand-blasted,</b> large-grit acid-etched (SLA) and hydrophilic SLA (modSLA) surfaces. Firstly, the osteogenic characteristics of the primary osteoprogenitor cells were confirmed using ALP activity and Alizarin Red S staining. The effect of smooth (SMO), SLA and modSLA surfaces on the TGF-߯BMP (BMP 2, BMP 6, ACVR 1) and non-canonical WNT/Ca 2 + (WNT 5 A, FZD 6) pathways, {{as well as the}} integrins ITGB 1 and ITGA 2, was determined. It was revealed that the modified titanium surfaces could induce the activation of TGF-߯BMP and non-canonical WNT/Ca 2 + signaling genes. The expression pattern of microRNAs (miRNAs) related to cell differentiation was evaluated. Statistical analysis of the differentially regulated miRNAs indicated that 35 and 32 miRNAs were down-regulated on the modSLA and SLA surfaces respectively, when compared with the smooth surface (SMO). Thirty-one miRNAs that were down-regulated were common to both modSLA and SLA. There were 10 miRNAs up-regulated on modSLA and nine on SLA surfaces, amongst which eight were the same as observed on modSLA. TargetScan predictions for the down-regulated miRNAs revealed genes of the TGF-߯BMP and non-canonical Ca 2 + pathways as targets. This study demonstrated that modified titanium implant surfaces induce differential regulation of miRNAs, which potentially regulate the TGF-߯BMP and WNT/Ca 2 + pathways during osteogenic differentiation on modified titanium implant surfaces.

40|$|The present work {{describes}} an experimental set-up built to simulate dynamic wetting and heat transfer occurring in many rapid solidification processes. Tests were performed with molten aluminium droplets falling from a crucible onto a metallic substrate. A high-speed camera captured {{the evolution of}} the droplet's geometry, while thermocouples, inserted inside the metallic substrate, allowed a heat transfer analysis to be performed. Aluminium 5754 was found to have a better initial dynamic wetting and heat transfer compared to pure aluminium. An increase in the initial temperature of the substrate was associated with better dynamic wetting and heat transfer. The heat flux was also increased by the use of a polished substrate compared <b>to</b> a <b>sand-blasted</b> substrate.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is first to define the effect of a surface {{finishing}} such as sand-blasting on the geometry of a wood cutting tool and its wear resistance. In addition, the effectiveness of surface coatings like CrAlN deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique on conventional and sand-blasted cutting edges was studied. A reference tool and different sand-blasted ones were tested by micro-peeling of beech in a laboratory. Microscopic observations, cutting forces measurement and cutting wear tests were carried out to quantify the behaviour of these tools. The results obtained showed that the artificial wear by sandblasting leads to an increase in the wear resistance and coating effectiveness, and completely changes the type of damage done to the tools.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{biochemical}} signals promoting cell functions (adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation) and thereby improving the osseointegration process are currently investigated. Unfortunately, their application {{for the production of}} bioactive implantable devices is often hampered by their insolubility; instability; and limited availability of a large amount of inexpensive, high-purity samples. An attractive alternative is the use of short peptides carrying the minimum active sequence of the natural factors. Synthetic peptides mapped on fibronectin and vitronectin have been demonstrated to enhance cell adhesion both to polystyrene and acellular bone matrix; in particular, a nonapeptide sequence from human vitronectin works via an osteoblast-specific adhesion mechanism. In this study, we incorporated these peptides into a sol-gel silica dressing applied <b>to</b> coat <b>sand-blasted</b> and acid-attacked titanium samples; measured the kinetic of peptide release; and used titanium disks, coated with a peptide-enriched film, as substrates to determine the peptide concentration that maximizes cell adhesion in vitro.

2500|$|Also called {{joint and}} crack repair, this method's {{purpose is to}} {{minimize}} infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system. Joint sealants are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) [...] techniques. Successful resealing consists of old sealant removal, shaping and cleaning the reservoir, installing the backer rod and installing the sealant. Sawing, manual removal, plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant. Saws are used to shape the reservoir. When cleaning the reservoir, no dust, dirt or traces of old sealant should remain. Thus, it is recommended <b>to</b> water wash, <b>sand-blast</b> and then air blow to remove any sand, dirt or dust. The backer rod installation requires a double-wheeled, steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth. After inserting the backer rod, the sealant is placed into the joint. There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid, silicone and preformed compression seals.|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} many endosseous {{implants}} in orthopaedic and dental applications {{depends on the}} surface characteristics, as they affect osseous integration. Previous investigations indicated that a novel large-grit sand-blasted and acid-etched (SLA) titanium (denoted as SLAffinity-Ti) implant had better bone integration {{than that of a}} comparably shaped implant with a plasma-sprayed titanium surface. The purpose of the present investigation was to create a SLAffinity surface on pedicle screws and trauma screws and to compare it with the surfaces of a sand-blasted-only implant and commercial implants in terms of bone integration. The cortical bone and spine of twelve minipigs were implanted with 3 and 4 implants, respectively, and the bone integration was evaluated using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), mechanical tests (pull-out strength and stripping torque), and histological analysis (toluidine blue and hematoxylin and eosin staining) one and three months after implantation. The micro-CT images showed that the gap between the bone and implant was consistently higher in the sand-blasted-only and commercial groups compared to that in the SLAffinity group 1 and 3 months after implantation. Moreover, the bone volume of implant inserted into bone and the percentage of implant inside bone tissue were greater in the SLAffinity screws 1 and 3 months after implantation, as compared <b>to</b> the <b>sand-blasted</b> and commercial screws. In the mechanical tests, the removal torque and pull-out strength (p < 0. 05) were higher in the SLAffinity group at 1 and 3 months. The histological results were consistent with mechanical testing, showing that the SLAffinity group had the most mineralized matrix, the most bone formation around the screws, and the most bone cells in bone tissue. These findings indicate that a SLAffinity surface can effectively enhance the holding strength and integration of pedicle screws and cortical screws, promoting early healing and improving outcomes, compared to sand-blasted-only and commercial implants...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the laser consolidation of arc-sprayed coatings of r cr steel deposited on a medium carbon steel is reptrted. The 600 w cw co 2 laser beam was used to irradiate arc-sprayed coatings to remove the pores in the coated layer and to produce a stiong metalrurgicar bondbetween the coated layer and base metal. The heat flow in this process was analyzed using a finite-difference method to predict the hardened zone in the workpiece surface. Arc-sprayed coatings showed a substantial increase inlaser absorptivity when compared <b>to</b> ground or <b>sand-blasted</b> surfaces, which could improve the effectiveness of materials processing using lasers. As a result of laser treatment pores in arc-sprayed coatings were tutty excluded, and a metallurgical bond could be formed in the thin surface layer of the workpiece by applying appropriate process parameters. The width Lnd depth of the hardened zone in the workpiece surface could be correctly predicted using the finite-difference model. Separation of the untreated layer from the workpiece and the spheroidizing tendency of the molten part were theprimary obstacles in single-scan processes.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} of the dielectric properties, growth of water tree density and spatial distribution of polarization in samples of non-stabilized LDPE. Samples were initially <b>sand-blasted</b> <b>to</b> accelerate initiation of water trees, and subsequently aged in salt solution for approximately three weeks under two regimes of temperature (room temperature and 65 degrees C). Aging both with and without the presence of electric field stress was studied. The capacitance and dielectric loss of each sample were measured using a Hv capacitance bridge, and compared to theoretical models over the frequency range 10 (- 5) to 10 (4) Hz. The results indicate a real movement of charges/ions in the polymer bulk which causes a deterioration of the electrical insulation properties {{even in the absence of}} ac fields. The presence of a field further degrades the insulator. Samples were studied using the LIMM (laser-intensity-modulation method) to determine the distribution of polarization, assuming mean polarization is zero and space charge is absent. In the absence of the external field there is a presence of ionic charges of opposite polarity, which increases with increasing aging time and is highest at room temperature. The length of the twenty longest vented water trees was measured after various aging times, and it was found that trees grown at room temperature are longer than those grown at 65 degrees C. Also, the tree density was higher in specimens tested at room temperature. status: publishe...|$|R
