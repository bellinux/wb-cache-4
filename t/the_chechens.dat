25|$|In August 1996, {{he led a}} {{successful}} operation to retake the Chechen capital Grozny, defeating the Russian garrison of the city. Yeltsin's government finally moved for peace, bringing in former Soviet-Afghan War General Aleksandr Lebed as a negotiator. A peace agreement was concluded between <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> and Russians, under which <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> acquired de facto independence from Russia.|$|E
25|$|During the Crimean War of 1853–6, <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> {{supported}} the Ottoman Empire against Russia.|$|E
25|$|On January 4 and January 5, <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> began {{retreating}} to villages {{south of}} Grozny with whatever combat vehicles {{they had at}} their disposal. These convoys were bombed by Russian air attacks. Though <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> were on the retreat, they still controlled much {{of the center of}} the city. Reinforcements from both sides arrived, including Chechen volunteers from the villages outside of Grozny and Russian Naval Infantry.|$|E
50|$|The Head of <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> Republic (formerly President of <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> Republic or President of Chechnya) is {{the highest}} office within the {{political}} system of <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> Republic. <b>The</b> office was instituted in 2003 {{during the course of}} <b>the</b> Second <b>Chechen</b> War, when <b>the</b> Russian federal government regained control over the region and after a constitutional referendum approved the current Constitution of <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> Republic.|$|R

40|$|The {{normative}} {{problem that}} faces us in Chechnya is addressed through {{an analysis of}} <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> Revolution in 1991, of the two wars in Chechnya and their consequences.

25|$|The Russian {{recognition}} of Abkhazia and South Ossetia {{is also an}} issue. On one hand, Circassians are often highly enthusiastic to help the Abkhaz, who they view as brothers, and are enthusiastic also for Abkhazia's independence. On the other hand, however, it evidences a perceived double standard used negatively on <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> (whom many Circassians supported during the First Chechen War), {{and to a lesser}} extent, the Circassians as well. Paul Goble noted that the {{recognition of}} South Ossetia, in addition to enraging <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> and Ingush, also radicalized many Circassians against Russia, because of the mass of double standards.|$|E
25|$|After losing so {{many men}} when taking the {{northern}} part of Grozny, the Russians concentrated their artillery heavily on the southern half, firing over 30,000 shells each day. For a time being there was no close combat, with the Chechen using mainly sniper rifles. After blowing up most of the bridges <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> used the Sunzha River as a newly established front line as all but the southern part of Grozny was now in the Russian control. The city, however, was not completely sealed off until February 22, 1995, and <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> routinely resupplied their forces through the corridor from Shali.|$|E
25|$|Russian {{special forces}} joined with <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> under Basayev to attack Georgia. A GRU agent, Anton Surikov, had {{extensive}} connections with Basayev. Russian military intelligence had ordered Basayev {{to support the}} Abkhaz.|$|E

50|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was split into two parts: the Republic of Ingushetia and <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> Republic. <b>The</b> latter proclaimed <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> Republic of Ichkeria, which sought independence. Following <b>the</b> First <b>Chechen</b> War with Russia, Chechnya gained de facto independence as <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> Republic of Ichkeria. Russian federal control was restored during <b>the</b> Second <b>Chechen</b> War. Since then there has been a systematic reconstruction and rebuilding process, though sporadic fighting continues in the mountains and southern regions of the republic.|$|R

25|$|The separatists {{were less}} {{successful}} in the Second Chechen War. <b>The</b> <b>Chechens</b> were unable to hold their ground against better prepared and more determined Russian forces.

25|$|The raid on Beslan {{had more}} to do with the Ingush {{involved}} than <b>the</b> <b>Chechens,</b> but was highly symbolic for both nations. The Ossetes and Ingush had (and have) a conflict over ownership of the Prigorodny District, which hit high points during the 1944 Stalinist purges, and the ethnic cleansing of Ingush by Ossetes (the Ossetes getting assistance from the Russian military) in 1992-3. At the time of the raid, there were still over 40,000 Ingush refugees in tent camps in Ingushetia and Chechnya. The Beslan school itself had been used against the Ingush, as in 1992 the gym was used as a pen to round up Ingush during the ethnic cleansing by the Ossetes. For <b>the</b> <b>Chechens,</b> the motive was revenge for the destruction of their homes and, indeed families: Beslan was one of the sites from which federal air raids were launched at Chechnya.|$|E
25|$|The Russians {{launched}} heavy volleys {{of artillery}} and Grad rockets, setting {{buildings and the}} oil refinery ablaze. <b>The</b> <b>Chechens</b> held the Russians back, though the upper floors of the building caught fire.

25|$|During the Russian Civil War, Chechens {{and other}} Caucasian nations lived in {{independence}} {{for a few}} years before being Sovietized in 1921.
