500|$|Depp's {{return in}} Dead Man's Chest {{was the first}} time he had ever made a sequel. Drew McWeeny wrote, [...] "Remember how cool Han Solo was in Star Wars the first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> it? And then {{remember}} how much cooler he seemed when Empire came out? This is that big a jump." [...] Depp received an MTV Movie Award and a Teen Choice Award for Dead Man's Chest, and was nominated for an Empire Award and another Golden Globe. For his performance in At World's End, Depp won an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance, as well as a People's Choice Award, a Kids' Choice Award, and another Teen Choice Award. He has signed on to reprise the role for future sequels.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Journalist for USA Today, Matt Roush, {{described}} Sue and Ali {{as two of}} the serial's more colourful residents. Discussing the cotdeath storyline, which {{aired in}} 1985 in the UK, Roush said, [...] "When tragedy strikes, {{as in the case}} of Ali (Nejdet Salih) and jealous wife [...] (Sandy Ratcliff), EastEnders becomes achingly believable. Try to remember the last <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> soap stars deal with the bureaucracy of registering death certificates and canceling welfare benefits." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{came the}} power of {{cross-examination}} {{on the part of}} the prisoner. He made no attempt to modify what had been said before, but asked in a gentle apologetic voice: [...] "Was that the last <b>time</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>saw,</b> or thought <b>you</b> <b>saw,</b> Peregrine Oakshott?" ...|$|R
5000|$|A critic from Indolink.com {{stated that}} [...] "overall, {{if it is}} a long <b>time</b> since <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> a movie with good comedy, above average music and crystal clear photography, here is one for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to ask}} you something," [...] I said. [...] "I {{want you}} to tell me {{everything}} that happened, from the time when we wished each other good night, to the <b>time</b> when <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> me take the Diamond." ...|$|R
2500|$|He said, [...] "In {{the early}} days, every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> the {{exterior}} of Hogwarts, it was a physical miniature," [...] which was made by craftsmen and occupied a large sound stage. [...] "We {{ended up with a}} profile of how Hogwarts looked, a skyline that actually I didn't design, and it wasn't always satisfactory, and as all the novels got written and movies got made there were new requirements [...] The [...] definitely wasn't there originally, and so we were able to add that substantial piece. And in the last film, we needed an arena for the battle for Hogwarts – the big courtyard outside doubled in size, {{and if you look at}} the first movie it wasn't there at all. There were quite some liberties taken with the continuity of Hogwarts." [...] In the last film, Craig used a digital model instead of a miniature to [...] "embrace the latest technology".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Goodness {{knows what}} more trouble the wretched creature's got into by this <b>time.</b> <b>You</b> <b>saw</b> {{that he was}} acquitted, didn't you?" [...] she demanded, in answer to her husband's stare.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, then." [...] Mrs. Gereth {{looked hard}} at the floor. [...] "There was no {{obligation}} at the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> him last--when you sent him, hating her as he did, back to her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... --Why, God {{eternally}} curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I {{threw out}} more clothes in my <b>time</b> than <b>you</b> ever <b>saw.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "'Buck,' says he, all interested, 'I'll {{tell you}} what! I {{want to make}} this a red-letter day. I've been keeping close at home, and I want to turn myself a-loose. We'll have the highest old <b>time</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>saw.</b> We'll go in the back room here and play {{checkers}} till half-past six.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{did have}} a sort of fancy for him the first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> him, didn't you?" [...] asked Mrs. Ellison, coaxingly, while forcing herself to be {{systematic}} and coherent, by a mental strain of which no idea can be given.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you needn't talk! You hove your sword at Macnamara {{and demanded}} a drum-head court-martial every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> him. The {{only thing that}} soothed you was putting you under arrest every half hour. You were off your head for three days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they are}} local preachers. The last <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> the upper one," [...] said Captain Dan with a smile, [...] "you were {{seated in the}} Wesleyan chapel, {{and he was in}} the pulpit dressed like a gentleman, and preaching as eloquently {{as if he had been}} educated at college and trained for the ministry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. That was {{the last}} <b>time</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>you.</b> You and he were in a carriage, just starting--belated--for the train. I {{remember}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I told <b>you,</b> {{the first}} <b>time</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>you,</b> that I couldn't read,' said Hugh, impatiently. 'What in the Devil's name's inside of it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{accepted}} my assent; but, oddly enough, with {{a sudden}} qualification that showed her as still sharply disposed {{to make use of}} any loose scrap of her embarrassed acuteness. [...] "Of course, at the same <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> yourself <b>saw</b> that your not admitting the possibility would have taken the edge from your cruelty. It's not the innocent," [...] she suggestively remarked, [...] "that we fear to frighten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it is {{difficult}} to explain. You see, my friend, you have a nature so honest, and a countenance so transparent, that--enfin, to conceal your feelings is impossible! If I had told you my ideas, the very first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman would have--in your so expressive idiom--'smelt a rat'! And then, bon jour to our chances of catching him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{difficult}} {{is it for}} an ambassador to dabble in treasonable intrigue, especially when old, and {{when the weather is}} wet. Let us suppose that Goring and the Earl met. Goring's business was to ask if the Earl 'has leave to disclose the secret that was not in his power to do, last <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> him. I am ready to come myself, and meet him where he pleases.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Halleck {{leaned forward}} and tapped the floor with his stick; then he fell back again, and laid his cane across {{the arms of his}} chair, and drew a long breath. [...] "Atherton," [...] he said, [...] "if you had found a blackguard of your {{acquaintance}} drunk on your doorstep early one morning, and had taken him home to his wife, how would you have expected her to treat you the next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> her?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course I {{remember}} Button-Bright," [...] {{replied the}} maiden in a sweet, tinkling voice. [...] "The last <b>time</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> {{was in the}} Land of Oz." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Told me! You {{have never}} told me when you have got your hair cut, but I have had senses to {{perceive}} it. You have always adored her, ever since I have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you told me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> her, when you were very young indeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Judge {{felt that}} he had done a {{hazardous}} thing. He took a new tone, his reminiscent tone. [...] "Mrs. Brown, do you remember the first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> me? Well, I was 'pirating' through Oberlin--(chopping wood, you remember we didn't saw it in those days) and living in a cellar, just like this young man. He's been cookin' his own grub, just as I did then, because he hasn't any money to pay for board. Now I think we ought to give him a lift. Don't you think so, Mrs. Brown?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose {{you go back}} to Dexter," [...] he proceeded. [...] "And {{suppose that}} the doctor's opinion exaggerates the peril in his case. What are you to do? The last <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> him, you had the immense {{advantage}} of taking him by surprise. Those sensitive nerves of his gave way, and he betrayed the fear that you aroused in him. Can you take him by surprise again? Not you! He is prepared for you now; and he will be on his guard. If you encounter nothing worse, you will have his cunning to deal with next. Are you his match at that? But for Lady Clarinda he would have hopelessly misled you on the subject of Mrs. Beauly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{interrupted}} Elsie, with a hurt {{look that}} accorded ill with {{a twinkle in}} her eyes; [...] "I think you might {{know the difference between}} me and Cora by this <b>time,</b> though <b>you</b> only <b>saw</b> my back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can’t deceive me," [...] ses Joe; [...] "I’ve ’ad {{too much}} experience; I knew it the fust <b>time</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> by the mole on your nose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it wasn't your shout. I {{had been}} there some <b>time</b> before <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> me. And I was not there to tempt Providence, as you call it. I went up there for--for what you thought I was going to do. Yes. I climbed two fences. I {{did not mean to}} leave {{anything}} to Providence. There seem to be people for whom Providence can do nothing. I suppose you are shocked to hear me talk like that?" ...|$|R
60|$|The one painter whom Diderot never spares is Boucher, {{who was an}} idol of the time, {{and made}} an income of fifty {{thousand}} livres a year out of his popularity. He laughs at him as a mere painter of fans, an artist with no colours on his palette save white and red. He admits the fecundity, the fougue, the ease of Boucher, just as Sir Joshua Reynolds admits his grace and beauty and good skill in composition.[39] Boucher, says Diderot, is in painting what Ariosto is in poetry, and he who admires the one is inconsistent {{if he is not}} mad for the other. What is wanting is disciplined taste, more variety, more severity. Yet he cannot refuse to concede about one of Boucher's pictures that after all he would be glad to possess it. Every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> it, he says, you would find fault with it, yet you would go on looking at it.[40] This is perhaps what the severest modern amateur, as he strolls carelessly through the French school at his leisure, would not in his heart care to deny.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{appears that}} Red {{was the most}} comely thing you ever saw. I've talked to {{quite a number of}} people who knew him in those days, white men, and they all agree that the first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> him his beauty just took your breath away. They called him Red on account of his flaming hair. It had a natural wave and he wore it long. It must have been of that {{wonderful}} colour that the pre-Raphaelites raved over. I don't think he was vain of it, he was much too ingenuous for that, but no one could have blamed him if he had been. He was tall, six feet and an inch or two--in the native house that used to stand here was the mark of his height cut with a knife on the central trunk that supported the roof--and he was made like a Greek god, broad in the shoulders and thin in the flanks; he was like Apollo, with just that soft roundness which Praxiteles gave him, and that suave, feminine grace which has in it something troubling and mysterious. His skin was dazzling white, milky, like satin; his skin was like a woman's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{think you}} are {{perfectly}} horrid,' she said, 'and I am glad {{to have an opportunity}} to tell you so, even though you do not understand me. I cannot imagine how anybody can be so stupid as to want to talk about horrible ear-trumpets the first time he meets a girl whom he has not seen for years, and who used to like him so much, and who likes him still in spite of his cruel stupidity. I wonder why you thought I wanted to see you the minute I got home? I am awfully disappointed in you, for I did think you would talk to me in a very different way the first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> me. And now I am going to tell you something--and I would rather cut my tongue out than say it in English, but it gives me a wicked delight to say it in Burmese: I love you, John Howard. I have loved you for a long time; and that is the reason I went to Burma; and now that I have come back I am obliged to say that I love you still. If you could invent some sort of a tube that would make you see better with your eyes and understand better with your mind, it would be a great deal more suitable than this horrid, snake-like thing for your ear. I do not suppose you will ever hear me speak this way in English, but I tell you again, John Howard, that I love you, and it makes me sick to think what a goose you are.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why then, I'll {{go where}} you will,' {{said the old}} man, turning to the child. 'You're sure of what you tell me? You would not deceive me? I am changed, even in the little <b>time</b> since <b>you</b> last <b>saw</b> me.' ...|$|R
