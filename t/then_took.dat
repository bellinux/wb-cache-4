5|$|Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering again. It {{was in this}} {{match that}} King gave what Barker called his finest {{first-class}} performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian's first innings before being run out, and he <b>then</b> <b>took</b> 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not out and <b>then</b> <b>took</b> 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs.
