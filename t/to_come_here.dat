Lendi Baug got its name from a well known river which used to previously flow there. The garden was full of trees and flowering plants that included a rose garden where deer and rabbits roamed about. Baba went to Lendi Baug daily and every day he threw some silver coins in the 'Lendi' ('Well'). Baba was also known to test his devotees to see if they hankered after money and gold. Baba used <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> every morning and afternoon entering alone through the west and rest under a Neem tree. Sai Baba also dug a pit, 2 feet deep, under the Neem tree and kept an earthen lamp lit continuously. Lendi Baug also has a well which was dug by Baba and his devotees.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} race, Stewart {{drove to the}} victory lane; the win earned him $55,725. He said, [...] "The fact that we've won 17 times here and not won on the right day is proof it's good momentum, but it's no {{guarantee}} obviously. It's nice <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> especially for Steve and I, being our first race together, {{to be able to}} come out and have two really good strong and solid races back-to-back is an awesome start for us." [...] Earnhardt felt that the race was [...] "pretty good" [...] and praised Stewart for his victory. He also said that he aimed to start the Daytona 500 without using a backup car. Ambrose was happy with his third-place finish, [...] "We learned a lot for Sunday, we got a good result. We are smiling right now but it was very close to being the other way around." [...] He also said he was hoping to carry on his good form into the Daytona 500.|$|E

[...] Anthony Gerrard, who missed the decisive penalty took to Twitter to apologise to Cardiff fans stating that the miss would [...] "...haunt {{me for the rest of}} my days!" [...] Despite Gerrard's apology, Cardiff goalkeeper Tom Heaton was adamant that none of the players should take the blame for the defeat: [...] "There is {{definitely}} no blame attached to any of the lads who missed. They all had the strength of character to stand up and take a penalty in front of 90,000 people and the world watching in a pressure situation. They should be credited and congratulated for taking them. Sadly, it wasn’t our day.” ...|$|E
500|$|Scheduling {{the concert}} meant a {{financial}} loss of £500,000 for the band, despite sponsorship from Coca-Cola and GSM. Ticket prices were set at just DM 8 ( [...] , [...] ), {{because of the}} 50percent unemployment rate in the city. Bono offered for the group to perform a benefit concert or small show in Sarajevo, but the city requested they hold the full PopMart show. Bono said, [...] "We offered to do a charity gig here, just turn up and do a scratch gig, but they wanted the whole fucking thing. They wanted the lemon!" [...] McGuinness added, [...] "we {{felt it was important}} that we treat this as another city on the tour, to pay them that respect. <b>To</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> and not do the whole show would have been rude." [...] According to news releases following the concert, the total net income for the show was US$13,500; however, tour promoter John Giddings noted that price did not include the costs of the production or transportation.|$|E
500|$|Foreigners like Coey {{who volunteered}} for the Rhodesian Army {{received}} the same pay and conditions of service as local regulars. Ideologically and religiously motivated, Coey viewed himself {{as a kind of}} latter-day crusader. He kept a thorough journal of his thoughts and experiences throughout his army service. [...] "I believe God intended me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> for some purpose," [...] he wrote soon after enlisting. [...] "This action has cost me an Officer's Commission, and ... my citizenship may be revoked, [...] this is the most I can do for my country under the circumstances." [...] He told the historian Gerald Horne that he believed communists had already compromised top levels of the US government, and that by serving in Rhodesia he was helping to unify [...] "his people" [...] against a foreign conspiracy. His religious views also affected his views on Zionism: he believed that the State of Israel's existence prior to the Second Coming of Christ was contrary to scriptural prophecies, and that it should therefore be destroyed.|$|E

500|$|Dennis Feldman had {{the idea}} for Species in 1987, as he worked on another film about an alien invasion, Real Men. Having read an article by Arthur C. Clarke about the insurmountable odds against an {{extraterrestrial}} craft ever locating and visiting Earth, given that stellar distances are great, and faster-than-light travel is unlikely, Feldman started {{to think that it}} was [...] "unsophisticated for any alien culture <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> in what 'd describe as a big tin can." [...] Thus in turn he considered that the possibility of extraterrestrial contact was through information. Then he detailed that a message would contain instructions from across the void to build something that would talk to men. Instead of a mechanical device, Feldman imagined wetware. The visitor would adapt to Earth's environment through DNA belonging to Earth's organisms. Mankind has sent to space transmissions [...] "giving out directions" [...] such as the Arecibo message, which Feldman considered unwary, as they relay information to potential predators from outer space. He pointed out that [...] "in nature, one species would not want a predator to know where it hides." ...|$|E
500|$|Mido joined West Ham United on {{a four-month}} loan on 1 February 2010 after his season-long loan spell with Zamalek was {{terminated}} by mutual agreement. He stated [...] "I had to sacrifice some things but I'm here {{to play football}} again and I'm here to prove a point. I'm {{very happy to be}} here, it's a great club – and I'm sure I'll do well here." [...] West Ham chairman David Sullivan announced that in order for Mido to secure his long-term footballing future, his contract with West Ham put him amongst the lowest earners in the Premier League. Sullivan said [...] "He doesn't want to be known as a 'has been' of English football, so he was willing <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to play for a nominal fee, just £1,000 a week." [...] He made his debut for West Ham on 6 February in 2–1 away defeat against Burnley. In nine appearances for West Ham he failed to score and had a tame penalty saved in a 2–2 away draw against Everton. In June 2010, West Ham decided not to offer him a new contract.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start." [...] Goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek believed winning the competition in 2003 would benefit Liverpool: [...] "It was great to win there before and I also had one of my best performances for Liverpool. There's a great buzz around the place; we know that the club expects to win trophies, and we're in a position to deliver that later this week." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{has been}} well {{received}} by critics. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone magazine noted [...] "Lost!" [...] as [...] "probably" [...] the [...] "album's most sublime pop moment". NMEs critic Mark Beaumont had the same view of Hermes, complimenting, [...] "It's not until [...] – all church organ funkiness, stomporific handclap rhythms and Chris pouting like a preacher in a jacuzzi full of strippers – that [...] really hits its stride." [...] Chris Jones of BBC writes, [...] "...'Lost!' seems to sport bongos in its mix, yet it's the plaintive voice with its vague sense of regret, the lifts from minor key piano forays into vast, pumping rock and also a strident optimism {{that people are going}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> for." [...] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork had the same sentiment: [...] "Thanks to a bubbling bit of exotic percussion that wouldn't sound out of place on Peter Gabriel's latter-day LPs, 'Lost!' is transformed from Just Another Coldplay Song into a uniquely alluring smash and live staple for years to come." [...] An article in The Guardian lambasted [...] "Lost!": [...] "This song is a deflated balloon, or, put another way, a used empty condom. He has, I think, merged visual, audio and textual into a kind of polysensory jam; no part of it works without the other two." ...|$|E
500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> and they were just going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E

Before the performance, she announced [...] "I feel like I've {{waited a long}} time <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>here.</b> And I feel very grateful.... For the first time ever, I'm going to sing 'Marry the Night'." [...] She sat on the piano and played a slow version of the song, accompanied by a sitar. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Gaga gave her first televised performance of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] dressed as a satellite landing on the moon. Wearing a red bikini, and a large red disc around her, Gaga was perched atop a semi-circular replica of the moon which was covered in silver chains. Flames erupted around the stage as Gaga revealed another circular disc covering her face. She sang the song from that vantage point and {{near the end of the}} performance, removed the metal disc and {{performed a}} choreographed dance routine with her back-up dancers. She also performed the song at the 2011 Bambi Awards in Wiesbaden, Germany, on November 10. The stage included a vintage convertible with a keyboard built into the side of the door and Gaga also won an award later that night at the gala.|$|E
