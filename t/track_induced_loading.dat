40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simplified displacement-based approach {{for the design}} of a slope stabilising system. On the top of the slope, a railway ballasted <b>track</b> <b>induces</b> repeated dynamic <b>loads</b> on the subgrade soil, that, in conjunction with other cyclic environmental loads (seasonal temperature and soil moisture variation) induce a progressive accumulation of soil displacements, despite the safety factors for the slope, if computed by means of traditional limit equilibrium methods, are all larger than one. The design procedure started then from the analysis of preliminary (pre-operam) monitoring data, in order to define the shape and amplitude of the soil displacement field, by interpreting them within a viscoplastic constitutive framework. This allowed to conveniently optimise the slope stabilising system (consisting in FRC piles connected to each other by means of a precast FRC beam and reinforced by pre-stressed ground anchors) with the aim of reducing the soil displacement rates below a prescribed threshold. The focus of the work, rather than presenting advanced constitutive or numerical simulations, is on the design approach, which allows the designer to get a reliable and safe design solution, even in lack of rich and sophisticated site characterisation, as it is often the case in real applications...|$|R

40|$|This {{experimental}} study seeks {{to quantify the}} impact various composite parameters have on the structural response of a composite structure in a pyroshock environment. The prediction of an aerospace structure's response to pyroshock <b>induced</b> <b>loading</b> is largely dependent on empirical databases created from collections of development and flight test data. While there is significant structural response data due to pyroshock <b>induced</b> <b>loading</b> for metallic structures, there is much less data available for composite structures. One challenge of developing a composite pyroshock response database as well as empirical prediction methods for composite structures is {{the large number of}} parameters associated with composite materials. This {{experimental study}} uses data from a test series planned using design of experiments (DOE) methods. Statistical analysis methods are then used to identify which composite material parameters most greatly influence a flat composite panel's structural response to pyroshock <b>induced</b> <b>loading.</b> The parameters considered are panel thickness, type of ply, ply orientation, and pyroshock level induced into the panel. The results of this test will aid in future large scale testing by eliminating insignificant parameters as well as aid in the development of empirical scaling methods for composite structures' response to pyroshock <b>induced</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} {{load statistics}} are developed {{by taking the}} acoustically <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> to be a random population, assumed to be stationary. Each element of this ensemble of acoustically <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> is assumed {{to have the same}} power spectral density (PSD), obtained previously from a random response analysis employing the given acoustic field in the STS cargo bay as a stationary random excitation. The mechanically <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> is treated as either (1) a known deterministic transient, or (2) a nonstationary random variable of known first and second statistical moments which vary with time. A method is then shown for determining the probability that the combined load would, at any time, have a value equal to or less than a certain level. Having obtained a statistical representation of how the acoustic and mechanical loads are expected to combine, an analytical approximation for defining design levels for these loads is presented using the First Passage failure criterion...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{modelling}} of {{the interaction}} between a jet and an aircraft wing or fuselage in VTOL aircraft was undertaken using a cold jet exiting perpendicular to a flat plate in a uniform cross-flow. Effects of jet decay rate and jet-to-cross-flow velocity ratio, R, on the <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> distribution were investigated. Jet decay rate was increased by using cylindrical centerbodies submerged in the jet nozzle, which caused nonuniform initial jet velocity profiles. Quicker jet decay rate, corresponding to the presence of a centerbody, resulted in as much as 50 % reduction in the <b>induced</b> pressure <b>loads</b> on the plate. This has implications in interpretation of results from earlier VTOL model studies of jet <b>induced</b> <b>loads,</b> where the jets have often had relatively slow decay rates due to uniform initial velocity profile...|$|R

40|$|High {{tension cable}} {{guardrail}} is becoming increasing popular in median and roadside applications {{due to the}} promise of reduced deflections upon impact and reduced maintenance. As the performance of these systems is observed in service, {{there is a growing}} concern over the end anchorage foundation performance of current systems. Foundations for high tension systems must not only be capable of restraining the impact load of a vehicle but must also restrain the initial pretension on the cable system as well as temperature <b>induced</b> <b>loads.</b> While it may be acceptable for many roadside safety devices to require foundation repair after impact, foundation failure due to environmentally <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> would be a serious maintenance problem. As initial tension and temperature <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> can be greater than those loads applied during impact, this type of loading must be considered in foundation design. Foundation deflection can reduce cable tension, increasing deflection of the system during impact and letting the cables sag after impact. The soil conditions in which these foundations are placed vary significantly. This report considers the potential impact, tension, and temperature loads and develops a set of suggested foundation designs to accommodate a range of in situ soil conditions. These designs will vary significantly in different areas around the nation due to variations in both weather and in situ soil conditions. Deflection during full-scale crash tests may not accurately represent the foundation deflection that will be experienced in the field...|$|R

40|$|This note {{presents}} {{a model for}} the dynamic simulation of a catenary mooring line (or a submarine power cable). In general, mooring lines are subject to a direct wave load (e. g. drag, inertia) in addition to the <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> due to movement of the vessel to which they are linked. Specific aim of this note is to present, calibrate and validate the numerical response to direct wave action, by comparisons with physical model tests. Tests were carried out at the wave flume of the Maritime Laboratory of IMAGE Department, Padova University, within the framework of a Master thesis. Wave <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> were measured at the fairlead of a compliant chain, with the peculiarity that the fairlead was hinged to a fixed point, the chain being simply subject to the <b>load</b> <b>induced</b> by regular (slightly non-linear) waves.

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{compression}} between two parallel plates {{is used to}} measure the viscoelastic properties of whole and decapsulated human lenses and compare them with other animal species. Compressive load relaxation was performed by deforming the lens by 10 % and measuring the force relaxation response for 100 s to obtain thickness, stiffness and relaxation of the <b>induced</b> <b>loading</b> force and Maxwell parameters for human, monkey, porcine and leporine whole and decapsulated lenses. Thickness and percentage loading force relaxation increased linearly with lens age, whereas stiffness and <b>induced</b> <b>loading</b> force increased exponentially. Human and monkey lenses aged at different rates. Loading force relaxation in a generalized Maxwell model was described by three time constants ranging from 1 to 1000 s. Compressive load relaxation is a very versatile method to study the viscoelastic properties of whole and decapsulated lenses and potentially also artificial accommodating lenses. The data presented in the study will help researchers choose the most suitable animal lenses based on the desired properties and age to be mimicked from the human lenses. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A large {{variety of}} {{numerical}} tools with {{different levels of}} sophistication for the prediction of wave <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> and motions have been developed over the last decades and are being applied today. With the current trend of larger, more advanced and optimized designs, e. g. large container ships and focus turning more and more towards safety and energy efficiency, nonlinear phenomena are becoming more important {{and many of the}} traditional methods fail to capture some of the physics induced by such hull shapes and involved in large amplitude wave <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> and motions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the work done on a numerical method for the three-dimensional fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) problem. The aim of the development is the prediction of large amplitude wave <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> and motions with actual forward speed, taking into account implicitly all kinds of nonlinearities, i. e. higher and lower order frequency components, hull shape above the calm water level (exact body approach) and self interaction between the forward speed flow field and the radiated/diffracted waves. The body boundary conditions are imposed on the instantaneous wetted surface and the fully nonlinear free surface boundary conditions are updated using the common mixed Euler-Lagrange (MEL) method. Free surface panels are raised a distance above the surface while the boundary conditions are imposed on markers tracing the free surface. The computational domain moves forward in time consistently with the time integral scheme and the evolution of the free surface marker elevation and velocity potential to include the actual effect of forward speed. Incident waves can be prescribed either from standard perturbation solutions or from fully nonlinear numerical solutions. In addition to a description of the overall methodology, the paper presents numerical results and a systematic comparison with experimental data from the literature...|$|R
40|$|A {{computational}} tool {{was applied}} {{based on a}} two dimensional linear method to predict the hydrodynamic loads for damaged ships. Experimental tests on a ship model have also been carried out to predict the hydrodynamic loads in various design conditions. The results of the theoretical method and experimental tests are compared to validate the theoretical method. The extreme wave <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> have been calculated by short term prediction. For the loads in intact condition, the prediction with duration of 20 years at sea state 5 is used, while for loads in damaged conditions the prediction in 96 hours exposure time at sea 3 is used. The maximum values of the most probable extreme amplitudes of dynamic wave <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> in damaged conditions are much less than those in intact condition because of the reduced time. An opening could change the distribution of not only stillwater bending moment but also wave-induced bending moment. It is observed that although some cross sections are not structurally damaged, the total loads acting on these cross sections after damage may be increased dramatically compared to the original design load in intact condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{preliminary}} design af a high altitude, remotely piloted, atmospheric sampling aircraft powered by microwave energy beamed from a ground based antenna has been completed. The aircraft utilizes a horizontal tail and a canard for longitudinal control {{and to enhance}} the structural rigidity of the twin fuselage configuration. The wing structure is designed to withstand a gust <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> factor of n equals 3 at cruise altitude, but the low wing loading of the aircraft makes it very sensitive to gusts at lower altitudes, where <b>induced</b> <b>load</b> factors may be in excess of 20. Therefore, a structural load alleviation system is proposed to limit actual loads to the designed structural limit. Since the transmitting antenna would have a diameter of several hundred feet, {{it would not be}} readily transportable; so, it is proposed that a single antenna be constructed at a site from which the aircraft is to be flown.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{predicting}} wave <b>induced</b> <b>loads</b> on cylinders is an enormously complex one. It {{is clear from}} the scatter present in most experimental determinations of force coefficients that there are many individual factors which influence the mechanisms of flow <b>induced</b> <b>loading.</b> Among these are some, for instance Reynolds number, separation and periodic vortex shedding, which are inter-related and whose influences cannot be studied in isolation. Others, such as shear flow, irregular waves and free surface effects, can at least be eliminated in the laboratory, in order to approach an understanding of the more fundamental characteristics of the flow. A vertical cylinder in uniform waves experiences an incident flow field which can be described in terms of rotating velocity and acceleration vectors, always in the same vertical plane, containing also the cylinder axis, whose magnitudes are functions of time and of position {{along the length of the}} cylinder. Some of the essential features of this flow can be studied under two-dimensional oscillatory conditions, in which either the cylinder or the fluid is oscillated relative to the other along a straight line (planar oscillatory flow). The incident velocity and acceleration vectors are then always concurrent, normal to the cylinder axis, and oscillating in magnitude with time. <br/...|$|R

Bose (1996) used a 3 -D panel method to evaluate the <b>induced</b> hydrodynamic <b>load</b> fluctuation between a milled ice block and the propeller blade leading edge profile, with a fixed value of proximity. For variable proximity simulation, a time-domain panel method is required to handle multiple objects moving in multiple pats.
