25|$|None of this, apparently, was enough. Sage {{wrote in}} a journal in August 1961, “I have said all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say. There is nothing left {{for me to do}} but scream.” On January 8, 1963, she put a fatal bullet through her heart. Following {{instructions}} in her will, Pierre Matisse buried urns containing Sage’s and Tanguy’s ashes in the water off the coast of Tanguy’s native Brittany in 1964.|$|E
25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first has sort of given me a complex <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E
25|$|Henry was in France {{with the}} Emperor Maximilian at {{the siege of}} Thérouanne. The Scottish Lyon King of Arms brought James IV's letter of 26 July to him. James asked him to desist from attacking France in breach of their treaty. Henry's {{exchange}} with Islay Herald or the Lyon King on 11 August at his tent at the siege was recorded. The Herald declared that Henry should abandon his efforts against the town and go home. Angered, Henry said that James {{had no right to}} summon him, and ought to be England's ally, as James was married to his (Henry's) sister, Margaret. He declared:And now, for a conclusion, recommend me to your master and tell him if he be so hardy to invade my realm or cause to enter one foot of my ground I shall make him as weary of his part as ever was man that began any such business. And one thing I ensure him by the faith <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> the Crown of England and by the word of a King, there shall never King nor Prince make peace with me that ever his part shall be in it. Moreover, fellow, I care for nothing but for misentreating of my sister, that would God she were in England on a condition she cost the Schottes King not a penny.|$|E

500|$|Adam's {{off-screen}} {{background was}} established to reflect that of his father; the character was highly self-motivated, studying at college and beginning a career in finance. In an interview with Soaps In Depth, Engen said, [...] "Luckily, I'm {{not going to be}} compared to anyone else...anything I do and anything I try to project, and [...] kind of ideas <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> influence the character are okay". The actor stated his intent to portray Adam as a [...] "rich, three-dimensional character with ambitions, flaws, and the positive qualities of his mother Hope".|$|E
500|$|She {{rejects the}} notion that her song lyrics are autobiographical, telling The Times in 1998: [...] "the {{tortured}} artist myth is rampant. People paint me {{as some kind of}} black witchcraft-practising devil from hell, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be twisted and dark to do what I am doing. It's a load of rubbish". What is more, she later told Spin: [...] "some critics have taken my writing so literally to the point that they'll listen to 'Down by the Water' and believe I have actually given birth to a child and drowned her." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{set list}} {{consisted}} of songs from her debut album mainly, but some new songs like [...] "Fashion" [...] from the Confessions of a Shopaholic soundtrack were also considered. In May, {{during an interview}} with Edmonton Sun Gaga announced that the tour would continue through European festivals in summer. She also declared plans for a bigger North American tour including Canada. Gaga explained that the show {{is supposed to be}} much bigger than the previous version. She said, [...] "Oh, you have no idea, [...] The tour that we're about to announce is such a dream <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pinch myself almost every day to remind myself that it's happening." ...|$|E

500|$|By 2009, {{the term}} [...] "chamber pop" [...] {{had fallen to}} {{indiscriminate}} use: as songwriter/author Scott Miller suggests, it [...] "made more sense applied to the Fleet Foxes than to other bands I've since seen it applied to". He also noted that Pet Sounds had become a ubiquitous object of comparison; [...] " [...] are happy about <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pinch myself and reflect that I'd never thought I'd see the day." [...] Treblezines Brian Roster wrote that Grizzly Bear's album Veckatimest was a [...] "landmark exploration of the changing landscapes of pop in 2009" [...] that represented an attempt to create [...] "a sort of abridged conclusion to chamber pop's earliest days".|$|E
500|$|... "Alive" [...] is not [...] "the type of music" [...] that Lopez {{is used to}} making. According to Lopez, {{she knew}} that there was {{something}} [...] "inside of me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> offer to this [...] And then, you know, things happen. Things have a weird way of happening naturally and organically when they're supposed to. And I feel that this song was just meant to be, for this movie. Basically, I wrote the song for me to go through all these kinds of things as an actress with this character. You draw from all different experiences in your life. From way back to the present, to whatever, to make it really true and honest". [...] "Alive" [...] means [...] "the world" [...] to Lopez because of its positive message {{and the fact that it}} was something that she created with Judd.|$|E
500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, some people call it nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying to take things away from me, and the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't know I have and then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> defend myself. I {{have to stand up}} and fight the fucking gorilla. Once I've got the diamond and I run away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E

500|$|Gens' {{wife and}} {{daughter}} at first went to Kaunas but, after {{the formation of the}} ghetto, they returned to Vilnius and lived near the ghetto's perimeter. His wife used her maiden name rather than Gens'. According to Leonard Tushnet, there were unfounded rumors that the couple had divorced. Gens did not refute the rumors, as he thought they would help protect his family. Other sources state that the two were divorced to protect Elvyra and Ada. Elvyra Gens was opposed to her husband taking {{a leading role in the}} government of the ghetto and urged him to [...] "pass" [...] as a Lithuanian. It is not clear exactly why Gens went into the ghetto, but in a letter to his wife, Gens said [...] "This is the first time in my life <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> engage in such duties. My heart is broken. But I shall always do what is necessary for the sake of the Jews in the ghetto." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{a report}} in Reuters, Goldstone said he had spent many days and [...] "sleepless nights" [...] {{deciding}} whether to accept the mandate, saying that it had come as [...] "quite a shock". He continued, [...] "I can approach the daunting task I have accepted in an even-handed and impartial manner and give it the same attention <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> situations in my own country," [...] where his experience had been that [...] "transparent, public investigations are very important, important particularly for the victims because it brings acknowledgement of what happened to them." [...] He explained that he had long [...] "taken a deep interest in Israel, in what happens in Israel, and I have been associated with organisations that have worked in Israel" [...] and [...] "decided to accept it because of my deep concern for peace in the Middle East, and my deep concern for victims in all sides in the Middle East." ...|$|E
500|$|Bacon later {{stated that}} [...] "painting {{has nothing to}} do with {{colouring}} surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: [...] "When I feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's going to work and then I go with the image itself." [...] He told David Sylvester that he intended his [...] "hard, flat, bright ground" [...] to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that [...] "for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably is why I have used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with [...] "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.|$|E

500|$|Keef {{has drawn}} {{comparisons}} to 50 Cent, as The New York Times writes, that like 50 Cent, Keef [...] makes thuggery, [...] "a {{major part of}} his early-career persona." [...] Lupe Fiasco, who {{has been involved with}} a controversy with Keef, has been referred to as an [...] "antagonist" [...] to Keef's more gangsta-rap persona. The New York Times writes, [...] "Lupe Fiasco is a stern and didactic teacher, but it’s arguable that Chief Keef’s music is far better at ringing warning bells." [...] Another rapper, Common, has praised Chief Keef's contributions to rap, stating, [...] "I think Chief Keef brought something that nobody else was doing and he brought it raw. He brought it real. With <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> respect that as an artist that he has come and brought that." [...] Other rappers, such as Rhymefest and Lupe Fiasco, however, have been critical of Chief (see controversies section below).|$|E
500|$|David Fricke of Rolling Stone {{felt the}} album's lyrics have an [...] "emotional and {{pictorial}} directness, rare for Yorke". The lines [...] "No more {{going to the}} dark side with your flying saucer eyes / No more falling down a wormhole <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pull you out", from the track [...] "Atoms for Peace", were inspired by an [...] "admonition" [...] from Yorke's partner Rachel Owen. According to the Globe and Mail, [...] "The Clock", influenced by Arabic music, is a [...] "gliding, droning song about losing control while pretending 'that you are still in charge'." [...] "Analyse" [...] was inspired by a blackout Yorke experienced in his hometown Oxford: [...] "The houses were all dark, with candlelight in the windows, which is obviously how it would have been when they were built. It was beautiful." [...] The song [...] "Atoms for Peace" [...] references a 1953 speech by American President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The album title was inspired by [...] "these huge elephants {{that we have in the}} room at the moment, in the west, and people are desperately trying to erase them from public consciousness." ...|$|E
500|$|Following a {{long time}} of hiatus in her acting career, Cher was {{announced}} to be returned on the musical film Burlesque (2010) co-starring Christina Aguilera. This {{was the first time}} Cher appeared on the screen since Stuck on You (2003). Talking about the making of the film, Cher revealed, [...] "It’s harder to do things. I've beat my body up so badly, it's amazing it's still talking to me and listening to what I say. But I’ve got aches and pains everywhere." [...] The soundtrack was also revealed, with eight songs performed by Aguilera, and two songs by Cher: [...] "Welcome to Burlesque" [...] and [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me". During an interview with a California journal, Cher commented about [...] "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me", [...] "That song, for me, had a lot of meaning. It reminded me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kind of move over." [...] She also spoke about the track with the Fresno Bee, saying [...] "Not that I'm doing it gracefully, because you'd have to pull me over kicking and screaming." [...] In the United States, the song was released to adult contemporary radio station on January 15, 2011 the first single from the soundtrack. In order to promote the song, several promotional remixes were made by Almighty, Dave Aude and StoneBridge. The remix EP, which contains uptempo dance versions of the track, was released onto iTunes Stores on November 24, 2010. The remix done by StoneBridge was released as a single on December 7, 2010. The song is also included in Cher's 25th studio album, Closer to the Truth (deluxe edition).|$|E
