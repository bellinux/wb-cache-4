50|$|England {{announced}} {{the same team}} for the First <b>Test</b> <b>bar</b> Mike Smith who was brought in over Caddick, while Australia lodged a complaint against David Graveney for his decision to change pitches {{two weeks before the}} Test. Australia won the toss and chose to bowl in the 36 overs permitted in a rain affected first day. Ending on 103/3, England collapsed on the second day to 172 all out, thanks to a seven-wicket haul from Gillespie. Atherton scored 41 from 143 deliveries, however no other batsman passed 30. In response, Elliott (199) and Ashes debutant Ricky Ponting's maiden Test century (127) brought Australia to 501/9 declared, with an expensive five-wicket haul for Gough, who went for 149 runs.|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} bachelor´s thesis {{deals with}} the influence of heat treatment especially artificial aging on mechanical and structural properties of AlSi 7 Mg 0. 6 alloy. Cylindrical <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> of diameter 6 mm and 9 mm cast into a self-supporting ceramic shell made by plaster investment technology were used as experimental samples. These <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> were cast by Alucast whereas the patented technology of casting- JF casting was used. On the <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> was carried out the T 6 heat treatment according to the Standards AMS 2771 C. After the solution annealing were <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> divided to the six groups and put through various time of artificial aging, namely from 2 to the 12 hours. In order to evaluate {{the effect of the}} time of artificial aging on the structure and mechanical properties of both diameters of the <b>test</b> <b>bars,</b> the method of light microscopy, Brinell hardness test and static traction test were used. Also SDAS quantification was carried out by means of image analysis. On the grounds results of experiments it is possible to state, that the best values of mechanical properties of both diameters of the cylindrical <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> were reached after 10 hours of artificial aging...|$|R

40|$|The present paper reviews {{research}} on a haptic orientation processing. Central {{is a task}} in which a <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> has to be set parallel to a reference bar at another location. Introducing a delay between inspecting the reference bar and setting the <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> leads to a surprising improvement. Moreover, offering visual background information also elevates performance. Interestingly, (congenitally) blind individuals do not or to a weaker extent show the improvement with time, while in parallel to this, they appear to benefit less from spatial imagery processing. Together this strongly points to an important role for visual processing mechanisms {{in the perception of}} haptic inputs...|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{deviations}} {{occur when}} blindfolded subjects set a <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> parallel to a reference {{bar in the}} horizontal plane using haptic information (Kappers and Koenderink 1999, Perception 28 : 781 - 795; Kappers 1999, Perception 28 : 1001 - 1012). These deviations are assumed to reflect {{the use of a}} combination of a biasing egocentric reference frame and an allocentric, more cognitive one (Kappers 2002, Acta Psychol 109 : 25 - 40). In two experiments, we have examined the effect of delay between the perception of a reference bar and the parallel setting of a <b>test</b> <b>bar.</b> In both experiments a 10 -s delay improved performance. The improvement increased with a larger horizontal (left-right) distance between the bars. This improvement was interpreted as a shift from the egocentric towards the allocentric reference frame during the delay period...|$|E

40|$|A {{new version}} of an {{experimental}} set-up for examination of linear contraction and shrinkage stresses progress of metals and alloys during– and after solidification has been described. By new method the examinations of the shrinkage phenomena are conducted in a vertical rod-casting with circular cross-section. The test rod casting can have a constant cross-section (constrained contraction, parted mould) or can be tapered (unconstrained contraction, no parted mould). The examinations can be conducted in sand and metal mould. A microprocessor recorder {{has been used for}} registering of measured signals. In the contraction experiment the dimensions changes of solidified <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> and the test mould are registered. By the investigation of contraction stresses, a contraction force effecting on the solidified <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> is registered instead of its dimension changes. The temperature changes of the shrinkage rod casting (in 6 points) and the mould (in one point) can be measured. Exemplary investigation results of linear contraction development in aluminium have been presented...|$|E

A vertical shrinkage rod casting with circular cross-section (constant or fixed: tapered) {{has been used}} as a test sample. By constant cross-section a test channel mould was parted and allowed a constrained contraction to examine. No parted test channel mould was tapered and allowed an unconstrained contraction to investigate. In the experiments the dimensions changes of solidifying <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> and the test mould have been registered, what has allowed to explain a mechanism of pre-shrinkage extension of solidifying metals and alloys. Registered time dependence of the <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> and the test mould dimension changes have shown, that so-called pre-shrinkage extension has been by mould thermal extension caused. The investigation results have also shown that time- and temperature dependences of shrinkage of Al-Si alloys have been on silicon concentration depended...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There {{are some}} {{indications}} that haptic space like visual space is not Euclidean (eg Blumenfeld, 1937 Acta Psychologica 2 125 ^ 174). In {{a series of}} experiments, we investigated the haptic perception of spatial relations in a systematic way. We restricted ourselves to a horizontal plane at waist height. Blindfolded {{subjects were asked to}} perform three tasks with their right hand: (i) a reference bar was presented under four different orientations and subjects were asked to rotate a <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> such that it felt to be parallel to the reference bar; (ii) subjects had to rotate two test bars {{in such a way that}} they felt collinear; (iii) subjects had to point a <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> in the direction of a marker. Bars and marker could appear at nine different locations. In all experiments large systematic deviations (up to 408) were made. The deviations strongly correlated with horizontal (right ^ left) but not with vertical (forward ^ backward) distance. Subjects showed qualitatively identical trends but the size of the deviations was strongly subject-dependent. In addition, a significant haptic oblique effect was found. These results provide strong evidence that haptic space in non-Euclidean. ...|$|E

40|$|The yield {{strength}} of high-pressure diecast (hpdc) <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> of alloy AZ 91 increases with decreasing section thickness while its hardness remains approximately constant. This behaviour {{is in contrast}} {{with that of the}} gravity cast alloy, whose hardness scales with the {{yield strength}}. Vickers hardness measured on the surface of hpdc <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> using increasing loads shows that the subsurface porosity layer usually found in hpdc material may gradually collapse under the indent, lowering the hardness. However, this is insufficient to explain the lack of correlation between hardness and yield strength. It is argued that the low strain-hardening rate of high-pressure diecast material leads to lower than expected hardness values. In addition, it is shown that the plastic zone under a macro indentation is largely contained by the softer core of the castings, rendering hardness insensitive to the casting thickness. It is concluded that macrohardness is too coarse a tool for a meaningful determination of the strength of hpdc material. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Also, {{the influence of}} protective coatings on these properties was investigated. Specimens of forged bar stock were subjected to LCF and HCF tests at 950 K (1250 F) and 3. 4 MN/sq m (500 psig) pressure, in ammonia containing about 1. 5 percent H 2 O. Aluminized samples (Chromizing Company's Al- 870) and gold plated <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> were compared with uncoated specimens. Comparison tests were also run in air at 950 K (1250 F), but at ambient pressures.

40|$|Research has {{revealed}} that haptic perception of parallelity deviates from physical reality. Large and systematic deviations {{have been found in}} haptic parallelity matching most likely due to the influence of the hand-centered egocentric reference frame. Providing information that increases the influence of allocentric processing has been shown to improve performance on haptic matching. In this study allocentric processing was stimulated by providing informative vision in haptic matching tasks that were performed using hand- and arm-centered reference frames. Twenty blindfolded participants (ten men, ten women) explored the orientation of a reference bar with the non-dominant hand and subsequently matched (task HP) or mirrored (task HM) its orientation on a <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> with the dominant hand. Visual information was provided by means of informative vision with participants having full view of the <b>test</b> <b>bar,</b> while the reference bar was blocked from their view (task VHP). To decrease the egocentric bias of the hands, participants also performed a visual haptic parallelity drawing task (task VHPD) using an arm-centered reference frame, by drawing the orientation of the reference bar. In all tasks, the distance between and orientation of the bars were manipulated. A significant effect of task was found; performance improved from task HP, to VHP to VHPD, and HM. Significant effects of distance were found in the first three tasks, whereas orientation and gender effects were only significant in tasks HP and VHP. The results showed that stimulating allocentric processing by means of informative vision and reducing the egocentric bias by using an arm-centered reference frame led to most accurate performance on parallelity matching...|$|E

The coating compositions are Ni- 19 Al- 1 Cb, Ni- 19 Al- 3 Cb, Ni- 17 Al- 20 Cr, and Ni- 12 Al- 20 Cr. Cyclic burner rig hot corrosion (900 C) and oxidation (1050 C) tests indicated that Ni-Al-Cb coatings provided better overall resistance than Ni-Al-Cr coatings. Tensile properties of Ni- 19 Al- 1 Cb and Ni- 12 Al- 20 Cr coated <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> were fully retained {{at room temperature}} and 649 C.
