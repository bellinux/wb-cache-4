5|$|Carroon, gravely ill, is {{cared for}} by the Rocket Group's doctor, Briscoe (John Glen), who has been having a secret affair with Carroon's wife, Judith (Isabel Dean). It is not just Quatermass who is {{interested}} in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (Paul Whitsun-Jones) and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Ian Colin) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted {{by a group of}} foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe he has obtained about travelling in space. It is clear that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> critically wrong: he appears to have absorbed the consciousness of the other two crew members, and is slowly mutating into a plant-like alien organism.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly {{knew what she was}} doing sleeping with an older man, and yet <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Arthur Dales, now living in a Florida trailer park, calls Mulder and Scully for help when a neighboring family disappears; and, with a hurricane approaching, Mulder and Scully find themselves trapped {{with a group of}} residents in a building where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> in the water.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I wouldn't say he <b>was</b> exactly... but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> queer... <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> uncanny about him. I'll {{tell you}} my opinion...." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>{{something}}</b> {{remote and}} splendid {{in the ladies}} who rode haughtily through the streets on prancing horses, covered with red and gold trappings. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> heroic, something of splendid art in the pose of the athletes in the ring.|$|R
5000|$|The two {{travelers}} knew <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> {{wrong with}} the city, since the residents didn't seem like {{they wanted to be}} saved or anything, even though <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> as dangerous as the robot creature.|$|R
5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have}} to act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E
5|$|As {{a form of}} express trust, {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the gift is given after death through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust. If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a charitable trust, like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} episode, Mahone and Michael {{are the only}} ones left on the team. Linc and Sara are captured, and Self is in the hospital. Mahone and Michael decide it is time to bring the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an {{explosion}} set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without the hard drive and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and her man, Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln {{to the other side of}} the room. When the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> wrong with Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's hard drive is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael’s grave at a beach.|$|E
60|$|Paul {{was just}} opening out from {{childhood}} into manhood. This atmosphere, where everything took a religious value, {{came with a}} subtle fascination to him. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> in the air. His own mother <b>was</b> logical. Here <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> different, something he loved, something that at times he hated.|$|R

5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen {{if they wish to}} try to combine them.|$|E
25|$|They are {{critical}} methods, having, like all criticism, {{the power to}} do good when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that must be destroyed, dissolved, or reduced, but capable only of harm when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> to be built (Jung, 1966: par. 65).|$|E
25|$|Whereas legal {{positivism}} {{would say}} that a law can be unjust without it being any less a law, a natural law jurisprudence {{would say that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> legally deficient about an unjust norm. Legal interpretivism, famously defended in the English-speaking world by Ronald Dworkin, claims to have a position different from both natural law and positivism.|$|E

25|$|It is {{only through}} {{recognizing}} {{the violence and}} sensuality {{at the center of}} Mozart's work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence. In a paradoxical way, Schumann's superficial characterization of the G minor Symphony can help us to see Mozart's daemon more steadily. In all of Mozart's supreme expressions of suffering and terror, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> shockingly voluptuous.|$|E
25|$|Though Hikari doesn't {{show her}} {{strength}} in her performances, {{she has a}} natural sense of knowledge and observation {{when it comes to}} gymnastics and is able to learn the techniques better than Hazuki and with time is able to surpass her. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that Hikari needs to work on: she needs to add more grace and elegance to her performances. She is able to achieve this with the help of Mao Natsukawa.|$|E
25|$|Mental {{events have}} a certain {{subjective}} quality to them, whereas physical seem not to. So, for example, one may ask what a burned finger feels like, or what the blueness of the sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like. Philosophers of mind call the subjective aspects of mental events qualia. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that it's like to feel pain, to see a familiar shade of blue, and so on. There are qualia involved in these mental events. And the claim is that qualia cannot be reduced to anything physical.|$|E
60|$|The {{man stood}} silent. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> devilish in his appearance.|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} some things {{for which it is}} not enough to state a single cause, but several, of which one, however, is the case. Just as if you were to see the lifeless corpse of a man lying far away, it would be fitting to list all the causes of death in order to make sure that the single cause of this death may be stated. For you would not be able to {{establish}} conclusively that he died by the sword or of cold or of illness or perhaps by poison, but we know that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> of this kind that happened to him.|$|E
25|$|Steven first {{appears in}} the serial The Chase, when the Doctor and his {{companion}}s, Ian, Barbara, and Vicki, find him on the planet Mechanus where he crash-landed two years before. He joins the Doctor and Vicki as a companion in the following serial, The Time Meddler, when they discover that he stowed-away in the TARDIS after having escaped the burning Mechanoid City. Steven is a strong-willed individual, who is more capable when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> physical to do than when there is thinking to be done. He has a finely developed {{sense of right and}} wrong, and places a high value on human life.|$|E
25|$|When Sir Gervase Chevenix-Gore {{writes to}} Hercule Poirot to unceremoniously summon {{him down to}} the Chevenix-Gore ancestral pile, Poirot is {{initially}} reluctant to go. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> that intrigues him and so he catches the train that Sir Gervase wanted him to. On arrival, it is clear that no-one was expecting him, and, {{for the first time in}} memory, Sir Gervase himself, who is always punctual, is missing. Poirot and guests go to his study and find him there dead, having apparently shot himself. Poirot is not convinced, however, and soon starts to prove that Sir Gervase was murdered because of various improbable factors surrounding the death, including the position at which the bullet is believed to have struck a mirror and the many different moods that Chevenix-Gore exhibited during the day.|$|E

25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> {{that is very}} seldom found {{in the art of}} today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some of these pictures before and in a place that had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I had seen them in the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around. And here beside the Silvermine River in Connecticut I talked with a man who might have worked in one of the cathedrals or belonged to a mediaeval guild of craftsmen, a man who considers art in relation to an economy utterly different from the one that is dominant among us in the world today.|$|E
25|$|By {{assuming}} a deterministic physical universe, the objection can be formulated more precisely. When a person decides {{to walk across}} a room, it is generally understood {{that the decision to}} do so, a mental event, immediately causes a group of neurons in that person's brain to fire, a physical event, which ultimately results in his walking across the room. The problem is that if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> totally nonphysical causing a bunch of neurons to fire, then there is no physical event which causes the firing. This means that some physical energy is required to be generated against the physical laws of the deterministic universe—this is by definition a miracle and there can be no scientific explanation of (repeatable experiment performed regarding) where the physical energy for the firing came from. Such interactions would violate the fundamental laws of physics. In particular, if some external source of energy is responsible for the interactions, then this would violate the law of the conservation of energy. Dualistic interactionism has therefore been argued against in that it violates a general heuristic principle of science: the causal closure of the physical world.|$|E
25|$|Another highly {{classified}} U.S. {{study was}} conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) {{in the latter half}} of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents convince us that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> going on that must have immediate attention... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level scientists, now known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.|$|E

Whatever her tone was, however, it had a fascination; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> dainty about it, {{and yet it was}} decidedly audacious.|$|R
