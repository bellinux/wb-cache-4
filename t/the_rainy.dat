5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E

5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape during <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms}} of soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested at the end of <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E

5|$|Three African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} {{take part in}} a long-distance migration, timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth on the volcanic soil short-grass plains where they can find the nutrient-rich forage necessary for lactation and calf growth. The timing of the migration in both directions can vary considerably from year to year. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season, they migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of drinking water. When <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season begins again a few months later, the animals trek back to their wet-season range. These movements and access to nutrient rich forage for reproduction allow migratory wildebeest populations to grow to much larger numbers than resident populations. There were many long-distance migratory populations of wildebeest 100 years ago, but currently all but three migrations (Serengeti, Tarangire, and Kafue) have been disrupted, cut off, and lost.|$|E
30|$|The {{reproductive}} {{activity of}} D. melanostictus is seasonal and {{is related to}} the rainfall regime. Ovarian follicles begin vitellogenesis at the end of <b>the</b> little <b>rainy</b> season and reach their maximal diameter from May to July, months when <b>the</b> little <b>rainy</b> season abruptly ceases. Oviposition takes place during <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>rainy</b> season, and egg development occurs during <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>rainy</b> season and <b>the</b> first main <b>rainy</b> season of <b>the</b> year. Seasonality in female reproductive activity seems to be common in anurans from Bach Ma National Park. In fact, it was suggested that in tropical anuran species living in areas of pronounced difference between the little and main rainy seasons, oviposition is concentrated at the end of <b>the</b> little <b>rainy</b> season, and hatching occurs during <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>rainy</b> season and early in <b>the</b> main <b>rainy</b> season (Ngo et al. 2009).|$|R
