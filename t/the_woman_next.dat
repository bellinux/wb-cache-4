2500|$|François Roland Truffaut ( [...] ; 6 February 1932 – 21 October 1984) was a French film director, screenwriter, producer, actor, {{and film}} critic, {{as well as}} {{one of the founders of}} the French New Wave. In a film career lasting over a quarter of a century, he remains an icon of the French film industry, having worked on over 25 films. [...] Truffaut's film The 400 Blows came to be a {{defining}} film of the French New Wave movement. Unique in world cinema, the movie is followed over 20 years with classics Stolen Kisses, Bed and Board and Love on the Run between 1958 and 1979. He also directed such other classics as Shoot the Piano Player (1960), Jules et Jim (1961), The Wild Child (1970), Two English Girls (1971), Day for Night (1973) and <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>Next</b> Door (1981).|$|E
2500|$|Legendary French {{director}} François Truffaut {{adapted the}} subject to modern times for his 1981 film La Femme d'à côté (<b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>Next</b> Door), while 1988's In the Shadow of the Raven transported the characters to medieval Iceland. Here, Trausti and Isolde are warriors from rival tribes who come into conflict when Trausti kills the leader of Isolde's tribe, but a local bishop makes peace and arranges their marriage. Bollywood director Subhash Ghai transfers the story to modern India and the United States in his 1997 musical Pardes. The Indian American Kishorilal (Amrish Puri) raises his orphaned nephew Arjun (Shahrukh Khan). Eventually, Pardes sends Arjun back to India to lure the beautiful Ganga (Mahima Chaudhary) as a bride for his selfish, shallow son Rajiv (Apoorva Agnihotri). Arjun falls for Ganga, and struggles to remain loyal to his cousin and beloved uncle. The film features the Bollywood hit [...] "I Love My India". The 2002 French animated film Tristan et Iseut is a bowdlerized version of the traditional tale aimed at a family audience.|$|E

60|$|Then came a pause, and I noticed, {{with horror}} and a rising of the hair, that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>next</b> to Mahomed began to fondle him, patting {{his cheeks and}} calling him by names of endearment while her fierce eyes played {{up and down his}} {{trembling}} form. I do not know why the sight frightened me so, but it did frighten us all dreadfully, especially Leo.

60|$|Ruth was led {{back to the}} bench, and <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>next</b> to her brought forward. This was {{a heavier}} person, with the figure and step of a matured woman. Upon {{removing}} her bonnet she showed the plain face of a woman of forty, and it was striking only in that strange, stony aloofness noted in the older men. Here, Shefford thought, was the real Mormon, different {{in a way he}} could not define from Ruth. This woman seated herself in the chair and calmly faced her prosecutors. She manifested no emotion whatever. Shefford remembered her and could not see any change in her deportment. This trial appeared to be of little moment to her and she took the oath as if doing so had been a habit all her life.|$|E
60|$|He went early, {{and found}} himself in the end seat of a long row of many rows of women, who were prolonging the time of keeping their hats on till custom obliged them to take them off. He gave so much notice to <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>next</b> him as to see that she was deeply veiled as well as widely hatted, and then he lapsed into a dreary muse, which was broken by the first strains of the overture. Then he {{diverted}} himself by looking round at all those ranks of women lifting their arms to take out them hat-pins and dropping them to pin their hats to the seat-backs in front of them, or to secure them somehow in their laps. Upon the whole, he thought the manoeuvre graceful and pleasing; he imagined a consolation in it for the women, who, if they were forced by public opinion to put off their charming hats, would know how charmingly they did it. Each turned a little, either her body or her head, and looked in any case {{out of the corner of}} her eyes; and he was phrasing it all for a scene in his story, when he looked round at his neighbor to see how she had managed, or was managing, with her veil. At the same moment she looked at him, and their eyes met.|$|E

60|$|Hatless, in {{the very}} front row, marched a tall slip of a girl, arrow-straight, and so thin, with dirty fair hair, in a blouse and skirt gaping behind, ever turning her pretty face on its pretty slim neck from side to side, so that one could see her blue eyes {{sweeping}} here, there, everywhere, {{with a sort of}} flower-like wildness, as if a secret embracing of each moment forbade her to let them rest on anything and break this pleasure of just marching. It seemed that in the never-still eyes of that anaemic, happy girl the spirit of our march had elected to enshrine itself and to make thence its little excursions to each ecstatic follower. Just behind her marched a little old woman--a maker of chains, they said, for forty years--whose black slits of eyes were sparkling, who fluttered a bit of ribbon, and reeled with her sense of the exquisite humour of the world. Every now and then she would make a rush at one of her leaders to demonstrate how immoderately glorious was life. And each time she spoke <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>next</b> to her, laden with a heavy baby, went off into squeals of laughter. Behind her, again, marched one who beat time with her head and waved a little bit of stick, intoxicated by this noble music.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps a {{year before}} we {{returned}} to London, a Catholic friend brought me to a spiritualistic seance {{at the house of}} a young man who had been lately arrested under a suspicion of Fenianism, but had been released for lack of evidence. He and his friends had been sitting weekly about a table in the hope of spiritual manifestation and one had developed mediumship. A drawer full of books had leaped out of the table when no one was touching it, a picture had moved upon the wall. There were some half dozen of us, and our host began by making passes until the medium fell asleep sitting upright in his chair. Then the lights were turned out, and we sat waiting {{in the dim light of}} a fire. Presently my shoulders began to twitch and my hands. I could easily have stopped them, but I had never heard of such a thing and I was curious. After a few minutes the movement became violent and I stopped it. I sat motionless for a while and then my whole body moved like a suddenly unrolled watch-spring, and I was thrown backward on the wall. I again stilled the movement and sat at the table. Everybody began to say I was a medium, and that if I would not resist some wonderful thing would happen. I remembered that my father had told me that Balzac had once desired to take opium for the experience sake, but would not because he dreaded the surrender of his will. We were now holding each other's hands and presently my right hand banged the knuckles of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>next</b> to me upon the table. She laughed, and the medium, speaking for the first time, and with difficulty, out of his mesmeric sleep, said, [...] "tell her there is great danger." [...] He stood up and began walking round me, making movements with his hands as though he were pushing something away. I was now struggling vainly with this force which compelled me to movements I had not willed, and my movements had become so violent that the table was broken. I tried to pray, and because I could not remember a prayer, repeated in a loud voice ...|$|E
