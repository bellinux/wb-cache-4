5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as <b>thrips</b> is the {{possibility}} of being trapped by water. <b>Thrips</b> have non-wetting bodies and have the ability to ascend a meniscus by arching their bodies and working their way head-first and upwards along the water surface in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} small sizes and {{high rates of}} reproduction, <b>thrips</b> are {{difficult}} to control using classical biological control. Suitable predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where <b>thrips</b> hide while feeding, and they must also prey extensively on eggs and larvae to be effective. Only two families of parasitoid Hymenoptera parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other biocontrol agents of adults and larvae include anthocorid bugs of genus Orius, and phytoseiid mites. Biological insecticides such as the fungi Beauveria bassiana and Verticillium lecanii can kill <b>thrips</b> at all life-cycle stages. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against <b>thrips.</b> It is commercially available or can be made of certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult melon <b>thrips</b> occur when plants are illuminated with red light.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>thrips</b> are pests of {{commercial}} crops {{due to the}} damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop. Some <b>thrips</b> serve as vectors for plant diseases, such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by <b>thrips,</b> but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include the tomato spotted wilt virus and the impatiens necrotic spot viruses. The western flower <b>thrips,</b> Frankliniella occidentalis, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of plant diseases caused by tospoviruses. Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing globalization of trade and the growth of greenhouse agriculture, <b>thrips,</b> unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include F. occidentalis, <b>Thrips</b> simplex, and <b>Thrips</b> palmi.|$|E

In South Africa Triple Helix is driven {{under the name}} THRIP: The Technology and Human Resources for Industry Programme (<b>THRIP)</b> aims to boost South African Industry by supporting research and technology development, its success visible for the past 13 years – where industry is represented by various private companies and the government by the National Research Foundation (NRF). Various universities take part in this project. The paper consists of a theoretical study describing the <b>THRIP</b> process and {{the roles of the}} different role players. This is followed by an empirical study where 107 respondents from the population of everybody that have been involved in <b>THRIP</b> since its inception gave their ranking of the biggest beneficiaries from <b>THRIP</b> projects on a questionnaire.

5|$|The {{most obvious}} {{contribution}} that <b>thrips</b> make to their ecosystem is the damage {{they can cause}} during feeding. This impact may fall across a broad selection of prey items, as there is considerable breadth in host affinity across the order, and even within a species, varying degrees of fidelity to a described host remain. Family Thripidae in particular is notorious for members with broad host ranges, {{and the majority of}} pest <b>thrips</b> come from this family. For example, <b>Thrips</b> tabaci damages crops of onions, potatoes, tobacco, and cotton.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thrips</b> species Gynaikothrips australis {{feeds on}} the {{underside}} of new leaves of F. rubiginosa, as well as F. obliqua and F. macrophylla. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue and a gall results, and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The <b>thrips</b> begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and live for around six weeks. At other times, <b>thrips</b> reside on old leaves without feeding. The species pupates sheltered in the bark. The <b>thrips</b> remain in the galls at night, wander about in the daytime and return in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. Psyllids have almost defoliated trees in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney in spring.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thrips</b> (order Thysanoptera) are minute (most are 1mm long or less), slender insects with fringed {{wings and}} unique {{asymmetrical}} mouthparts. Different <b>thrips</b> species feed mostly on plants by puncturing and sucking up the contents, {{although a few}} are predators. Approximately 6,000 species have been described. They fly only weakly and their feathery wings are unsuitable for conventional flight; instead, <b>thrips</b> exploit an unusual mechanism, clap and fling, to create lift using an unsteady circulation pattern with transient vortices near the wings.|$|E
5000|$|Gladiolus <b>Thrip</b> (Mackenzie Crook): A preening, narcissistic and {{ruthless}} hit-man, <b>Thrip</b> is a Type 12 entity, {{the most powerful}} type of demon there is. He has a cockney accent and speaks in a very pompous, verbose manner. He possesses superhuman speed and strength and is immune to most forms of attack. Nevertheless, he possesses an arrogant belief in his invincibility which leads to his apparent destruction {{at the hands of}} Luke in the first episode. <b>Thrip</b> had no nose and wore an ivory beak in its place which survived the apparent destruction of his body. He later returns in the final episode, working to drive Luke and Galvin apart; however he is ultimately slain by Mina, who awakens her vampiric nature by drinking a vial of her own blood. Thanks to her vampiric sense, Mina realises that <b>Thrip</b> is a vampire (explaining why he did not die previously and why he was so difficult to kill). She later tears out his throat, as {{the only one who can}} kill a vampire is another vampire, causing his body to liquefy. <b>Thrip's</b> superhuman speed was a hint to his true nature, as vampires bear the same kind of superhuman speed as seen in 'Suckers'.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} insecticidal {{formulations}} were examined for their efficacy against {{a range of}} insects under laboratory conditions using a Potter Tower technique. The insecticides Yates Pyrethrum, Eco-oil, Defender, Orchex, Confidor, Agrimec, Encapsulated Pyrethrum, Encapsulated Pyrethrum and Neem, Azatin, NeemAzal, {{as well as a}} combination of the insecticides Azatin plus Eco-oil were tested at both the half as well as the full recommended field rate against a range of insect pests. In addition, the ability to synergise natural pyrethrum by {{some or all of the}} natural compounds including sesame oil, the crystalline extract of a sesame oil crude extract, dillapiole, and the synthetic synergist PBO, in spray emulsions at a variety of rates and ratios was examined in tests against the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, passionvine hopper (Scolypopa australis), greenhouse <b>thrip,</b> and lightbrown apple moth. Confidor and Yates Pyrethrum gave marked control (i. e. mortality > 80 %) of the greatest number of test species including the aphid, <b>thrip</b> and mealybug and two of the moth species for Confidor and all of the moth, aphid and <b>thrip</b> species for Yates Pyrethrum. It is suggested that the use of the synthetic synergist PBO could be replaced by the natural synergists including dillapiole, as well as the crystalline extract of a sesame oil crude extract at the highest ratio that was tested against the pea aphid, passionvine hopper, and lightbrown apple moth. Results with greenhouse <b>thrip</b> and tomato fruit worm were inconclusive. A complete summary of the results is given in abstract form for each of the three parts of this dissertation...|$|R

5|$|Most {{research}} has focused on <b>thrips</b> species that feed on economically significant crops. Some species are predatory, but most of them feed on pollen and the chloroplasts harvested from the outer layer of plant epidermal and mesophyll cells. They prefer tender parts of the plant, such as buds, flowers and new leaves. Besides feeding on plant tissues, the common blossom <b>thrips</b> feeds on pollen grains and on the eggs of mites. When the larva supplements its diet in this way, its development time and mortality is reduced, and adult females that consume mite eggs increase their fecundity and longevity.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} <b>thrips</b> create galls, almost always in leaf tissue. These may occur as curls, rolls or folds, or as {{alterations}} {{to the expansion}} of tissues causing distortion to leaf blades. More complex examples cause rosettes, pouches and horns. Most of these species occur in the tropics and sub-tropics, and the structures of the galls are diagnostic of the species involved. A radiation of <b>thrips</b> species seems to have taken place on Acacia trees in Australia; some of these species cause galls in the petioles, sometimes fixing two leaf stalks together, while other species live in every available crevice in the bark. In Casuarina in the same country, some species have invaded stems, creating long-lasting woody galls.|$|E
