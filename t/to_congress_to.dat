5|$|Beginning in 1880, {{in their}} annual reports, the Mint Director and Treasury Secretary appealed <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> {{discontinue}} the three-cent piece. The last three-cent pieces were struck in 1889, and the denomination was discontinued, {{along with the}} gold dollar and the three-dollar piece, by the Act of September 26, 1890. Many of the coins from 1888 and 1889 were still held at the Treasury Department and were melted after passage of the act, the fate of millions more as they flowed back from banks. The resultant metal contributed to large mintages of the Liberty Head nickel between 1890 and 1893.|$|E
5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 {{to cast their}} votes for the president. As the election occurred prior to ratification of the Twelfth Amendment, each elector cast two votes for the presidency, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person. Under the terms of the constitution, the individual who won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> be counted.|$|E
5|$|Smuggling off American coasts was {{an issue}} before the Revolutionary War, and after the Revolution it was more problematic. Along with smuggling, lack of {{shipping}} control, pirating, and a revenue unbalance were also major problems. In response, Hamilton proposed <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> enact a naval police force called revenue cutters in order to patrol the waters and assist the custom collectors with confiscating contraband. This idea was also proposed to assist in tariff controlling, boosting the American economy, and promote the merchant marine. It is thought that his experience obtained during his apprenticeship with Nicholas Kruger was influential in his decision-making.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood {{firmly on}} the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the {{government}} was required to coin under the Bland-Allison Act of 1878. Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> repeal this law before he was inaugurated. Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents. In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency. While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.|$|E
5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 {{to cast their}} votes for the president. As originally prescribed by Article II of the Constitution, each state chose a number of electors equal to its representation in Congress. Each elector then cast two votes for president, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person, and were prohibited from casting both their ballots for persons from their own state. The individual who won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> be counted. Adams received 34 electoral college votes in the presidential election of 1789, finishing in second place behind George Washington, who garnered 69 votes. As a result, Washington became the nation's first president, and Adams became the its first vice president.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} from office on December 1, 1794, giving Washington two months' notice, {{in the wake of}} his wife Eliza's miscarriage while he was absent during his armed repression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Before leaving his post on January 31, 1795, Hamilton submitted a Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> curb the debt problem. Hamilton grew dissatisfied with what he viewed as a lack of a comprehensive plan to fix the public debt. He wished to have new taxes passed with older ones made permanent and stated that any surplus from the excise tax on liquor would be pledged to lower public debt. His proposals were included into a bill by Congress within slightly over a month after his departure as treasury secretary. Some months later Hamilton resumed his law practice in New York to remain closer to his family.|$|E

Truman chose not to go <b>to</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>to</b> obtain additional statutory authorization for a seizure of the steel industry for the same reasons.
