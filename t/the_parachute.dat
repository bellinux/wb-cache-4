5|$|All {{parachute}} {{forces had}} {{to undergo a}} twelve-day parachute training course at No. 1 Parachute Training School, RAF Ringway.

5|$|After the war {{the brigade}} {{comprised}} the 1st, 2nd, 17th <b>Parachute</b> Battalions and <b>the</b> 16th (<b>Parachute)</b> Field Ambulance. <b>The</b> 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Battalion {{had left to}} join <b>the</b> 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Brigade, replacing <b>the</b> 1st Canadian <b>Parachute</b> Battalion, who had returned to Canada at the cessation of hostilities. The 1st Airborne Division was disbanded in November 1945, and the brigade assigned to the 6th Airborne Division in Palestine. In 1946 <b>the</b> 17th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion amalgamated with the 7th (Light Infantry) <b>Parachute</b> Battalion retaining <b>the</b> number of the senior unit.

5|$|The division's two {{parachute}} brigades, {{landing in}} the early hours of 6June, were scattered across the countryside during <b>the</b> <b>parachute</b> drop. Most of the battalions could only muster around sixty per cent or less of their total strength on the drop zones (DZ). They did carry out all of their objectives, however, before the 6th Airlanding Brigade arrived by gliders to reinforce them at 21:00 that evening.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} last mission—Operation Fustian—began at 19:30 on 12July, {{when the first}} {{aircraft}} carrying the 1st Parachute Brigade took off from North Africa. Following behind <b>the</b> <b>parachute</b> force were the glider-towing aircraft, comprising twelve Albemarles and seven Halifaxes, towing eleven Horsa and eight Waco gliders. The first glider casualties occurred on takeoff, when two aircraft towing Waco gliders crashed. While en route, one glider was released prematurely by its towing aircraft and crashed into the sea. Arriving over Sicily, having lost the element of surprise, four gliders were shot down by coastal anti-aircraft batteries. By the time the gliders arrived at their landing zones, two hours had lapsed {{since the start of}} <b>the</b> <b>parachute</b> landings. With the German defences alerted, only four Horsa gliders managed to land mostly intact, all the others being caught by German machine-gun fire and destroyed on their approach. The surviving Horsas had been carrying three of the brigade's anti-tank guns, which were now included in their defence of Primosole Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{reported}} seeing a parachute drifting {{away from the}} falling F-100F, leading to the hope that a pilot had ejected, but when <b>the</b> <b>parachute</b> was located it {{was determined to be}} a drag parachute that is meant to be deployed on landing to help slow the fighter down.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier Richard N. Gale, {{who would}} later command the 6th Airborne Division, took command of <b>the</b> 1st <b>Parachute</b> Brigade on its {{formation}} in September 1941. A triangular brigade formation with three battalions, Gale decided that rather than dividing the 11th Special Air Service Battalion among the brigade's battalions, he would keep the already trained unit together. On 15September it was renamed <b>the</b> 1st <b>Parachute</b> Battalion, which, together with the newly raised 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, now formed <b>the</b> 1st <b>Parachute</b> Brigade. These battalions were formed from volunteers aged between twenty-two and thirty-two years of age. Only men in infantry units were selected and only ten men from any one unit were allowed to leave. Early in 1942 the brigade was joined by <b>the</b> 4th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion, <b>the</b> 16th (<b>Parachute)</b> Field Ambulance, and <b>the</b> 1st (<b>Parachute)</b> Squadron, Royal Engineers (RE). <b>The</b> 4th <b>Parachute</b> Battalion left <b>the</b> brigade in July {{to become the first}} battalion in <b>the</b> 2nd <b>Parachute</b> Brigade.|$|R
50|$|After the war {{the brigade}} {{comprised}} the 1st, 2nd, 17th <b>Parachute</b> Battalions and <b>the</b> 16th (<b>Parachute)</b> Field Ambulance. <b>The</b> 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Battalion {{had left to}} join <b>the</b> 3rd <b>Parachute</b> Brigade, replacing <b>the</b> 1st Canadian <b>Parachute</b> Battalion, who had returned to Canada at the cessation of hostilities.

5|$|After 24 hours, only 2,500 {{men of the}} 101st and 2,000 of the 82nd Airborne {{were under}} the control of their divisions, {{approximately}} a third of the force dropped. This wide dispersal had the effect of confusing the Germans and fragmenting their response. The 7th Army received notification of <b>the</b> <b>parachute</b> drops at 01:20, but Rundstedt did not initially believe that a major invasion was underway. The destruction of radar stations along the Normandy coast in the week before the invasion meant that the Germans did not detect the approaching fleet until 02:00.|$|E
5|$|At 17:30 {{a flight}} of Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 190s {{attacked}} the Orne bridgehead, causing {{little in the way}} of any damage. Soon afterward, Royal Air Force Short Stirling bombers arrived to carry out a parachute resupply for the division. Included in <b>the</b> <b>parachute</b> drop were 6 pounder anti-tank guns, which until then had always been delivered by glider. Some forty-one of the 9th Parachute Battalion's missing men arrived at their position at 21:00, bringing the battalion strength up to around 200 men.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War all the British Army, Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, {{and some}} Royal Marines Commandos were disbanded, leaving only three Royal Marines Commandos and one brigade (with {{supporting}} Army elements). As of 2010 the British Commando force is 3 Commando Brigade, which consists of both Royal Marines and British Army components, as well as commando-trained personnel from the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.

During the Algerian War, <b>the</b> 9th <b>Parachute</b> Chasseur Regiment relieved <b>the</b> 1st <b>Parachute</b> Chasseur Regiment (1er RCP) and became part of <b>the</b> 25th <b>Parachute</b> Division. <b>The</b> regiment didn’t take part in the 1961 Algiers Putsch.
