40|$|Despite {{substantial}} evidence that {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) is influenced by taxation, the impact of bilateral <b>tax</b> <b>treaties</b> on FDI is surprisingly unclear. We provide a simple theoretical framework illustrating why the impact of <b>tax</b> <b>treaties</b> may be heterogeneous across the distribution of FDI, and thus why focusing on the average effect of <b>tax</b> <b>treaties</b> may be misleading. We then assess the empirical relevance of such heterogeneity by estimating the quantile treatment effects (QTEs) of <b>tax</b> <b>treaties</b> on US inbound and outbound FDI using panel data from 1980 [...] 1999. Our results are striking, and consistent with our expectations. We obtain positive effects of <b>tax</b> <b>treaties</b> at lower quantiles {{of the distribution of}} FDI, but negative effects in the upper quantiles. Moreover, while the negative effects are substantially larger in absolute terms relative to the positive effects, the two effects are roughly equivalent in percentage terms.

25|$|The {{bilateral}} <b>tax</b> <b>treaty</b> {{negotiated with}} Canada {{in particular has}} been a political-football for the government of that country. The treaty was made to allow the profits for IBCs and offshore banking companies to be repatriated to Canada tax-free after paying taxes in Barbados. The aim was mainly for companies like the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), and Scotiabank, which (along with Barclays of the United Kingdom), when-combined control a healthy majority of Barbados' local Commercial Banking sector. In essence the treaty makes the economy of Barbados almost an unofficial part of the Canadian economy and it was aimed at allowing Canadian companies to extract profits back to Canada more easily. During the Canadian national elections of 2003 and 2006, it was cited that the former Minister of Finance and later Prime Minister Paul Martin had international shipping companies that operated in Barbados' offshore sector under the bilateral treaty possibly saving his company from higher taxes in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Benefits versus cost. The {{intention}} of locating US persons and their non-US financial accounts was to increase tax {{revenues from the}} interest, dividends, and gains of those assets. The majority of assets located was expected be the international equivalent of standard checking and savings accounts, where the applicable interest was less than 0.5% during 2015. The majority of that income is already (by <b>tax</b> <b>treaty)</b> attributable to the country where it resides. (IRS Form 1116 is normally used to credit foreign taxes upon passive income.) Another source from which FATCA intends to raise revenue is {{in the identification of}} a wider population of US persons. However, the majority (82%) of overseas US persons filing owe no tax to the US (due to tax treaties). At the congressional hearing on 26 April 2017, Congressman Mark Meadows stated that according to FATCA's drafters themselves, FATCA would, at most, reduce tax evasion by less than 1% (i.e. recoup less than $1billion out of an estimated $100billion in lost revenue). In contrast, he said, normal enforcement activities create a return of $20 for every $1 spent. Because $200million is being spent to implement FATCA in FY2017, the IRS commissioner’s own estimates show that just shifting the money from FATCA to general enforcement would increase tax revenues by over $1billion.|$|E

A key determinant for these patterns is the relative size of bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI) activity. In plausible situations, more asymmetric countries will negotiate <b>treaties</b> with higher <b>tax</b> rates. This theory is then tested using 1992 data from U.
