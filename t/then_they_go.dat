25|$|The Rainbow Sash Movement covers two {{separate}} organizations created by and advanced by practicing LGBT Catholics {{who believe they}} should be able to receive Holy Communion. It has been most active in the United States, England, and Australia. The Rainbow Sash itself is a strip of a rainbow colored fabric which is worn over the left shoulder and is put on at the beginning of the Liturgy. The members go up to receive Eucharist. If denied, they go back to pews and remain standing, but if the Eucharist is received <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> back to the pew and kneel in the traditional way. Cardinal Francis Arinze, Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, said that members of the Rainbow Sash Movement disqualified themselves from Communion by making reception of it a display of opposition to the Church's teaching, while Archbishop Harry Joseph Flynn, when head of the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, said that the decision to take Communion lay with individual Catholics as to their state of grace and freedom from mortal sin, but that receiving Communion should not be used as a protest. The movement in Illinois also planned to hold in a cathedral prayer for legalization of same-sex marriage, an initiative that Bishop Paprocki of Springfield called blasphemous.|$|E

[...] "Tornado Tommy" [...] drives around the city filming tornadoes and is oblivious to another tornado that is headed to his direction.

After Amy's cameraman is injured while rescuing her sister-in-law, Harkin stays behind with him and their neighbor. The others rush to reach the airport during the 15-minute eye of the hurricane, where they are picked up in a plane piloted by Harkin's brother, an air force weather pilot. After the storm passes, Harkin keeps her promise and tells London's story on air.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} {{recorded}} at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco on December 7, 2001. War at the Warfield was Slayer's second DVD. Originally set for release on February 11, 2003, and later February 13, 2003, it was delayed several times, due to unspecified [...] "production issues". However, on May 20, 2003, {{it was announced}} that the release would be on June 17, 2003, only to be pushed back once again to July 27. Before the DVD's release, Tom Araya commented, [...] "I don't think it's different than any other Slayer show, you got your kids doing the mosh stuff. They get crazy, they tear the place up. And then you get the one kid that's tempted to jump off the balcony. Whether he does it or not is another story. When they do, of course they get hurt, but they always insist on staying so they can watch the rest of the show, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to the emergency room." [...] On July 25, 2003, four days before its release, MTV announced the DVD's contents.|$|E
2500|$|Tressel {{brought to}} the Buckeye {{football}} program two pre-game traditions he developed at Youngstown State. Prior to its warmup routine before every football game, the team exits the locker room as a unit in a controlled manner, linked arm-in-arm in a group known as [...] "The Hive". After warmups the team returns to the locker room, and when it next appears, runs onto the field and forms a circle of players around the strength coach, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> through their warmup routine.|$|E
2500|$|Charlie's Angels was {{generally}} formatted {{in the way}} of a procedural drama much like the vast majority of other crime shows of the era. Many of the episodes follow a regular structure whereby a crime is committed, the 'Angels' are given the case details, and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> undercover to solve the crime. Inevitably, the final scene takes place back at the Townsend office with Charlie offering his congratulations for a job well done. Most episodes have stand-alone plots and are usually not referenced in future episodes. As such, cast changes notwithstanding, it's possible to view the episodes in any order (the first regular episode filmed, [...] "The Killing Kind," [...] was the sixth to be broadcast).|$|E

2500|$|For {{members of}} all World Class corps {{and the most}} {{competitive}} Open Class corps, the activity is a full-time summer commitment. [...] Members travel from show site to show site, performing in competitions and parades across North America nearly non-stop until the DCI Championships. Corps travel by coach buses in convoy with semi-trailer trucks holding equipment and field kitchens. Once on the road, members generally sleep on the buses as the corps travels at night, and in sleeping bags on school gym floors when their next destination is reached. [...] The corps practice their shows {{for as long as}} the schedule allows during the day, and <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to the stadium for the local competition. [...] After each show is over, the cycle repeats, with only a few breaks in the cycle for laundry days and an occasional free day for relaxation.|$|E
2500|$|These merchants speak Arabic, Persian, Roman, the Frank, Spanish, and Slav languages. They {{journey from}} West to East, from East to West, partly on land, partly by sea. They {{transport}} from the West eunuchs, female slaves, boys, brocade, castor, marten and other furs, and swords. They take ship from Firanja (France), on the Western Sea, and make for Farama (Pelusium). There they load their goods on camel-back and go by land to al-Kolzum (Suez), {{a distance of}} twenty-five farsakhs. They embark in the East Sea and sail from al-Kolzum to al-Jar and al-Jeddah, <b>then</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to Sind, India, and China. On their return from China they carry back musk, aloes, camphor, cinnamon, and other products of the Eastern countries to al-Kolzum and {{bring them back to}} Farama, where they again embark on the Western Sea. Some make sail for Constantinople to sell their goods to the Romans; others go to the palace of the King of the Franks to place their goods. Sometimes these Jew merchants, when embarking from the land of the Franks, on the Western Sea, make for Antioch (at the head of the Orontes River); thence by land to al-Jabia (al-Hanaya {{on the bank of the}} Euphrates), where they arrive after three daysâ€™ march. [...] There they embark on the Euphrates and reach Baghdad, whence they sail down the Tigris, to al-Obolla. From al-Obolla they sail for Oman, Sindh, Hind, and China.|$|E
