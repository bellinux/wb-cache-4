500|$|Kinsler was {{mentioned}} as an MVP candidate before his injury by writers at ESPN, the Dallas News, the Los Angeles Times, and the Washington Post. He could have conceivably rivaled Pedroia for MVP, {{if not for}} the sports hernia that cut his 2008 campaign short a month and a half. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> missed having an MVP year", manager Ron Washington said. [...] "If luck [...] on our side and he [...] healthy, he would have run away with it." [...] In the end, he received a single 10th-place vote from Jeff Wilson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.|$|E
500|$|When {{the shoot}} ended, Abrams gave the cast small boxes {{containing}} little telescopes, which {{allowed them to}} read the name of each constellation it was pointed at. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> wanted {{each of us to}} look at the stars a little differently," [...] said John Cho. After the shoot, Abrams cut out some scenes of Kirk and Spock as children, including seeing the latter as a baby, as well as a subplot involving Nero being imprisoned by the Klingons and his escape: this explanation for his absence during Kirk's life confused many to whom Abrams screened the film. Other scenes cut out explained that the teenage Kirk stole his stepfather's antique car because he had forced him to clean it before an auction; and that the Orion he seduced at the Academy worked in the operations division. Afterwards, she agrees to open the e-mail containing his patch that allows him to pass the Kobayashi Maru test.|$|E
2500|$|An {{unidentified}} {{source said}} interrogations with Roof {{after his arrest}} determined he had been planning the attack for around six months, researched Emanuel AME Church, and targeted it because of its role in African-American history. One of the friends who briefly hid Roof's gun from him said, [...] "I don't think the church was his primary target because {{he told us he}} was going for the school. But I think he couldn't get into the school because of the security ... so I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> settled for the church." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, indeed. All the same, I like Lord Fawn extremely," [...] said Madame Goesler, [...] "and I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> the man {{to marry}} Lady Eustace. He's always at his office or at the House." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> as lovely {{as he can}} live!" [...] said Mela, as {{she stood}} a moment with her sister on the scene of her triumph, where the others had left them after the {{departure}} of their guests.|$|R
2500|$|Several tracks {{refer to}} Edwards' {{time in a}} couple of {{hospitals}} in 1994. Among them is [...] "She Bathed Herself in a Bath of Bleach", of which James Dean Bradfield said to the NME: [...] "There're some people he met when he was in one of the two places having treatment and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> digested other people's stories and experiences." [...] The final track, [...] "William's Last Words", has been compared to a suicide note, and although Nicky Wire rejects this suggestion, Bradfield observes, [...] "you can draw some pretty obvious conclusions from the lyrics." [...] Wire, who admitted finding the task of editing this song [...] "pretty choking", eventually composed the music and sang lead vocals after Bradfield found himself unsuited to the task.|$|E
2500|$|His down-to-earth manner was {{attested to}} by a White House butler who {{recalled}} that, {{on a visit}} in 1979, Philip had engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation, and poured them drinks. As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking, Philip is noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny, or as gaffes: awkward, [...] politically incorrect or even offensive, but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background. In {{an address to the}} General Dental Council in 1960, he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: [...] "Dontopedalogy  is  the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years." [...] Later in life he suggested his comments {{may have contributed to the}} perception that he is [...] "a cantankerous old sod". The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of [...] "HRH Victor Meldrew". For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, [...] "No wonder you are deaf listening to this row." [...] Later Philip wrote, [...] "The story is largely invention. It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that I would do any such thing." [...] When he and the Queen met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by an IRA bomb, and the Queen enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: [...] "Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing". Menary later said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> tries to put people at ease by trying to make a joke. I certainly didn't take any offence." [...] During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, [...] "If you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed." [...] The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go [...] "round-eyed". His comment had no effect on Sino-British relations, but it shaped his own reputation.|$|E

5000|$|New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, {{a self-proclaimed}} Dallas Cowboys fan, has {{frequently}} slammed the Philadelphia Eagles, {{one of the}} Cowboy's biggest rivals. In early 2017, Christie hastily generalized Philadelphia fans, calling them [...] "angry, awful people," [...] and said Citizens Bank Park, {{the home of the}} Philadelphia Phillies, [...] "is not safe for civilized people." [...] Kenney went on a local sports talk radio program to respond to Christie's claims. [...] "He's got the biggest 'L' on his forehead of anybody in the country," [...] Kenney said on SportsRadio 94.1. [...] "He ran for president for one hot-mess minute and then when that was over he was moon-dogging Trump thinking {{he was going to get}} a big job," [...] Kenney said. [...] "Now I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> bitter and has got nowhere to go. Who's going to hire him? I <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> done," [...] Kenney said.

We've always acted with her as if we thought she was {{different}} from other girls, and he behaves to {{her as if she}} was just like all of them, just as silly, and just as weak, and it pleases her, and flatters her; she likes it." ...|$|R

5000|$|Actor Victor Webster {{has said}} of his character, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> loves life, he loves love. I think he's very charming and easy-going and lighthearted. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> {{generally}} enjoys being around people and really helping people." [...] He says he was chosen for the part because he displays many of those traits himself. However, he also claimed that playing [...] "the perfect guy" [...] {{was something of a}} struggle, [...] "Coop is extremely confident. He knows all about love and relationships, and the problem with a guy who's so sure of himself is that you can play him very cocky and arrogant, and that can be somewhat off-putting." [...] The actor explains that falling in love takes a great deal of humility, and that required him to bring a self-deprecating quality to his performance: [...] "you learn about your faults and how to overcome them if the relationship means that much to you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Levin {{met with}} President Donald Trump on March 7 in the Oval Office and chatted {{for an hour}} [...] Levin [...] "just really likes {{powerful}} people, and he really likes having friends who are powerful, and who better than the President of the United States?

5000|$|When Kennedy {{decided not}} to run for reelection in 2010, he cited his {{decision}} on the fact that his life [...] "has taken a new direction". Mark Weiner, a major Democratic fundraiser in Rhode Island and one of Kennedy's top financial backers, said [...] "It's tough {{to get up and go}} to work every day when your partner is not there, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> had a broken heart after his father passed away." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, Wright named John Leslie live on air as the {{television}} presenter being {{linked to the}} alleged rape of Ulrika Jonsson. Wright subsequently claimed he couldn't remember blurting out Leslie's name during the show. In a Sky 1 show, John Leslie: My Year of Hell, Wright offered John Leslie an apology. Leslie confirmed he wouldn't sue Wright, claiming: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> made a really big mistake and unfortunately I was the one paying the price." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song {{opens with}} an African-style drum beat by Brian Downey, which {{gives way to}} twin-guitar harmonies {{characteristic}} of Thin Lizzy's sound. The lyrics include heavy use of rhyme and alliteration, such as the first three lines which include the words 'investigate', 'insinuate', 'intimidate', 'complicate', 'wait', 'hesitate', 'state', 'fate' and 'awaits'. The song fades out with lead singer Phil Lynott doing an impersonation of Elvis Presley which seemed to {{have little to do}} with the meaning of the song. Guitarist Scott Gorham suggested, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> wanted to use his American accent there." ...|$|E

5000|$|Iggy Pop spent a {{good deal}} of time in the studio with Bowie and the band while the album was being recorded, stating [...] "I worked {{extensively}} on that album. There's a lot more work there than is reflected in just the simple co-writing credit for two songs and some of the old stuff." [...] When asked why Bowie included so much Pop-written material on the album, Pop could only guess.

In fact, he's {{one of the}} more accomplished and well-rounded jazz guitarists of our day. Most know him as a supremely tasteful accompanist to singers such as Michael Bublé, Eric Comstock and Freddy Cole (Nat's younger brother). But his penchant for bluesy soul-jazz comes through on his latest, The Jukebox Crowd, a sextet affair with Hammond organ and plenty o' horns. He can also cut it in lean and modern post-bop settings, judging from organist Jared Gold's 2008 smoker Solids & Stripes." ...|$|R
