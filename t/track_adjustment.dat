According to the characteristics of high stalk crops planted in different row spacing in the plain area of Henan province, this paper designed a full hydraulic driving field high frame operation vehicle, included power system, engine placement and M type three-wheeled high frame structure. It also adopted a closed hydraulic system fully driven by three hydraulic motors, hydraulic power steering system and hydraulic <b>track</b> <b>adjustment</b> system. Its maximum clearance height is 1, 800 mm. Speed ranges from 0 - 17 km/h with the hydraulic control. The back wheel <b>track</b> <b>adjustment</b> ranges from 2, 000 - 2, 400 mm.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{requirement for}} unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) is the collision avoidance (CA) capability to meet safety and flexibility issues {{in an environment}} of increasing air traffic densities. This paper proposes two efficient algorithms: conflict detection (CD) algorithm and conflict resolution (CR) algorithm. These two algorithms are the key components of the cooperative multi-UAV CA system. The CD sub-module analyzes the spatial-temporal information of four dimensional (4 D) Departament de Telecomunicació i Enginyeria de Sistemes trajectory to detect potential collisions. The CR sub-module calculates the minimum deviation of the planned trajectory by an objective function integrated with <b>track</b> <b>adjustment,</b> distance, and time costs, taking into account the vehicle performance, state and separation constraints. Additionally, we extend the CR sub-module with causal analysis to generate all possible solution states in order to select the optimal strategy for a multi-threat scenario, considering the potential interactions among neighboring UAVs with a global scope of a cluster. Quantitative simulation experiments are conducted to validate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed CA system, as well as to test its efficiency with variable parameters...|$|E
30|$|A {{consistent}} {{high precision}} and high resolution gravity {{model in the}} north-east Atlantic off Iberia peninsula using multi-source gravity data, ship-borne and satellite derived gravity anomalies, is presented. A solution strategy based on least squares optimal interpolation was used to assimilate into a coherent gravity model, gravity data with different spectral and spatial resolutions. Satellite derived gravity anomalies from KMS 02 model, with an error covariance of 25 mGal 2, and marine data carefully edited and validated by bias crossover error adjustment, were used in this study. The observation error variance was determined from ship-borne <b>track</b> <b>adjustment</b> and assigned an independent value for each track determined from error variance propagation. Unbiased ship-borne gravity observations were assimilated into the satellite derived gravity KMS 02 model by the least squares optimal interpolation algorithm (OI) with bias removed by applying a regional bias to all ship tracks (OI-b) and alternatively by constraining all ship tracks to KMS 02 using bias and tilt (OI-t). External error of the model was determined by comparing with recent surveys and it was verified that OI-t approach improved the final gravity model to an accuracy of about 3 mGal. The effect of different merging approaches on geoid solution was also evaluated and it was verified that the merging process can contribute to improve the geoid accuracy up to 4 cm with the OI-t approach.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{helicopter}} rotor {{systems are}} designed with non-metallic composite materials for fatigue strength and low radar signature for reduced observability. They incorporate non-metallic composite blades and non-metallic tracking tabs. Adjustment of the existing non-metallic tracking tabs is complex and inefficient since it requires heating and cooling a thermoplastic tab material for each <b>track</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Several track-tab adjustments are required until optimum tracking is achieved. In this paper, a method for achieving direct in-flight incremental adjustment of the tracking tab is presented. The method utilizes a special tab material that can be remotely activated by the pilot from the cabin while in forward flight. This material is a composite consisting of shape memory alloy (SMA) wires embedded into a polymeric matrix. The activation of the SMA composite tab is done through electric current controlled from the pilot cabin and sent through conductors along the blade to the tracking tab. The proposed method will achieve in-flight tracking tab adjustment, will minimize the adjustment cycles and will reduce by at least a factor of ten the total tracking time. The implementation of the proposed incrementally adjustable in-flight tracking tab will rapidly minimize the once-per-rev helicopter vibration forward flight. This will lead to reduced crew fatigue, increased component life, and reduced maintenance for the helicopter. Additionally, the proposed method will also be serve as emergency system to reduce unbalanced vibrations due to ballistic damage of the rotor blade...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to climate}} change, drier summers have been {{observed}} over {{the last ten years}} in Mediterranean areas. Increasing drought levels may have a different weight in influencing the stomatal versus photosynthetic activity of forests, altering the water-use efficiency (i. e. i. e. i. e., WUE, the amount of carbon gain per water lost) and, consequently, the global carbon balance. By combining leaf gas exchanges and leaf carbon/oxygen isotope measurements, we tested under Mediterranean conditions a semi-quantitative dual isotope model to <b>track</b> <b>adjustments</b> in stomatal conductance (gs) and maximum CO 2 assimilation at saturating light (Amaxmaxmax) in response to changes in air and soil water availability. The experiment was established at Allumiere site (Rome, Italy) over the course of two consecutive years. There, we modified the amount of precipitation reaching the soil on water depleted (D) and watered (W) replicate plots (~ 100 m 2) of an Arbutus unedoArbutus unedoArbutus unedoArbutus unedoArbutus unedoArbutus unedoArbutus unedoArbutus unedoArbutus unedoArbutus unedoArbutus unedoArbutus unedoArbutus unedo L. forest using a system of rain gutters and sprinklers, respectively. Changes in soil water availability affected gs and Amaxmaxmax in parallel. As an application of the model, we found that, in response to reduced air and soil water availability, constant carbon (δ 1313 C) and increasing oxygen (δ 1818 O) isotope values were consistent with a parallel decline of either gs and Amaxmaxmax. As a result of parallel decline, WUE did not differ or only slightly differed between treatments, in contrast with most of the studies that found a wide-spread increase of WUE in response to enhanced drought.

The results indicate that females were located at significantly lower rates than males. As expected, sample members with lower cognitive abilities were among the hardest-to-reach subpopulations.

The power system for Space Station Freedom is such a structure. Each array consists of a deployable truss mast and a split blanket of photo-voltaic solar collectors.

50|$|In the {{original}} system, {{as applied to}} 625 line analogue TV, the audio signal was sampled twice during each television line and each sample converted to 10-bit PCM.

Compandors operating on the signal before encoding and after decoding enabled the required signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved. As the PCM noise was predominantly high-pitched, the compandor only needed to operate on the high frequencies. Also, the compandor only operated at high audio levels, so that modulation of the noise by the companding would be masked by the relatively loud high-frequency audio components.
