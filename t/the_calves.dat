5|$|The water bull {{is said to}} {{reproduce}} with standard cattle, the resulting progeny distinguishable by {{the small size of}} their ears. According to some myths, <b>the</b> <b>calves</b> of water bulls and ordinary cows ought to be killed at birth by any method other than drowning– they cannot be killed by drowning– to avoid bringing disaster to the herd. Conversely, in northern areas <b>the</b> <b>calves</b> are considered to be of superior quality.|$|E
5|$|Males, {{females and}} juveniles each form {{separate}} social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together {{and search for}} food or water sources. The female group is much larger and covers greater areas. They travel the grassy plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex linear hierarchy. The nursery and juvenile group is naturally formed when females give birth to calves. After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. <b>The</b> <b>calves</b> start befriending each other and stay back in the nursery group while the mother returns to the female group. <b>The</b> <b>calves</b> leave the nursery group when they {{are at least two}} years old and join a male or female group.|$|E
5|$|According to Celtic mythology scholar James MacKillop, because <b>the</b> <b>calves</b> {{of water}} bulls and {{ordinary}} cows might bring disaster to the herd, {{they are supposed}} to be killed at birth; it is impossible to kill them by drowning, so other methods have to be used. Conversely, stories published in 1937 by the clergyman George Sutherland suggest these hybrids are considered to be of superior quality to normal pedigree cattle in the far north of Scotland.|$|E
50|$|There are {{currently}} several concepts {{upon which to}} base a predictive law.

40|$|The {{population}} {{trajectory of}} woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in Newfoundland is currently determined by low calf survival {{due to high}} predation rates during the first 6 - 8 weeks after parturition. Most caribou in Newfoundland congregate and give birth in open calving grounds; consequently, in order to investigate predator-prey interactions, design research, and develop mitigation strategies, the geographic extent of <b>the</b> caribou <b>calving</b> grounds must be properly identified. We used VHF telemetry locations of caribou calves, collected from 2003 - 2010, to determine the spatial and temporal extent of caribou calving grounds in three study areas in Newfoundland. We put GPS collars on 47 black bears (Ursus americanus) in 3 caribou ranges where bears are having {{a significant impact on}} caribou recruitment by preying on <b>calves</b> during <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> season. Bear movements were greatest during <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> season, potentially increasing encounters with calves. Some bears migrated to <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> grounds just prior to caribou parturition, indicating deliberate broad-scale selection of areas of high calf density. Bears displayed interannual fidelity to calving ground usage patterns during <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> season, with some bears using <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> grounds every year, while others did not. We estimated the probability of a bear spending time in <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> grounds during <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> season {{as a function of the}} bear’s sex and mean distance to <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> grounds with logistic regression. We found that as distance increased, the odds of a bear spending time in <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> grounds decreased, and that at any given distance the odds were greater for male bears than for female bears. Our results indicate that some bears in Newfoundland are likely caribou calf predators, while others are not, and that the sex and broad-scale distribution of bears influenced the probability of a bear participating in calf predation during <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> season. <b>The</b> probability distribution of calf-visiting bears could be used to develop management practices to mitigate the impact of bear predation on declining caribou herds in Newfoundland...|$|R
5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with high protein and low fiber content. This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. The social structure of the bohor reedbuck is highly flexible. Large aggregations are observed during the dry season, when hundreds of bohor reedbuck assemble near a river. Males become sexually mature {{at the age of}} three to four years, while females can conceive at just one year of age, reproducing every nine to fourteen months. Though there is no fixed breeding season, mating peaks in the rainy season. The gestation period is seven and a half months long, after which a single calf is born. <b>The</b> <b>calves</b> are weaned at eight to nine months of age.|$|E
5|$|An 18th-century account {{suggests}} that females {{might have left}} their newborn calves in isolation and returned regularly to suckle them until <b>the</b> <b>calves</b> {{were old enough to}} join herds, which is similar to the behaviour of roan and sable antelopes. Akin to other grazing antelopes, the bluebuck probably calved mainly where rainfall, and thus the availability of grasses, peaked. Such locations could be the western margin of the CFR during winter and the eastern margin of the CFR during summer. Faith et al. 2013 found that the occurrence of juveniles in bluebuck fossils decreases linearly from the west to the east, indicating that most births took place in the western CFR; due to the preference for rainfall, it may be further assumed that most births occurred during winter, when the western CFR receives most of its rainfall. The annual west-to-east migration would have followed in summer, consistent with the greater number of adult juveniles in the east that would have joined herds. Juvenile fossils also occur in other places across the range, but appear to be concentrated in the western CFR.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect <b>the</b> <b>calves</b> from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E

50|$|The flow of icebergs from <b>the</b> <b>calved</b> {{glacier tongue}} {{has reduced the}} {{effectiveness}} of the polynya west of Mertz Glacier that acted as one of Antarctica's major areas for the formation of dense Antarctic Bottom Water. <b>The</b> <b>calving</b> could affect future thermohaline circulation around Antarctica.|$|R
25|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{is a force}} imbalance at <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> front due to thinning causing a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces at <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> front propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, reducing frictional back forces, as the glacier becomes more afloat at <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> front. <b>The</b> reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows {{for an increase in}} velocity. This is akin to letting off the emergency brake a bit. The reduced resistive force at <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> front is then propagated up-glacier via longitudinal extension because of the backforce reduction. For ice streaming sections of large outlet glaciers (in Antarctica as well) there is always water {{at the base of the}} glacier that helps lubricate the flow.|$|R
5|$|In East Africa, {{the blue}} {{wildebeest}} {{is the most}} abundant big game species; some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds, but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic. Breeding in both takes place over {{a short period of}} time at the end of the rainy season and <b>the</b> <b>calves</b> are soon active and are able to move with the herd, a fact necessary for their survival. Nevertheless, some fall prey to large carnivores, especially the spotted hyena. Wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra which gives heightened awareness of potential predators. They are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons. Wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle. Some illegal hunting goes on but the population trend is fairly stable and some populations are in national parks or on private land. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both as least-concern species.|$|E
5|$|In sculpture, Revanta {{is often}} {{depicted}} with the Guhyakas, whose chief he is, in scenes of hunting. Apart from the attributes described in texts like the sword, bow; he sometimes also carries {{a cup of}} wine in his hand. Revanta is often depicted wearing long boots reaching up to <b>the</b> <b>calves,</b> unlike other Hindu divinities – except Surya – who are depicted barefoot. Revanta is depicted seated on a horse and accompanied by a hunting dog. Revanta's attendants are depicted with various hunting weapons like lances and swords. Some of them are shown blowing a conch or beaming drums or holding an umbrella {{over the head of}} their lord, the umbrella being the symbol of royalty. Also, some of them are depicted as flying or holding wine or water jars. Sometimes, an attendant carries a dead boar in his shoulder or the dog chasing a boar.|$|E
5|$|Most mysticetes reside at the poles. So, {{to prevent}} the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they migrate to calving/mating grounds. They will then stay there for {{a matter of months}} until the calf has {{developed}} enough blubber to survive the bitter temperatures of the poles. Until then, <b>the</b> <b>calves</b> will feed on the mother's fatty milk. With the exception of the humpback whale, it is largely unknown when whales migrate. Most will travel from the Arctic or Antarctic into the tropics to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will migrate back to the poles in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the mother can continue eating, as they fast in the breeding grounds. One exception to this is the southern right whale, which migrates to Patagonia and western New Zealand to calve; both are well out of the tropic zone.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{mechanism}} is a [...] "Jakobshavn effect", coined by Terry Hughes, {{where a small}} imbalance of forces caused by some perturbation can cause a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces at <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> front propagates up-glacier.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} four ice-shelf characteristics in the area close to <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> front: ice flow speed, strain rate, ice thickness and shelf width. Data are compiled for these glaciological parameters at <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> fronts of 22 Antarctic ice shelves. Clarification concerning the viscous supply of ice to <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> front is sought following <b>the</b> empirical <b>calving</b> law of Alley and others (2008), derived from a similar but smaller dataset, and the scaling analysis of Hindmarsh (2012). The dataset is analysed and good agreement is observed between the expected theoretical scaling and geophysical data for the flow of ice near <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> front in <b>the</b> case of ice shelves that are laterally confined and have uniform rheology. The lateral confinement ensures flow is aligned in the along-shelf direction, and uniform rheological parameters mean resistance to flow is provided by near-stationary ice in the grounded margins. In other cases, the velocity is greater than predicted, which we attribute to marginal weakening or the presence of ice tongues...|$|R
5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of <b>the</b> <b>calves,</b> or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum is one {{of several}} {{poisonous}} members of the genus Tricholoma; its large size, fleshy appearance, and pleasant smell and taste add to the risk of it being accidentally consumed. It was responsible for over 20 percent of cases of mushroom poisoning in Switzerland {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Many cases of poisoning arise in the Jura Mountains. Eating it causes highly unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea. These arise 15minutes to 2hours after consumption and often persist for several hours; complete recovery usually takes 4 to 6 days. Sweating and anxiety may be evident, and disturbance in liver function has been recorded. Cramping may occur in <b>the</b> <b>calves.</b> In one case, seven people and a cat suffered severe symptoms after sharing a meal that contained only two mushroom caps. The toxin, the identity of which is unknown, appears to cause a sudden inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the stomach and intestines.|$|E
5|$|When hunting larger animals, tigers {{prefer to}} bite the throat and use their {{powerful}} forelimbs {{to hold onto the}} prey, often simultaneously wrestling it to the ground. The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its target dies of strangulation. By this method, gaurs and water buffaloes weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much. Although they can kill healthy adults, tigers often select <b>the</b> <b>calves</b> or infirm of very large species. Healthy adult prey of this type can be dangerous to tackle, as long, strong horns, legs and tusks are all potentially fatal to the tiger. No other extant land predator routinely takes on prey this large on their own. Whilst hunting sambars, which comprise up to 60% of their prey in India, tigers have reportedly made a passable impersonation of the male sambar's rutting call to attract them.|$|E

40|$|Data on lactational and {{reproductive}} performances for 1993 and 1994 of dairy cows which calved in autumn or in spring on eight commercial winter milk supply farms around Palmerston North were collected. The eight commercial winter milk supply herds had a calving spread condensed into autumn and spring seasons. There were 7689 calvings recorded involving 3787 cows. The lactational parameters measured were yields of milk fat and milk protein per lactation, and days in milk (DIM) per cow. The mean milk fat production for <b>the</b> autumn <b>calved</b> cows was 206 kg/cow and 166 kg milk protein/cow (372 kg milk solids) per lactation while <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows produced 199 kg milk fat/cow and 160 kg milk protein/cow (359 kg milk solids) per lactation. The mean lactation length (DIM) for <b>the</b> autumn <b>calved</b> cows was 282 days, while <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows {{had a mean}} lactation length of 258 days (P< 0. 05). The mean daily milk fat yield averaged across the days in milk was 0. 73 kg per cow for <b>the</b> autumn <b>calved</b> cows while <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows had a mean daily milk fat yield of 0. 77 kg/cow (P< 0. 05). The mean values of milk production {{in the second and}} third months of lactation were 18 litres per day and 17 litres per day for <b>the</b> autumn <b>calved</b> cows while spring calved cows produced 22 litres per day during the second month of lactation and 19 litres per day during the third month of lactation respectively. The reproductive parameters measured were calving interval (CI), 4 weeks submission rates (SR), 42 day non-return rates (NNR), services per conception, 4 week calving rates and empty rates. <b>The</b> autumn <b>calved</b> cows had a longer CI than <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows; 390 days vs 372 days (P< 0. 05). <b>The</b> autumn <b>calved</b> cows had a lower average 4 weeks SR than <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows; 71 % vs 81 % (P< 0. 05). <b>The</b> autumn <b>calved</b> cows had a lower average 42 day NNR (conception rate) than <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows; 55 % vs 64 % (P< 0. 05). <b>The</b> autumn <b>calved</b> cows had a higher average of services per conception than <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows; 1. 9 vs 1. 6 (P< 0. 05). <b>The</b> autumn <b>calved</b> cows had a lower 4 week <b>calving</b> rate than <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows; 41 % vs 54 % (P< 0. 05). <b>The</b> autumn <b>calved</b> cows had a higher average empty rate than <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows; 12 % vs 10 % (P< 0. 05). These results show that cows which calved in autumn actually produced larger yields of milk fat and milk protein per lactation than those which calved in spring. However, these higher yields were achieved in longer lactations, and the autumn cows produced lower average daily yields than <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows. <b>The</b> lower daily yields during the second and third months of lactation by the autumn cows, indicated that these cows were on a lower level of feeding at this stage than <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows. <b>The</b> autumn <b>calved</b> cows had lower values for all aspects of reproductive performance than <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows. This difference is probably due to, at least partly, to the lower level of feeding in early lactation. These herds are relatively high producing, and therefore it can be deduced that they are generally well managed. Nevertheless <b>the</b> autumn <b>calved</b> cows were fed less well in early lactation than <b>the</b> spring <b>calved</b> cows, causing slightly poorer performances...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>calving</b> rate {{is largely}} {{controlled}} by {{the depth of the}} water and the glacier velocity at <b>the</b> <b>calving</b> front. <b>The</b> process of <b>calving</b> provides an imbalance in forces {{at the front of the}} glaciers, that raises velocity.

5|$|The thyroid {{itself is}} {{examined}} by {{observation of the}} gland and surrounding neck for swelling or enlargement. It is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner. The gland moves {{up and down with}} swallowing because of its attachments to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. In a healthy person the gland is not visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. Examination of the thyroid gland includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid size. The character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency may all be able to be felt. If a goitre is present, an examiner may also feel down the neck consider tapping {{the upper part of the}} chest to check for extension. Further tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign), listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck.
