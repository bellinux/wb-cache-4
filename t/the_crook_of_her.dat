The dress is full length with its collar lying falling just below her neck and its hem mostly covering her feet. The bodice is gathered and snugly fit. Around the waist a thick, twisted band of fabric is wrapped so that it appears lightly knotted with the cloth’s end coming from under the band {{at the rear of}} the dress. This excess length of cloth is drawn up through <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right arm. The dress’ sleeves appear rolled and sit just above the elbows.|$|E
2500|$|Babies can {{successfully}} latch {{on to the}} breast from multiple positions. Each baby may prefer a particular position. The [...] "football" [...] hold places the baby's legs next to the mother's side with the baby facing the mother.

The [...] "cross-over" [...] hold {{is similar to the}} cradle hold, except that the mother supports the baby's head with the opposite hand. The mother may choose a reclining position on her back or side with the baby laying next to her.|$|E
2500|$|Commerce {{measures}} approximately [...] {{tall and}} is {{carved out of}} Italian Carrara marble. [...] It rests on a cement base; attached to the base is a black label that reads [...] "COMMERCE" [...] in large gold letters. The sculpture is a female figure representing commerce. She is dressed in Hellenistic robes which are belted at the waist, and her hair is styled in a bun (with a few tendrils loose on her neck). She holds a caduseus, a classic symbol of commerce, in <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> proper right arm. Her proper right foot is extended slightly forward, while her proper left foot is pointed downward behind her body (as if {{she is in the}} middle of a step).|$|E
5000|$|A {{regular at}} Studio 54 and the Mudd Club, Carangi usually used cocaine in clubs. After her agent and mentor, Wilhelmina Cooper, {{died of lung}} cancer in March 1980, a devastated Carangi began abusing drugs and {{developed}} an addiction to heroin. Carangi's addiction soon began to affect her work; she had violent temper tantrums, walked out of photo shoots to buy drugs, and fell asleep in front of the camera. Scavullo recalled a fashion shoot with Carangi in the Caribbean when [...] "she was crying, she couldn't find her drugs. I literally had to lay her down on her bed until she fell asleep." [...] During one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> final location shoots for American Vogue, Carangi had red bumps in <b>the</b> <b>crooks</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> elbows where she had injected heroin. Despite airbrushing, some of the photos, as published in the November 1980 issue, reportedly still showed visible needle marks.|$|R
50|$|By the 1920s she {{was living}} in Detroit and had become {{virtually}} destitute. No longer young, she was reduced to propositioning men on the streets and was repeatedly arrested for soliciting and common prostitution. She hoped to make money from her former notoriety by writing magazine articles and an autobiography {{with the help of a}} journalist, which was published in 1928 as Chicago May, Her Story, by <b>the</b> Queen <b>of</b> <b>Crooks.</b> <b>Her</b> former lover Guerin published his own life story at the same time, under the title I was a Bandit. She died in 1929 at the age of 59 years.|$|R

2500|$|History is an {{approximately}} 9-foot tall (274.32cm) {{statue of}} a female figure draped in Hellenistic robes, holding a feathered quill in her proper right hand and an open book cradled in <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> proper left arm. She wears a floor-length tunic with a wide, slightly pleated neckline underneath a loosely draped mantle which is approximately a foot shorter than the tunic itself. The mantle is draped over her proper left shoulder, encircles her body about the proper right hip, and is gathered at her proper left waist. Her proper right sleeve is rolled halfway up her arm above the elbow, and her proper right arm is crossed {{in front of her}} body, horizontal to her waist. She holds a feathered quill delicately in her proper right hand, and little finger of which is curled and raised slightly. The little finger of her proper left hand, which holds the open book, is also curled slightly, adding a sense of delicacy to her pose. Some of the pages of the book have been delineated from one another, in order to give it a more realistic appearance. Her hair is pulled back into a braid, and wound around itself several times, creating a thick bun. Her features have an idealized cast to them, and her eyes are lowered, gazing at the pages of the book in her proper left hand. The sculpture's proper right foot is raised slightly at the heel, and she stands with the majority of her weight on her proper left foot. This sculpture, like the other seven, is carved from Italian Carrara marble, and sits upon a cement pedestal. Approximately three feet below the base of the statue is a black plaque, upon which is the word [...] "HISTORY" [...] in gold lettering.|$|E

Istra was still asleep, but her cheek now lay wistfully on <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> thin arm. He looked at the auburn-framed paleness of her face, its lines of thought and ambition, unmasked, unprotected by the swift changes of expression which defended her while she was awake. He sobbed. If he could only make her happy! But {{he was afraid of}} her moods.|$|E

60|$|The bride sat in {{the rocker}} with her feet resting upon the world. She was wrapt in rosy dreams and a kimono of the same hue. She {{wondered}} what the people in Greenland and Tasmania and Beloochistan were saying one to another about her marriage to Kid McGarry. Not that it made any difference. There was no welter-weight from London to the Southern Cross that could stand up four hours--no; four rounds--with her bridegroom. And he had been hers for three weeks; and <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little finger could sway him more than the fist of any 142-pounder in the world.|$|E

The Huns, Dr. dear, will never be brought to brook by notes. And now," [...] concluded Susan, tucking Jims in <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gaunt arms and marching downstairs, [...] "having cried my cry and said my say I shall take a brace, and if I cannot look pleasant I will look as pleasant as I can." ...|$|E
60|$|Representations {{have been}} made {{concerning}} Mr. Horace Swanky's behavior; rumors have been uttered about notes in verse, conveyed in three-cornered puffs, by Mrs. Ruggles, who serves Miss Pinkerton's young ladies on Fridays,--and how Miss Didow, to whom the tart and enclosure were addressed, tried to make away with herself by swallowing a ball of cotton. But I pass over these absurd reports, as likely to affect the reputation of an admirable seminary conducted by irreproachable females. As they go into church Miss P. driving in her flock of lambkins with <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> parasol, {{how can it be}} helped if her forces and ours sometimes collide, as the boys are on their way up to the organ-loft? And I don't believe a word about the three-cornered puff, but rather that it was the invention of that jealous Miss Birch, who is jealous of Miss Raby, jealous of everybody who is good and handsome, and who has HER OWN ENDS in view, or I am very much in error.|$|E

She was outlined against the sky, carrying a basket, and you could see that sky through <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> arm. And Ashurst, who saw beauty without wondering how it could advantage him, thought: 'How pretty!' The wind, blowing her dark frieze skirt against her legs, lifted her battered peacock tam-o'-shanter; her greyish blouse was worn and old, her shoes were split, her little hands rough and red, her neck browned. Her dark hair waved untidy across her broad forehead, her face was short, her upper lip short, showing a glint of teeth, her brows were straight and dark, her lashes long and dark, her nose straight; but her grey eyes were the wonder-dewy as if opened {{for the first time that}} day. She looked at Ashurst--perhaps he struck her as strange, limping along without a hat, with his large eyes on her, and his hair falling back. He could not take off what was not on his head, but put up his hand in a salute, and said: ...|$|E

50|$|Zercher squat - the barbell {{is held in}} <b>the</b> <b>crooks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arms, on {{the inside}} of the elbow. One method of {{performing}} this is to deadlift the barbell, hold it against the thighs, squat into the lower portion of the squat, and then hold the bar on the thighs as you position <b>the</b> <b>crook</b> <b>of</b> your arm under the bar and then stand up. This sequence is reversed once the desired number of repetitions has been performed. Named after Ed Zercher, a 1930s strongman.|$|R
5000|$|In Brinkmann's opinion, this statue type {{does not}} depict mortal girls but goddesses.

[...] On the Peplos Kore, there are bore holes in the lowered right arm and the bent left arm which suggest she held a bow and arrows or a shield and helmet.|$|E
