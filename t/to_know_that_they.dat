5|$|Per {{traditional}} accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi {{were still}} not satisfied, and sent two thieves {{to steal the}} manuscript. The thieves tried {{to break into the}} Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion. The thieves {{had a change of heart}} and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were. Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were guarding his home at night. He sent the manuscript of Ramcahritmanas to his friend Rai Todar Mal, the finance minister of Akbar, and donated all his money. The thieves were reformed and became devotees of Rama.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{examples}} of medieval noblewomen who acted with considerable de facto independence. Prominent are Lady Ingegjerd Ottesdotter Rømer of Austrått and Lady Gørvel Fadersdotter (Sparre) of Giske. It is, however, important <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> acted as so-called 'pseudo men', i.e. in the formal rôle of a man (usually their deceased husband's, father's or brother's). Legally, {{there was no such thing}} as formal female rôles.|$|E

In 2013 he said on Polish {{television}} that homosexual people have no right to a prominent role in politics, [...] "They have <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are a minority and must adjust to smaller things". He also said homosexual MPs should sit [...] "behind a wall" [...] in a parliament. Despite sharp international criticism and a legal complaint of [...] "propaganda of hate against a sexual minority", Wałęsa refused to apologize for his comments. At a political rally in 2000, he described gay people as [...] "sick" [...] and said, [...] "I believe those people need medical treatment". During the drawing up of a new Polish Constitution in 1995, President Wałęsa argued against the inclusion of gay rights provisions. In 2014 City authorities of San Francisco renamed Walesa Street because of his [...] "anti-gay remarks". A deputy speaker of the Polish Parliament said Wałęsa's anti-gay position could jeopardize his international career as a human rights speaker.|$|E

500|$|The {{secondary}} crew of JAT Flight 367, {{flying from}} Stockholm to Belgrade with stopovers in Copenhagen and Zagreb, arrived in Denmark {{on the morning}} of 25 January 1972. According to Vulović, she was not scheduled to be on Flight 367 and JAT had confused her for another flight attendant also named Vesna. Nevertheless, Vulović says she was excited to travel to Denmark because it was her first time visiting the country. The crew had the entire afternoon and the following morning to themselves. Vulović wished to go sightseeing but her colleagues insisted that they go shopping. [...] "Everybody wanted to buy something for his or her family," [...] she recalled. [...] "So I had to go shopping with them. They seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would die. They didn't talk about it, but I saw... I felt for them. And the captain was locked in his room for 24 hours. He didn't want to go out at all. In the morning, during breakfast, the co-pilot was talking about his son and daughter as if nobody else had a son or daughter." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dr Sam Coulter-Smith, a {{consultant}} in {{obstetrics and gynaecology}} and a university master in the Rotunda Hospital, {{one of the largest}} maternity hospitals in Ireland, said that it would be preferable to introduce legislation to bring in clarity, saying, [...] "We really do need legislation in this area, otherwise we're going to be at risk of doctors working outside the law, and that's not appropriate." [...] Dr Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, said: [...] "It is very disappointing that, 20 years after the 'X-Case', we don't have legislation" [...] and that women [...] "need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are going to get the appropriate health care that they need" [...] while doctors [...] "need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are also protected in their ability to do their job." [...] Peter Boylan, of the Irish Institute of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: [...] "The current situation is like a sword of Damocles hanging over us.

2500|$|SOA 2.0 Web Services can be {{composed}} in two ways: orchestration and choreography.

The involved SOA 2.0 services do not know (and do not need <b>to</b> <b>know)</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{are part of a}} composition or a higher business process. Only the central coordinator of the orchestration knows this, so the orchestration is centralized with explicit definitions of operations and the order of invocation of SOA 2.0 [...] services.|$|E

2500|$|The {{dimensionless}} constants {{that arise}} in the results obtained, such as the C in the Poiseuille's Law problem and the [...] in the spring problems discussed above, come from a more {{detailed analysis of the}} underlying physics and often arise from integrating some differential equation. [...] Dimensional analysis itself has little to say about these constants, but it is useful <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> very often have a magnitude of order unity.

Later, the chief military and civilian figures responsible for the shooting were removed from their positions as the press came {{to accept the fact}} that the strike dealt with poor conditions and was not a communist-led anti-regime action.

2500|$|India is {{currently}} the world's largest cutting & polishing centre for diamonds. Both countries have agreed to streamline their bilateral trade in diamonds through reductions in regulations and tariffs. Indian Prime Minister Modi stated in an interview, [...] "I made three proposals to President Putin. First, I would like Alrosa to have direct long-term contracts with more Indian companies. I am pleased <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are moving in this direction. Second, I want Alrosa and others to trade directly on our diamond bourse. We have decided to create a Special Notified Zone where mining companies can trade diamonds on consignment basis and re-export unsold ones. Third, I asked to reform regulation so that Russia can send rough diamonds to India and reimport polished diamonds without extra duties". Analysts predict through streamlined procedures and initiatives bilateral trade in this area will significantly increase.|$|E
