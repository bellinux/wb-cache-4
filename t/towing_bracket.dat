5000|$|Yhteissisu {{presented}} in May 1946 a model {{which was more}} suitable to the civil market. Sisu S-22K had its premier in Domestic Industry Fair in Helsinki. The letter K came from kevyt, [...] "light"; the total weight was just 7 tonnes instead of eight tonnes, the front bumper was substituted by a lighter one, the wheel size was smaller and the army standard <b>towing</b> <b>bracket</b> was left off.|$|E
50|$|Steering is {{assisted}} by a hydraulic servo. Both axles are with single tyres size of 14.5-20". Fuel capacity is 210 litres. The direct current electrical system {{is equipped with}} an 840-Watt, 24-Volt generator. There are two 145 Ah batteries. A <b>towing</b> <b>bracket</b> at the rear end. A reconnaissance winch of 6.5-ton capacity and 60-metre cable length is mounted as standard {{and it can be}} used both in front and rear end of the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|It is {{the first}} {{production}} biturbo model in a Q-series vehicle; based on the Audi RS Q3 concept. It features a 2.5 TFSI (2.5 L; 151 cu in) I5 turbo engine rated @5200-6700rpm and 420 Nm@1500-5200rpm, 7-speed S-tronic transmission with D and S modes, battery located in the luggage compartment, 4-link independent rear wheel suspensions, electro-mechanical rack and pinion steering, electro-mechanical parking brake and hill hold assist, 365 mm ventilated and perforated front brake discs with wave-shaped outer contours, black eight-piston calipers with RS logos, electronic stabilization control (ESC) with sport mode, 19-inch alloy wheels in German market (optional 20-inch wheels, with exclusive 5 dual-spoke V design from Audi RS Q3 concept), body accents and roof rails in matt aluminum, special door sill plates and door trim strips, a high-gloss black honeycomb front grille, RS front bumper and quattro emblem in the front air intake, roof spoiler, rear bumper with diffuser insert, elliptical tailpipe, a rear RS Q3 logo, choice of 8 body colors (including the exclusive Sepang Blue pearl effect), instrument cluster with gray gauges and white scales and red pointers, contrasting stitching in rock gray trim at flat bottom three-spoke multifunction steering wheel and gear selector lever, Multi Media Interface and driver information system with RS logo, RS menu with boost pressure, oil temperature and a lap timer; pedals and foot support in aluminum look, inlays in piano finish black (optional aluminum race or carbon), black (optional lunar silver) headlining, sport seats with embossed RS Q3 logos upholstered in black Alcantara/leather (optional Fine Nappa leather in black or lunar silver with contrasting stitching in rock gray or the design package with diamond stitching), reversible loadliner, optional <b>towing</b> <b>bracket,</b> RS-specific driver information system (park assist plus), Audi sound system with ten loudspeakers, xenon plus headlights, LED tail lights. The car accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.5 seconds and onto a limited top speed of 250 kph mph.|$|E
50|$|Outside North America, {{the vehicle}} {{mounting}} for the tow ball {{is called the}} <b>tow</b> <b>bracket.</b> The mounting points for all recent passenger vehicles are defined by the vehicle manufacturer and the tow-bracket manufacturer must use these mount points and prove the efficacy of their bracket for each vehicle by a full rig-based fatigue test.|$|R
40|$|<b>Bracket</b> <b>towing</b> hook {{construction}} planning {{is to make}} a construction that has the stress level of the allowable limit and can be accepted by the construction. Requirements for towing hook are structural strength if the stress levels that occur below the elastic region. By calculating the value of the maximum load, maximum stress, von mises stress and deflection (displasment) that occur in the construction of <b>bracket</b> <b>towing</b> hook, so that known security level of construction that has been designed. Research on construction of the strength <b>bracket</b> <b>towing</b> hook need to be considered and carried out, where the stress caused by load about them should not exceed the maximum limit σ yield materials and σ allow based on the rules from the class. The reference to rules used in this research is based on the rules of Bureau Classification Indonesia. Analysis of the strength <b>bracket</b> <b>towing</b> hook construction is done by using finite element methode. The analysis used is a static load analysis to determine the characteristics and location of greatest stress on the construction <b>bracket</b> <b>towing</b> hook based on three variations of loading. Analysis results obtained using finite element methode based program of greatest stress maximum occurs in the condition of the <b>bracket</b> <b>towing</b> hook  with maximum horse power load that is equal to 44, 2 N/mm 2 where the most critical area occurs at node 457 which is located at frame number 23 lengthwise section and stiffener number 7 cross section. This stress is still in a safe condition because after compared with material σ yield of 400 N/mm 2 and σ allow based BKI rules of 178, 12 N/mm 2 produce safety factor value of 9, 05 and 4, 03 </p...|$|R
5000|$|While the Ford Aerostar {{would never}} see a full {{redesign}} over its 12-year production run, it would see a number of detail changes to bring it in line with other Ford trucks. For 1988, the nameplate badging was changed, moving it from each fender to the tailgate; it was changed from chrome to silver in color. In 1989, the chrome grille {{was replaced by a}} black-trim grille; the <b>bracketed</b> <b>towing</b> mirrors were replaced by integrated powered sideview mirrors. In 1992, an extensive facelift redesigned the grille, bumpers, wheels, and replaced the sealed-beam headlights with replaceable-bulb composite units (the amber turn signal lenses were changed to clear-lens units). As it was becoming a federal requirement, a center brake light was added for 1994. As the Aerostar had been slated for discontinuation after the 1994 model year, few visible changes were made afterwards. For 1997, the amber rear turn signal lenses were deleted; XLT models were given optional 14x6" [...] seven-hole alloy wheels.|$|R
40|$|In The Ditch {{is a local}} {{company based}} in Mountain Home. They {{specialize}} in designing and manufacturing accessories for commercial tow trucks, {{as well as for}} regular consumer use. They already manufacture a large line of hitches, dolly mounts (for <b>towing</b> vehicles), and <b>brackets</b> for mounting general towing equipment to trucks. Brackets and mounting systems are the focus of the Senior Design Project that In the Ditch has proposed. We have been asked to create a modular platform that can be mounted to a variety of vehicles and this platform will be able to hold a variety of towing accessories. The project will be focused on an adaptive design approach. In The Ditch currently produces platforms for attachment of various accessories, and we will be using a single platform that can adapt to the various accessories that an end user will need to secure to a variety of vehicles. We will be building off of successful design solutions from their current products, as well as their expertise in manufacturing with sheet metal. This design will also need to be constrained to their current manufacturing capabilities. The main goal of the project is to create product that In the Ditch may be able to sell to the general towing community as well as satisfy the general public for any need they may see the product fit to fill...|$|R
