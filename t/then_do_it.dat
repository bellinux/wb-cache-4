500|$|Wark {{played as}} a central defender, midfielder and, occasionally, as a striker. Wark was an unusual player; {{he was able to}} play as a {{defensive}} midfielder yet break forward to score. According to former team-mate Terry Butcher, this was because his colleagues would drop back to cover for him: [...] "I played with John Wark, who was a sitting midfielder but was one of the top scorers in England and Europe. If you see it, <b>then</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> as long as the others spot it and cover for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the band's reunion, Lytle noted, [...] "The bargain I {{made myself}} {{regarding}} the 'brief reunion and couple of shows' situation was that I wasn't gonna {{talk too much}} about it. I was just gonna stew on it, and <b>then</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> That's {{the good thing about}} festivals. No need for me to sell anything here. Get in, rock out, get paid, get out. There are just going to be a few shows. Festival-type thingies. Perhaps the odd 'warm up gig' in someone's hair salon or something. Money was a motivating factor (resurfacing my indoor tennis court, oil change for my 4×4 Ferrari) but the idea of playing and hanging out with each other is something all of the guys are pretty stoked about." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the text}} {{accompanying}} the first recording of Sonatas and Interludes, Cage specifically {{stated that the}} use of preparations is not a criticism of the instrument, but a simple practical measure. Cage started composing for prepared piano in 1940, when he wrote a piece called Bacchanale for a dance by Syvilla Fort, and by 1946 had already composed a large number of works for the instrument. However, in Sonatas and Interludes the preparation is very complex, more so than in any of the earlier pieces. Forty-five notes are prepared, mostly using screws and various types of bolts, but also with fifteen pieces of rubber, four pieces of plastic, several nuts and one eraser. It takes about two or three hours to prepare a piano for performance. Despite the detailed instructions, any preparation is bound to be different from any other, and Cage himself suggested that there is no strict plan to adhere to: [...] "if you enjoy playing the Sonatas and Interludes <b>then</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> so that it seems right to you".|$|E
500|$|Although the European films {{allowed him}} to travel {{and gave him a}} {{constant}} source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he [...] "knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless". One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying [...] "I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that [...] "I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her". An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would [...] "listen... politely, <b>then</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> my own way, as if the conversation had never taken place"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called [...] "limp", and Christopher Young described as [...] "such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy".|$|E
2500|$|Along the way, Zhang Fei {{attacked}} Jiangzhou (江州; around present-day Yuzhong District, Chongqing), {{which was}} defended by Yan Yan, a military officer serving under Liu Zhang. He defeated Yan Yan and captured him alive. Zhang Fei said to Yan Yan, [...] "When my army showed up, {{why did you}} put up resistance instead of surrendering?" [...] Yan Yan replied, [...] "You people launched an unwarranted attack on my home province. There may be generals in my province who will lose their heads, but there are none who will surrender." [...] Zhang Fei was enraged and he ordered Yan Yan's execution. Yan Yan was expressionless, and he said, [...] "If you want to chop off my head, <b>then</b> <b>do</b> <b>it!</b> What's with that outburst of anger?"

I had offers from the USA and Qatar but I {{wanted to be part}} of a new {{beginning}} for the sport in India. As for the conditions, we all know about them — but I'm ready and training hard. I like the pressure," [...] he said, making it clear that the USA and Qatar hardly excited him as much as India. Pirès is a regular at Arsenal's training ground, using the facilities to stay fit, and said that he spoke to Arsène Wenger about playing in India: [...] "He told me if you have it in you and if you have the passion to go play in India, <b>then</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> And I think I'm ready." [...] "The reception at the airport was amazing," [...] he said, on his unveiling in India, before adding, [...] "Thank you for the welcome India... and the spicy food." ...|$|E

In 214, Liu Bei summoned reinforcements from his base in Jing Province to enter Yi Province and assist him in attacking Liu Zhang. Zhang Fei, a general under Liu Bei, led troops to attack Jiangzhou (江州; around present-day Yuzhong District, Chongqing), which was defended by Yan Yan. Zhang Fei defeated Yan Yan, captured him alive, and asked him, [...] "When my army showed up, why did you put up resistance instead of surrendering?"

He was seated on his horse at some distance from Joseph and the Arabs, and had no appearance of being in league with those, no doubt, worthy guides.
