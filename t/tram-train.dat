5|$|A {{number of}} {{speculative}} expansion proposals exist for new lines to Stockport, a loop around Wythenshawe, {{and the addition}} of <b>tram-train</b> technology.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of Metrolink {{has been}} a key {{strategy}} of transport planners in Greater Manchester, who have overseen its development in successive projects, known as Phases 1, 2, 3a and 3b with the most recent phase, 2CC becoming operational in February 2017. Construction work on the Trafford Park Line extension from Pomona to the Trafford Centre commenced in early 2017 with an estimated operational date of 2020/21. Furthermore, TfGM have endorsed more speculative expansion proposals for new lines to Stockport, a loop around Wythenshawe, {{and the addition of}} <b>tram-train</b> technology.|$|E
5|$|The National Rail Administration has {{developed}} a plan for possible expansion of the commuter rail. The main possibilities have been discussed: rebuilding the section from Sandnes to Egersund to double track, taking back into use the Ålgård Line, which branches off at Ganddal, and building a new branch from south of Gausel to Stavanger Airport, Sola. An alternative to several of the options is a light rail, {{which may or may}} not be built as a <b>tram-train,</b> which would use parts of the existing double track between Stavanger and Sandnes.|$|E
5000|$|Running <b>tram-trains</b> {{directly}} to ManchesterThe possibility of running <b>tram-trains</b> between Greenbank or Knutsford and central Manchester has been examined. [...] However, {{it was decided}} in 2013 {{that the use of}} <b>tram-trains</b> alongside existing heavy rail passenger and freight services would provide poor value for money and alternative heavy rail options should be examined instead.|$|R
50|$|The {{running of}} <b>tram-trains</b> {{directly}} into Manchester (via Sale) has been looked into. In 2013 TfGM said that running <b>tram-trains</b> to Knutsford would provide poor {{value for money}} and that alternative heavy rail options should be looked at instead.|$|R

5|$|The main {{railway station}} in Aarhus is Aarhus Central Station {{located in the}} city centre. DSB has {{connections}} to destinations throughout Denmark and beyond. Two local railways provide commuter services to Grenaa and Odder. The Aarhus Letbane is a planned electric <b>tram-train</b> system that will link two railway lines with a new light rail route through the city. Most city bus lines go through the inner city and pass through either Park Allé or Banegårdspladsen, or both. Regional and Inter-city buses terminate at Aarhus Bus Terminal, {{just east of the}} central station. The long-distance buses of linie888 connect Aarhus to other cities in Jutland and Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Supertram is {{scheduled}} to begin operations of the new <b>tram-train</b> line from Cathedral to Rotherham Parkgate, using seven brand new Vossloh-built Class 399 Citylink articulated electric multiple units. The existing Siemens-Duewag Supertram fleet will not be upgraded for <b>tram-train</b> operation, so have not been registered under TOPS and cannot be used on the line as they lack the relevant Network Rail safety systems and crashworthiness. The <b>tram-train</b> scheme, which was first planned to be in service by 2015 has been delayed and is not expected to start until the summer 2018.|$|E
25|$|Vossloh has {{supplied}} seven <b>tram-train</b> vehicles, delivered between November 2015 and November 2016.|$|E
50|$|Alstom Citadis Dualis <b>tram-trains</b> {{will be used}} on the line.|$|R
50|$|Currently {{there are}} 28 Flexity Link <b>tram-trains</b> in use, which were {{manufactured}} by Bombardier in Vienna and Bruges. Six sets were temporarily loaned to Kassel, where they operated trial runs for RegioTram Kassel. From the timetable change in December 2009, three <b>tram-trains</b> were lent to the Stadtbahn Karlsruhe {{for use on}} line S9.|$|R
50|$|The {{difference}} between modern <b>tram-trains</b> {{and the older}} interurbans and radial railways is that <b>tram-trains</b> are built to meet mainline railway standards, rather than ignoring them. An exception is the USA's River Line in New Jersey which runs along freight tracks with time separation: passenger trains run by day, and freight by night.|$|R
25|$|Nantes {{is trying}} to develop a <b>tram-train</b> system, which would allow {{suburban}} trains to run on tram lines; the system already exists in Mulhouse (in eastern France) and Karlsruhe, Germany. The city has two <b>tram-train</b> lines: Nantes-Clisson (southern) and Nantes-Châteaubriant (northern). Neither is yet connected to the existing tram network, and resemble small suburban trains more than tram-trains. The Bicloo bicycle-sharing system has 880 bicycles at 103 stations.|$|E
25|$|The Class 399 {{units were}} built in 2015/16 with the first {{delivered}} in December 2015. Until {{the completion of the}} <b>tram-train</b> line, some will be used to provide increased capacity on the existing Supertram network. The first entered service on 17 September 2017.|$|E
25|$|A {{scheme to}} {{introduce}} light rail to Watford was conceived in 2009 {{when it was}} proposed that the Abbey Line should be converted to <b>tram-train</b> operation and run by Hertfordshire County Council. The project was cancelled due to the complications and expense of transferring the line from National Rail to the county council.|$|E
50|$|RegioTram {{operates}} using 28 tramcars from Alstom RegioCitadis {{delivered in}} 2004. There are {{two versions of}} these tramcars: 18 dual voltage <b>tram-trains</b> for use on the electrified network in and outside of Kassel, and 10 hybrid <b>tram-trains</b> (DC/diesel) for use with a diesel engine outside Kassel on the section around Wolfhagen. Similar vehicles of the same model are also in use on RandstadRail in the Netherlands.|$|R
50|$|It is {{also served}} by the <b>tram-trains</b> on line S1 (currently the only line) of the Saarbahn (Heusweiler Markt-Saarbrücken-Sarreguemines).|$|R
50|$|Most <b>tram-trains</b> are {{standard}} gauge, which facilitates sharing track with main-line trains. Exceptions include Alicante Tram and Nordhausen, which are metre gauge.|$|R
25|$|Historically many <b>tram–train</b> level {{crossings}} have operated in Melbourne, {{all but the}} aforementioned three have been grade separated, or the tramway or railway has been abandoned. The first were built during the cable tram systems operation, with much reluctance {{on behalf of the}} Victorian Railways. Many more were built after the emergence of electric trams in 1906, often causing disputes between tramway operators and the Victorian Railways.|$|E
25|$|Germany did not {{undergo the}} {{extensive}} tramway closure programmes that {{were carried out}} in other European countries and many cities retain their original tram networks. In some places, tram networks have been added or expanded through the introduction of hybrid <b>tram-train</b> or stadtbahn systems which may combine standard railway, on-street and underground operations. Notable examples include the systems in Cologne and Karlsruhe. In Frankfurt-am-Main, many tram lines were transferred to U-Bahn operation.|$|E
25|$|While the Valencian-owned company, Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat Valenciana (FGV) {{operates}} a <b>tram-train</b> line between Alicante, Benidorm and Dénia. It also operates the city tram and metro system of Valencia (Valencia Metro) and Alicante (Alicante Tram). There is as well a third new tram and trolleybus system {{being built in}} Castellón de la Plana and its metropolitan area. Additionally both, Valencia metro and Alicante tram are being extended to serve uncovered areas, like the new tram line planned {{to open in the}} coming months towards the University of Alicante and San Vicente del Raspeig.|$|E
50|$|Alicante Tram {{connects the}} city with {{outlying}} settlements along Costa Blanca. , electric <b>tram-trains</b> run up to Benidorm, and diesel trains go further to Dénia.|$|R
50|$|SYPTE and WYPTE subsidise commuters' {{travel with}} {{discount}} schemes. <b>Tram-trains</b> {{have also been}} proposed in the area. However, no scheme has yet been approved.|$|R
50|$|At Freudenstadt, the Ortenau S-Bahn {{services}} {{meet those}} of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, operating by Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (AVG), using their fleet of <b>tram-trains,</b> over the Murgtalbahn to Karlsruhe.|$|R
25|$|Local train {{services}} {{operate in}} the central, southern and eastern sections {{of the city and}} are operated by South West Trains, with stations at Swaythling, St Denys, Millbrook, Redbridge, Bitterne, Sholing and Woolston. Plans were announced by Hampshire County Council in July 2009 for the introduction of <b>tram-train</b> running from Hythe (on what is now a freight-only line to Fawley) via Totton to Southampton Central Station and on to Fareham via St. Denys, and Swanwick. The proposal follows a failed plan to bring light rail to the Portsmouth and Gosport areas in 2005.|$|E
25|$|After {{discarding}} {{proposals for}} a railway and a <b>tram-train,</b> Akershus County Municipality planned a people mover to Lysaker Station. This was approved of in 2004, but in 2007 the county changed its opinion and instead {{opted for a}} connection to the Oslo Tramway, allowing direct access to the city center. Ruter took over the planning in 2008 and followed up with additional reports. It instead recommended that the site be served by a metro. It cited that estimates showed that no other transit systems will have sufficient capacity in the long run. The project is estimated to cost 4.5 billion Norwegian krone, but there is no fixed schedule for construction.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} <b>tram-train</b> route {{would run}} in a new tramway line from Fornebu to Lysaker. There it would connect to the Drammen Line from Lysaker Station to Skøyen Station. At the latter site it would instead connect to the Skøyen Line of the tramway via Bygdøy allé and run to the city center and Jernbanetorget. The line was proposed extended eastwards partially along the Trunk Line and partially along a new light rail route via Akershus University Hospital to Lillestrøm and Kjeller in Skedsmo. The line from Lysaker to Fornebu was estimated to cost 223 million krone, and a total cost of 334 million to reach the city center.|$|E
5000|$|Most modern trams are {{designed}} to travel at up to 80 km per hour while <b>tram-trains</b> may have {{a top speed of}} 100 km per hour.|$|R
50|$|The {{running of}} <b>tram-trains</b> {{directly}} in to Manchester, {{in addition to}} the existing rail service, has been estimated as being able to cut about 10 minutes off the overall journey time to and from Manchester. Network Rail and the Department for Transport (DfT) have indicated that they are keen to carry out a trial for <b>tram-trains</b> in the UK, which will be between Rotherham and Sheffield. Carrying out the trial would provide the information Network Rail and the DfT require on reliability, frequency and costs.|$|R
50|$|Further plans, {{making use}} of the {{additional}} capacity made available by this second axis, involve the use of <b>tram-trains</b> over local railway lines to form a RegioTram network.|$|R
25|$|Lysaker Station was {{the closest}} railway station to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. From 27 May 1990, SAS and NSB started a {{cooperation}} to better the connection between rail and airline services. The project included the station being branded as Lysaker/Fornebu and dedicated shuttle buses running from the station to the airport terminal. NSB changed their scheduled so all InterCity Express and long distance trains on the Drammen Line started stopping at Lysaker. Oslo Sporveier and the Norwegian National Rail Administration launched {{a proposal for a}} <b>tram-train</b> service in 1997, largely inspired by the Karlsruhe model. The last plane departed from Fornebu on 7 October 1998.|$|E
25|$|So far as Edinburgh's guided {{transportation}} systems are concerned, the troubled tramway scheme for Edinburgh has enjoyed the limelight for some years. First seriously planned in 2003, {{the emphasis was}} on connecting the airport and northern suburbs to the city centre although a branch route to Newcraighall was contemplated, and later dropped. None of the proposals involved running on the Suburban Line, although a <b>tram-train</b> solution has been advocated by a special interest group: this would have involved vehicles running on the Suburban Line and transferring to street running to achieve a more direct and convenient access to the city centre. This {{would have had the}} incidental advantage of avoiding adding to the train movements on the congested four-track section of the main line from Haymarket to Waverley, but would of course have constrained the route options on the South Side.|$|E

50|$|The line's fifteen <b>tram-trains</b> are {{maintained}} at {{shops in the}} de Paris-Est technicentre located in Noisy-le-Sec in Seine-Saint-Denis. They were renovated after {{the creation of the}} RER E.|$|R
50|$|In March 2008 the UK Department for Transport {{released}} {{details of}} a plan to trial diesel <b>tram-trains</b> on the Penistone Line for two years starting in 2010. There was no commitment to connect them to the Sheffield tram network, and in September 2009 the idea was withdrawn as it was deemed not economically viable for a trial due to the cost of the extra development required for the diesel engines to meet the forthcoming stringent EU emission regulations. Instead single-voltage electric <b>tram-trains</b> will be trialled between Rotherham and Sheffield.|$|R
50|$|ARST: {{the trains}} run on narrow-gauge track, are {{generally}} slow, {{due to the}} tortuosity of the lines, except for the electrified <b>tram-trains</b> operating in the metropolitan areas of Sassari and Cagliari.|$|R
