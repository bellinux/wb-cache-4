60|$|HYPATIA. I {{can imagine}} {{all sorts of}} men I could {{fall in love with}}; but I never seem to meet them. The real ones are too small, like Bunny, or too silly, like Jerry. Of course one can get into a state about any man: fall in love with him if you like to call it that. But who would risk marrying a man for love? I shouldnt. I {{remember}} three girls at school who agreed that the one man you should never marry was the man you were in love with, because it would make a perfect slave of you. Theres a sort of instinct against it, I <b>think,</b> <b>thats</b> just as strong as the other instinct. One of them, to my certain knowledge, refused a man she was in love with, and married another who was in love with her; and it turned out very well.|$|E
5000|$|Mel {{has been}} dubbed as a chameleon, and Outhwaite has {{suggested}} that she liked to bring variation to Mels characterisation: [...] "When I arrived I liked the idea Mel was feisty and strong. I didnt want her turning into a wimpy character like so many women in soaps. You know, theyre either bitches or theyre slags or theyre victims. I wanted to give Mel a bit of everything. Every woman has all those elements to their character. Its just working out where they come and go, and I dont <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> lack of continuity; I <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> a three-dimensional character." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{a further}} {{interview}} with Press Association, Scanlan said: [...] "I {{have never had}} the opportunity to play somebody as complex and as damaged as Brendan. He is without doubt a sociopathic, self-loathing, homophobic gay man and that in itself is a fascinating attraction for any actor to play. I think any actor would love a challenge, when youre doing a role if it pushes your boundaries and takes you out of yourself and allows you to experience different things. I <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> great. So coming up to do the part was exciting for me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Even though Jackie Robinson {{became the}} first black player in modern major league history in April 1947, Larry Doby, who broke the American League color barrier that July, felt that Gibson was the best black player in 1945, 1946, and 1947. Doby said in an {{interview}} later, [...] "One {{of the things that was}} disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. I <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> one of the reasons why Josh died so early - he was heartbroken." ...|$|E
5000|$|Director Jonathan Demme has commented, [...] "Beloved only {{played in}} theaters for four weeks. It made $22 million dollars -- I <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> {{a lot of}} money. And the only reason it left theaters after a month was because the Disney {{corporation}} that released the picture wanted all the Beloved theaters -- where we were doing very well, {{in a number of}} situations. The Walt Disney company wanted those theaters for Adam Sandlers Waterboy. So, we were told that they were gonna bring us back {{at the end of the}} year, and they didnt.

40|$|Some Nietzsche scholars, like Wilcox and Kaufmann, <b>think</b> <b>that</b> for Nietzsche {{there are}} truths and that {{knowledge}} {{of them is}} possible. 1 I do not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this reading is correct. Other scholars, like Danto and Cameron, <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Nietzsche rejects the possibility of truth. In my opinion they are correct, but they also <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this rejection gives rise to serious difficulties in Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s thought. 2 I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Nietzsche was aware of these difficulties, consciously sought to get around them, and that his most bizarre doctrines, if understood correctly, succeed in do- ing so...|$|R

5000|$|In 2012, {{seven years}} after the role made him famous, Oh reprised Hedwig for the rock musicals seventh run in Korea. At a press conference, he jokingly talked about shaving his legs again and being banned from his {{favorite}} activities like eating meat, working out, and drinking alcohol, but said that the role was [...] "certainly worth the ordeal." [...] Oh said, [...] "This musical tells us that to love someone is to accept him exactly the way he is. It also tells us that everyone deserves to be loved, and every individual is meaningful and important. I <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> the essential message of this piece." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{contributing}} factor, at least, {{was that}} June Lockhart and director Don Richardson {{were no longer}} excited about the show. Lockhart said in response to being told about the cancellation by Perry Lafferty, the head of CBS programming, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> for the best at this point", although {{she goes on to}} say that she would have stayed if there had been a fourth season. Lockhart immediately joined the cast of CBS Petticoat Junction upon Lost in Spaces cancellation.

5000|$|... "This is a {{song about}} Adelaide and my upbringing. I namedropped lots of things that only Adelaide people know as well just because I felt like it. Ive done lots of music about being an outcast and feeling alienated in the past, so I {{wanted to do a}} happier song about being young. The song was {{produced}} by HAMLEY and basically stayed the same all the way through except the drums changed a little. I wrote the last verse when I was driving around in Adelaide, I <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> why the subject matter is kind of different to the other two verses. This is probably more boom bap {{than the rest of the}} album but its just so catchy I had to leave it on there." ...|$|E
5000|$|Farscapes {{production}} {{staff were}} pleased {{with how the}} episode turned out. Writer Justin Monjo stated, [...] "Its full of surprises {{and we are all}} very excited about it.

[...] "I found a line I want to change...She did a Unity thing / I dont <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> what was written / A [...] "Unity thing" [...] sounds like some kinda dance" [...] He also acknowledged the difficulties involved in resurrecting Aeryn: [...] "its such a fine line between stupid and clever / I agree that its good to leave some of em dead / elsewise it doesnt mean much" ...|$|E
5000|$|Chabons first novel, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, {{was written}} as his UC Irvine masters thesis.

The Mysteries of Pittsburgh appeared in 1988 and became a bestseller, instantly catapulting Chabon {{to the status of}} literary celebrity. Among Chabons major literary influences in this period were Donald Barthelme, Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel García Márquez, Raymond Chandler, John Updike, Philip Roth and F. Scott Fitzgerald. As Chabon remarked in 2010, [...] "I just copied the writers whose voices I was responding to, and I <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> probably the best way to learn." ...|$|E

All three have been friends for a long while, and on his and Hannahs friendship as well as her character Carradine stated [...] " [...] Ive known Daryl Hannah for 20 years. Shes kind of a friend of the family. Anyway, Ive been hot for her ever since Blade Runner. It was great working with her on this. She plays a torch singer, and shes actually pretty good at it. I <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> probably why she took the part, because she got to sing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Also {{reported}} {{for the first time}} was a comment Bill Clinton supposedly made in trying to convince Ted Kennedy not to back Obamas candidacy but rather that of his wife, Hillary Clinton. Clinton reportedly said to Kennedy that [...] "a few years ago, this guy would have been getting us coffee." [...] There is no evidence that Clinton ever made the remark. However, the alleged belittling of Obamas candidacy supposedly helped lead to Kennedys endorsement of Obama shortly thereafter. [...] Reverend Al Sharpton condemned Clintons alleged remark, saying, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> far more disturbing Senator Reids comments because this is someone seeking to stop Mr. Obamas campaign... If someone said that he would have been getting us coffee like that in the context they said he said it, that would be very offensive to me, and I would definitely take Mr. Clinton on".|$|E
5000|$|... "Dinosaur" [...] {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} most music critics. Ian Gittins of The Guardian {{called it a}} [...] "bitchy put-down of ageing suitors".

Its neither." [...] The UrbanWires Cheryl Chia was critical of the song, saying that it [...] "has {{the potential to be}} very annoying after a few rounds." [...] Billboards Monica Herrera also gave a negative review. She used the song as an example of one of the albums [...] "missteps", stating that it could [...] "only appeal to the most heartless of teens".
