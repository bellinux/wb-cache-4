5|$|After {{finding out}} that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true {{feelings}} about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she {{shows up at the}} office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie, who is at the fundraiser, <b>tells</b> <b>people</b> that Arizona died in the plane crash. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having other child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later.|$|E

He has a strong relationship with Red, joining him on his regular fishing trips and taking part in many aspects of the Possum Lodge operations. He also takes his fatherhood very seriously, often trying to pass on his ideas and wisdom to other people (most notably Harold).

25|$|If Plato's {{important}} dialogues do {{not refer}} to Socrates' execution explicitly, they allude to it, or use characters or themes that {{play a part in}} it. Five dialogues foreshadow the trial: In the Theaetetus (210d) and the Euthyphro (2a–b) Socrates <b>tells</b> <b>people</b> that he is about to face corruption charges. In the Meno (94e–95a), {{one of the men who}} brings legal charges against Socrates, Anytus, warns him about the trouble he may get into if he does not stop criticizing important people. In the Gorgias, Socrates says that his trial will be like a doctor prosecuted by a cook who asks a jury of children to choose between the doctor's bitter medicine and the cook's tasty treats (521e–522a). In the Republic (7.517e), Socrates explains why an enlightened man (presumably himself) will stumble in a courtroom situation. The Apology is Socrates' defense speech, and the Crito and Phaedo take place in prison after the conviction. In the Protagoras, Socrates is a guest at the home of Callias, son of Hipponicus, a man whom Socrates disparages in the Apology as having wasted a great amount of money on sophists' fees.|$|E
500|$|Fark {{was created}} in 1999 by Drew Curtis of Lexington, Kentucky. Curtis states that the word [...] "fark" [...] {{originated}} either from a chat room euphemism for a popular four letter F-word, or from a drunken misspelling, although he <b>tells</b> <b>people</b> it is the former {{because it is a}} [...] "better story that way". He registered Fark.com in September 1997, when a friend mentioned that all of the four letter domain names were disappearing. Originally, Fark contained no content except for an image of a squirrel with large testicles. This photograph is that of a Cape Ground Squirrel in Etosha National Park, Namibia, taken by photographer Kevin Shafer, who at the time worked for the Corbis Corporation, ca. 1993. The squirrel image is no longer used in the production area of the site, but it can still be found as the server's 404 error for pages that do not exist.|$|E

On April 9, 2011, an instructional video featuring a group of teenagers dancing to [...] "Move Your Body" [...] was released online. After a few days, Beyoncé has said that she [...] "would record her {{own version of the}} exercise routine" [...] to show kids how it is done by shooting a new music video featuring a series of fun workouts to accompany the track. On April 26, 2011, Beyoncé released a video directed by Melina Matsoukas for [...] "Move Your Body". In the video, students join Beyoncé to perform choreography by Frank Gatson. In the choreography, Beyoncé and the students mix salsa, dancehall, The Running Man, Dougie, stomp. The music video for [...] "Move Your Body" [...] takes place as a four-minute long flash mob. The video begins during lunch hour at what looks like a junior high cafeteria. Everything is normal until Beyoncé, wearing short shorts and green knee-high socks, enters the cafeteria doors to begin the song. After Beyoncé's entry, all the kids jump to their feet, following along as Beyoncé leads the group through all kinds of dances.|$|E

The religious right wants to tell people how to live." [...] In his 1999 best-selling memoir I Ain't Got Time to Bleed, Ventura responded to the controversy sparked by these remarks by elaborating on his views concerning religion: ...|$|E

Not liking to use the word [...] "cancer", Reed (whose parents are both Ohio State alums and himself is an Ohio State fan) decided to call his cancer [...] "Michigan", since [...] "Ohio State is always going to beat Michigan". The move of calling his cancer [...] "Michigan" [...] got the support of his parents, Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer (who Reed later got to meet), and even some Michigan fans, including Michigan head coach Brady Hoke.

McCreevy was heavily criticised in the European Parliament by {{the leader of the}} Socialist group in the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, who demanded on 17 June 2008 that McCreevy be removed from his post of EU commissioner. Schulz slightly misquoted McCreevy, whom he stated had contributed to Ireland's rejection of the Lisbon Treaty with remarks during {{the referendum}} campaign that no [...] "sane person" [...] would read the document."This man goes to Ireland and says he has not read the treaty and <b>tells</b> <b>people</b> {{there is no need to}} read it," [...] Mr Schultz said during a heated debate on the referendum at the European parliament in Strasbourg today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Silas {{sets his}} sights on Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) as his next {{potential}} victim. Jamil Fadel (Sikander Malik) and Lee Hunter (Alex Carter) start their own radio show and recruit Lynsey to be their on-air agony aunt. Lynsey's advice to [...] "sexually charged" [...] young people does not go down well with Silas. Hassan said that Silas assumes the worst about Lynsey. Silas grows more furious when Lynsey dresses up in a sexy nurse's outfit for the radio's webcam. Lynsey is [...] "horrified" [...] as her flat becomes dark and Silas grabs her from behind. However, Silas is scared off as Lynsey's screams are heard by Silas's grandson, Riley Costello (Rob Norbury), who arrives to rescue her. Lynsey realises that it was Silas who attacked her and <b>tells</b> <b>people,</b> {{but they do not}} believe her. Discussing the plot, Bronagh Waugh (who plays Lynsey's best friend Cheryl Brady) explained that everyone thinks that Lynsey is crazy and making the allegation up. She said [...] "Lynsey's really upset about it and asks Cheryl for some help. While she hates seeing her best friend in that kind of state, she thinks Lynsey's just being paranoid and Silas is a really upstanding member of society." [...] As no one accepts Lynsey's allegation, she wants to bring Silas down even more. Hassan stated that Lynsey is determined to find the evidence she needs to expose Silas. Riley realises that Lynsey is telling the truth and confronts Silas, who has a heart attack. Riley brings Silas into hospital, but Lynsey is not sure whether Silas is genuinely ill. Lynsey is assigned as his nurse and withholds his oxygen mask until he admits that he attacked her. Heidi walks in on Lynsey withholding treatment from Silas and Lynsey calls for help. Norbury later told Digital Spy that he did not think Riley's suspicions of Silas would ever completely go and [...] "everything that happened shook [...] up a bit".|$|E
