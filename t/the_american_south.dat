5|$|Modern deep frying {{began in}} the 19th century with the growing {{popularity}} of cast iron, particularly around <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>South</b> which {{led to the development of}} many modern deep-fried dishes.

5|$|The first dish {{known to}} have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the Middle Ages.
