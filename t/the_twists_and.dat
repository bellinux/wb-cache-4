25|$|The pair leave, {{and walk}} along the streets taking turns {{carrying}} the disguises and discussing how to split the money. This serves to introduce some levity and ease the narrative out of the emotional climax of the scene, helping to prepare the audience for <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> emotion of the following scene, the true climax of the play.

25|$|Gabriel was devotedly in love, but {{he could}} not marry his {{mistress}} because the Romanov's family status forbade any morganatic union. He appealed to his aunt, Olga, Queen of the Hellenes, to intercede on his behalf, and she went to see Nicholas II requesting permission for his nephew to marry, but the emperor flatly refused.

25|$|The secrecy {{campaign}} continued {{even while}} the series aired. Journalists are typically given preview copies of episodes so they might prepare reviews for publication as soon as an episode airs. To keep <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> turns of Broadchurch a secret, preview copies of each episode were delivered electronically and protected with passwords. Chibnall also significantly restricted access to each completed episode {{to just a few}} people. Nevertheless, a large number of journalists knew who the killer was long before the final episode aired, Chibnall said. But the secret never leaked.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{cause of}} the Sultana disaster {{was determined to be}} mismanagement of water levels in the boiler, exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} vessel was severely overcrowded and top heavy. As the steamboat made her way north following <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> turns of the river, she listed severely to one side then the other. Her four boilers were interconnected and mounted side-by-side, so that if the boat tipped sideways, water would tend to run out of the highest boiler. With the fires still going against the empty boiler, this created hot spots. When the boat tipped the other way, water rushing back into the empty boiler would hit the hot spots and flash instantly to steam, creating a sudden surge in pressure. This effect of careening could have been minimized by maintaining high water levels in the boilers. The official inquiry found that the boat's boilers exploded due to the combined effects of careening, low water level, and a faulty repair to a leaky boiler made a few days earlier.|$|E

500|$|Frankenstein, {{like much}} Gothic fiction of the period, mixes a [...] and alienating subject matter with {{speculative}} and thought-provoking themes. Rather {{than focusing on}} <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> turns of the plot, however, the novel foregrounds the mental and moral struggles of the protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, and Shelley imbues the text with her own brand of politicised Romanticism, one that criticised the individualism and egotism of traditional Romanticism. Victor Frankenstein is like Satan in Paradise Lost, and Prometheus: he rebels against tradition; he creates life; and he shapes his own destiny. These traits are not portrayed positively; as Blumberg writes, [...] "his relentless ambition is a self-delusion, clothed as quest for truth". He must abandon his family to fulfill his ambition.|$|E
500|$|Sonnets are {{particularly}} {{associated with high}} poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, {{largely due to the}} influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as Edmund Spenser (who gave his name to the Spenserian sonnet), Michael Drayton, and Shakespeare, whose sonnets are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the Oxford Book of English Verse. However, <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> turns associated with the volta allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects. Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics (John Milton, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Claude McKay), theology (John Donne, Gerard Manley Hopkins), war (Wilfred Owen, e. e. cummings), and gender and sexuality (Carol Ann Duffy). Further, postmodern authors such as Ted Berrigan and John Berryman have challenged the traditional definitions of the sonnet form, rendering entire sequences of [...] "sonnets" [...] that often lack rhyme, a clear logical progression, or even a consistent count of fourteen lines.|$|E

500|$|Reviews for [...] "Pilot" [...] were {{generally}} favorable. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+, calling the show [...] "a slick action-adventure tale with knotty plotting and zeitgeisty villains". Hank Steuver of The Washington Post praised the episode for being [...] "stylish and swiftly paced" [...] with [...] "intriguing plot twists", but {{felt that there}} was [...] "not a lot of motivation to keep coming back". Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that the [...] "tone change" [...] in the episode was [...] "a bit abrupt", but noted that [...] "viewers who can handle <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> turns will be intrigued". James Poniewozik gave a mixed review of the episode, noting that the show is [...] "setting itself up to be largely a bad-guy-of-the-week show" [...] and that its success will [...] "depend on how interesting Reddington and Keen’s backstories become". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said the episode was [...] "stylish and expertly paced", saying that [...] "it is never boring".

500|$|... "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{received}} highly positive reviews. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club {{called it}} the best Parks and Recreation episode so far, and compared the cliffhanger and [...] "many of the bittersweet moments leading to it" [...] to the comedy series Freaks and Geeks. James Poniewozik of Time magazine strongly praised [...] "Li'l Sebastian", and called {{it one of the}} best episodes of the season. He said Li'l Sebastian's funeral brought out the best in the characters, and that the episode [...] "combined slapstick, authentic stakes and a holistic picture of the oddball history and commonalities that bond the folks we've come to know in Pawnee". Henry Hanks of CNN called it [...] "one of the funniest half-hours of any show this season", and compared the Li'l Sebastian funeral to the funeral scenes in the Mary Tyler Moore Show episode [...] "Chuckles Bites the Dust". The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow called the episode a [...] "triumphant exclamation point at the end of Parks and Recreations third season", and described every moment as [...] "uproariously funny". Meslow particularly praised <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> major character developments of the final 10 minutes, and said it demonstrates how much the show and characters have changed since the series debuted.|$|E
500|$|Drew McWeeny {{praised the}} film's {{complexity}} as giving it repeat-viewing value, and its conclusion as [...] "perhaps the most canny move it makes." [...] Todd Gilchrist found the story too {{similar to other}} cinematic trilogies such as Star Wars, but praised the production values. Brian Lowry felt that [...] "unlike last year's bloated sequel, it at least possesses some semblance of a destination, making it slightly more coherent - if no less numbing during the protracted finale." [...] Total Film praised the performances but complained that <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> exposition {{made it hard to}} care for the characters. Edward Douglas liked the film but had issues with its pacing, while Blake Wright criticized the Davy Jones's Locker and Calypso segments. James Berardinelli found it the weakest of the trilogy as [...] "the last hour offers adventure as rousing as anything provided in either of the previous installments... which doesn't account for the other 108 minutes of this gorged, self-indulgent, and uneven production." [...] Peter Travers praised Richards and Rush but felt [...] "there can indeed be {{too much of a good}} thing," [...] regarding Depp's character. Travers later declared the movie to be one of the worst films of the year. Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent said the film was overall a disappointment and that [...] "the final showdown ... is a non-event and the repetitive swordplay and inane plot contrivances simply become boring by the end". Richard Roeper gave a positive review, saying [...] "Gore Verbinski and the stunt and special effects crews have created one of the most impressive blends of live-action work and CGI wizardry ever put on film," [...] and believing it [...] "rarely drags and is almost always entertaining." [...] He praised the performances of the actors as one of the best things about the film.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{reception}} was, on the whole, lukewarm compared to some earlier works.

2500|$|IGN {{scored the}} game a 9.1/10 {{and said that}} [...] "anyone looking for a first-person shooter that offers more than flat, stereotypical {{characters}} and copy-and-paste supersoldier plots, one that attempts to establish a {{sense of right and}} wrong and loops you into the decision making process, and one that's set in one of the most vividly realized settings around should pick up BioShock 2. It's a game in which story, setting, and gameplay are expertly blended to create an experience that's as thought-provoking as it is entertaining." [...] IGN's review also stated that the game does not look as visually impressive as its predecessor, but it is still one of the best-looking games around because of its unique art style. In a round-table style video chat, IGN editors said that Rapture was less mysterious because players have seen it before, and that was a major strike against the game. Since the original had such an eerie mysterious feel to it, <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> turns seen in the sequel seemed less surprising.|$|E
