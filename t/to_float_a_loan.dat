25|$|In {{the hope}} of {{securing}} international recognition, Seán T. O'Kelly was sent as envoy to Paris to present the Irish case to the Peace Conference convened by the great powers {{at the end of}} World War I. When it became clear by May 1919 that this mission could not succeed, de Valera decided to visit the United States. The mission had three objectives: to ask for official recognition of the Irish Republic, <b>to</b> <b>float</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to finance the work of the Government (and by extension, the Irish Republican Army), and to secure the support of the American people for the republic. His visit lasted from June 1919 to December 1920 and had mixed success. One negative outcome was the splitting of the Irish-American organisations into pro- and anti-de Valera factions. He met the young Harvard-educated leader from Puerto Rico, Pedro Albizu Campos, and forged a lasting and useful alliance with him.|$|E
500|$|In Paris, Slidell {{had been}} {{approached}} by the banking firm Erlanger et Cie. [...] The company offered <b>to</b> <b>float</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to benefit the Confederacy. The proposed terms provided a large commission to Erlanger and would entitle the bondholder to cotton at a discounted price once the South won the war. Baron Frederic Emile d'Erlanger, head of the firm, journeyed to Richmond in early 1863, and negotiated with Benjamin, although the transaction properly fell within the jurisdiction of Treasury Secretary Memminger. The banker softened the terms somewhat, though they were still lucrative for his firm. [...] Benjamin felt the deal was worth it, as it would provide the Confederacy with badly needed funds to pay its agents in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Planning for a Shire Hall in the Gardiner Road District {{commenced}} {{as early}} as 1867. In 1878 land {{at the corner of}} High Street and Glenferrie Road was reserved for a Shire Hall, Court House and Library. Two years later, the estimated cost of erecting a building comprising a Shire Hall, Municipal, Post and Telegraph Offices, Library and Reading Room was £4,000. The Council considered the Shire could not afford to pay such a sum, and the members were against borrowing the money. In August, 1884, the proposal was again considered, and in November, the Council decided <b>to</b> <b>float</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of £5,000 for the purpose of building a Shire Hall.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike France and Britain, at the {{outbreak}} of the First World War Germany found itself largely excluded from international financial markets. This became most apparent after <b>an</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>float</b> <b>a</b> major <b>loan</b> on Wall Street failed in 1914. As such, Germany was largely limited to domestic borrowing, which was induced by a series of war credit bills passing the Reichstag. This took place in many forms; however, the most publicised was the public war bond (...) drives.|$|R
5000|$|The use {{of checks}} in a scam {{hinges on the}} {{practice}} or law in many countries concerning checks: when an account holder presents a check for deposit, the bank will usually make the funds available to the account holder within 1-5 business days, although checks, particularly if international, may take longer than that to clear. The clearing process may take 7-10 days, and {{can take up to}} a month when dealing with foreign banks. The time between the funds appearing as available to the account holder and the check clearing is known as the [...] "float", during which time the bank could technically be said <b>to</b> have <b>floated</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> <b>to</b> the account holder to be covered with the funds from the bank clearing the check. Even after it has cleared, funds may be reclaimed much later if fraud is discovered.|$|R

50|$|A revised law {{on civil}} service {{pensions}} was passed on 9 June 1853.On 8 March 1854 a bill was passed <b>to</b> <b>float</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> {{to fund the}} expenses of the Crimean War. The loan was raised through issuance of bonds to the public, an innovation. Demand greatly exceed the amount required. To meet payments on the war bonds, the 1855 budget had to increase the floating debt, and was passed with difficulty.A second war loan was authorized on 31 December 1854, and was again successful. The size of subscriptions was limited to encourage large numbers of small subscriptions by the supporters of the emperor. With deteriorating health, {{by the end of}} 1854 Beneau was forced to hand over control of the Finance ministry to Baroche.|$|E
50|$|When the First Dáil met in 1919, Éamon de Valera was the {{president}} of Sinn Féin and thus the natural choice for leadership. However he had been imprisoned in England so, at the second meeting of the Dáil on 22 January, Cathal Brugha was elected as the first Príomh Aire on a temporary basis. De Valera escaped Lincoln Gaol in February and so was elected to replace Brugha at the Dáil's third meeting on 1 April. As leader de Valera visited the United States from June 1919 to December 1920. His aim was to gain both popular and official recognition for the Republic, and <b>to</b> <b>float</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to finance Dáil Éireann and the War of Independence. By his return de Valera had won public but not official support for the Republic and had raised a loan of $6 million.|$|E

The Brazilian government was forced to deny these spurious allegations several times. The New York Times remarked: [...] The rumor is that the three warships ... ordered Britain two years ago will be launched from English shores only to fly the German flag. It is asserted that these ships, which are named the Sao Paulo, the Minas Geras sic and the Rio de Janeiro, and all of which will be completed by next fall, will be conveyed to the German government on the payment of $30,000,000.It may be recalled that when orders were placed for the ships ... there was much speculation as to the destiny of the vessels, as no naval expert could understand how a second-rate power like Brazil needed such formidable engines of war which would represent absolutely the latest stages of naval construction and armament. Meanwhile, it had been reported that the ships were being built for the Japanese government, which had a secret understanding with Brazil. But this theory was soon discarded by the fact that relations between these two countries were not extremely cordial on account of the attitude of Brazil toward the immigration of Japanese laborers. Then it was semi-officially stated that the ships would never leave the ways except to fly the British flag, but the money for such a purpose could only be raised by <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> or the Admiralty getting the sum from the sinking fund—contingencies which would naturally become public property long before they could be carried out.|$|R
25|$|Up {{until the}} mid-50s, postwar {{construction}} had been financed on tax surpluses accumulated during World War II and the Korean War. After those surpluses ran out, further construction was financed on state bond issues. However, the state {{at that time}} would not finance student housing, and UCLA comprised 17,000 students with only Hershey Hall (originally constructed in 1930 as a 129-bed women's dorm) accommodating any students on campus. So the Regents <b>floated</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> {{from the federal government}} to build Dykstra Hall and Sproul Hall on the hill west of the athletic fields. They opened in 1959 and 1960, respectively. The UCLA Faculty Club assessed their membership $100 apiece and <b>floated</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> from the Regents to build the Faculty Center, which was completed in 1959. Ackerman Union was also built from <b>a</b> Regents <b>loan</b> paid for by fees self-assessed by students in this period.|$|R

50|$|De Valera {{went on to}} {{be named}} President of Dáil Éireann, and in May 1919 he visited the United States in this role. The mission had three objectives: to ask for {{official}} recognition of the Irish Republic, <b>to</b> <b>float</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to finance {{the work of the}} Government (and by extension, the Irish Republican Army), and to secure the support of the American people for the republic. His visit lasted from June 1919 to December 1920 and had mixed success. One negative outcome was the splitting of the Irish-American organisations into pro- and anti-de Valera factions. De Valera managed to raise $5,500,000 from American supporters, an amount that far exceeded the hopes of the Dáil. Of this, $500,000 was devoted to the American presidential campaign in 1920 which helped him gain wider public support there. In 1921 it was said that $1,466,000 had already been spent, and it is unclear when the net balance arrived in Ireland. Recognition was not forthcoming in the international sphere. He also had difficulties with various Irish-American leaders, such as John Devoy and Judge Daniel F. Cohalan, who resented the dominant position he established, preferring to retain their control over Irish affairs in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the entire}} war {{the notion that}} the CSA possessed a most {{efficient}} engine of war in its monopoly of cotton (the [...] "King Cotton" [...] idea) buoyed up the hopes of the Confederates. The government in Richmond strained every effort to induce the great powers of Europe to recognize the Confederacy as a nation (see Cotton diplomacy). It also - more successfully - secured individual foreigners' financial recognition of the Confederate States by effecting a foreign loan based on cotton. This favorite notion went into practice in the spring of 1863. The French banking house of Erlanger & Company undertook <b>to</b> <b>float</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of $3,000,000, redeemable after the war in cotton at the rate of sixpence a pound. According to one source, [...] Baron Rothschild informed W. W. Murphy, American consul-general in Frankfort, that [...] "all Germany condemned this act of lending money to establish a slaveholding government, and so great was public opinion against it that Erlanger and Company dare not offer it on the Frankfort bourse". As cotton at the time was selling at nearly four times that figure, and would presumably be quoted far above sixpence long after the establishment of peace, the bonds offered strong attractions to those speculatively inclined and in sympathy with the Confederate cause. The Confederate agents mismanaged the placing of the bonds in Europe, but notwithstanding, a considerable sum was secured from the public and used for the purchase of naval and military stores. This was aided in part by the (incorrect) assumption of some investors that, even should the Confederacy lose the war, the United States government would honor and redeem the bonds. However, {{at the close of the}} war the re-established Federal authorities ignored these foreign bonds, like all the other bonds of the Confederate government, or of state governments under the Confederacy.|$|E
