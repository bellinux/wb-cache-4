5|$|RNA {{interference}} {{has been}} used for applications in biotechnology and is nearing commercialization in others. RNAi has developed many novel crops such as nicotinefree tobacco, decaffeinated coffee, nutrient fortified and hypoallergenic crops. The genetically engineered Arctic apples received FDA approval in 2015. The apples were produced by RNAi suppression of PPO (polyphenol oxidase) gene making apple varieties <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> undergo browning after being sliced. PPO-silenced apples are unable to convert chlorogenic acid into quinone product.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of HIT requires stopping heparin treatment, and both protection from thrombosis and choice of an agent <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> reduce the platelet count any further. Several alternatives {{are available for}} this purpose and mainly used are danaparoid, fondaparinux, argatroban and bivalirudin.|$|E
5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E

5|$|During construction, {{the weight}} had {{increased}} from 149 to 170 tonnes; to reduce this to 158 tonnes, {{the original idea}} of step-free access was discontinued. Instead, a wheelchair lift was installed, but it proved not to work.

The Norwegian Federation of Organisations of Disabled People have criticized Flytoget for ordering identical additional cars <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> ease access for the disabled.|$|E
5|$|Sedna {{will come}} to {{perihelion}} around 2075–2076. This close approach to the Sun {{provides an opportunity for}} study <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> occur again for 12,000 years. Although Sedna is listed on NASA's Solar System exploration website, NASA is not known to be considering any type of mission at this time. It was calculated that a flyby mission to Sedna could take 24.48 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on launch dates of 6 May 2033 and 23 June 2046. Sedna would be 77.27 or 76.43AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, several cybernetically enhanced aliens are accidentally reanimated by a research team in the Arctic. The aliens assimilate the researchers and their ship before escaping into space. The Enterprise pursues the ship and is attacked, forcing Archer to destroy the vessel. Afterwards they discover that the aliens sent a message into the Delta Quadrant containing the coordinates of Earth, a message <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> arrive until the 24th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemical}} reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, {{in which one}} chemical is transformed {{through a series of}} steps into another chemical, by a sequence of enzymes. Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy. Enzymes act as catalysts that allow the reactions to proceed more rapidly. Enzymes also allow the regulation of metabolic pathways in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm petrel}} is migratory, {{spending}} {{the northern hemisphere}} winter mainly in cool waters off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, south to latitude 38°S and east to KwaZulu-Natal. Some birds stay north of the equator in the seas adjoining Mauritania and Rio de Oro, and a few remain near the breeding islands, especially in the Mediterranean. It is strictly oceanic outside the breeding season, although it is described as regularly seen from land in West Africa. Young birds do {{not return to the}} breeding colonies until their second or third year. Birds mostly head south from the breeding islands between September and November, reaching West Africa by mid-November and the south Atlantic {{by the end of the}} year. The return passage starts in April, with late records from the tropics and further south probably representing sub-adult birds <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> breed that year.|$|E
5|$|They usually winter along coasts and on inland lakes, bays, inlets, and streams, {{with birds}} {{migrating}} {{to the nearest}} body of water <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> freeze over in the winter: western Canadian loons go to the Pacific, Great Lakes loons to the Gulf of Mexico region, eastern Canadian loons to the Atlantic, and some loons to large inland lakes and reservoirs. They appear {{in most of the}} inland waters of the United States. The South Carolina coast, the Gulf coast adjacent to the Florida panhandle, and the Atlantic seaboard from Massachusetts to Maine have some of the highest concentrations of common loons. Occasional vagrants are recorded inland in Mexico, in San Luis Potosí and Coahuila, as well as in Chiapas and Oaxaca in the south. They are accidental in northern Japan and the Commander Islands in northwestern Pacific, and Cuba in the West Indies.|$|E
