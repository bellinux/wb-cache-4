40|$|The {{existence}} of gold-arsenic mineralization, {{the presence of}} enhanced concentrations of gold in arsenopyrite, especially in its fine grain varieties showing positive gold-arsenic ratios in gold-quartz and gold-pyritic ores indicate {{the important role of}} As in hydrothermal gold transport. The most accessible approach to the investigation of these complicated systems is provided by physico-chemical modeling. In the present work the isobaric isothermal potentials (DG°f 298) of thioarsenides, the most important group of arsenic compounds in the solution, have been determined and refined {{on the basis of the}} creation of physico-chemical models using the data on the As sulfide solubility in the As – S – O – H system. The data obtained were reconciled with the thermodynamic data available by solving the reverse thermodynamic problem. Numerical physico-chemical modeling has been carried out for a series of tests in both pure water and hydrogen sulfide solutions (0. 0032 - 0. 011 m) with the initial pH values from 1. 14 to 8. 4 in the 25 - 250 °C temperature range under saturated water steam pressure. The computer-calculated constants are included in the modeling of tests on orpiment dissolution in sulfide-sodium solutions. The As 2 S 3 ryst solubility in the 25 - 250 °C temperature range has first been obtained. A specific feature of the process is a sharp increase in dissolved arsenic total concentration as the pH value of the hydrothermal phase rises from 4 to 6 - 7. Concentration increases and gradient decreases with temperature rise. The predominant forms are represented by <b>thioarsenites.</b> Just as in acidic, so in weakly and moderately alkaline solutions the orpiment solubility is caused by the concentration combination of thioarsenous acid H 3 AsS 3 and its oligomers H 4 As 2 S 50 and H 2 As 2 S 40. At a temperature of over 200 - 250 °C these concentrations can be compared only with that of the AsOH (HS) 2 o complex of mixed composition. ...|$|R
40|$|Formation {{constants}} for <b>thioarsenite</b> {{species have}} been determined in dilute solutions at 25 °C, ΣH 2 S from 10 - 7. 5 to 10 - 3. 0 M, ΣAs from 10 - 5. 6 to 10 - 4. 8 M, and pH 7 and 10. The principal inorganic arsenic species in anoxic aquatic systems are arsenite, As(OH) 3 0, and a mononuclear <b>thioarsenite</b> with an S/As ratio of 3 : 1. Thioarsenic species with S/As ratios of 1 : 1, 2 : 1, and 4 : 1 are lesser components in sulfidic solutions that might be encountered in natural aquatic environments. Thioarsenites dominate arsenic speciation at sulfide concentrations > 10 - 4. 3 M at neutral pH. Conversion from neutral As(OH) 3 0 to anionic <b>thioarsenite</b> species may regulate the transport and fate of arsenic in sulfate-reducing environments by governing sorption and mineral precipitation reactions. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Raman {{spectra of}} <b>thio{{arsenite}}</b> and arsenite species {{in aqueous solution}} were obtained at room temperature. Solutions at constant ΣAs + ΣS of 0. 1 and 0. 5 mol kg - 1 were prepared with various ΣS/ΣAs ratios (0. 1 – 9. 0) and pH values (~ 7 – 13. 2). Our {{data suggest that the}} speciation of As under the conditions investigated is more complicated than previously thought. The Raman measurements offer evidence for at least six separate S-bearing As species whose principal bands are centered near 365, 385, 390, 400, 415 and 420 cm - 1. The data suggest that at least two different species may give rise to bands at 385 cm - 1, bringing the probable minimum number of species to seven. Several additional species are possible but could not be resolved definitively. In general, the relative proportions of these species are dependent on total As concentration, ΣS/ΣAs ratio and pH. At very low ΣS/ΣAs ratios we also observe Raman bands attributable to the dissociation products of H 3 AsO 3 (aq). Although we were unable to assign precise stoichiometries for the various <b>thioarsenite</b> species, we were able to map out general pH and ΣS/ΣAs conditions under which the various <b>thioarsenite</b> and arsenite species are predominant.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of refractory gold concentrates containing arsenopyrite and pyrite and {{the simultaneous}} dissolution {{of gold in}} aerated alkaline solutions at ambient temperatures and pressures without the addition of cyanide has been studied. It involves the following aspects: the chemistry of the oxidation of pure arsenopyrite and pyrite minerals in aerated alkaline solutions; the kinetics of oxidation of arsenopyrite and the simultaneous dissolution of gold in such solutions; the kinetics of simultaneous dissolution of gold during the alkaline oxidation of refractory gold concentrates; the electrochemistry of gold in alkaline solutions containing thiosulfate or monothioarsenate; the effect of copper on the leaching of gold in alkaline thiosulfate solutions; and the leaching of gold in alkaline solutions with thioarsenites. The nature and proportions of {{the products of the}} oxidation of arsenopyrite in aerated alkaline solutions have been studied using high pressure ion chromatography techniques that have shown that thiosulfate and a new species, monothioarsenate, are the main oxidation products of arsenopyrite apart from arsenate and sulfite. The alkaline oxidation of pyrite primarily yields thiosulfate and sulfite. A kinetic investigation of the oxidation of arsenopyrite with air or oxygen has shown that the initial rate of arsenopyrite oxidation is proportional to the concentration of dissolved oxygen. A reaction mechanism for the oxidation of arsenopyrite has been proposed, which involves an anodic oxidation of the mineral involving hydroxyl ions coupled to a cathodic process for oxygen reduction which is partially controlled by mass transfer of dissolved oxygen to the mineral surface. Detailed studies of the dissolution behaviour of gold in aerated alkaline solutions in the presence of thiosulfate or monothioarsenate by electrochemical and leaching methods have demonstrated that the dissolution rate is very low as compared to that of gold in alkaline cyanide or ammoniacal thiosulfate solutions. It has been found that copper ions catalyze the dissolution of gold in the thiosulfate solutions in the absence of ammonia. The leaching experiments also have shown that gold may dissolve in alkaline <b>thioarsenite</b> solutions, which provides a possible new process option for the leaching of gold. The oxidation of refractory arsenical gold concentrates in aerated alkaline solutions results in the formation of thiosulfate, arsenate and sulfate as well as the dissolution of gold, copper and iron. It appears that the dissolution of gold is due to the complex reactions of gold with thiosulfate ions promoted by the catalytic effect of copper ions. Up to 80...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} has two objectives; {{the first}} is to investigate speciation of three d 10 metals (Ag(I), Hg(II) and Pb(II)) in sulfidic solutions containing As(III) to determine if <b>thioarsenite</b> could act as a ligand for the metals. Second, a hypothesis that As(III) forms strong complexes with bicarbonate is investigated. The solubility of As in sulfidic solutions (10 - 4 - 10 - 3 M) equilibrated with As 2 S 3 +S at near-neutral pH (6. 95 - 7. 95) was measured and compared to the solubility of As in binary and ternary assemblages. Three species, AsS(HS) (OH) -, As(OH) 3 and H 2 As 3 S 6 -, explain As speciation: 0. 5 As 2 S 3 + 3 H 2 O &# 61659; As(OH) 3 + 1. 5 H 2 S, pK= 12. 58, 1. 5 As 2 S 3 + 1. 5 H 2 S &# 61659; H 2 As 3 S 6 - + H+, pK= 6. 20 &# 61617; 0. 77 and 0. 5 As 2 S 3 + H 2 O + 0. 5 H 2 S&# 61659; AsS(HS) (OH) - + H+ pK= 8. 74 &# 61617; 0. 09. The solubility of As and Ag in sulfidic solutions (10 - 4 - 10 - 3 M) equilibrated with two Ag-As-S assemblages at near-neutral pH (6. 89 - 8. 37) was measured. The As species that explained As 2 S 3 +S solubility also explained solubilities in the Ag-As-S system. The silver solubility was explained by six species: 0. 5 Ag 2 S(s) + 1. 5 HS- + 0. 5 H+ &# 61659; Ag(HS) 2 -, pK= 0. 406 &# 61617; 0. 41; Ag 2 S (s) + 2 HS- &# 61659; Ag 2 S(HS) 22 -, pK= 4. 78; 0. 5 Ag 2 S (s) + 0. 5 HS- + 0. 5 H+ &# 61659; Ag(HS) pK= 2. 11 &# 61617; 0. 21; 0. 5 Ag 2 S (s) + Cl- + 0. 5 HS- + 0. 5 H+ &# 61659; Ag(Cl) (HS) -, pK=- 1. 09 &# 61617; 0. 20; 0. 5 Ag 2 S (s) + (x- 1) S&# 61616; + 0. 5 HS- &# 61659; AgSx- + 0. 5 H+, pK= 8. 51 &# 61617; 0. 19 and Ag+ + AsS(HS) (OH) - &# 61659; AgAsS(HS) (OH) o, pK=- 17. 17 &# 61617; 0. 20. As shown by the last equilibrium expressions, dithioarsenite (AsS(HS) (OH) -) is a strong ligand for Ag(I). Two other ternary systems, HgS+As 2 S 3 +S and PbS+As 2 S 3 +S, were investigated but the solubility of Hg 2 + and Pb 2 + were not significantly enhanced when arsenic was present. The order of stability of the metal-thioarsenite complexes agrees with predictions by Tossell (2000). The &# 61508;GFo of natural orpiment was calculated to be - 80. 8 &# 61617; 1. 6. The solubility of As 2 O 3 in concentrated bicarbonate solutions at near-neutral pH is enhanced to a small, but statistically significant degree compared to the solubility in chloride solutions of the same ionic strength. This effect is attributed to one complex: As(OH) 3 + HCO 3 - &# 61659; As(OH) 2 CO 3 -, pK= 0. 57 &# 61617; 0. 15. The small constant suggests that As(III) -carbonate complexes will be negligible at carbonate concentrations found in nature...|$|E
