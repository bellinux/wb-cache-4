40|$|<b>The</b> Italian <b>appraisal</b> {{practice}} {{is characterized by}} valuations developed in subjective opinions formulated by the valuers, according to the experience and the competence {{rather than on the}} survey of the market data of comparable properties. This practice makes up for the lack of information on the real estate market and to the consequent absence of systematic collections of market data. This tradition is in <b>the</b> cadastral <b>appraisal</b> for <b>the</b> rural (1886) and urban properties (1939). The assessed income is appraised for a representative property and wide to all the other properties with arbitrary scores (pure number). The assessed value is derived from the income with fixed multipliers. The reform of <b>the</b> cadastral <b>appraisals</b> (2013) provides <b>the</b> employment of predetermined statistic functions rather than the automated valuation models applied in <b>the</b> mass <b>appraisal.</b> There are therefore ample spaces to rationalize the Italian valuations.

5000|$|<b>The</b> coping <b>appraisal</b> {{consists}} of <b>the</b> response efficacy, self-efficacy, {{and the response}} costs. Response efficacy is {{the effectiveness of the}} recommended behavior in removing or preventing possible harm. Self-efficacy is the belief that one can successfully enact the recommended behavior. The response costs are the costs associated with the recommended behavior. The amount of coping ability that one experiences is the combination of response efficacy and self-efficacy, minus the response costs. <b>The</b> coping <b>appraisal</b> process focuses on the adaptive responses and one's ability to cope with and avert the threat. <b>The</b> coping <b>appraisal</b> is <b>the</b> sum of <b>the</b> <b>appraisals</b> of <b>the</b> responses efficacy and self-efficacy, minus any physical or psychological [...] "costs" [...] of adopting the recommended preventive response. Coping <b>Appraisal</b> involves <b>the</b> individual's assessment of the response efficacy of the recommended behavior (i.e. perceived effectiveness of sunscreen in preventing premature aging) as well as one's perceived self-efficacy in carrying out the recommended actions.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the heterogeneous appraiser behavior and its implication on <b>the</b> traditional <b>appraisal</b> smoothing theory. We {{show that the}} partial adjustment model is consistent with <b>the</b> traditional <b>appraisal</b> smoothing argument only when all the appraisers choose the same smoothing technique. However, if appraiser behavior is heterogeneous and exhibits cross-sectional variation due to the difference in their access to, and interpretation of information, the model actually leads to a mixed outcome: The variance of the appraisal-based returns can be higher or lower than the variance of transaction-based return depending {{on the degree of}} such heterogeneity. Using data from the residential market, we find that, contrary to what <b>the</b> traditional <b>appraisal</b> smoothing theory would predict, appraisal-based indices may not suffer any “smoothing” bias. These findings suggest that <b>the</b> traditional <b>appraisal</b> smoothing theory, which fails to consider the heterogeneity of appraiser behaviors, exaggerates <b>the</b> effect of <b>appraisal</b> smoothing. ...|$|R

25|$|Lenders {{argue that}} the real estate attorney's fee, for example, is a {{pass-through}} cost, not a cost of the lending. In effect, they are arguing that the attorney's fee is a separate transaction and {{not a part of}} the loan. Consumer advocates argue that this would be true if the customer is free to select which attorney is used. If the lender insists, however, on using a specific attorney, the cost should be looked at as a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees – for example, when the lender receives money from the attorney and other agents to be the one used by the lender. Because of this, U.S. regulators require all lenders to produce an affiliated business disclosure form which shows the amounts paid between the lender and <b>the</b> <b>appraisal</b> firms, attorneys, etc.|$|E
25|$|Computers {{have been}} playing an {{increasing}} role in PA for some time (Sulsky & Keown, 1998). There are two main aspects to this. The first is {{in relation to the}} electronic monitoring of performance, which affords the ability to record a huge amount of data on multiple dimensions of work performance (Stanton, 2000). Not only does it facilitate a more continuous and detailed collection of performance data in some jobs, e.g. call centres, but it has the capacity to do so in a non-obvious, covert manner. The second aspect is in mediating the feedback process, by recording and aggregating performance ratings and written observations and making the information available on-line; many software packages are available for this. The use of IT in these ways undoubtedly helps in making <b>the</b> <b>appraisal</b> process more manageable, especially where multiple rating sources are involved, but it also raises many questions about appraisees' reactions and possible effects on PA outcomes. Mostly, the evidence so far is positive.|$|E
5000|$|Protection {{motivation}} {{theory is}} a theory that was originally created to help clarify fear appeals. The protection motivation theory proposes that people protect themselves based on four factors: the perceived severity of a threatening event, the perceived probability of the occurrence, or vulnerability, {{the efficacy of the}} recommended preventive behavior, and the perceived self efficacy. [...] Protection motivation stems from both <b>the</b> threat <b>appraisal</b> and <b>the</b> coping <b>appraisal.</b> <b>The</b> threat <b>appraisal</b> assesses <b>the</b> severity of the situation and examines how serious the situation is. <b>The</b> coping <b>appraisal</b> is how one responds to the situation. <b>The</b> coping <b>appraisal</b> consists of both efficacy and self-efficacy. Efficacy is the individual's expectancy that carrying out recommendations can remove the threat. Self-efficacy is the belief in one's ability to execute the recommended courses of action successfully. PMT is one model that explains why people engage in unhealthy practices and offers suggestions for changing those behaviors. It is educational and motivational. Primary prevention: taking measures to combat the risk of developing a health problem. (e.g., controlling weight to prevent high blood pressure). Secondary prevention: taking steps to prevent a condition from becoming worse. (e.g., remembering to take daily medication to control blood pressure).|$|R

25|$|Three {{different}} approaches {{are commonly used}} in business valuation: the income approach, the asset-based approach, and the market approach. Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining {{the value of a}} business using the definition of value appropriate for <b>the</b> <b>appraisal</b> assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the net present value of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the First chicago method which essentially combines the income approach with the market approach.|$|E
