5|$|Fire or Police Linked Service – In {{countries}} such as the United States, Japan, Hong Kong and France ambulances can be operated by the local fire or police service, more commonly the fire service due to overlapping calls. This is particularly common in rural areas, where maintaining a separate service is not necessarily cost effective, or by service preference such as in LA where the LAFD prefers <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>all</b> parts of emergency medicine in-house.

5|$|In November 1968, Grant {{secured a}} $143,000 advance {{contract}} from Atlantic Records, {{which was then}} the biggest deal of its kind for a new band. Atlantic were a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul, and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s they began to {{take an interest in}} British progressive rock acts. Record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them. Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour, and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>all</b> publishing rights.|$|E

The Philippine consulate also expected a large workload {{as a result of}} the rehiring provisions. Chinese newspapers published articles calculating how households could maximise their benefits under the waiver rules. Street protests on 3 August decried the waiver's unfairness and its burden on the Immigration Department. According to one protester, the waiver would teach households how to use legal loopholes.|$|E

5|$|At the Country Disc Jockey Convention {{in early}} November, Presley was voted the year's most {{promising}} male artist. Several record companies had by now shown interest in signing him.

Presley, at 20, was still a minor, so his father signed the contract. Parker arranged with the owners of Hill and Range Publishing, Jean and Julian Aberbach, to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>all</b> the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one third of their customary royalties in exchange for having him perform their compositions.

5|$|Prior to World War II, Heimdal {{had been}} {{proposed}} as a {{location for the}} primary airport for Trondheim. Construction had started with drainage and ground works, but this work was interrupted by the war. Because of the large investments made to Værnes by Luftwaffe, a commission was established in 1947 to look into if Værnes or Lade instead should be selected. The commission was unanimous in recommending Værnes, highlighting that the airport was of a sufficient size <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>all</b> civilian and military needs in the foreseeable future, and emphasized the proximity to the railway and highway. However, the commission recommended that Heimdal and Lade be kept as possibilities for future expansion. When the issue was discussed in Parliament, several members of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications focused on the long distance to Trondheim, but the low investment needs (stipulated to NOK 1.3 million for necessary navigation and air control investments) convinced parliament, who passed legislation in favor of Værnes on 10 June 1952.|$|E

25|$|Star Wars: Bounty Hunter began {{life when}} LucasArts {{was asked to}} make an Episode II-based game which {{featured}} Jango Fett. In March 2001 game design documents were presented, and development began shortly after. The PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube versions of the game have different custom in-house graphics engines, each designed specifically {{to take advantage of}} the two platforms' unique strengths and work around their unique limitations, but the core game engine is identical. In the PS2 version they took advantage of both vector unit (VU) chips to drive the graphics to maximum performance. The DMA bandwidth was taken advantage of to use a high number of textures. There is full-screen antialiasing and texture mip mapping support. They used the second VU1 chip <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>all</b> the character skinning and VU0 <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>all</b> the skeletal animation transforms. Which enabled dozens of characters to be on-screen without bogging down the frame rate. They had 10 individually optimized rendering loops on VU1 to speed up the rendering process. Their PS2 graphics engine could move 10,000,000 triangles per second, and adding the gameplay, collision, logic, textures, sound would go down accordingly to around 30,000 to 50,000 triangles per frame, all at an average frame rate of 30 frames per second.|$|E
