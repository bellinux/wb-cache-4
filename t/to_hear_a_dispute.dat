5000|$|Conflict of laws, {{often called}} [...] "private {{international}} law" [...] in civil law jurisdictions, is distinguished from {{public international law}} because it governs conflicts between private persons rather than states (or other international bodies with standing). It concerns the questions of which jurisdiction should be permitted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> legal <b>dispute</b> between private parties, and which jurisdiction's law should be applied, therefore raising issues of international law. Today corporations are increasingly capable of shifting capital and labor supply chains across borders, as well as trading with overseas corporations.

At an early age she married William Travers, a tobacconist at the Three Feathers, Watling Street, London.

Her stability and discretion contrasted - according to the Dictionary of National Biography - with the extravagances of the handful of Quaker women who contributed to Nayler's fall.

40|$|Britain 2 ̆ 7 s Lord Denning {{once said}} that “as a moth is drawn to the light, so is a {{litigant}} drawn to the United States. ” Certainly, as a pro-arbitration state and a signatory to various international conventions concerning the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, the United States seems a natural place {{to bring an action}} to enforce an arbitral award against a foreign state or state agency. However, suing a sovereign has not traditionally been a simple task in the United States or elsewhere. Most nations grant foreign states the presumption of immunity, thus denying that their domestic courts have jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> involving a foreign sovereign unless an exception to immunity exists. For years, U. S. courts took a highly deferential, “hands-off” approach to litigation involving a foreign sovereign. However, recent case law out of the D. C. Circuit has radically diminished the jurisdictional elements that plaintiffs must establish before a U. S. court will assert its power to enforce an arbitral award against a foreign state or state agency. This article investigates this recent shift and describes what contacts, if any, a foreign state or state agency must have with the United States before a U. S. court will assert jurisdiction under sections 1605 (a) (1) and 1605 (a) (6) of the U. S. Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”).

40|$|In Australia, {{a supreme}} court has a {{supervisory}} role over the statutory adjudication process that has been established within the security of payment legislation. In this role, the courts have quashed many adjudication determinations {{on the grounds of}} jurisdictional error in recent years. This is a problem as the courts’ involvement in statutory adjudication is contrary to the object of the legislation. When reviewing adjudication determinations, the courts have adopted different approaches with respect to determining the role of adjudicators and the essential jurisdictional facts that must exist in order for an adjudicator to have jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> referred <b>disputed</b> matter. This diversification of judicial interpretation with respect to jurisdictional error is confusing, not only to construction professionals, but also to many lawyers. Via a desktop study– where the evidence is mainly garnered from case law, governmental reports and commentaries – this paper reviews the legal complexities involved in diagnosing jurisdictional errors. In doing so, the paper aims to answer the question as to why the adjudication process has become bogged down in the quagmire of judicial review. The paper concludes that the evolving inconsistency of case law in relation to statutory adjudication is a crucial factor contributing to the erosion of the object of the security of payment legislation in Australia. Moving forward, the paper argues that establishing a legislative review mechanism of jurisdictional challenges may be sufficient to address this problem...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} ruling (Parry Sound (District) Social Services Administration Board v. O. P. S. E. U., Local 324, 2003 SCC 42), the Supreme Court of Canada states that an {{arbitrator}} has jurisdiction <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>a</b> <b>dispute</b> that involves rights guaranteed by codes, charters and employment legislation {{even if the}} arbitrator has been barred from such recourse under a collective agreement. In the case at issue, an employee with probationary status benefited from maternity leave and was discharged upon her return. Despite {{the clarity of the}} wording under the collective agreement stating that a probationary employee may not resort to arbitration, a grievance was filed and was worded as follows: [Translation] “.  .  .  was discharged without reason and this decision is arbitrary, discriminatory, unjust and vitiated by bad faith. ”Owing to the rights vesting in the employee under the Employment Standards Act (Ontario), the Board of Arbitration ruled on its own jurisdiction to hear such a grievance. This decision was quashed in judicial review (Superior Court) and but was then upheld in Court of Appeal and once again by the Supreme Court of Canada (majority 7 / 9). The Supreme Court of Canada began by making several observations concerning the criteria of judgment applicable to judicial review, namely that which is considered patently unreasonable. An attempt was made to distinguish between an unreasonable decision and one that would be patently unreasonable. It seems to us that such a distinction remains ambiguous and further confuses the exercising of a fair judicial review; unreasonableness should not be graded by degrees. In a second approach, the ruling establishes the relationship between State standards (Codes, Charters and employment legislation) and contractual standards. Working from the basis that State standards would be incorporated into the collective agreement, the Court establishes that the limit imposed upon the collective agreement regarding access to arbitration had the practical effect of denying the right to maternity leave, elsewhere guaranteed by law. For this reason, the arbitrator had to intervene and exercise control in order to ensure respect for established standards of public order. To achieve these ends, the Supreme Court of Canada seemed to experience considerable difficulty in qualifying the collective agreement and classified it in the category of private contracts. Such a categorization, confined to the traditional “public/private” dichotomy, dismisses the true legal and desired effect seeking to make the collective agreement a regulatory labour provision complementary to statutes governing public order and intimately related to the latter. In support of his line of reasoning, Judge Iacobucci, on behalf of the majority (7 / 9), repeatedly referred to the ruling: McLeod v. Egan, [1975] 1 S. C. R. 517. The referrals denied under this ruling are hardly convincing and uselessly weigh down the reasoning. Moreover, Judge Major (dissenting) also referred to it and considered that Judge Iacobucci was reading into the McLeod v. Egan ruling a purport that it just does not have. In all, we believe that the codes, charters and employment legislation serve as the basis upon which the collective agreement is built and, consequently, the parties’ contractual freedom both derives from this basis and is limited thereto. This interrelation would be analogous to that of the Constitution and employment statutes, without it being possible to affirm that the Constitution would be found {{to be a part of}} each of these statutes. This ruling is especially interesting because it recognizes the employee’s right to resort to arbitration in order to ensure respect for guarantees stipulated in employment legislation, despite wording to the contrary in the collective agreement. Parties to collective agreements and arbitrators must therefore respectively correct their approach and grant access to arbitration for all employees from the very moment that their fundamental rights are jeopardized in any way...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the disturbingly growing use of external professional standards by public {{colleges and universities}} to squelch students’ First Amendment speech rights. Using the 2016 decision by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Keefe v. Adams and the 2015 decision by the Ninth Circuit in Oyama v. University of Hawaii as analytical springboards, the article exposes the tension between two competing First Amendment rights – the institutional academic freedom of public universities to control curricula and the free speech rights of public university students {{both on and off}} campus. Without guidance from the Supreme Court, lower courts are foundering and applying inconsistent standards to analyze professional-standards cases affecting college students.
