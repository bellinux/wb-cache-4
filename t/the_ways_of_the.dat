Initially suspicious of the young crocodile but ultimately won over by its innocence, King Rufus and the Gobbos decide to raise it as one of their own and teach it in <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gobbo. The crocodile, named Croc, grows, eventually becoming much larger than the Gobbos.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the alien {{substance}} Terrigen was released into the ecosystem, Joey Gutierrez developed metal-melting abilities. Unable to control this power, Gutierrez is confronted in the streets by soldiers {{who are willing to}} use lethal force to detain him. Gutierrez is saved by S.H.I.E.L.D., and Inhuman agent Daisy Johnson attempts to explain to him that he is also an Inhuman, with a dormant gene within him that was activated by the Terrigen. Struggling to help Gutierrez accept what has happened to him, Johnson seeks the help of Lincoln Campbell, the Inhuman who helped her transition but has now renounced <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Inhumans, wishing to live a normal life.|$|E
5|$|The Lowell System {{combined}} large-scale mechanization with {{an attempt}} to improve the stature of its female workforce and workers. A few girls who came with their mothers or older sisters were as young as ten years old, some were middle-aged, but the average age was about 24. Usually hired for contracts of one year (the average stay was about four years), new employees were given assorted tasks as spare hands and paid a fixed daily wage while more experienced loom operators would be paid by the piece. They were paired with more experienced women, who trained them in <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factory.|$|E

50|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Open Palm, {{the key to}} {{maintaining}} the universe is by being in harmony with nature, one's surroundings, and one's station in life. As an effect of being in nature with one's surroundings, one is expected to actively assist in lessening the chaos in the area, through <b>the</b> assistance <b>of</b> lessening burdens. <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Open Palm dictates that a character should not act outside a specific station and purpose in life. According to <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Closed Fist, on the other hand, <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> life is to follow <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> serving oneself—to face one's challenges head on, challenge one's station in life, and work to become self-reliant. <b>The</b> emphasis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Closed Fist is combat, turmoil, and constantly challenging oneself. Many {{of those who are}} evil tend to be considered to follow <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Closed Fist, in that they bring about chaos in the universe.|$|R
5|$|Drizzt fights off the resurrected spirit-wraith of {{his father}} in Exile, the second book in the Dark Elf Trilogy and also {{published}} in 1990. Sojourn picks up the story when Drizzt leaves the Underdark for the surface, where he meets a blind human ranger named Montolio Debrouchee. When Montolio begins teaching him <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ranger, Drizzt realizes that, unknowingly, he had been following those very principles his entire life. From then on Drizzt's patron goddess is Mielikki, the Faerûnian goddess of the forest and of rangers. Montolio eventually dies, and Drizzt travels the Realms {{in search of a}} new home. He eventually finds himself in Icewind Dale where he meets dwarven king Bruenor Battlehammer, and Bruenor's adopted human daughter, Catti-brie.|$|E
5|$|In this {{relatively}} liberal environment Jan accompanied the servants in their work, {{listening to their}} stories, learning <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> countryside, and trying to help as best he could. As his knowledge and confidence increased Jan began {{to go out into}} the countryside by himself, exploring the hills and valleys which surrounded him. Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd — first of the pigs and poultry in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect; Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the natural increase of the beasts under their care. As time passed Jan gradually built up a respectable holding of livestock.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot is also {{recognized}} as a bildungsroman, wherein a naive young person matures while learning <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. Rastignac is tutored by Vautrin, Madame de Beauséant, Goriot, and others about the truth of Parisian society and the coldly dispassionate and brutally realistic strategies required for social success. As an everyman, he is initially repulsed by the gruesome realities beneath society's gilded surfaces; eventually, however, he embraces them. Setting aside his original goal of mastering the law, he pursues money and women as instruments for social climbing. In some ways this mirrors Balzac's own social education, reflecting the distaste he acquired for the law after studying it for three years.|$|E

Vlas journeyed from Moscow to meet the oncoming refugees, travelling through to <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian army and recording the hardships and struggling he witnessed along <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> When people died at the roadside, they put up crosses to mark the burial sites, giving the account its title <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross.|$|R
5|$|Marta, a black gray wolf, is alpha {{female in}} a small pack in Pleasant Valley, Montana, that {{consists}} of her mate, Calef, their three pups Rann, Sula, and Annie, and a seven-year-old wolf named Oldtooth. One morning Calef is killed by poachers, leaving Marta and Oldtooth to try to feed and raise the pups on their own. Though an experienced hunter, Oldtooth is unable to bring down large game as he lost most of his teeth chewing a steel leg trap off his leg years ago. Once the cubs {{are old enough to}} be left alone for short periods of time, Marta takes over the bulk of the hunting. Though it is difficult, the two adults successfully keep all three cubs alive and begin weaning them and teaching them <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wolf. In the summer, traps begin appearing in the area as human populations increase. Annie and Sula are caught and are taken away by humans, but reappear a few days later, locked in cages. Marta tries to free her pups but is unsuccessful; however humans come regularly to keep them fed and ensure they have water. Oldtooth is later captured, while Marta is tranquilized from a helicopter. Rann escapes and is not seen again.|$|E
5|$|The droids {{are sold}} to a family of {{moisture}} farmers, whose nephew Luke Skywalker (Chris) wishes to join the Rebellion and fight the Empire. While cleaning the droids, Luke stumbles upon Leia's message inside R2, who later decides to leave the farm. Luke and C-3PO pursue him but are attacked by Sand People. Luke is knocked out by one of them (Opie) and is found by Obi-Wan Kenobi (Herbert), who takes them to his hut. Leia's message explains that R2 contains the plans to the Death Star, which must be sent to her father on her home planet of Alderaan and asks Obi-Wan to help. Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must learn <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Force and accompany him to Alderaan, and gives him his own lightsaber. Realizing that the Empire must be looking for the droids, Luke returns home to discover that his home has been destroyed and his aunt and uncle killed.|$|E
5|$|Talion is then {{sought out}} by the warrior Lithariel, the {{daughter}} of Queen Marwen (Claudia Black), who claims {{to be able to}} assist Celebrimbor with his mission. Marwen is the ruler of Núrn, a kingdom of sea raiders located in the south of Mordor. She uses her powers to guide Talion and Celebrimbor to another of Celebrimbor's relics. Talion also gets help from a Dwarf hunter named Torvin, teaching Talion <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hunt to dominate Caragors and Graugs (beasts native to Mordor), eventually fighting a massive Graug from Torvin's past who killed Torvin's hunting partner, later revealed to be his brother. Later, Marwen advises them to use Celebrimbor's powers to take control of an army of orcs and other beasts, using them to lead an assault against Sauron. Talion eventually realizes that the wizard Saruman is possessing Marwen, and assists Lithariel in freeing her from his control. Talion, however, still carries out Saruman's plan, leading an army of mind-controlled orcs in an assault against the Black Hand's stronghold at Ered Glamhoth. However, rather than the Black Hand, Talion finds the Tower of Sauron waiting for him. The Tower mockingly taunts Talion that Celebrimbor chose him as a host and can free him at any time and offers the elf a place at Sauron's side. Refusing the offer, the two battle and Talion emerges victorious after viciously stabbing the Tower to death with his son's sword. Afterwards, Celebrimbor confesses that the Tower told the truth and promises to let Talion join his family in death if he wishes, once the Black Hand is slain.|$|E

The first Greek {{references}} to the Goths call them Scythians, since this area along the Black Sea historically had been occupied by an unrelated people of that name. The application of that designation to the Goths appears to be not ethnological but rather geographical and cultural - Greeks regarded both the ethnic Scythians and the Goths as barbarians.|$|E
