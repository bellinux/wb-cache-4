5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast {{to the side of the}} ship. The chairs had eye bolts under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh later joined Ernest Joyce {{and others}} on a journey across the Great Ice Barrier to Minna Bluff, to lay a depot for Shackleton's polar party, whose return from their {{southern}} march was awaited. On 3 March, while keeping watch on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> Nimrod, Mackintosh observed a flare, which signalled the safe return of Shackleton and his party. They had fallen just short of their South Pole objective, having reached a Farthest South of 88° 23' S.|$|E

5|$|The chained {{slaves were}} packed under <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> a small vessel named The Schooner York {{to be shipped}} to the island (other sources say the voyage took place aboard The Morovia). During this voyage the Igbo slaves rose up in rebellion, {{taking control of the}} ship and {{drowning}} their captors in the process causing the grounding of the Morovia in Dunbar Creek at the site now locally known as Igbo Landing.|$|E
5|$|After regaining the title, Yokozuna {{challenged}} any American {{athlete to}} bodyslam him on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the USS Intrepid on July 4, 1993. After many challengers failed, Lex Luger arrived by helicopter and bodyslammed Yokozuna. Luger became a fan favorite and changed his gimmick to an American patriot. He faced Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1993; {{he won the}} match by countout but did not win the title. Lex Luger and Bret Hart each earned a title match against Yokozuna the following year at WrestleMania X. Luger was disqualified in his match, but Hart won the championship later that night.|$|E
5|$|At 2pm on Wednesday, March 21, the Spray {{collided}} with the Lucinda four miles north of Barnegat, New Jersey, knocking {{a hole in the}} Sprays bow that resulted in her filling with water; the Lucinda also sustained damage. Capt. Willis of the Lucinda saw no one other than Jackalow (whom he blamed for the collision) on board the Spray, and Jackalow refused to be rescued and taken aboard the Lucinda. Willis observed that <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the Spray was strewn with bedding and other articles from the cabin.|$|E

In September 2009, the NJDOT began repairs to <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the Manahawkin Bay Bridge. This project, completed in May 2010, cost $4 million and received funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Manahawkin Bay Bridge is to undergo a rehabilitation project and a parallel bridge will be built to the south. Construction began on May 3, 2013 with completion expected in 2019.|$|E
5|$|Lex Luger's {{rivalry with}} Yokozuna began on July 4 at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the USS Intrepid. After several wrestlers and other athletes {{attempted}} to body slam Yokozuna, Luger {{arrived in a}} helicopter. He was able to body slam Yokozuna, {{which led to a}} title shot at SummerSlam. To build support for Luger, the WWF had him ride across the country in a bus named the Lex Express. Yokozuna's spokesperson, Jim Cornette, agreed to the match, but he made Lex Luger agree to two conditions. Luger would not receive a rematch if he lost, and he had to wear protective padding over the steel plate in his forearm.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 11 April 1975, the 31st MAU received orders to execute Operation Eagle Pull. At 06:00 on 12 April, 12 CH-53s of HMH-462 launched from <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> USS Okinawa and then at 10-minute intervals descended again {{to pick up their}} marines. Elements of Companies F and H, and the command group embarked from the USS Okinawa while elements of Company G boarded their helicopters on the USS Vancouver, giving a total ground security force of 360 Marines. As the helicopters completed loading they formed into groups of three orbiting the task force.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> {{the bridge}} was formed by pre-casting {{individual}} concrete units on the southern river shore, then hoisting them into place on temporary timber staging in the river. The units were then structurally joined by strands of high-tensile wire and stretched with a hydraulic jack. These pre-stressing strands were anchored in reinforced concrete blocks {{at the ends of}} the spans. The new bridge had a traffic capacity of 6,000 cars per hour in each direction, over a total of six traffic lanes.|$|E
5|$|The {{inventories}} of both 1514 and 1546 also list several hundred heavy darts and lime pots {{that were designed}} to be thrown onto <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> enemy ships from the fighting tops, although no physical evidence of either of these weapon types has been identified. Of the 50 handguns listed in the Anthony Roll, the complete stocks of five matchlock muskets and fragments of another eleven have been found. They had been manufactured mainly in Italy, with some originating from Germany. Found in storage were several gunshields, a rare type of firearm consisting of a wooden shield with a small gun fixed in the middle.|$|E
5|$|When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to {{organize}} the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar {{for the first time}} in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing he could stop America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C. where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.|$|E

5|$|Williams {{received}} his commission as an ensign in the Navy. He attended the Navy Supply Corps School for new junior officers, {{which was then}} located on Harvard Business School's campus. Following the completion of his initial training, Williams {{was assigned to the}} aircraft carrier USS Lexington (CV-2), where he served as a dispersing officer (or paymaster) for a 2,000-person crew. The USS Lexington was deployed to the Pacific Ocean theater. In May 1942, the USS Lexington was sunk by Japanese forces during the Battle of the Coral Sea. During the evacuation of the Lexington, Williams swung from a line onto <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> an American destroyer that had arrived to rescue the crew of the sinking aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|After {{about half}} of his army had been ferried into Indiana, the Union gunboat USS Elk and an armed private ship, the Grey Eagle, arrived on the scene. The Elk fired a shot into <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the Alice Dean as it tried to escape to the shoreline. Both of the Union ships were wooden, and as the Confederate {{artillery}} opened fire, they quickly retreated upriver towards Louisville to avoid being destroyed. The crossing resumed again. In total, it took seventeen hours for Morgan to ferry his now 2,000 men and supplies across the river. By listening in on the telegraph, he learned that Brig. Gen. Edward H. Hobson with a force of 4,000 cavalry was advancing on his position from the south. The lead elements of the Union force arrived in Brandenburg at about 8:00 pm, where the Confederate rearguard was able to delay their advance long enough for Morgan's artillery to be carried across the river. On the last trip across, most of the rearguard was able to escape, but several were left behind and captured.|$|E
5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E

5|$|At dawn, lookouts on Greyhound {{were able}} to {{establish}} that Victoria was a large merchant ship rather than a warship and Elphinstone was encouraged to resume the attack. Aalbers sailed shortly afterwards, his ships tacking away from the shore in line of battle ready for the British advance. In doing so, Pallas drew ahead of the next ship in line, creating a gap through which the British attack could be directed. At 05:00, Elphinstone raised French colours {{in an effort to}} confuse the Dutch officers and indicated that he wished to speak with the Dutch commander. Aalbers was not fooled, and when Elphinstone opened fire on Pallas at close range at 05:30, the Dutch frigate replied immediately. With the frigates engaged, Harrier cut between Pallas and Victoria, Troubridge discharging his carronades into Victoria and ordering his crew to fire muskets at <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> Pallas. In response, Victoria and Batavier pulled out of the line to engage Harrier, which continued its fire against Pallas, while William, bringing up the rear of the Dutch line, pulled out completely and sailed for the coast.|$|E
5|$|Engin Raghip's {{solicitor}} was now Gareth Peirce– who had {{represented the}} Guildford Four and Birmingham Six, prominent cases of miscarriage of justice– and his barrister Michael Mansfield. Peirce applied for leave to appeal. She began to explore Raghip's mental state, arguing that his confession {{could not be}} relied upon, and arranged {{for him to be}} examined by Dr. Gísli Guðjónsson of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, a specialist in suggestibility; Guðjónsson concluded that Raghip was unusually suggestible, with a mental age of between 10 and 11. Silcott was again represented by Barbara Mills and Braithwaite by Steven Kamlish. Mills noted the lack of photographic or scientific evidence, and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire on <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> the Tangmere block, given that he was renting a shop there.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} {{slightly above}} normal tides and rough surf along the Jersey shore, killing one surfer off of Wildwood Crest. The combination of gusty winds {{and the heavy}} surf produced moderate beach erosion along much of the coastline, primarily to beaches facing southeastward. In the Delaware Bay and River area, no significant erosion was reported, though coastal flooding from the hurricane washed out a road and destroyed <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> a house in Baypoint. In Cape May County waves eroded the beaches by up to 4feet (1.2m) in Ocean City and Avalon, with several cities experiencing a loss of dunes and geotubes in Whale Beach being exposed. Waves from Isabel in Atlantic County resulted in light damage, minor coastal flooding, and slight beach erosion. The beaches of southern Ocean County experienced a loss of 3 to 4feet (0.9 to 1.2m) of sand, while locations further to the north experienced only minor erosion. Most coastal areas of Monmouth County reported eroded beaches by up to 4feet (1.2m), with Union Beach losing about 5,000sq. feet (465sq. m) of sand.|$|E
