5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use {{in liquid}} crystal displays, which {{rely on the}} optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see <b>Twisted</b> <b>nematic</b> field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.|$|E

25|$|<b>Twisted</b> <b>nematic</b> {{displays}} contain liquid crystals that {{twist and}} untwist at varying degrees to allow light to pass through. When no voltage {{is applied to}} a TN liquid crystal cell, polarized light passes through the 90-degrees twisted LC layer. In proportion to the voltage applied, the liquid crystals untwist changing the polarization and blocking the light's path. By properly adjusting {{the level of the}} voltage almost any gray level or transmission can be achieved.|$|E

25|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the first calculators {{appeared}} with field-effect, <b>twisted</b> <b>nematic</b> (TN) LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them {{to cut out}} damaging ultraviolet rays. The advantage of LCDs {{is that they are}} passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the Casio Mini Card LC-78 of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, under {{different}} titles, inventors conceived electro optical effects as alternatives to <b>twisted</b> <b>nematic</b> field effect LCDs (TN- and STN- LCDs). One approach {{was to use}} interdigital electrodes on one glass substrate only to produce an electric field essentially parallel to the glass substrates. To {{take full advantage of}} the properties of this In Plane Switching (IPS) technology further work was needed. After thorough analysis, details of advantageous embodiments are filed in Germany by Guenter Baur et al. and patented in various countries. which is not 0 or 90 degrees, filed Jan 9, 1990. The Fraunhofer Institute in Freiburg, where the inventors worked, assigns these patents to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, a supplier of LC substances. In 1992, shortly thereafter, engineers at Hitachi work out various practical details of the IPS technology to interconnect the thin-film transistor array as a matrix and to avoid undesirable stray fields in between pixels. Hitachi also improves the viewing angle dependence further by optimizing the shape of the electrodes (Super IPS). NEC and Hitachi become early manufacturers of active-matrix addressed LCDs based on the IPS technology. This is a milestone for implementing large-screen LCDs having acceptable visual performance for flat-panel computer monitors and television screens. In 1996, Samsung developed the optical patterning technique that enables multi-domain LCD. Multi-domain and In Plane Switching subsequently remain the dominant LCD designs through 2006. In 2007 the image quality of LCD televisions surpassed the image quality of cathode-ray-tube-based (CRT) TVs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, LCD televisions surpassed CRT TVs in worldwide sales for the first time. LCD TVs were projected to account 50% of the 200million TVs to be shipped globally in 2006, according to Displaybank. In October 2011, Toshiba announced 2560×1600 pixels on a 6.1-inch (155mm) LCD panel, suitable for use in a tablet computer, especially for Chinese character display.|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{crystals}} made of rod-like molecules {{had been}} discovered in 1888, and many compounds had been synthesized at Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany in the 1920s and 30s. Some physical studies had been undertaken by the German and Russian schools during that era, but the subject later languished till the mid-fifties. Starting in the late fifties, the systematic synthetic effort by George William Gray in the UK and the physical studies by Wilhelm Maier in Germany (including the well-known Maier–Saupe or MS theory) started {{a revival of the}} subject. Chandrasekhar and his co-workers made contributions to the application of the dynamical theory of reflections to study the fascinating optical properties of cholesteric liquid crystals which have a helical structure with a pitch which is usually ~ 0.5mm, and to the extensions of the molecular theory of nematic liquid crystals beyond the MS model. Chandrasekhar was invited to establish a liquid crystal laboratory in RRI after the Department of Science and Technology started supporting it in 1971. The move had a highly positive impact on his productivity. Along with a couple of former students who moved with him to RRI, in a short time, he developed a laboratory with all the essential facilities needed for research in the chosen area. Realizing that cutting-edge research would not be possible without an in-house capacity to produce new materials, a synthetic organic chemistry laboratory was set up. Soon many new experimental and a few theoretical results emerged and the Liquid Crystal Laboratory at RRI became one of the leading centres of research in the world. The <b>twisted</b> <b>nematic</b> liquid crystal display was invented in Europe in 1971 and recently, LCDs have displaced CRTs as commercially the most important displays. In cooperation with Chandrasekhar and his colleagues, the Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Bangalore, developed indigenous know-how for the manufacture of simple LCDs for the domestic market.|$|E

2500|$|In technology, {{molecules}} {{in which the}} optic axis is subject to manipulation during a mesophase have become commercial products {{as they can be}} used to manufacture display devices. The susceptibility of the optic axis, called a director, to an electric or magnetic field produces the potential for an optical switch. [...] Methods used include the Freedericksz transition and the <b>twisted</b> <b>nematic</b> field effect. From early liquid crystal displays the buying public has embraced the low-power optical switch facility of mesophases with director.|$|E
2500|$|Each pixel of an LCD {{typically}} {{consists of}} a layer of molecules aligned between two transparent electrodes, and two polarizing filters (parallel and perpendicular), the axes of transmission of which are (in most of the cases) perpendicular to each other. Without the [...] liquid crystal between the polarizing filters, light passing through the first filter would be blocked by the second (crossed) polarizer. Before an electric field is applied, {{the orientation of the}} liquid-crystal molecules is determined by the alignment at the surfaces of electrodes. In a <b>twisted</b> <b>nematic</b> (TN) device, the surface alignment directions at the two electrodes are perpendicular to each other, and so the molecules arrange themselves in a helical structure, or twist. This induces the rotation of the polarization of the incident light, and the device appears gray. If the applied voltage is large enough, the liquid crystal molecules {{in the center of the}} layer are almost completely untwisted and the polarization of the incident light is not rotated as it passes through the liquid crystal layer. This light will then be mainly polarized perpendicular to the second filter, and thus be blocked and the pixel will appear black. By controlling the voltage applied across the liquid crystal layer in each pixel, light can be allowed to pass through in varying amounts thus constituting different levels of gray. [...] Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels.|$|E
2500|$|On December 4, 1970, the <b>twisted</b> <b>nematic</b> {{field effect}} in liquid {{crystals}} was filed for patent by Hoffmann-LaRoche in Switzerland, (...) with Wolfgang Helfrich and Martin Schadt (then {{working for the}} Central Research Laboratories) listed as inventors. Hoffmann-La Roche then licensed the invention to the Swiss manufacturer Brown, Boveri & Cie who produced displays for wristwatches during the 1970s and also to Japanese electronics industry, which soon produced the first digital quartz wrist watches with TN-LCDs and numerous other products. James Fergason, while working with Sardari Arora and Alfred Saupe at Kent State University Liquid Crystal Institute, filed an identical patent in the United States on April 22, 1971. In 1971 the company of Fergason ILIXCO (now LXD Incorporated) produced the first LCDs based on the TN-effect, which soon superseded the poor-quality DSM types due to improvements of lower operating voltages and lower power consumption. In 1972, the first active-matrix liquid-crystal display panel was produced in the United States by T. Peter Brody's team at Westinghouse, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1983, researchers at Brown, Boveri & Cie (BBC), Switzerland, invented the super-twisted nematic (STN) structure for passive matrix addressed LCDs. H. Amstutz et al. were listed as inventors in the corresponding patent applications filed in Switzerland on July 7, 1983, and October 28, 1983. Patents were granted in Switzerland CH 665491, Europe EP 0131216, [...] and many more countries. In 1980 Brown Boveri started a 50/50 joint venture, Videlec AG, with the Dutch Philips company. Philips had all the required know how to design and build chips for the control of large LCD elements. In addition. Philips had better access to markets for electronic components and intended to use LCDs in new product generations of hi-fi, video equipment and telephones. In 1984 Philips researchers Theodorus Welzen and Adrianus de Vaan invented video speed [...] drive schemes that solved the slow response time of STN-LCDs, enabling high resolution, high quality, and smooth moving video images on STN-LCDs. In 1985 Philips inventors Theodorus Welzen and Adrianus de Vaan solved the problem to drive high-resolution STN-LCDs using low-voltage (CMOS-based) drive electronics; opening the application of high-quality (high resolution and video speed) LCD panels {{to be used in}} battery operated portable products like notebook computers and mobile phones. In 1985 Philips acquired 100% of the in Switzerland located Videlec AG company, after Philips moved the Videlec production lines to the Netherlands. The years after, Philips successfully produced and marketed complete modules (consisting of the LCD screen, microphone, speakers etc.) in high-volume production for the booming mobile phone industry.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, we first {{investigated}} {{the origin of}} an orientation transition found in nematic LC deposited on microtextured substrates comprising domains of parallel grooves alternating between the x and y directions, in which the LC alignment underwent an abrupt transition from being inhomogeneous planar to more uniform possessing a large pretilt angle of 40 ° when the pattern period was decreased to ~ 1 μm. The LC alignment near transition homogenizes towards either the + 45 ° or the - 45 ° azimuthal directions in order to relax the elastic strain from copying the alternating groove orientations, and in turn the ± 45 ° azimuthal alignment states, by being misaligned from the local grooves, possess a large surface energy and may cause the LC director to tilt out of plane. Based on this mechanism, we successfully devised controls on the pattern parameters that allowed us to easily manipulate the LC pre-tilt angle. Then we developed the photoalignment method to make the inhomogeneous alignment patterns with sizes in the centimeter scale. We measured their azimuthal anchoring energies {{to be at least}} 80 % smaller than those of similarly prepared uniform surfaces. The anchoring of LC on a uniformly photoaligned surface is due to chemo-physio interactions between the LC molecules and the alignment surface. But that on an inhomogeneous patterned surface probably has an elastic origin, which may explain why a different anchoring energy is demonstrated. Finally, we explored applications of the inhomogeneous alignment patterns in display devices. Based on the orientation degeneracy of the ± 45 ° azimuthal alignment states on these patterns, we devised the protocol of a bistable <b>twist</b> <b>nematic</b> LC cell and successfully constructed bistable <b>twist</b> <b>nematic</b> cells in which the two different twist states can be switched back and forth by backflow dynamics induced by out-of-plane electric pulses of 20 - 30 V...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the photo-induced {{alignment}} of liquid crystal on an azo dye film is discussed for the {{liquid crystal display}} (LCD) applications. This is a non-contact technique to align the liquid crystals so that the dust particles and static charges generated by the rubbing process can be eliminated. To prepare for the photo-alignment layer, the azo dye film is exposed to a linearly polarized or non-polarized light. As {{a result of the}} dipole absorption, the photo-induced molecular distribution is non-uniform and has an angular dependence. Consequently, since the dispersion forces between the dye and the liquid crystal molecules dominate, the induced orientation of the liquid crystal molecules is possible.
