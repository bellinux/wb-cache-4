50|$|The MacPherson strut {{is a type}} of {{automotive}} suspension system that uses the top of a <b>telescopic</b> <b>damper</b> as the upper steering pivot. It is widely used in the front suspension of modern vehicles and is named for American automotive engineer Earle S. MacPherson, who originally invented and developed the design.|$|E

50|$|In 1935, BMW fitted {{the first}} mass-produced {{hydraulically}} <b>damped</b> <b>telescopic</b> fork to its R12 and R17 motorcycles. BMW still uses telescopic forks today on its F-series, G-series, HP, and S1000RR motorcycles.|$|R

50|$|The first {{production}} motorcycles with hydraulically <b>damped</b> <b>telescopic</b> forks {{were the}} German BMW R12 and R17 in 1935. However, undamped telescopic forks were used on bikes made by The Scott Motorcycle Company {{from the beginning}} of production in 1908, and the Danish Nimbus used them from 1934 on.|$|R
40|$|The {{springing}} {{support in}} a driver’s seat {{is a very}} serious issue, such that manufacturers are increasing their efforts to optimize the dynamic properties of this kind of seat. The main optimization criterion is vibration insulation efficiency with regard to health research and associated health standards and regulations. This article deals with the definition of the optimal driver’s seat properties in relation to two examples of springing systems with different kinds of damping. The first case involves the springing support of a driver’s seat that uses a pneumatic spring and a <b>telescopic</b> hydraulic <b>damper.</b> In the second case, the damping effect is achieved by two pneumatic springs whose forces effect a phase shift due to a throttle valve located in the connecting piping system...|$|R
50|$|On 14 February 1935, BMW {{presented}} the R12 {{together with the}} BMW R17 on the German Automobile Exhibition in Berlin for the first time, being a direct successor to the BMW R11. This and the R17 were {{the first in the}} world being produced with hydraulically <b>damped</b> <b>telescopic</b> forks. By 1942, the total number of BMW R12 motorcycles manufactured was 36,000. For military purposes, the Einvergasermotor was only available for the R12.|$|R
50|$|The ES2 is a Norton {{motorcycle}} first {{produced in}} 1927. It {{was a long}} stroke single, always 79mm x 100mm bore and stroke, originally launched as a sports motorcycle but throughout its long life it was gradually overtaken by more powerful models. It remained popular due to its reliability and ease of maintenance, {{as well as the}} traditional design. From 1947 the ES2 had an innovative hydraulically <b>damped</b> <b>telescopic</b> front fork and race developed rear plunger suspension.|$|R
2500|$|The A-4 engined Potez VIII first flew on 19 April 1920. When {{its engine}} was {{recognised}} {{as a failure}} the A-4 {{was replaced by a}} six-cylinder Anzani radial engine, mounted uncowled in the nose. An early version produced [...] and a later variant [...] [...] Initially the four wheel undercarriage was retained but when the Potez VIII appeared at the 1922 Paris Salon it had more conventional two wheel gear. The wheels were on a single axle. From each end of the axle a strut ran to the underside of the forward fuselage, acting together with a vertical <b>telescopic,</b> rubber <b>damped</b> shock absorber. At least one example flew as a floatplane, designated Potez VIII H (H for hydravion or water plane). It had a single, central float and a small, airfoil section stabilizing float under each wing.|$|R
5000|$|In 1949, a {{year after}} {{receiving}} the [...] "Panhead" [...] engine, the FL was given a new front suspension featuring hydraulically <b>damped</b> <b>telescopic</b> forks, replacing the leading link spring suspension of the time. These forks were standard on all big twin models for 1949, including the E, EL, F, and FL. Harley-Davidson offered the spring suspension units on these models and recommended their use on sidecar combinations, because the hydraulic forks {{did not have enough}} trail to allow the combination to be stable enough for safe operation.|$|R
5000|$|Scott {{produced}} a motorcycle with telescopic forks in 1908, and {{would continue to}} use them until 1931. In 1935 BMW became the first manufacturer to produce a motorcycle with hydraulically <b>damped</b> <b>telescopic</b> forks. Most motorcycles today use telescopic forks for the front suspension. The forks can be most easily understood as simply large hydraulic shock absorbers with internal coil springs. They allow the front wheel to react to imperfections in the road while isolating {{the rest of the}} motorcycle from that motion.The top of the forks are connected to the motorcycles frame in a triple tree clamp (known as a [...] "yoke" [...] in the UK), which allows the forks to be turned in order to steer the motorcycle. The bottom of the forks is connected to the front wheels axle.|$|R
