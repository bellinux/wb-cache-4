5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E
5|$|By mid-September, Grant warned Boutwell {{to be on}} {{his guard}} as the gold price {{continued}} to rise, while the conspirators bought ever more and the rising price affected the wider economy. Grant, seeing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> was unnatural, told Boutwell to sell gold, which reduced its price. Boutwell did so the next day, on September 24, 1869, later known as Black Friday. The sale of gold from the Treasury defeated Gould's scheme as the gold price plummeted, relieving the economic tension. This caused a mild recession, but by January 1870, the economy resumed its post-war recovery. Gould and Fisk managed to escape without much harm to themselves. A Congressional investigation followed, chaired by James A. Garfield and cleared Grant of wrongdoing, but excoriated Gould and Fisk for their manipulation of the gold market and Corbin for exploiting his personal connection to Grant.|$|E

5|$|The Liberals made no new, radical {{proposals}} {{during their}} campaign, but instead ran a quiet campaign with occasional {{attacks on the}} opposition parties. They were convinced that the public still supported their party, and that no expensive promises need be made to voters. St. Laurent was made {{the image of the}} nation's prosperity, and the Liberals refused to admit any reason for discontent existed. When Minister of Finance Harris proposed raising the upcoming increase in old age pension by an additional four dollars a month, St. Laurent refused to consider it, feeling <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> had been calculated {{on the basis of the}} available facts, and those facts had not changed.|$|E
5|$|The National Safety Council, {{a nonprofit}} safety {{advocacy}} group, estimates U.S. motor vehicle deaths in 2016 were 40,200, a 14 {{percent increase from}} its 2014 estimate. The National Safety Council measures roadside deaths differently than U.S. government agencies. The National Safety Council counts traffic and non-traffic deaths within one year of an accident while the government counts only traffic deaths occurring within 30 days of a crash. The National Safety Council's statistics show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in 2016 was due only in part to increased miles driven (due to population growth, low gasoline prices, and a strengthening economy.) The National Safety Council suggests the increase in deaths not explained by increased vehicle miles is attributable to complacency about impaired driving and increased driver distraction.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} {{of the welfare state}} was by 1957 accepted by both major parties. Diefenbaker promised to expand the national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough {{to keep up with the}} cost of living. Diefenbaker noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E

5|$|Following overhaul, Texas resumed duty {{with the}} Atlantic Fleet early in 1919. On 10 March, {{she became the}} first American {{battleship}} to launch an airplane when Lieutenant Commander Edward O. McDonnell flew a British-built Sopwith Camel off the warship. Later in 1919 Texass captain, Nathan C. Twining, successfully employed naval aircraft to spot the fall of shells during a main battery exercise. The results were that aircraft-borne gunfire spotters were significantly more accurate than shipboard spotters. In testimony to the Navy General Board, Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Whiting attested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in gunfire effectiveness with air spotting was likely to be as great as 200%. As a result of these first experiments, the Navy would add floatplanes to all of the fleet's battleships and newer cruisers. In May 1919, Texas served as a plane guard and navigational aid for the successful attempt by Navy Curtiss NC flying boat NC-4 to become the first airplane to cross the Atlantic. On 26 July 1919 Texas entered the Pacific Ocean as part of the newly formed Pacific Fleet and she would spend the next five and half years as a part of Pacific Fleet. On 17 July the following year, she was designated BB-35 under the Navy's newly adopted alpha-numeric system of hull classification symbols.|$|E

25|$|Although it {{is unclear}} when the AMY1 gene copy number began to increase, it is known and {{confirmed}} that the AMY1 gene existed in early primates. Chimpanzees, the closest evolutionary relatives to humans, {{were found to have}} 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene that is identical in length to the human AMY1 gene, which is significantly less than that of humans. On the other hand, bonobos, also a close relative of modern humans, was found to have more than 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene. Nonetheless, the bonobo AMY1 genes were sequenced and analyzed, and {{it was found that the}} coding sequences of the AMY1 genes were disrupting, which may lead to the production of dysfunctional salivary amylase. It can be inferred from the results <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in bonobo AMY1 copy number is likely not correlated to the amount of starch in their diet. It was further hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in copy number began recently during early hominin evolution as none of the great apes had more than two copies of the AMY1 gene that produced functional protein. In addition, it was speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in the AMY1 copy number began around 20,000 years ago when humans shifted from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agricultural societies, which was also when humans relied heavily on root vegetables high in starch. This hypothesis, although logical, lacks experimental evidence due to the difficulties in gathering information on the shift of human diets, especially on root vegetables that are high in starch as they cannot be directly observed or tested. Recent breakthroughs in DNA sequencing has allowed researchers to sequence older DNA such as that of Neanderthals to a certain degree of accuracy. Perhaps sequencing Neanderthal DNA can provide a time marker as to when the AMY1 gene copy number increased and offer insight into human diet and gene evolution.|$|E
