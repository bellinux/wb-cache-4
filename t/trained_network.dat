5000|$|WaveNet {{is a type}} of {{feed-forward}} artificial {{neural network}} known as a deep convolutional neural network. These consist of layers of interconnected nodes similar to the brain’s neurons. The CNN takes a raw signal as an input and synthesises an output one sample at a time. [...] In the 2016 paper, the network was fed real waveforms of English and Mandarin speech. As these pass through the network, it learns a set of rules to describe how the audio waveform evolves over time. The <b>trained</b> <b>network</b> can then be used to create new speech-like waveforms from scratch at 16,000 samples per second. These waveforms include realistic breaths and lip smacks - but do not conform to any language. [...] WaveNet is able to accurately model different voices, with the accent and tone of the input correlating with the output. For example, if it is trained on with German, it produces German speech. This ability to clone voices has raised ethical concerns about WaveNets ability to mimic anyone’s voice. [...] The capability also means that if the WaveNet is fed other inputs - such as music - its output will be musical. At the time of its release, DeepMind showed that WaveNet could produce classical sounding music.|$|E

However, the success rate was generally low and severe instability issues were encountered.

In particular, we <b>trained</b> the <b>networks</b> to predict symbols in string sequences of the context-sensitive language {aⁿbⁿcⁿ; n≥ 1 }. Comparative experiments with and without incremental learning indicated that incremental learning can accelerate and facilitate training. Furthermore, incrementally <b>trained</b> <b>networks</b> generally resulted in monotonic trajectories in hidden unit activation space, while the trajectories of non-incrementally <b>trained</b> <b>networks</b> were oscillating.
