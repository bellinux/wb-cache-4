5|$|The bill {{then goes}} through a <b>third</b> <b>reading.</b> At this stage, only {{amendments}} not of a material character may {{be made to the}} bill. The minister moving the <b>third</b> <b>reading</b> may also make a speech outlining the changes made to the bill. The bill is then put to the vote. In most cases, a simple majority of Parliament is all that is needed for the bill to be approved. However, bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a special majority: not less than two-thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings.|$|E

5|$|Establishment {{and support}} of cadet battalions and rifle clubs, with the caveat that no funding could be {{provided}} out of the Parliamentary grant in respect of any person {{under the age of}} sixteen. This caveat was a compromise introduced on the <b>third</b> <b>reading</b> of the bill; the Commons had provided that no support could be given for a person under sixteen at all, and the Lords wished to remove this restriction. The compromise was to state that no support could come from Parliamentary funds, but the associations were effectively free to raise money themselves for this purpose.|$|E

5|$|Harper was {{the only}} Reform MP to support the {{creation}} of the Canadian Firearms Registry at second reading in 1995, although he later voted against it at <b>third</b> <b>reading</b> stage. He said {{at the time that he}} initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents supported it, and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.|$|E

5|$|The bill {{then passed}} to a <b>third</b> <b>reading</b> in the House of Lords, where {{it took a}} few minor amendments, but escaped any {{significant}} opposition barring a brief dispute over the status of Cadet units; it was eventually agreed that they could be supported by the associations provided that no funding was to be provided from money voted by Parliament. This amendment was accepted by the Government, and the bill passed smoothly to royal assent.|$|E
5|$|This {{prompted}} Planché {{to begin}} campaigning for copyright {{to be extended}} to dramatic works. He gathered a group of dramatists (including John Poole, James Kenney, Joseph Lunn and Richard Brinsley Peak) who prevailed upon writer and MP George Lamb to introduce a bill in Parliament; but the bill did not pass its <b>third</b> <b>reading.</b> In 1832 Edward Bulwer-Lytton, a novelist and MP, was successful in getting a select committee set up to consider dramatic copyright, as well as theatrical censorship and the monopoly of the patent theatres on drama. Planché gave evidence before the select committee; the following year the Dramatic Copyright Act 1833 (3 Will IV c. 15) was passed.|$|E
5|$|On March31 {{the insurgents}} kept their {{part of the}} {{agreement}} by allowing the supply bill to be passed on second reading and the budget to be hoisted for ninety days. However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed {{that it was not}} as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a <b>third</b> <b>reading.</b> They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election. The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.|$|E

40|$|This brief {{examines}} the complex interplay of family, school, and place {{factors in the}} reading achievement levels of third grade students. <b>Third</b> grade <b>reading</b> achievement is critical to later academic and occupational success. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, the authors report that suburban children realize greater gains in reading achievement from kindergarten to Grade 3 than their rural or urban counterparts. Rural students who were struggling readers {{at the beginning of}} kindergarten have lower average <b>reading</b> achievement in <b>third</b> grade than both urban and suburban students when children of the same socioeconomic status are compared. The differences in <b>third</b> grade <b>reading</b> achievement between rural and nonrural children who were low achievers in kindergarten most likely reflect different educational opportunities and school resources available to these children. The authors suggest that improved professional development opportunities for rural teachers may help narrow the differences in the <b>third</b> grade <b>reading</b> achievement of rural, urban, and suburban students who were struggling readers in kindergarten...|$|R
5|$|Once {{the draft}} order had been issued, {{the locus of}} the process moved from the Potteries to London with the Local Government Provisional Order (No. 3) Bill {{introduced}} in the House of Commons in July 1908 by the Select Committee on Private bills chaired by Sir George White. The bill received its <b>third</b> <b>reading</b> on 31 July 1908 but had undergone significant amendment during its passage through the House of Commons, most notably in {{the introduction of a}} complex, differential rating system for a period of 10 years. Few of the interested parties were pleased with the proposal and, although the differential system was welcomed, a period of 20 years was preferred with the complicated valuation required of all public assets proving unpopular. As a result, Tunstall withdrew its support for the order leaving only Hanley and Longton to promote the bill in the House of Lords. Neither council was particularly in favour of the financial settlement but felt honour bound to promote the bill, having been the initial instigators of the scheme. Petitions objecting to the bill were submitted to the House of Lords by Staffordshire County Council, Burslem, Fenton, Stoke, and Tunstall councils, the Longton Justices, the North Staffordshire Railway Company, and individual Tunstall ratepayers.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{itself was}} {{formally}} {{introduced to the}} House of Commons on 4 March 1907. The subject was debated in the House of Lords on 21 March, where the proposed changed to the Militia were strongly opposed. The bill had its second reading in the Commons on 9, 10, and 23 April, and was passed into Committee, where it was discussed at some length over nine days. The opposition to the bill, whilst verbose, was not very effective. Hugh Arnold-Forster, the previous War Secretary, argued that the Territorial Force would prove ineffective in opposition to conscripted Continental armies, whilst the Labour Party objected generally to any increase in military strength. Most of the opposition came from partisans of the existing system; {{as well as the}} implacable opposition from the Militia element, supporters of the Yeomanry objected to the reduction in their daily rates (from 5s. 6d. to 2s. 8d.), whilst Sir Howard Vincent led the opposition from the Volunteers against the stricter control of the new regulations. However, the strong Liberal majority saw off all opposition, and the bill moved for a <b>third</b> <b>reading</b> on 19 June, where it passed with 286 votes to 63. The opposition was mainly led by the Irish MPs, who voted against the government for reasons unrelated to the bill, and some of the Labour Party; most of the Unionists, save a few like Vincent or Charles Dilke, abstained rather than oppose.|$|E

40|$|State {{and local}} {{assessment}} data from 117 students in one {{school in the}} California Central Valley were examined {{to determine how much}} participation in a kindergarten through second grade multitiered reading intervention model contributed to <b>third</b> grade <b>reading</b> achievement, over and above the demographic factors of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, parent education level, English language level in kindergarten, gender, and age at kindergarten entry. State and local assessment data were also examined to determine how much participation in a kindergarten through second grade multitiered reading intervention model contributed to <b>third</b> grade <b>reading</b> achievement, over and above the kindergarten reading readiness factors of letter sounds, oral blending, oral segmenting, consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) word reading, and high frequency word (HFW) reading. Multiple regression analyses with ordered sets of predictors were conducted to identify the relationship of the factors to students??? <b>third</b> grade end-of-year <b>reading</b> performance. Additionally, multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the contributions of three interventions???Systematic Instruction in Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, and Sight Words (SIPPS); Reads Naturally; and teacher-created interventions???over and above demographic factors on end-of-intervention assessments. Kindergarten reading readiness and demographic factors significantly contributed to <b>third</b> grade <b>reading</b> achievement, while the effects of participation in a multitiered intervention model were not significant...|$|R
