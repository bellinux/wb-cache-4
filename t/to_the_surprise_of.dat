5|$|The disorganized {{nature of}} the British retreat {{demonstrated}} a loss of effective command. An experienced commander could easily have encamped at the Lake George landing, taken stock of the situation, and begun siege operations against the French. Abercrombie, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> some in his army, ordered a retreat {{all the way back}} to the south end of Lake George. Nester, unable to find other rational reasons for this, claims that the general must have panicked.|$|E
40|$|Mars Science Laboratory's (MSL) Sample Acquisition Sample Processing and Handling (SA-SPaH) {{system is}} one of the most ambitious terrain {{interaction}} and manipulation systems ever built and successfully used outside of planet earth. Mars has a ruthless environment that has surprised many who have tried <b>to</b> explore there. <b>The</b> robustness widget program was implemented by <b>the</b> MSL project <b>to</b> help ensure <b>the</b> SA-SPaH system would be robust enough <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprises</b> <b>of</b> this ruthless Martian environment. The robustness widget program was an effort of extreme schedule pressure and responsibility, but was accomplished with resounding success. This paper will focus on a behind the scenes look at MSL's robustness widgets: the particle fun zone, the wind guards, and the portioner pokers...|$|R

5|$|Upon release, The Dark Knight Rises {{received}} a positive critical response and was successful {{at the box}} office, going on to outgross its predecessor and become the 18th-highest-grossing film of all time grossing over $1.08 billion. However, unlike its predecessors, the film was not nominated for any Oscars during its year of eligibility at the 85th Academy Awards, much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> film industry insiders.|$|E
5|$|After {{just half}} a year as vice president, Arthur {{found himself in the}} {{executive}} mansion due to the assassination of his predecessor. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> reformers, Arthur took up the cause of reform, though it had once led to his expulsion from office. He signed the Pendleton Act into law and strongly enforced its provisions. He gained praise for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive. He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy, but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus, which had been accumulating {{since the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Sheldon Hawkes is {{a fictional}} {{character}} on the CBS crime drama CSI: NY portrayed by Hill Harper.

5|$|After rescuing all the Tribals and {{restoring}} the starship with several needed parts, the team, along with King Jeff, departs to the asteroid and confront Mizar. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> all though, Mizar is {{revealed to be}} a robot controlled by King Jeff's jealous brother, Barry. Realising that destroying Barry's robot ruined their best chance of destroying the asteroid, the team is out of options. In an honorable notion, Floyd, a little robot that defected from Mizar and followed the team, offers to sacrifice himself to destroy the asteroid. Hesitantly, the team agrees and attaches a timed warhead to Floyd before sending him into the core. The team returns to the starship and departs shortly before Floyd destroys the asteroid. Afterwards on Earth, the Jet Force Gemini team is given the highest honors for their accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|After the {{foremost}} Turkish troops crossed the fortifications {{and dealt with}} the Bulgarian defenders, they began plundering the vicinity. However, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> Kantakouzenos and Umur Bey, the majority of Momchil's men were {{standing in front of}} the city walls and had not yet participated in the skirmishes. As the Byzantine–Turkish force advanced towards the defenders, Momchil led his troops ahead into battle. His cavalry was promptly eliminated by Turkish sharpshooters and his remaining troops were surrounded on three sides by heavily armed horsemen. Momchil's remaining men continued the fight on foot and for the most part did not surrender until Momchil himself perished.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} Khalid's {{strategic}} maneuverability was his advance into Roman Syria. Emperor Heraclius had sent all his available garrisoned troops into Syria, towards Ajnadayn, {{to hold the}} Muslim troops at the Syria-Arabia border region. The possible route of any Muslim reinforcement {{was expected to be}} the conventional Syria-Arabia road in the south, but Khalid, who was then in Iraq, took the most unexpected route: marching through the waterless Syrian desert, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> the Byzantines, he appeared in northern Syria. Catching the Byzantines off guard, he quickly captured several towns, virtually cutting off the communications of the Byzantine army at Ajnadayn with its high command at Emesa, where emperor Heraclius himself resided.|$|E
25|$|The Flood {{were added}} {{early in the}} game {{development}} stage of Halo: Combat Evolved, and life of Halo was specifically tailored <b>to</b> increasing <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Flood's sudden appearance, halfway through the first game. At one point, Halo featured large numbers of terrestrial dinosaur-like creatures, but Bungie felt the presence of other native species would dilute the impact of the Flood and removed them.|$|R
25|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unpopularity of the American-led {{invasion}} of Iraq among Greeks, {{it had been}} expected by the media that audience members would protest against the war during {{the entrance of the}} American delegation into the stadium by booing; however, the Americans did receive a warm welcome, much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pleasant <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> US news anchors covering the event as well as NBC Sports anchor Bob Costas.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} held during August and September 1986 culminated in a summit between United States President Ronald Reagan and the General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavík, Iceland, on 11 October 1986. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> immense <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> both men's advisers, the two agreed in principle to removing INF systems from Europe and to equal global limits of 100 INF missile warheads.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the USFWS {{relocated}} about 140 Californian sea otters to San Nicolas Island (SNI) in southern California, {{in the hope}} of establishing a reserve population should the mainland be struck by an oil spill. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> biologists, the San Nicolas sea otters mostly swam back to the mainland. By 2005, only 30 sea otters remained at San Nicolas, although they were slowly increasing as they thrived on the abundant prey around the island. The plan that authorized the translocation program had predicted the carrying capacity would be reached within five to 10 years. The spring 2016 SNI count was 104 sea otters, continuing a 5-year positive trend of over 12% per year.|$|E

5|$|Observers {{hoped that}} the impacts would give them a first glimpse of Jupiter beneath the cloud tops, as lower {{material}} was exposed by the comet fragments punching through the upper atmosphere. Spectroscopic studies revealed absorption lines in the Jovian spectrum due to diatomic sulfur (S2) and carbon disulfide (CS2), the first detection of either in Jupiter, and only the second detection of S2 in any astronomical object. Other molecules detected included ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The amount of sulfur implied by the quantities of these compounds was {{much greater than the}} amount that would be expected in a small cometary nucleus, showing that material from within Jupiter was being revealed. Oxygen-bearing molecules such as sulfur dioxide were not detected, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> astronomers.|$|E
50|$|However, Feng solely {{stood before}} him. After barking at the foolish looking Feng, Ji would unleash his {{ultimate}} potential; effectively Ji would send Feng scurrying away with countless wounds. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> immense <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> Ji, however, Feng immediately unleashed a fog {{of black smoke}} combined with a large ball of fire at Ji. After Ji toppled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground in shock, he would be clobbered to death by Feng.|$|R
50|$|Claiming her {{responsibilities}} on Choson affairs, in 1894, the Imperial Japanese Navy {{launched the}} First Sino-Japanese War against China. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lack of government funding and the intensive Japanese naval program, Beiyang's once superior resources were becoming outdated. By {{the time of}} the Battle of Yalu River (1894), the Beiyang Fleet suffered heavy losses due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> attack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese and the inferiority of its equipment, and was eventually annihilated in the Battle of Weihaiwei.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{decision}} <b>to</b> place <b>the</b> song {{at the end}} of the episode, {{right after}} the amputation of Jaime's hand, was made <b>to</b> reinforce <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viewers: “It’s such a shocking ending and when we read the scene in the books it was so shocking to us. To really hammer home the shock of that moment you need something unexpected. There’s no version of a traditional score that would keep you as off balance as we wanted that scene to leaving you feeling.” ...|$|R
5|$|On 6 May 1970, Stewart {{suggested}} to Wilson {{that they should}} formally advise the Queen to remove Beadle from the Privy Council. Wilson resolved to {{wait until after the}} British general election the following month. This decision proved decisive for Beadle as, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> many, the Conservatives won the election, and Edward Heath replaced Wilson as Prime Minister. Heath's government decided against removing Beadle from the Privy Council, surmising that this would only hinder progress towards an accommodation with Smith. Beadle remained a Privy Counsellor {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Paulo {{was written}} to be unlikable, {{with the hope}} he would redeem himself when his backstory was {{revealed}} in his final episode. Paulo either resents or is indifferent toward the often heroic actions {{of some of the}} survivors, spending much of his time golfing. He complains to Nikki about not being included; however, he does little to help out around the camp and does not try to improve his status in the survivors' hierarchy. When he does get chances to participate in treks, for example, when Hurley finds a car, Paulo is uninterested and discourages Nikki from joining Hurley on his adventure. Nikki tries to participate, tending to a wounded Mr. Eko and volunteering to go with Locke to the Pearl station, much <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> Paulo. Paulo accompanies her, and he exhibits a constant sarcastic behavior in the Pearl.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeals, Maryland's highest court, {{agreed to}} hear the state's appeal in 2006, {{bypassing}} the intermediate court. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>of</b> spectators, there were almost no questions from the judges during oral argument, which took place on December 4, 2006, causing speculation that the court may have taken the appeal just to reverse the Circuit Court ruling. On September 18, 2007, the court issued its decision in Conaway v. Deane, overturning the trial court ruling for the plaintiffs in a 4–3 decision, and holding that the statutory ban on same-sex marriage did not violate the Maryland Constitution.|$|E
