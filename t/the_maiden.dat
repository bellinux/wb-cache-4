5|$|However, at two Cabinet {{meetings}} held on 1 April 1965, it {{was decided}} to cancel the TSR-2 on the grounds of projected cost, and instead to obtain an option agreement to acquire up to 110 F-111 aircraft with no immediate commitment to buy. This decision was announced in the budget speech of 6 April 1965. <b>The</b> <b>maiden</b> flight of the second development batch aircraft, XR220, was due {{on the day of the}} announcement, but following an accident in conveying the airframe to Boscombe Down, coupled with the announcement of the project cancellation, it never happened. Ultimately, only the first prototype, XR219, ever took to the air. A week later, the Chancellor defended the decision in a debate in the House of Commons, saying that the F-111 would prove cheaper.|$|E

A few years after Bettys opened in York war broke out, and the basement 'Bettys Bar' became a favourite haunt {{of the thousands of}} airmen stationed around York.

5|$|Leonard Nimoy was not {{originally}} {{considered for}} the role as the celebrity at <b>the</b> <b>maiden</b> voyage of the monorail, as the writing staff did not think he would accept, because William Shatner had previously turned the show down.

After demanding several script changes, Takei declined, saying {{he did not want}} to make fun of public transportation as he was a member of the board of directors of the Southern California Rapid Transit District (now the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority).
