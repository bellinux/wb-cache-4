25|$|Arsenical bronze {{was used}} by many {{societies}} and cultures across the globe. Firstly, the Iranian plateau, followed by the adjacent Mesopotamian area, together covering modern Iran, Iraq and Syria, has the earliest arsenical bronze metallurgy in the world, as previously mentioned. It was in use from the 4th millennium BC through to mid 2nd millennium, a period of nearly 2,000 years. There {{was a great deal}} of variation in arsenic content of artefacts throughout this period, making it impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> how much was added deliberately and how much came about by accident. Societies using arsenical bronze include the Akkadians, those of Ur, and the Amorites, all based around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and centres of the trade networks which spread arsenical bronze across the Middle East during the Bronze Age.|$|E
500|$|Deleuze's and Latour's opinions, however, are {{minority}} ones, as Whitehead has {{not been}} recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools. [...] It is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> why Whitehead's influence {{has not been}} more widespread, {{but it may be}} partly due to his metaphysical ideas seeming somewhat counter-intuitive (such as his assertion that matter is an abstraction), or his inclusion of theistic elements in his philosophy, or the perception of metaphysics itself as passé, or simply the sheer difficulty and density of his prose.|$|E

Although the character died {{at the end of}} Avatar, Cameron confirmed in 2010 that Lang would return in the first three sequels, stating [...] "I'm not going <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga". He later stated that Quaritch would act as main antagonist once again, in all four sequels.|$|E

2500|$|The 1966 GM Electrovan is {{credited}} with being the first hydrogen fuel cell car ever produced. Though fuel cells have {{been around since the}} early 1800s, General Motors was the first to use a fuel cell, supplied by Union Carbide, to power the wheels of a vehicle with a budget of [...] "millions of dollars". In 2002, it was reported that GM spent about $100 million a year in research and development of fuel cell vehicle. In June 2007, Larry Burns, vice president of research and development, said he's not yet willing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> when hydrogen vehicles would be mass-produced, but he said it should happen before 2020, the year many experts have predicted.

2500|$|Because {{the game}} was found only {{recently}} after centuries of obscurity, it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> what all the rules were. [...] Several documents describing the game have been found; however, {{there are differences between}} them. [...] Many of the pieces appear in other shogi variants but their moves may be different. [...] The board, and likewise the pieces, were made much smaller, making archeological finds difficult to decipher. [...] Research into this game continues for historical and cultural reasons, but also to satisfy the curious and those who wish to play what could be the most challenging chess-like game ever made. [...] More research must be done however. [...] This article focuses on one likely set of rules that can make the game playable in modern times but is by no means canon. [...] These rules may change as more discoveries are made and secrets of the game unlocked.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{long after}} Abe began work at Yoshidaya, Ishida began making amorous {{advances}} towards her. Omiya had never satisfied Abe sexually, {{and she gave}} in to Ishida. In mid-April, Ishida and Abe initiated their sexual relationship in the restaurant {{to the accompaniment of}} a romantic ballad sung by one of the restaurant's geishas. On April 23, 1936 Abe and Ishida met for a pre-arranged sexual encounter at a teahouse, or machiai—the contemporary equivalent of a love hotel—in the Shibuya neighborhood. Planning only for a short 'fling', the couple instead remained in bed for four days. On the night of April 27, 1936, they moved to another teahouse in the distant neighborhood of Futako Tamagawa where they continued to drink and have sex, occasionally with the accompaniment of a geisha's singing, and would continue even as maids entered the room to serve sake. They next moved to the Ogu neighborhood, and Ishida did not actually return to his restaurant until the morning of May 8, 1936, after an absence of about two weeks. Of Ishida, Abe later said, [...] "It is hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> what was so good about Ishida. But it was impossible to say anything bad about his looks, his attitude, his skill as a lover, the way he expressed his feelings. I had never met such a sexy man." ...|$|E

Alas, {{this time it was}} Russia which was wrong – the military victory did not translate into a political one." [...] He also argued that the war [...] "has drawn unjustifiably little attention in the military analysts’ community, even though {{it was one of the}} most genuine lessons in conventional warfare of the past twenty years, has busted quite a few myths and dogmas, and not just from a political perspective, but also in terms of military aspects." [...] He admitted [...] "that to this day it is relatively difficult to obtain information about what really happened at any given moment in 2008." [...] Ühtegi asserted that [...] "even in June 2008 all the signs showed that even if war were to erupt, it would happen in Abkhazia." [...] However the circumstances changed in June 2008, because on the border of South Ossetia skirmishes became more frequent and the Ossetians attacked the Georgian villages in South Ossetia, which was met with Georgian mortar fire. Ühtegi stated [...] "considering the complicated situation in South Caucasus in the summer of 2008, it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> who started the war. In fact – we should first agree upon how we define starting a war." [...] He agreed with the opinion that [...] "Russian side or rather the Ossetians with support from the Russian forces conducted a multitude of provocations during the summer of 2008, which led to the war." [...] The Russian analysts assessed the international situation adequately and calculated that should Georgia send its regular forces to South Ossetia and should Russia react with a military counterstrike, it would not cause a war between great powers, because first there would be a dispute as to who the aggressor was – Russia or Georgia.|$|E

5000|$|Reviewing a {{recording}} of the piece, Philip Clark of Gramophone was somewhat more critical, observing, [...] "It's difficult <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what <b>exactly</b> Adams has created.
