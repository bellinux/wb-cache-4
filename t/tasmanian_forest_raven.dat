50|$|Remains of Chatham ravens {{are most}} common in coastal sites on the Chatham Islands. On the coast, it may have frequented the seal and penguin colonies or fed in the {{intertidal}} zone, as does the <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> (C. tasmanicus). It may also have depended on fruit, like the New Caledonian crow (C. moneduloides), {{but it is difficult}} to understand why a fruit eater would have been {{most common in}} coastal forest and shrubland when fruit was distributed throughout the forest.|$|E
50|$|The <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> {{lives in}} a wide variety of {{habitats}} in Tasmania but is restricted to more closed forest on mainland Australia. Breeding takes place in spring and summer, occurring later in Tasmania than in New South Wales. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree. An omnivorous and opportunistic feeder, it eats a wide variety of plant and animal material, as well as food waste from urban areas and roadkill. It has been blamed for killing lambs and poultry and raiding orchards in Tasmania, and is unprotected under <b>Tasmanian</b> legislation. The <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> is sedentary, with pairs generally bonding for life and establishing permanent territories.|$|R
25|$|Smooth Island {{is home to}} a {{wide range}} of native Australian birds. Recorded {{breeding}} seabird species are little penguin (Eudyptula minor), little pied cormorant, black-faced cormorant, great cormorant and short-tailed shearwater (Ardenna tenuirostris). The latter predominantly habitates inland from the western to southern coasts. The following native birds occupy the island: <b>Tasmanian</b> nativehen and <b>forest</b> <b>raven.</b> The Pacific gull also occupies the island. A survey by the Department of the Environment (Australia) in 2010 revealed the presence of the Eurasian skylark (Alauda arvensis), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and common blackbird (Turdus merula) on the island. The presence of sea eagle, wedge-tailed eagle, kelp gull, tern, silver gull, oystercatcher, cormorant and gannet species have also been described. No reptiles have been recorded on the island apart from a small population of blue tongue lizards. The hooded plover (Thinornis cucullatus) is a threatened species which may be present on Smooth Island.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Forest</b> <b>Raven,</b> Corvus tasmanicus tasmanicus, is {{the only}} crow or raven species found on {{mainland}} Tasmania. Although members of the genus Corvus have been comprehensively studied, relatively {{little is known about}} the <b>Forest</b> <b>Raven.</b> While recently studies have been made of the closely related Northern <b>Forest</b> <b>Raven</b> (C. t. boreus) in New South Wales, this is the first study to be undertaken on the biology of the <b>Forest</b> <b>Raven</b> in Tasmania. Overall, the results of this study suggest that <b>Forest</b> <b>Ravens</b> are similar in their breeding biology and behaviour to other corvid species with similar life-histories, both in Australia and overseas. Adult breeding <b>Forest</b> <b>Ravens</b> maintain large self-sufficient territories year-round. Juvenile ravens remain in these territories with their parents for some months after fledging, before leaving to join nomadic flocks comprising immature birds and non-breeding adults. This study focused on the breeding biology and the behaviour of territory-holding adult <b>Forest</b> <b>Ravens</b> in six territories in light bushland around Hobart, southern Tasmania. Ravens built nests in trees characteristic of the tallest vegetation of the area, nests being situated on average 24 m above the ground. The <b>Forest</b> <b>Raven</b> nesting season began in August. Incubation and nestling periods lasted around 22 days and 37 - 49 days respectively, with second clutches being laid in the event of the failure of the first. <b>Forest</b> <b>Ravens</b> produced on average 1. 9 fledglings per pair per nesting season, with most pairs producing two fledglings. The survival rate of fledglings to one month was very high. Away from the nest, and outside the breeding season, <b>Forest</b> <b>Ravens</b> are consistent with other bird species in spending most of their time in perching behaviour and foraging. The <b>Forest</b> <b>Raven</b> is a common and distinctive member of Tasmania's avifauna, and is of commercial importance due to the damage it causes in orchards. Due to the perception of the <b>Forest</b> <b>Raven</b> as an agricultural pest the species is one of only three native bird species not protected by Tasmanian law. In a number of countries corvids are becoming increasingly urban, causing problems through aggressive behaviour, noise and unsanitary mess. Although this has not yet been reported in the <b>Forest</b> <b>Raven,</b> a potential increase in food sources as a result of suburban spread in Tasmania may in the future lead to greater numbers of ravens in such areas. By providing information on the breeding and behaviour of the <b>Forest</b> <b>Raven,</b> the results of this study may be of use in the development of plans or devices to manage the species in a controlled, effective and non-lethal way...|$|R

50|$|Sedentary and territorial, the <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> {{is similar}} in {{breeding}} and feeding habits to the Australian raven. A single breeding pair and their brood occupy a territory of variable size—areas of 40 to 400 ha have been recorded—and remains there year-round, though groups of ravens may enter this area to forage. In northern New South Wales, <b>forest</b> <b>ravens</b> have been recorded nesting near Australian ravens and Torresian crows. They were observed warding off the Australian ravens but to a degree permitting the crows to pass through their territories. <b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> will defend their territory by chasing and mobbing intruding birds of prey as large as wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles. Agonistic displays to ward off potential intruders include flying to a high perch and calling loudly with head extended and hackles raised. <b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> will give their wings a flick on the upward wingbeat when flying to the perch and may continue flicking their wings after landing. Subadult and nonbreeding <b>forest</b> <b>ravens</b> form flocks that move around, though they may use the same roosting site {{for a few months}} at a time. <b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> generally walk when moving around on the ground, though do hop when hurrying, such as when trying to avoid an oncoming car on a road.|$|R

50|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> {{fly from}} Tasmania and the {{mainland}} to islands well offshore in Bass Strait {{and may even}} traverse the strait entirely. First recorded on King Island in Bass Strait in 1979, the <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> has become more numerous and flocks of several hundred birds were recorded by 1997. The island was previously inhabited by little ravens.|$|R
50|$|Like the Australian raven on {{mainland}} Australia, the <b>Forest</b> <b>raven</b> in Tasmania has {{a history}} of being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers as it is perceived to be a threat to livestock and orchard crops. It is not protected under Tasmania's Nature Conservation Act 2002 and no permit is required if landowners seek to kill them. Larger numbers of <b>forest</b> <b>ravens</b> (alongside swamp harriers and brown falcons) were killed in 1958 as rabbit populations dwindled due to myxomatosis and predatory birds were thought to have turned their attention to poultry and livestock. Studies on corvids elsewhere in Australia showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked, and hence their poor reputation was unjustified. <b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> may do more good than harm by preying on insects and removing carrion. Despite their fondness for roadkill, <b>forest</b> <b>ravens</b> are rarely hit by vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Ian Rowley {{proposed}} that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north. The raven diverged into the ancestor of the <b>forest</b> and little <b>ravens</b> {{in the east and}} Australian raven in the west. As the climate was cooler and drier, the aridity of central Australia split them entirely as the habitat between became inhospitable. Furthermore, the eastern diverged into nomadic little <b>ravens</b> and, in <b>forested</b> refuges, <b>forest</b> <b>ravens.</b> As the climate eventually became warmer, the western ravens spread eastwards and outcompeted <b>forest</b> <b>ravens</b> on mainland Australia, as evidenced by the <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> being only found in closed forest refuges on the mainland but in a wider variety of habitats in Tasmania.|$|R
50|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> forage {{in pairs}} {{or groups of}} up to ten birds, though they may gather in much larger numbers {{if there is an}} {{abundant}} food source, such as a large carcass, rubbish or insect swarm. The species is attracted to areas where people have discarded excess food, such as rubbish tips, picnic grounds, parks, gardens and roads. <b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks with Torresian crows, little and Australian ravens. In these situations, the more abundant species may exclude the less abundant. In Tasmania, <b>forest</b> <b>ravens</b> have been recorded foraging with Pacific and silver gulls, and black currawongs. Foraging takes place in the early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while walking along and looking, and turning over objects with their bills as they go. <b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> often fly 1 - 2 m above the ground over marshland, heath or beaches looking for food. Nests of various birds, including domestic chickens and burrowing seabirds have been raided for eggs and young. <b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> have been observed attempting to raid the nest of ospreys on the New South Wales north coast.|$|R

The fate of FRL was dependent upon <b>Tasmanian</b> <b>forest</b> practices gaining Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification.

5000|$|Gregory Mathews {{described}} the <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> {{as a distinct}} subspecies—Corvus marianae tasmanicus—of the Australian raven in 1912, its species name derived from Tasmania, the type locality. Rowley raised the <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> to species rank in 1970, noting there were no intermediate forms {{between it and the}} little raven (its closest relative) and that it was clearly larger with a much more massive bill. He described a second subspecies—Corvus tasmanicus boreus—the same year, observing that C. tasmanicus from Tasmania and southern Victoria has a very short tail compared with individuals from the northern New South Wales population. Rowley gave the species name <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> in 1970. The term [...] "crow" [...] is colloquially applied to any or all species of Australian corvid.|$|R
5000|$|Its call is a harsh, {{guttural}} [...] "kar-kar-kar-karrr" [...] or [...] "ark-ark-ark-arrk" [...] with {{a similarly}} drawn-out {{call to the}} Australian and <b>forest</b> <b>raven.</b> Like all species of raven in Australia (with {{the exception of the}} <b>forest</b> <b>raven)</b> the little raven sometimes stretches or flicks its wings outward slightly when calling. Like all corvids, the little raven is capable of vocal mimicry, but this behavior is mostly recorded in captivity and only rarely in the wild.|$|R
50|$|Rowley {{proposed}} that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north.

50|$|Alongside Australian <b>ravens,</b> <b>forest</b> <b>ravens</b> {{have been}} blamed for {{damaging}} orchards and killing lambs and poultry. This is not supported by fieldwork. They most often scavenge for afterbirth and newborn lamb faeces, which are highly nutritious. They {{are thought to have}} a beneficial role in cleaning up carcasses and consuming insect pests. <b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> prey on the larvae of the pasture beetle Scitala sericans. The beetle can damage pastures and is an agricultural pest; the raven may uproot plants when digging out the grubs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> cache {{food items}} for later consumption, {{generally}} using trees to evade other scavengers. Field observations in Nambucca showed that they built stick-like platforms 30 - 40 cm in diameter {{high in the}} canopies of trees as places to store and eat food. They were recorded storing food in tree forks 10 - 20 m above the ground and within {{the folds of the}} bark of paperbark trees. In another field study, a <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> stole a cape barren goose egg and hid it in a grassy tussock to consume later.|$|R

50|$|Sexes have {{identical}} plumage; {{the male}} is generally larger, {{but there is}} considerable overlap in size between individuals. The <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> can be distinguished from the two species of crow occurring in Australia by the grey base of the feathers, which is white in the latter species. The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows. Feather bases are not normally visible when observing birds in the field, but can sometimes be seen on a windy day if the feathers are ruffled. The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species, with the <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> the stockiest of all. Relative size is only useful when two species can be seen side by side, as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small. In Tasmania, the <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> could {{be confused with the}} black currawong, though the latter species has more slender wings with white markings, a longer tail and a very different call.|$|R
50|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> breed after {{at least}} three years, and form monogamous pairs. Birds breed later in Tasmania than {{mainland}} Australia, though the species has been little-studied. Eggs have been recorded from July to September and nestlings in September and October in New South Wales, while nestlings have been noted from September to December in Victoria. In Tasmania, the breeding season appears to take place from August to January. <b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> generally nest in forks in tall trees, usually eucalypts, below the canopy line. They have been recorded nesting on the ground on some Bass Strait Islands. Breeding success rates were impacted severely by droughts in New South Wales.|$|R
50|$|The <b>forest</b> <b>raven</b> is an omnivore, {{though it}} eats more meat than smaller corvids. Its diet {{includes}} {{a wide range}} of foods such as insects, carrion, fruit, grain and earthworms. It has been known to attack and eat birds as large as the little penguin, though many birds and mammals are already dead when encountered. In general, a significant proportion of its food appears to come from habitats in or near water. <b>Forest</b> <b>ravens</b> observed on the beach at Wilson's Promontory would glean the sand and turn over or disturb pieces of seaweed and debris for insect prey. They have also been reported taking crabs from sandbars and raiding seabird colonies for eggs and young.|$|R

50|$|The mite Knemidocoptes intermedius {{has been}} {{isolated}} from the <b>forest</b> <b>raven.</b> Infestation results in crusty (hyperkeratotic) grey lesions around their tibiotarsal joints, the mites living in tunnels under the skin.

5|$|Ian Rowley {{proposed}} that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north, which molecular evidence indicates occurred in the early Pliocene epoch around 4 million years ago. The raven diverged into the ancestor of the <b>forest</b> and little <b>ravens</b> {{in the east and}} Australian raven in the west, this split occurring around 2 million years ago in the early Pleistocene. As the climate became cooler and drier, the aridity of central Australia split them entirely. Furthermore, the eastern birds diverged into nomadic little <b>ravens</b> and, in <b>forested</b> refuges, <b>forest</b> <b>ravens.</b> As the climate eventually became warmer, the western birds spread eastwards and almost outcompeted <b>forest</b> <b>ravens</b> on mainland Australia.
