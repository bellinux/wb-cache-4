5|$|Einsteinium was {{discovered}} {{as a component}} of the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Albert Einstein. Its most common isotope einsteinium-253 (half-life 20.47 days) is produced artificially from decay of californium-253 in a few dedicated high-power nuclear reactors with a <b>total</b> <b>yield</b> on the order of one milligram per year. The reactor synthesis is followed by a complex process of separating einsteinium-253 from other actinides and products of their decay. Other isotopes are synthesized in various laboratories, but at much smaller amounts, by bombarding heavy actinide elements with light ions. Owing to the small amounts of produced einsteinium and the short half-life of its most easily produced isotope, there are currently almost no practical applications for it outside basic scientific research. In particular, einsteinium was used to synthesize, for the first time, 17 atoms of the new element mendelevium in 1955.|$|E

40|$|The influenceof the ion [...] atom {{potential}} on sputtering parameters calculated with {{molecular dynamics}} simulations was last investigated in detail by Harrison in 1980 [J. Appl. Phys. 52 (1981) 1499]. Harrison concluded that exceptfc <b>total</b> <b>yields,</b> layer yields, yieldsfel di#erent crystal orientations and atom per single ion (ASI) distributions, most sputtering properties were relatively {{insensitive to the}} choiceof ion [...] atom potential. Since conventional sputtering theory predicts that only the <b>total</b> <b>yields</b> should be dependent on the ion [...] atom potential, we have reinvestigated this problem with much higher precision. We find that only the <b>total</b> <b>yields</b> {{are sensitive to the}} ion [...] atom potential, and these appear to depend on the strengthof the ion [...] atom potential at a separation radiusof approximately 0. 7 # A rather than the larger separation radius rangeof 0. 8 [...] 1. 1 # A suggested by Harrison.

25|$|Growth {{overfishing}} {{occurs when}} fish are harvested {{at an average}} size that is smaller than the size that would produce the maximum yield per recruit. A recruit is an individual that makes it to maturity, or into the limits specified by a fishery, which are usually size or age. This makes the <b>total</b> <b>yield</b> less {{than it would be}} if the fish were allowed to grow to an appropriate size. It can be countered by reducing fishing mortality to lower levels and increasing the average size of harvested fish to a size that will allow maximum yield per recruit.|$|E
25|$|Scheme 2 is {{the newer}} {{synthesis}} route {{which was designed}} to make the reaction more direct and to produce better yields. This route uses L-glutamine rather than L-glutamic acid as a starting material and by letting it react with N-carbethoxyphthalimide gives N-phthaloyl-L-glutamine (4), with 50–70% yield. The substance 4 is then stirred in a mixture with carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) with enough 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to catalyze the reaction and heated to reflux for 15–18 hours. During the reflux thalidomide crystallizes out of the mixture. The final step gives 85–93% yield of thalidomide, bringing the <b>total</b> <b>yield</b> to 43–63%.|$|E

By using the volume of the pancreas as an indicator of <b>total</b> islet <b>yield,</b> MRI {{could be used as a}} predictive tool to determine the success of islet transplants. The data was gathered retrospectively from ten transplant patients, and the volume was determined by freehand contouring of the pancreas on MR images. With only ten patients, no significant correlation could be found between the volume vs. <b>total</b> islet <b>yield,</b> volume vs. IEQ (Islet Equivalent unit), mass vs. <b>total</b> islet <b>yield,</b> and mass vs. IEQ, with correlations of 0. 238, 0. 139, 0. 343, and 0. 219, respectively. The lack of correlation between the volume and <b>total</b> islet <b>yield</b> indicates other unaccounted variables such as fibrosis, inflammation, and fatty tissue infiltration that destroy islets but were not included in our volume calculations.

40|$|Neutron fluences were {{measured}} from 435 MeV/nucleon Nb ions stopping in a Nb target and 272 MeV/nucleon Nb ions stopping in targets of Nb and Al for neutrons above 20 MeV and at laboratory angles between 3 degrees and 80 degrees. The resultant spectra were integrated over angles to produce neutron energy distributions and over energy to produce neutron angular distributions. The <b>total</b> neutron <b>yields</b> for each system {{were obtained by}} integrating over the angular distributions. The angular distributions from all three systems are peaked forward, and the energy distributions from all three systems show an appreciable yield of neutrons with velocities greater than the beam velocity. Comparison of the <b>total</b> neutron <b>yields</b> from the two Nb + Nb systems suggests that the average neutron multiplicity decreases with decreasing projectile energy. Comparison of the <b>total</b> <b>yields</b> from the two 272 MeV/nucleon systems suggests that the <b>total</b> <b>yields</b> show the same dependence on projectile and target mass number as do total inclusive neutron cross sections.
