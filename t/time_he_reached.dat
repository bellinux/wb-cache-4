5|$|He joined Bradford City {{for whom}} he made his debut in league {{football}} in August 2007. After two seasons with City, {{he was released from}} his contract and returned to non-league with Mansfield Town. He played two years with Mansfield during which <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> the FA Trophy final before moving to another Conference side Gateshead. Internationally, Nix has represented England at youth level, playing for the U16, U18 and U20 teams, and semi-professional levels but holds an Australian passport and has expressed a desire to play for the latter country.|$|E
5|$|Maclean {{raised a}} force of about 180 Emigrants, {{and a number of}} militia. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> Sorel on October 14, he had raised, in {{addition}} to the Emigrants, about 400 militia men, sometimes using threatening tactics to gain recruits. His and Carleton's hopes were dashed on October 30, when Carleton's attempted landing at Longueuil of a force numbering about 1,000 (mostly militia, with some Emigrants and Indian support) was repulsed by the Americans. A few of his boats were landed, but most were driven off by Seth Warner's use of field artillery that had been captured at Chambly.|$|E
5|$|Caxias {{was growing}} old, and was ill and {{exhausted}} by the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> Asunción. As {{he did not feel}} up to the task of pursuing López into the Paraguayan hinterland, he asked to be either relieved of his post or given a short leave. Although his request was denied, he appointed a senior member of his staff as acting commander, and left for Brazil on 19 January 1869. The Emperor was angered that the marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already won—even though López was still at large and regrouping his few remaining military assets. Caxias' ill-conceived decision seriously endangered the hard-won achievements of the past months, even as the objective of eliminating López as a threat remained tantalizingly within reach.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, Hart's brother Walter {{travelled}} to South Africa {{for service}} with the Fourth Contingent in the Second Boer War. This inspired Hart {{to volunteer for}} the Eighth New Zealand South African Contingent, but his application was declined. However, he, along with another brother, George, successfully enlisted for the Ninth Contingent. The minimum age for volunteers was 20 and he falsified his age to enlist. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> South Africa in April 1902, the war was effectively over. He was discharged in July 1902 with the rank of lance sergeant but travelled to England instead of returning to New Zealand {{with the rest of}} the contingent.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{he began}} the Marathon of Hope, a {{cross-country}} run {{to raise money for}} cancer research. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada's 24 million people. He began with little fanfare from St. John's, Newfoundland, in April and ran the equivalent of a full marathon every day. Fox had become a national star by the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> Ontario; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money. He was forced to end his run outside Thunder Bay when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.|$|E
5|$|Terry-Thomas {{was born}} Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens at 53 Lichfield Grove, Finchley, North London. He {{was the third}} of four {{children}} born to Ernest Frederick Stevens, managing director of a butcher's business at Smithfield Market and part-time amateur actor, and his wife Ellen Elizabeth Stevens (née Hoar). As a child, Terry-Thomas was {{often referred to as}} Tom, the diminutive used by his family. He led a generally happy childhood, but believed that his parents secretly desired a daughter in his place. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> adolescence, his parents' marriage had failed and both became alcoholics. In an attempt to bring them together, Terry-Thomas often entertained them by performing impromptu slapstick routines, reciting jokes and singing and dancing around the family home. The performances seldom worked, and his father became increasingly removed from his family. His parents had divorced by the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|After {{separating}} from Leissègues on 15 December, Willaumez sailed south, capturing {{a number}} of vessels from a British troop convoy and sending the prizes, with the frigate Volontaire, to Tenerife. Willaumez's intention was to raid the China Fleet, a large convoy of valuable East Indiamen that sailed from the Far East to Britain every year. However, on 23 December he was pursued by Duckworth and driven far off course, {{so that by the}} <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> the Cape of Good Hope, where he planned to resupply his ships, it had already been captured by a British expeditionary force. Turning westwards, Willaumez raided shipping in the South Atlantic until April, when he anchored at Salvador in neutral Brazil. By early May, Willaumez was at sea again, stopping at Cayenne and then splitting his force to raid shipping in the Leeward Islands prior to reuniting at Fort-de-France on Martinique in June.|$|E
5|$|By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> his teens, Gygax had a {{voracious}} {{appetite for}} pulp fiction authors such as Robert Howard, Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber, H. P. Lovecraft, and Edgar Burroughs. Gygax was a mediocre student, and in 1956, {{a few months}} after his father died, he {{dropped out of high school}} in his junior year. He briefly joined the Marines, but after being diagnosed with walking pneumonia, he was given a medical discharge and moved back home with his mother. From there, he commuted to a job as shipping clerk with Kemper Insurance Co. in Chicago. Shortly after his return, a friend introduced him to Avalon Hill's new wargame Gettysburg, and Gygax was soon obsessed with the game, often playing marathon sessions once a week or more. It was also from Avalon Hill that he ordered the first blank hexagon mapping sheets that were available, which he then employed to design his own games.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1913 Dyer faced Jack Delaney for {{the vacant}} Wales Area Welterweight title, despite Delaney being English. The fight was staged at the Skating Rink on Westgate Street in Cardiff and was {{scheduled}} for 20 rounds. The fight went the distance and Dyer was awarded the bout on points decision, making him the Welsh welterweight champion. He held the title for just over a month when a rematch for the title ended in victory for Delaney. Despite the loss, a win over Gus Platts—who would later become British and European middleweight champion—in October resulted in Dyer being touted {{as one of the}} preferred challengers to the British welterweight champion Johnny Summers. Summers though had travelled to Australia to extend his boxing campaign, and in the spring of 1914 Dyer decided to follow him abroad to challenge for his title. Dyer stopped off en route in South Africa to play music halls in a bid to help pay his fares. Dyer entertained with a mixture of songs and shadow boxing, and challenged all-comers to fight with him {{at the end of the}} show. Unfortunately for Dyer, by the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> Australia, Summers had already returned to Britain.|$|E

5|$|With his {{improved}} ranking (No. 37), Raonic earned direct {{entry to}} Grand Slam tournaments and other ATP World Tour events {{for the first}} <b>time.</b> <b>He</b> <b>reached</b> the third round at both the Indian Wells Masters and the Monte-Carlo Masters. In May, Raonic rose to a new career-high ranking of No. 25. He was seeded {{for the first time}} at a Grand Slam event at the French Open, but lost in the first round to Michael Berrer. At the Halle Open, Raonic reached his first ATP World Tour doubles final, partnered with Robin Haase. The pair lost to Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi in the deciding super tiebreak. During his second round singles match at Wimbledon against Gilles Müller, Raonic retired with an early lead after injuring his right hip when he slipped and fell on the grass. He underwent hip surgery which prevented him from competing until September. His only significant result in the latter half of 2011 after returning from injury was a semifinal appearance at the Stockholm Open, where he lost to Gaël Monfils.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{changed for}} Barber in the 1932 season, when Yorkshire's regular, long serving opening batsman Percy Holmes began to suffer with illness. This left a batting place empty and enabled Barber to play more regularly. Wisden Cricketer's Almanack {{believed}} that he thoroughly deserved {{his place in the}} team as he scored exactly 1,000 runs at an average of 25.64, the first <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> four figures in a season. He finished fifth in the Yorkshire batting averages, {{the first time he had}} been placed so high. His runs also played a part in Yorkshire winning the County Championship in his first full season. After this breakthrough, Barber steadily improved his total of runs and batting average, helping Yorkshire to win the County Championship twice in 1933 and 1935. In 1933, he scored 1,595 runs at an average of 33.93, and in 1934 he scored 1,927 runs at an average of 40.14. In both seasons he finished fourth in the Yorkshire averages. However, Barber's best season statistically was the following season, 1935, when he achieved his best aggregate of runs and highest average in an English season, passing 2,000 runs in a season for the only time in his career. He scored 2,147 runs at an average of 42.09 and finished third in the Yorkshire averages. These performances earned him selection for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's Cricket Ground for the only time in his career, where he scored 61 and 18 not out.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 2014, Angle {{was named}} Executive Director of Wrestling Operations of TNA by TNA's Board of Directors. He {{announced}} a TNA World Heavyweight Championship rematch for the July 3 episode of Impact Wrestling between Lashley and Eric Young, and reinstated Bobby Roode, {{who had been}} indefinitely suspended by MVP. Angle also retired the TNA Television Championship, which had not been seen or defended since Abyss won it at Slammiversary 2013. On September 18, 2014 (aired on October 29 due to tape delay), Angle refereed the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between Bobby Roode and Bobby Lashley. Angle's contract with TNA was due to expire on September 14, 2014. Around this <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> out to Vince McMahon to offer his services {{for a return to}} the WWE. Unbeknownst to him Triple H had taken over McMahon's former duties. Angle offered to return as a part-time wrestler due to concerns of his age and health. Angle was caught off guard when WWE declined his services. It is speculated that WWE only offered a full-time contract which Angle didn't accept or WWE declined his return due to past relationship issues with him. After he was denied by WWE, he quickly signed a part-time contract with TNA Wrestling. On September 21, 2014, Angle's contract with TNA expired, ending his eight-year tenure with the company. Angle teased a return to WWE, however, he was offered a full-time contract, so Angle decided to stay with TNA.|$|E

5|$|Peter then {{returned}} to Constantinople with letters from Theodahad and the Roman Senate to the imperial couple, bearing pleas for a peaceful solution, but by the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> the imperial capital, Emperor Justinian had resolved on war and was preparing his forces. Consequently, Peter returned to Italy {{in the summer of}} 535 conveying an ultimatum: only if Theodahad abdicated and returned Italy to imperial rule, could war be averted. A two-pronged Byzantine offensive followed soon thereafter, attacking the outlying possessions of the Ostrogothic kingdom: Belisarius took Sicily, while Mundus invaded Dalmatia. Upon hearing these news, Theodahad despaired, and Peter was able to secure wide-ranging concessions from him: Sicily was to be ceded to the Byzantine Empire; the Gothic king's authority within Italy was severely restricted; a gold crown was to be sent as an annual tribute and up to 3,000 men were to be provided for the imperial army, underlining Theodahad's subject status. Theodahad, however, fearing that his first offer would be rejected, then instructed Peter, under oath, to offer the cession of all Italy, but only if the original concessions were rejected by Justinian. In the event, Justinian rejected the first proposal, and was delighted to learn of the second one. Peter was sent back to Italy with Athanasius, bearing letters to Theodahad and the Gothic nobles, and for a time {{it seemed as if the}} cradle of the Roman Empire would return peacefully to the fold. It was not to be: upon their arrival in Ravenna, the Byzantine envoys found Theodahad in a changed disposition. Supported by the Gothic nobility and buoyed up by a success against Mundus in Dalmatia, he resolved to resist, and imprisoned the ambassadors.|$|E
5|$|The Crown {{responded to}} reports of anarchy in Honduras by naming the elderly Diego Alvítez as the royal governor. Alvítez's fleet was wrecked some leagues away from Trujillo {{towards the end}} of October 1532, and he {{finished}} his journey on foot. By the time he arrived in the colonial capital, soon after Cerezeda had taken sole charge, he was near death. On 2 November, he named Cerezeda as acting governor, and died soon afterwards. Opposing factions once again formed, one of them headed by Diego Díaz de Herrera, and Cerezeda clung to power with great difficulty. To stabilise the province, he organised another expedition to settle the Naco valley. He sent a captain with sixty soldiers south and intended to follow with reinforcements, but was delayed in Trujillo by reports of a Spanish expedition approaching along the coast from the west. The new arrivals were led by Alonso D'Ávila, one of the officers of Francisco de Montejo, who had been named adelantado of Yucatán. D'Ávila had been attempting to establish a Spanish town {{on the east side of}} the Yucatán Peninsula, but had been forced out by native resistance. Since the entire region was at war with the Spanish, D'Ávila was unable to return to Montejo, and instead forayed along the Caribbean coast in canoes, looking for a suitable location to establish a new settlement. By the <b>time</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> Puerto de Caballos, his expedition was in a perilous state. D'Ávila appealed to Cerezeda for assistance, and the latter sent out supplies to the beleaguered party. D'Ávila and his men finally arrived in Trujillo in early 1533.|$|E
