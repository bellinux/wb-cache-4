5|$|When {{someone is}} {{within range of}} a trap, a sensor bar will move into a red zone. Activating the trap at this moment will capture them. If the trap is {{activated}} when the bar {{is not in the}} red zone, the trap will not work and will become disabled {{for a short period of}} time. The traps will also only work if the access code is correct. There are six possible access codes, and the player must eavesdrop into the conversations <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>when</b> the Martins change the code. When a new code is learned, the player must wait until the speaker leaves the room before changing the access code to the correct color to maintain control of the traps. Counters on the screen indicate how many perpetrators have entered the house and how many have been captured.|$|E
25|$|During the journey, the Cimarrons carried {{most of the}} supplies, such as {{bows and}} arrows for defense against the Spanish. Once {{they arrived at the}} spot where they planned to carry out their ambush in Nombre de Dios, a Cimarron spy was sent to the Spanish post <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>when</b> the {{treasure}} procession would begin. He came back and reported that Treasurer of Lima was to appear on the road within the next few hours. At one point, two Cimarrons were sent to kidnap a sleeping Spanish guard and question him about the Spanish treasure. He confirmed what the English already knew and begged not to be killed. When the mule train arrived with the treasure, the Spanish saw a Cimarron hiding and quickly turned the procession around. Drake and his men still managed to ambush the train but found that it did not carry anything of much value. The Cimarrones vowed to Drake and the English that they would continue being their friends and allies.|$|E

60|$|The Scottish Lowland militia, therefore, laboured under {{a double}} {{disadvantage}} when opposed to Highlanders. They were divested of the spear, a weapon which, {{in the hands}} of their ancestors, had so often repelled the impetuous assaults of the mountaineer; and they were subjected to a new and complicated species of discipline, well adapted, perhaps, to the use of regular troops, who could be rendered completely masters of it, but tending only to confuse the ranks of citizen soldiers, by whom it was rarely practised, and imperfectly understood. So much has been done in our own time in bringing back tactics to their first principles, and in getting rid of the pedantry of war, that it is easy for us to estimate the disadvantages under which a half-trained militia laboured, who were taught to consider success as depending upon their exercising with precision a system of tactics, which they probably only so far comprehended as <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>when</b> they were wrong, but without the power of getting right again. Neither can it be denied, that, in the material points of military habits and warlike spirit, the Lowlanders of the seventeenth century had sunk far beneath their Highland countrymen.|$|E
