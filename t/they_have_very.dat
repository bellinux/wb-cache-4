5|$|Accipitridae is {{a family}} of birds of prey that {{includes}} hawks, eagles, kites, harriers and Old World vultures. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> large, hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight.|$|E
5|$|The swifts {{are small}} birds, {{spending}} {{most of their lives}} flying. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have very long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 12,000 {{millipede}} {{species have}} been described. Estimates of the true number of species on earth range from 15,000 to as high as 80,000. Few species of millipede are at all widespread; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> poor dispersal abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.|$|E
60|$|It {{was evident}} that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little {{confidence}} in Soubise.|$|R
60|$|They {{stopped and}} stood in a row, and {{stared up at the}} kittens. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> small eyes and looked surprised.|$|R
50|$|A study {{assessed}} {{the interaction of}} spironolactone and 7α-TS with sex hormone-binding globulin and found that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> low affinity for this carrier protein.|$|R
5|$|The {{individual}} apparent magnitudes {{of the two}} component stars {{cannot be}} directly measured, but their relative brightness has been measured at various wavelengths. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> nearly equal brightness in the visible light spectrum, with the hotter secondary component generally being {{found to be a}} few tenths of a magnitude brighter. A 2016 measurement gives the magnitude difference between the two stars at a wavelength of 700 nm as 0.00 ± 0.1.|$|E
5|$|European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting {{their prey}} against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly {{continuously}} on darker nights when prey {{is harder to}} see. Hunting frequency reduces {{in the middle of}} the night. Although <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the chitin exoskeleton, are regurgitated as pellets.|$|E
5|$|Giant impacts {{are thought}} to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer {{simulations}} of a giant impact have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the present angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations also show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth. More recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the original Earth mass. Studies of meteorites originating from inner Solar System bodies such as Mars and Vesta show that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions as compared to Earth, whereas Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two, although this is debated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> {{long legs}} and necks, and were {{probably}} adapted to eating high vegetation, much like modern giraffes. Unlike modern camelids, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> hooves, rather than tough sole-pads and splayed toes.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> {{little time}} to {{complete}} the project with only four weeks in the studio. As a result, the last track, Mecadence, was left somewhat incomplete.|$|R
60|$|Edward {{afterwards}} {{learned that}} these severe precautions {{had been taken}} in consequence of a desperate attempt of the prisoners to escape, in which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> nearly succeeded.|$|R
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully must report to their supervisor, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) after Mulder kills a young man he believes to be a vampire. After each recollecting their takes on the event, they realize that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> different memories of the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The games {{introduce}} Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, {{some new}} types of legendary Pokémon that wander around Johto, changing locations frequently. They can be tracked by the Pokédex once encountered, and will always attempt to flee, but will retain HP loss. In addition {{there is the possibility}} of encountering a shiny Pokémon, which have a different coloration than normal Pokémon of their species, and appear very rarely. Two new Pokémon types were added, the Steel-type and the Dark-type. Steel-type Pokémon are immune to Poison-type moves, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> high defense and resistance to other types, while Dark-type Pokémon are immune to Psychic-type moves and are strong against Psychic-type Pokémon, as well as having few weaknesses. In Gold and Silver, new moves were added, but Pokémon knowing these moves are not allowed to be traded to the first generation games. To solve this, a move deleter was introduced, capable of erasing moves known by the Pokémon. Another major change was the splitting of the Special stat into Special Attack and Special Defense, which increased aspects of strategy.|$|E
5|$|Two thick {{folds of}} skin {{encircle}} the body {{behind the front}} legs and before the hind legs. The rhino has a smaller fold of skin around its neck. The skin itself is thin, , and in the wild, the rhino appears to have no subcutaneous fat. Hair can range from dense (the most dense hair in young calves) to scarce, and is usually a reddish brown. In the wild, this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud. In captivity, however, the hair grows out and becomes much shaggier, likely because of less abrasion from walking through vegetation. The rhino has a patch of long hair around its ears and a thick clump of hair {{at the end of}} its tail. Like all rhinos, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> poor vision. The Sumatran rhinoceros is fast and agile; it climbs mountains easily and comfortably traverses steep slopes and riverbanks.|$|E
5000|$|Many had criticized {{this show}} {{for being a}} replica of another Hong Kong drama series, Shine On You, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> similar content, and even the show titles were similar.|$|R
50|$|Selvadurai {{has stated}} that Funny Boy should {{not be seen as}} an autobiography. While both he and Arjie are gay and Sri Lankans who immigrated to Canada, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> {{different}} experiences.|$|R
60|$|However, by the sorcery of accident, before <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> far retraced their steps an open {{carriage}} became visible round {{a bend in}} the drive. Chickerel, with a servant's instinct, was for {{beating a}} retreat.|$|R
25|$|Slab serif typefaces date {{to about}} 1800. Originally {{intended}} as attention-grabbing designs for posters, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> thick serifs, {{which tend to}} be as thick as the vertical lines themselves.|$|E
25|$|A third {{branch of}} {{thinking}} takes an intermediate position, arguing {{that after the}} fall of Adam and Eve, humans are born impacted by sin such that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> decided tendencies toward sinning (which by personal choice all accountable humans but Jesus soon choose to indulge).|$|E
25|$|Since leaves provide little energy, sloths {{deal with}} this by a range of economy measures: <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> low {{metabolic}} rates (less than half of that expected for a mammal of their size), and maintain low body temperatures when active (30–34°C or 86–93°F), and still lower temperatures when resting.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a quarter}} of an hour before the detectives came back, and then <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little to say, {{excepting}} that they would report the particulars at headquarters and endeavor to run down the criminal.|$|R
50|$|The {{science of}} {{ampelography}} began seriously in the 19th century, when it suddenly became {{important to understand}} more about the different species of vine, as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> different resistance to disease and pests such as phylloxera.|$|R
50|$|Coccoderma is a genus {{of prehistoric}} lobe-finned fish which lived during the Late Jurassic period, Kimmeridgian Stage. Fossils {{have been found}} in the USA. It was small in size, about 27,5 cm. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> long and sharp teeth.|$|R
25|$|Class 3 {{barrier layer}} or semiconductive ceramic {{capacitors}} have very high permittivity, up to 50,000 {{and therefore a}} better volumetric efficiency than class 2 capacitors. However, these capacitors have worse electrical characteristics, including lower accuracy and stability. The dielectric is characterized by very high nonlinear change of capacitance over the temperature range. The capacitance value additionally depends on the voltage applied. As well, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> high losses and age over time.|$|E
25|$|Text {{adventure}} {{games are}} more accessible. There {{are only a}} small number of standard formats, and nearly all the classics can be played on modern computers. A popular text adventure interpreter is Frotz, which can play all the old Infocom text adventures. Some modern text adventure games can even be played on very old computer systems. Text adventure games are also suitable for personal digital assistants, because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> small computer system requirements. Other text adventure games are fully playable via web browsers.|$|E
25|$|Although other {{cells can}} use other fuels (most {{prominently}} fatty acids), neurons depend on glucose {{as a source}} of energy, unless the person is in ketosis. They do not require insulin to absorb glucose, unlike muscle and adipose tissue, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> small internal stores of glycogen. Glycogen stored in liver cells (unlike glycogen stored in muscle cells) can be converted to glucose, and released into the blood, when glucose from digestion is low or absent, and the glycerol backbone in triglycerides {{can also be used to}} produce blood glucose.|$|E
60|$|They {{stopped and}} stood {{in a row and}} stared up at the kittens. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> small eyes and looked surprised. Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.|$|R
50|$|By the 1780s {{there were}} about 40,000 to 50,000 Jews in France, chiefly {{centered}} in Bordeaux, Metz {{and a few other}} cities. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> limited rights and opportunities, apart from the money-lending business, but their status was not illegal.|$|R
60|$|That day <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little dinner, {{and went}} sadly to bed, knowing {{that for the}} next day there would be none and Jack, unable to sleep from grief and vexation, got up at day-dawn and went out into the garden.|$|R
25|$|Like other {{right whale}} species, the North Pacific right whale feeds by {{skimming}} water continuously while swimming, {{in contrast to}} balaenopterid whales such as the blue and humpback whales which engulf prey in rapid lunges. Right whales do not have pleated throats. Instead <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> large heads and mouths {{that allows them to}} swim with their mouths open, the water with the copepods flowing in, then flowing sideways through the right whale's very long, very fine baleen trapping the copepods, and then out over their large lower lips.|$|E
25|$|Real Madrid {{use this}} style of play {{extremely}} well because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> quick players in the likes of Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema of whom can speed in behind the defence and take them on when on the break at a quick pace. They also have passing masters in Kroos and Modric of whom can play the killer through ball in the spaces created. And for effect, they have a solid defence in Ramos and Varane to defend leads. Marcelo and Carvajal are also very quick full backs and so can get forward on the break too and put crosses in the box during attack, while being able to track back quick enough.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the work}} on organothorium {{compounds}} {{has focused on the}} cyclopentadienyls and cyclooctatetraenyls. Like many of the early and middle actinides (thorium through americium, and also expected for curium), thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex Th(C8H8)2, thorocene. It is isotypic with the more well-known analogous uranium compound, uranocene. Although these f-series cyclooctatetraenyls are not isotypic with the d-series cyclopentadienyls, including the more famous ferrocene, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> similar structures, and were named to emphasise this resemblance. It can be prepared by reacting K2C8H8 with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at the temperature of dry ice, or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgC8H8. It is an unstable compound in air and outright decomposes in water or at 190°C. Half-sandwich compounds are also known, such as 2(η8-C8H8)ThCl2(THF)2, which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.|$|E

60|$|The half-dozen {{who were}} peering at the chain were still among the wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so {{suddenly}} {{that they were}} lucky to save their skins and bones; <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> little else to save, or <b>they</b> might not <b>have</b> been so fortunate.|$|R
50|$|Despite his bold words, the Commune {{was at a}} great disadvantage; the Commune {{forces were}} outnumbered by the army four or five to one; <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>very</b> few trained officers; and, most importantly, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no plan {{for the defense of}} the city; Delescluze called upon each {{neighborhood}} to defend itself.|$|R
