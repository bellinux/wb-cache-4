6000|$|Mr. Tartar’s {{chambers}} {{were the}} neatest, the cleanest, and the best-ordered chambers ever seen under the sun, moon, and stars. The floors were scrubbed to that extent, {{that you might}} have supposed the London blacks emancipated for ever, and gone out of the land for good. Every inch of brass-work in Mr. Tartar’s possession was polished and burnished, till it shone like a brazen mirror. No speck, nor spot, nor spatter soiled the purity of any of Mr. Tartar’s household gods, large, small, or middle-sized. His sitting-room was like the admiral’s cabin, his bath-room was like a dairy, his sleeping-chamber, fitted all about with lockers and drawers, was like a seedsman’s shop; and his nicely-balanced cot just stirred in the midst, as if it breathed. Everything belonging to Mr. Tartar had quarters of its own assigned to it: his maps and charts had their quarters; his books had theirs; his brushes had theirs; his boots had theirs; his clothes had theirs; his case-bottles had theirs; his telescopes and other instruments had theirs. Everything was readily accessible. Shelf, bracket, locker, hook, and drawer were equally within reach, and were equally contrived with a view to avoiding waste of room, and providing some snug inches of stowage for something that would have exactly fitted nowhere else. His gleaming little service of plate was so arranged upon his sideboard as that a slack salt-spoon would have instantly betrayed itself; his toilet implements were so arranged upon his dressing-table as that a toothpick of slovenly deportment could have been reported at a glance. So with the curiosities he had brought home from various voyages. Stuffed, dried, repolished, or otherwise preserved, according to their kind; birds, fishes, reptiles, arms, articles of dress, shells, seaweeds, grasses, or memorials of coral reef; each was displayed in its especial place, and each could have been displayed in no better place. Paint and varnish seemed to be kept somewhere out of sight, in constant readiness to obliterate stray finger-marks wherever any might become perceptible in Mr. Tartar’s chambers. No man-of-war was ever kept more spick and span from careless touch. On this bright summer day, a neat awning was rigged over Mr. Tartar’s flower-garden as only a sailor can rig it, and there was a sea-going air upon the whole effect, so delightfully complete, that the flower-garden might have appertained to stern-windows afloat, and the whole concern might have bowled away gallantly with all on board, if Mr. Tartar had only clapped to his lips the speaking-trumpet that was slung in a corner, and given hoarse orders <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> up, look alive there, men, and get all sail upon her! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Strike {{the tent}} there!"--was the next order. As I hinted before, this {{whalebone}} marquee was never pitched except in port; and {{on board the}} Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to be <b>the</b> next thing <b>to</b> <b>heaving</b> up <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
6000|$|As I {{leaned over}} <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> up <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> I saw <b>the</b> {{bonefish}} flashing nearer. At that instant of thrilling excitement and suspense I could not trust my eyesight. There he was, swimming heavily, {{and he looked}} three feet long, thick and dark and heavy. I got <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> up just as he passed under the canoe. Maybe I did not revel in pride of my quickness of thought and action! ...|$|R
6000|$|And yet, {{half an hour}} later, as {{they were}} dressing-down, the Bank fog dropped on them, [...] "between fish and fish," [...] as they say. It drove {{steadily}} and in wreaths, curling and smoking along the colourless water. The men stopped dressing-down without a word. Long Jack and Uncle Salters slipped the windlass-brakes into their sockets, and began <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> up <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> <b>the</b> windlass jarring as the wet hempen cable strained on the barrel. Manuel and Tom Platt gave a hand at <b>the</b> last. <b>The</b> <b>anchor</b> {{came up with a}} sob, and the riding-sail bellied as Troop steadied her at the wheel. [...] "Up jib and foresail," [...] said he.|$|R
60|$|This {{time the}} wind was also favourable, but, unfortunately, a little too strong; so we were obliged, in the evening, {{to come to an}} anchor in Esquimain River. This river has good {{anchorage}} close to the bank, but is very deep in the lead, or current; this, however, we did not know at the time, and seeing a small schooner close to shore, we rounded to a few fathoms outside of her, and let go our <b>anchor.</b> Whirr! went <b>the</b> chain--ten! twelve! sixteen! till at last forty fathoms ran out, and only a little bit remained on board, and still we had no bottom. After attaching our spare cable to the other one, <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> at last grounded. This, however, was a dangerous situation to remain in, as, if the wind blew strong, we would have to run out to sea, and so much cable would {{take a long time to}} get in; so I ordered my two men, in a very pompous, despotic way, <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> up <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> again. But not a bit would it budge. We all <b>heaved</b> at <b>the</b> windlass; still <b>the</b> obstinate <b>anchor</b> held fast. Again we gave another heave, and smashed both the handspikes.|$|R
60|$|The {{ship was}} found to ride easily by one cable, and the hands were sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{windlass}} <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> up <b>the</b> other <b>anchor,</b> as our lead told us, we had rocks beneath us, and the captain {{was afraid of the}} chafing. <b>The</b> larboard-bower <b>anchor</b> was catted immediately, and there it was left suspended, with a range of cable overhauled, in readiness to let go at a moment's notice. After this, the people were told to get their suppers. As for us officers, we had other things to think of. The Crisis carried a small quarter-boat, and this was lowered into the water, the third-mate and myself manned its oars, and away we went to carry the captain round the ship, in order that he might ascertain the soundings, should it be necessary to get under way in the night. The examination was satisfactory, on all points but one; that of the holding-ground; and we returned to the vessel, having taken good care to trust ourselves in neither the wind nor the current. An anchor-watch was set, with a mate on deck, four hours and four hours, and all hands turned in.|$|R
6000|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} the continuation of her trial trip from Portland to Holyhead, as gathered from the Times, is exceedingly interesting:--When steam was up, and all ready for starting from Portland, the crew were sent forward <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> up <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b> Eighty men sufficed to drag the Great Eastern up to and over her moorings. Bringing <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> out of <b>the</b> ground, however, was not so easily managed; {{and it was not}} till all the musical resources known to sailors on such occasions were nearly exhausted that the tenacious gripe of Trotman's patent was released, when a slow drift with the tide showed that the great ship was again set free. In another minute, without shouting, confusion, or hurry of any kind, and with less noise than is made by a 100-ton coaster, a slight vibration through the ship, with a thin line of foam astern, showed that the screw engines were at work and the vessel once more under way. With such ease, with such perfect quietness and good order was everything accomplished, that the occasional cheering from the yachts and steamers was almost the first token given to those on board that the trial trip had commenced. At a quarter to four the [...] "way" [...] on the vessel was rapid; her head went round like turning a pleasure-boat; and so little sign was given of the ship being under steam, that it seemed rather as if the breakwater had got adrift and was slowly floating past, than that the monster vessel was really cleaving the blue waves with a force which, as yet, we have seen no wind or sea to resist or check. Directly <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> was fished, Captain Harrison passed the word to steam ahead with both engines easily, and the wheels began their revolutions, slowly at first, but nevertheless making a track of foam upon the water such as they never made on the first start from Deptford to the Nore. The accession of speed from working the paddles was at first but slight; not from any want of power, however, but simply from the fact that both engines were ordered to work slowly, and though propelling the great ship at something like eleven knots, were really scarcely driving at indicated half-speed.|$|R
60|$|One young Norwegian {{was eight}} {{feet tall and}} broad in proportion. His {{employer}} was a captain of a fishing boat. One time, {{on the way to}} their home port, a quarrel arose about money due the young giant, and in his anger he <b>heaved</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> overboard. That of course halted the boat, and it stayed halted, because the captain and crew could not <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> heavy <b>anchor</b> without <b>the</b> help of their brawny comrade. Finally the money matter was adjusted, and <b>the</b> young giant <b>heaved</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> without assistance. Nielsen went on to tell that this fisherman of such mighty frame had a beautiful young wife whom he adored. She was not by any means a small or frail girl--rather the contrary--but she appeared diminutive beside her giant husband. One day he returned from a long absence on the sea. When his wife, in her joy, ran into his arms, he gave her such a tremendous hug that he crushed her chest, and she died. In his grief the young husband went insane and did not survive her long.|$|R
60|$|But {{the time}} came when these rehearsals must be put in practice. The sails were lowered, and all hands <b>heaved</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> short. <b>The</b> {{whaleboat}} was then cut adrift, the upper topsails and the spanker set, the yards braced up, and the spanker sheet hauled out to starboard.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can {{get back}} to the wedging, and send two or three boys along <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> water out. I'll keep this thing going," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|Steph. Cut {{down the}} hammocks! {{cut down the}} hammocks! come, my lads: [...] Come, bullies, chear up! <b>heave</b> lustily. <b>The</b> <b>anchor's</b> apeak.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was a fine}} {{trick to}} play on an orphan, WASN'T it? I suppose I'll never hear the last of how I was ass enough <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> lead {{at the head of}} 66.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Robertson {{blinked at}} him with furtive, half-open eyes. [...] "I don't quite know--it's a heavy job. We have <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> piston up," [...] he said. [...] "Besides that, she has knocked things loose below." ...|$|R
60|$|He called some of {{his companions}} on board, and when Frank and Harry sat down to an {{excellent}} meal in the steamer's cabin they heard <b>the</b> men <b>heaving</b> <b>the</b> schooner's <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>Heave</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> short! [...] Raise main-sail and jib--steer forth, [...] O little white-hull'd sloop, now {{speed on}} really deep waters, [...] (I will not call it our {{concluding}} voyage, [...] But outset and sure {{entrance to the}} truest, best, maturest;) [...] Depart, depart from solid earth--no more returning to these shores, [...] Now on for aye our infinite free venture wending, [...] Spurning all yet tried ports, seas, hawsers, densities, gravitation, [...] Sail out for good, eidolon yacht of me! ...|$|R
60|$|One {{night the}} captain (who {{was one of}} those fellows mightily {{addicted}} to punch), instead of going ashore to saturate himself with rum at the ordinary, had his drink in his cabin in private. While he lay snoring away the effects of his rum in the cabin, Avary and a few other conspirators <b>heaved</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> very leisurely, and sailed out of the harbor of Corunna, and through the midst of the allied fleet riding at <b>anchor</b> in <b>the</b> darkness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of use! He {{is worth}} {{no more than}} the carcase of a whale that has been {{stripped}} of its blubber. I say, Miles, there would be no need of <b>the</b> windlass <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> blanket off of this fish!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{windlass}} {{is simply}} a horizontal, instead of a perpendicular capstan. Its sole purpose is for <b>heaving</b> up <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> and it is placed close to {{the bow of the}} ship.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Markham," [...] {{said the}} captain, {{as the second}} mate turned away, [...] "send a hand in <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chains <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> lead. I don't feel at all easy in my mind, so near these shoals as we must be just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|The bight of the pack-rope {{under the}} dead man's {{shoulders}} enabled him <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> body {{out of the}} hole. Then he set to work gathering up his gold. He worked steadily for several hours, pausing often to rest his stiffening shoulder and to exclaim: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> command <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> {{lead was}} {{followed}} by an order to reduce sail, and as the gale freshened and the night closed in, this order was repeated more than once, until the schooner was beating to windward under the smallest possible amount of canvas.|$|R
60|$|Shortly {{after this}} they <b>heaved</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> and started again, but {{once more the}} wind fell light {{and a couple of}} hours had passed and they were almost frozen when they reached the cove below the ranch. The house was dark when they crept into it and went {{straight}} to bed, while it cost Frank a determined effort to get up before daylight next morning. His clothes were still damp and he felt sore and aching, but he took his place with the others when they sat down to breakfast.|$|R
60|$|The {{wind was}} from the north-east, and was blowing a fresh gale. The Prince {{prepared}} to put to sea. While <b>the</b> men were <b>heaving</b> at <b>the</b> <b>anchors</b> a message came to Cyril that Prince Rupert wished {{to speak to him}} in his cabin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, 'tis likely; if it {{had been}} me, I should have been land-sick before this--ware round, boys, and stand by <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to</b> on <b>the</b> other tack." ...|$|R
6000|$|Winifred's bosom began <b>to</b> <b>heave.</b> <b>The</b> {{nostalgia for}} her husband which had rushed up with that scent was {{struggling}} with a deeper jealousy than any she had felt yet. There he was--a dark, and as if harried, shadow of his sleek and brazen self! What force had done this to him--squeezed him like an orange to its dry rind! That woman! ...|$|R
40|$|When a ship leaves <b>the</b> wharf <b>heaving</b> up <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> {{it is very}} {{important}} for captain to estimate the tracks of bow and stern. Using Nansei Maru and Keiten Maru, I measured the tracks of bow and stern and got the following results: 1. The track of bow has no relation with <b>the</b> speed of <b>heaving</b> up <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b> 2. <b>The</b> ratio of the maximum length of swinging out of stern to ship’s length over all (K_{max}/L_{OA}) is proportional to the cable direction (θ) and its ratio is calculated by the following expression; Nansei Maru K_{max}/L_{OA}= 0. 00275 θ- 0. 0103. Keiten Maru K_{max}/L_{OA}= 0. 00271 θ- 0. 0182. 3. In case that the swinging out of stern is greatest, the turning angle of the ship (α) is as follows; Nansei Maruα= 0. 5554 θ- 0. 349. Keiten Maru α= 0. 5573 θ- 0. 418. and in practice we can get the turning angle by the following expression, α= 5 / 9 θ. 4. In case that the cable direction is 63 °~ 73 °, the trace of the bow is at the right angle with the bow and aft midship line in the early stage of <b>heaving</b> up <b>the</b> <b>anchor.</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I'll {{tell you}} what I've done," [...] Carson called down. [...] "I've made heel-holds and hand-holes for you {{alongside}} of me. I'm going <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> rope in slow and easy, and you just come along sticking an' not too fast. I'll {{tell you what}}, first of all. I'll take you on the rope and you worry out of that pack. Get me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Magrath, with a {{grinning}} sneer, as he rose {{to descend}} to the cock-pit, [...] "there'll may be arise an occasion for a little learning, when I'll promise ye all the science that can be mustered in my unworthy knowledge. Soundings, I may have <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> lead {{in the depths of}} your physical formation, in which case I'll just endeevour to avoid the breakers of ignorance." ...|$|R
60|$|July 5. A steamer was sighted about midnight by the U. S. S. Hawk, {{formerly}} the yacht Hermione, off {{the north coast}} of Pinar del Rio, steaming eastward, close inshore. She {{paid no attention to}} three shots across her bow, or a signal <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> Hawk then opened fire and gave chase.|$|R
60|$|She {{was still}} {{hard at it}} when a big boy appeared, and began <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> trunks into another char; but gave out at the second, which was large. Instantly the brisk old woman put him aside, hoisted in the big boxes without help, and, {{catching}} up the shafts of the heavily laden cart, trotted away with it at a pace which caused the Americans (who prided themselves on their muscle) to stare after her in blank amazement.|$|R
60|$|The {{great red}} ship had drawn {{considerably}} nearer shore by now. Slowly, majestically, she was entering the bay. Already {{one or two}} wherries were putting off from the wharf to board her. From where he stood, Mr. Blood could see the glinting of the brass cannons mounted on the prow above the curving beak-head, and {{he could make out}} the figure of a seaman in the forechains on her larboard side, leaning out <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> lead.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, Master Vickars," [...] one of them, Roger Browne by name, said, [...] "that I had best go up first. I {{served for}} some years at sea, and am used to {{climbing}} about in dizzy places. It is no easy matter to get from this window sill astride the roof above us, and moreover I am more like <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> grapnel {{so that it will}} hook firmly on to the ridge than you are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] said Karlsefin, [...] "lower <b>the</b> sail, <b>heave</b> out <b>the</b> <b>anchor,</b> and let two men cast {{loose the}} little boat. Some {{of us will}} land {{and see what we}} shall see; for it must not be said of us, Biarne, as it was unfairly said of you, that we took no {{interest}} in these new regions." ...|$|R
60|$|Billy was {{impressed}} by the ease with which the Roamer was operated. While they lingered at table, at a word from Hastings the two Japanese had gone on deck. Billy could hear them throwing down the halyards, casting off gaskets, and <b>heaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchor</b> short on <b>the</b> tiny winch. In several minutes one called down that everything was ready, and all went on deck. Hoisting mainsail and jigger was a matter of minutes. Then the cook and cabin-boy broke out anchor, and, while one hove it up, the other hoisted the jib. Hastings, at the wheel, trimmed the sheet. The Roamer paid off, filled her sails, slightly heeling, and slid across the smooth water and out the mouth of New York Slough. The Japanese coiled the halyards and went below for their own dinner.|$|R
60|$|The polacre had {{now taken}} its place to leeward {{of the other}} two vessels, and they held on in that order until the frigate was within half a mile; when she fired a gun across their bows, as signal for them <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> brig was now flying the British colours; her prizes the British colours, with the Spanish {{underneath}} them. At <b>the</b> order <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>to,</b> they were all thrown up into the wind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold {{the thing}} lower!" [...] he exclaimed sharply. [...] "It's as I suspected--this is where Gladwyne got across; {{though he has}} better nerves than I thought he had. The broken end of a branch or two rested right here, and he was smart enough <b>to</b> <b>heave</b> <b>the</b> butt off the other bank, after he'd crawled over. Looks {{to me as if}} it had broken off yonder stump. Guess there'll be light enough to look for a way across in half an hour." ...|$|R
