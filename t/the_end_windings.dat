50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>windings</b> and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage axial blower mounted on the generator shaft comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – An {{induction}} motor operated with high voltage source generally generates high current in starting mode {{and has a}} long transient time after being started.

This force {{is the source of}} vibration and has a negative and serious influence on the insulation of end windings. There-fore, designing the end winding part with an appropriate support system is needed. To design the sup-port ring enclosing <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>windings,</b> we analyze the distribution of electromagnetic force on <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>windings</b> by applying the Biot–Savart’s law and the 3 D finite element method (FEM), and comparing two simulation methods.

40|$|The {{rotational}} speed of high-speed electric machines is over 15 000 rpm. These machines are compact in size {{when compared to}} the power rate. As a consequence, the heat fluxes are at a high level and the adequacy of cooling becomes an important design criterion. In the high-speed machines, the air gap between the stator and rotor is a narrow flow channel. The cooling air is produced with a fan and the flow is then directed to the air gap. The flow in the gap does not provide sufficient cooling for <b>the</b> stator <b>end</b> <b>windings,</b> and therefore additional cooling is required. This study investigates the heat transfer and flow fields around <b>the</b> coil <b>end</b> <b>windings</b> when cooling jets are used. As a result, an innovative and new assembly is introduced for the cooling jets, with the benefits of a reduced amount of hot spots, a lower pressure drop, and hence a lower power need for the cooling fan. The gained information can also be applied to improve the cooling of electric machines through geometry modifications. The objective of the research is to determine the locations of the hot spots and to find out induced pressure losses with different jet alternatives. Several possibilities to arrange the extra cooling are considered. In the suggested approach cooling is provided by using a row of air jets. The air jets have three main tasks: to cool the coils effectively by direct impingement jets, to increase and cool down the flow that enters <b>the</b> coil <b>end</b> space through <b>the</b> air gap, and to ensure the correct distribution of the flow by forming an air curtain with additional jets. One important aim of this study is the arrangement of cooling jets in such manner that hot spots can be avoided to wide extent. This enables higher power density in high-speed motors. This cooling system can also be applied to the ordinary electric machines when efficient cooling is needed. The numerical calculations have been performed using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics software. Two geometries have been generated: cylindrical for the studied machine and Cartesian for the experimental model. The main parameters include the positions, arrangements and number of jets, the jet diameters, and the jet velocities. The investigated cases have been tested with two widely used turbulence models and using a computational grid of over 500 000 cells. The experimental tests have been made by using a simplified model for <b>the</b> <b>end</b> winding space with cooling jets. In the experiments, an emphasis has been given to flow visualisation.

Cooling of the rotor and <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>windings</b> may also be difficult at least in case of two-stator-single-rotor construction where air circulation in the rotor and in the end-winding areas may be difficult to arrange.

Design/methodology/approach - The magnetostatic FEM model of the generator end windings is carried out for different displacements of the rotor axis to the stator magmetomotive force (MMF) axis. The method is based on a parallel integral formulation allowing to substantially reduce the computational effort. Findings - The computational model requires only the discretization of magnetic materials and conductors and is fast enough for carrying out 3 D analyses on a time scale fast enough for the needs of the designer.

Overreliance on {{petroleum}} products and environmental pollution from combustion emissions produced by automobiles {{has led to}} extensive research on hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicles and their components. A key component in these vehicles is the electric motor, used for traction as well as powering other appliances like the compressor. Overheating in electrical motors results in detrimental effects such as degradation of the insulation materials, magnet demagnetization, increase in Joule losses and decreased motor efficiency and lifetime. Hence, {{it is important to}} find ways of optimizing performance and reliability of electric motors through effective cooling and consequently reduce operating and maintenance costs.

40|$|Configurations are proposed, and illustrated, for {{terminating}} the 'cosine {phi}' windings of {{an ideal}} iron-free dipole magnet so as to preserve {{the quality of the}} internal field integrated (vs. z) through the entire magnet. <b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>windings</b> are placed on a surface of the same radius as that on which the conductors lie in the central (2 -D) portion of the structure. The desired pure dipole quality of the integrated field then is assured by requiring that the z-component of current, after projection onto the y-z plane, shall have in that plane a density distribution whose integral is independent of y. As a result of the analysis, end-winding configurations that satisfy this requirement are proposed in which each conductor filament follows through the transition region a locus whose y-z projection is of the form z(y;Y{sub 0 }) = f(y{sub 0 }) - f(y-y{sub 0 }), with f(0) = 0, wherein Y{sub 0 } serves as an index to identify the location of the filament in the central (2 -D) portion of the structure.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} dynamic control {{performances}} of a 14 -pole/ 18 -slot fractional slot concentrated winding (FSCW) interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (FSCW IPMSM). The machine was run with two commonly used control techniques: Field Oriented Control (FOC) and Direct Torque and Flux Control (DTFC). The FSCW IPMSM under consideration was previously designed and constructed at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) {{to achieve a}} high torque/high power density, high efficiency, a very wide (> 10 : 1) constant power speed range and very low cogging torque. The key favourable characteristic of an FSCW is <b>the</b> short <b>end</b> <b>windings,</b> which results in low copper loss and more compact design compared to its distributed winding counterpart. The other benefit of this particular 14 -pole/ 18 -slot FSCW IPMSM design includes some saliency ratio, which is desirable for sensorless control, compared to other CW permanent magnet machines. Nevertheless, this type of machine {{has so far been}} only investigated in terms of steady state performance; the dynamic control performance has not been studied yet. The major objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the dynamic control performances of the 14 / 18 FSCW IPMSM machine while running with model based controllers such as the FOC and DTFC, to study their limitations and to propose improvements of these controllers. The FOC was first implemented in the prototype FSCW machine using standard distributed windings IPMSM mathematical model. A number of issues associated with the FSCW IPMSM under FOC were detected and investigated thoroughly. The issues were resolved by implementing a closed-loop rotor position compensator and a new voltage compensation scheme. It is believed that this thesis, for the first time, applied the Sensorless Direct Torque and Flux Control (DTFC) to a FSCW IPMSM. The performances of the FSCW-IPMSM under DTFC at very low speed, however, were not satisfactory. To improve the performance of the DTFC at low speed operation, a closed-loop extended flux linkage model is proposed. Although it was proven that the proposed closed-loop extended flux linkage DTFC is superior to the open-loop DTFC, the extremely low speed operation still is not achieved.

50|$|The Magnicon, {{developed}} by Macfarlane's in Scotland, {{is similar to}} the Metadyne, but whereas the latter has a two-pole armature winding, the Magnicon has a four-pole lap winding, and is sometimes referred to a Metadyne with a short-pitched armature winding. They have been supplied to operate hoists and winches on ships. The stator of a Magnicon has four polar projections, spaced at 90 degrees, and one pair of them is excited. The pair of brushes which are on the same axis as the excited poles are short-circuited, resulting in a large current. The magnetomotive force (MMF) of this current acts on the non-excited poles, creating a working flux (Φ) and the output voltage. As with a full-pitch Metadyne, the armature reaction of the output current is 90 degrees out of phase, and therefore opposes the original excitation. Advantages over the normal Metadyne are that the number of exciting and compensating coils is halved to two each per cycle, and the shorter pitch of the coils results in less overhang at <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of <b>the</b> <b>windings.</b> However, the design creates idle currents in the armature, which result in losses, and on larger machines, where interpoles are required, each interpole must be fitted with two coils, one for each of the brush circuits.

Two space harmonics of closely the same magnitude are produced that travel in opposite directions, giving induced currents and opposing forces with little net force in plate rotors. The difficulty can be resolved if a wound secondary with a double layer winding is used instead of a plate. Here a substantial induced emf and current is produced only by the field for which the secondary is wound, so that force is produced only in one direction. The use and properties of modular windings for short rotor machines are explored using finite element analysis and the results are validated by practical tests. It is concluded that inexpensive modular windings can be used with wound secondaries to good effect particularly in long stator situations; for example, for electromagnetic launch and urban transport systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of {{electrical}} machines, efficiency improvements have become very important. However, {{there are at least}} two significant cases in which the compactness of electrical machines is critical and the tolerance of extremely high losses is valued: vehicle traction, where very high torque density is desired at least temporarily; and direct-drive wind turbine generators, whose mass should be acceptably low. As ever higher torque density and ever more compact electrical machines are developed for these purposes, thermal issues, i. e. avoidance of over-temperatures and damage in conditions of high heat losses, are becoming of utmost importance. The excessive temperatures of critical machine components, such as insulation and permanent magnets, easily cause failures of the whole electrical equipment. In electrical machines with excitation systems based on permanent magnets, special attention must be paid to the rotor temperature because of the temperature-sensitive properties of permanent magnets. The allowable temperature of NdFeB magnets is usually significantly less than 150 ˚C. The practical problem is that the part of the machine where the permanent magnets are located should stay cooler than the copper windings, which can easily tolerate temperatures of 155 ˚C or 180 ˚C. Therefore, new cooling solutions should be developed in order to cool permanent magnet electrical machines with high torque density and because of it with high concentrated losses in stators. In this doctoral dissertation, direct and indirect liquid cooling techniques for permanent magnet synchronous electrical machines (PMSM) with high torque density are presented and discussed. The aim of this research is to analyse thermal behaviours of the machines using the most applicable and accurate thermal analysis methods and to propose new, practical machine designs based on these analyses. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) thermal simulations of the heat transfer inside the machines and lumped parameter thermal network (LPTN) simulations both presented herein are used for the analyses. Detailed descriptions of the simulated thermal models are also presented. Most of the theoretical considerations and simulations have been verified via experimental measurements on a copper tooth-coil (motorette) and on various prototypes of electrical machines. The indirect liquid cooling systems of a 100 kW axial flux (AF) PMSM and a 110 kW radial flux (RF) PMSM are analysed here by means of simplified 3 D CFD conjugate thermal models of the parts of both machines. In terms of results, a significant temperature drop of 40 ̊C in the stator winding and 28 ̊C in the rotor of the AF PMSM was achieved with the addition of highly thermally conductive materials into the machine: copper bars inserted in the teeth, and potting material around <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>windings.</b> In the RF PMSM, the potting material resulted in a temperature decrease of 6 ̊C in the stator winding, and in a decrease of 10 ̊C in the rotor embedded-permanentmagnets. Two types of unique direct liquid cooling systems for low power machines are analysed herein to demonstrate the effectiveness of the cooling systems in conditions of highly concentrated heat losses. LPTN analysis and CFD thermal analysis (the latter being particularly useful for unique design) were applied to simulate the temperature distribution within the machine models. Oil-immersion cooling provided good cooling capability for a 26. 6 kW PMSM of a hybrid vehicle. A direct liquid cooling system for the copper winding with inner stainless steel tubes was designed for an 8 MW directdrive PM synchronous generator. The design principles of this cooling solution are described in detail in this thesis. The thermal analyses demonstrate that the stator winding and the rotor magnet temperatures are kept significantly below their critical temperatures with demineralized water flow.

The design approach is especially appropriate for large-bore, current-dominated magnets with many turns. The design method can be summarized as follows: First find a winding-block layout (block angles, number of turns in each block, etc.) for the central, straight-conductor part of the windings that produces two-dimensional fields with negligible higher harmonic content. Next, specify the numbers of groups of conductors into which each block of the 2 -D part of the winding fans out in the end-turn region. Also specify the end-zone axial length and the shape-function profile for <b>the</b> <b>end</b> zones. Finally, generate turn contours by finding conductor-group centerline curves in the developed (flattened) cylinder surface that are contours of constant stream function. Individual turns are specified by constant parallel displacement from the group centerline curve in the developed winding surface. An interactive computer program performs the above steps has been written and has been used to design <b>end</b> <b>windings</b> for a test quadrupole example. The unwanted higher harmonics in both peak and integral fields as computed by the Biot-Savart law are remarkably low...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{for the first}} time the analysis and experimental validation of a six-slot four-pole synchronous reluctance motor with nonoverlapping fractional slot-concentrated windings. The machine exhibits high torque density and efficiency due to its high fill factor coils with very short <b>end</b> <b>windings,</b> facilitated by a segmented stator and bobbin winding of the coils. These advantages are coupled with its inherent robustness and low cost. The topology is presented as a logical step forward in advancing synchronous reluctance machines that have been universally wound with a sinusoidally distributed winding. The paper presents the motor design, performance evaluation through finite element studies and validation of the electromagnetic model, and thermal specification through empirical testing. It is shown that high performance synchronous reluctance motors can be constructed with single tooth wound coils, but considerations must be given regarding torque quality and the d-q axis inductances...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the electric drive for an in wheel fractional slot axial flux machine designed for achieving a wide flux weakening operating region. By using a slotted stator with fractiona slot windings and additional cores enclosing <b>end</b> <b>windings</b> <b>the</b> axial flux machine reaches a wide constant power speed range. The machine {{is designed for}} increasing flux weakening capability while obtaining low harmonic back electromotive force and low cogging torque. A 10 N m axial flux machine exhibiting 3 to 1 flux weakening speed range has been built. A flux weakening controller able to maximize the output torque in the flux weakening region is designed and implemented. The goodness of both design and control algorithm is proved by experimental tests. However such a fractional slot machine has not only advantages. Rotor losses are very high {{and they have to}} be properly considered during the design process...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} new winding configuration for six-phase permanent-magnet (PM) machines with 18 slots and 8 poles, which eliminates and/or reduces undesirable space harmonics in the stator magnetomotive force. The proposed configuration improves power/torque density and efficiency with a reduction in eddy-current losses in the rotor permanent magnets and copper losses in <b>end</b> <b>windings.</b> To improve drive train availability for applications in electric vehicles (EVs), this paper proposes the design of a six-phase PM machine as two independent three-phase windings. A number of possible phase shifts between two sets of three-phase windings due to their slot-pole combination and winding configuration are investigated, and the optimum phase shift is selected by analyzing the harmonic distributions and their effect on machine performance, including the rotor eddy-current losses. The machine design is optimized for a given set of specifications for EVs, under electrical, thermal and volumetric constraints, and demonstrated by the experimental measurements on a prototype machine...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} the strategy {{to design and}} control an axial-ﬂux (AxF) surface-mounted permanent-magnet machine for achieving a wide ﬂux-weakening (FW) operating region. By using a slotted stator with fractional-slot windings and additional cores enclosing <b>end</b> <b>windings,</b> <b>the</b> AxF machine satisﬁes the speciﬁcation of a wide constant-power speed range. The design procedure is presented for increasing FW capability while obtaining low-harmonic back electromotive force and low cogging torque. This technique is applied to design an 8 -N · m AxF prototype machine that exhibits about 3 : 1 FW range. To the aim of exploiting full capability of the machine, an FW controller is designed and implemented. This controller utilizes the voltage difference between the current regulator and the output voltage, limited by a voltage source inverter. With this method, the output torque in the FW region is higher than that achieved using the con- ventional FW method based on the voltage-magnitude feedback. The goodness of both design and control algorithm is proved by experimental tests on a prototype...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{proposed}} a novel {{scheme based on}} SVMs for detecting and classifying faults in stator windings of a synchronous generator. Two SVM classifiers have been proposed. SVM 1 was used to identify the fault occurrence {{in the system and}} SVM 2 was used to determine whether the fault, if any, was internal or external. In the proposed scheme, fault detection and identification was performed in less than a quarter cycle of the 3 -phases current at <b>the</b> two <b>ends</b> of stator <b>windings.</b> <b>The</b> detection and classification of faults were not affected by the fault type and location, pre-fault power, fault resistance or fault inception time.|$|R
40|$|A linear metro that is {{propelled}} by a single-sided {{linear induction motor}} (SLIM) has recently attracted much attention. Compared with the rotating-induction-machine drive system, the SLIM drive has advantages such as direct thrust without needing friction between the wheel and the railway track, small cross-sectional area, lack of gear box, and flexible line choice {{on account of the}} greater climbing capability and smaller turning circle. However, due to its cut-open primary magnetic circuit, the SLIM has a longitudinal end effect and half-filled slots on <b>the</b> primary <b>ends,</b> which can reduce the air-gap average flux linkage and thrust. Based on the winding function method, the SLIM is supposed to have the following three groups of windings: 1) primary windings; 2) secondary fundamental windings; and 3) secondary <b>end</b> effect <b>windings.</b> <b>The</b> proposed method considers the actual winding distribution and structure dimensions. It can calculate the mutual, self, and leakage inductance to describe the influence of <b>the</b> longitudinal <b>end</b> effect and half-filled slots. Moreover, a new equivalent model is presented to analyze the different dynamic and steady-state performance. Comprehensive comparisons between simulation and experimental results that were obtained from both one arc induction machine and one linear metro indicate that the proposed model can be applied to predict the SLIM performance and control scheme evaluation...|$|R
