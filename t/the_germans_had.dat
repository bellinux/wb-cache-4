5|$|After World War II, the US {{wanted to}} {{guarantee}} the supply of cobalt ore for military uses (as <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> been doing) and prospected for cobalt within the U.S. border. An adequate supply of the ore was found in Idaho near Blackbird canyon {{in the side of}} a mountain. The firm Calera Mining Company started production at the site.|$|E
5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} {{the threat posed}} by the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, even trying to take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>have</b> worn green jerseys, white {{shorts and}} green socks as their {{alternate}} strip. In recent years, however, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>have</b> changed their away strip to grey in 2002–2003, black in 2004 and recently to red. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> wore red as their alternate colour in the 2006 World Cup.|$|R

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1943, his forces {{advanced}} forward towards the Belarusian city of Vitebsk. One of the key elements to Bagramyan's success was {{that many of the}} soldiers were part of veteran units that had been trained in the Arctic regions of Siberia, enabling them to easily push through entrenched defenses <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> spent months preparing. Among the key locations imperative to reach Vitebsk was the small town of Gorodok, which served as a communications hub that <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> heavily fortified. Despite the heavy defense preparations, Bagramyan was able to utilize his heavy artillery and air support from the Red Air Force in late December to bombard the town and then launch a three-pronged attack from the ground. The German garrison was overwhelmed, and by 24 December, two infantry divisions and one tank division had surrendered. In Moscow, the news of the victory at Gorodok prompted a 124-cannon salute in honor of Bagramyan and the First Baltic Front.|$|E
5|$|The Watten bunker {{was to be}} {{built to}} a design based on the B.III-2a bunker, though {{substantially}} larger. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> originally planned to build a separate LOX plant at Stenay but this option was abandoned in favour of installing a LOX production facility within the Watten bunker.|$|E
5|$|The Watten {{site was}} {{captured}} on 4 September 1944 by Canadian forces. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> evacuated {{it a few}} days earlier and removed the pumps which kept the cavernous basement free from water; not long afterwards it began to flood. This made a substantial amount of the bunker inaccessible to the Allies.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle is}} {{controversial}} because many historians and writers {{have concluded that}} it was failures by British divisional and corps commanders that squandered an opportunity to capture Caen, rather than the Germans achieving a defensive success. To resist the offensive, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> committed their most powerful armoured reserves, which deprived them of the fighting power for a counter-offensive and forfeited the initiative to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} the dead were buried in the St-Laurent-sur-Mer {{cemetery}} on 15 September 1942. The funeral was only attended by the local German and the French Gendarmarie commanders. To prevent anyone else from attending, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> a machine gun set up covering the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{group was}} moved to an area east of Troarn on 21August. With the 12th Devons leading they {{advanced}} again, occupying Branville, Vauville and Deauville on 22August. Attempts to cross the River Touques were repulsed by a force estimated to be around 1,200 men. Outflanking the German position, the 2nd OBLI crossed the river at Touques on 24August. Keeping {{the pressure on the}} retreating Germans on 25August, Le Correspondence, Petreville and Malhortie were captured. However, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> retained control of the bridge outside Malhortie and the high ground at Manneville-la-Raoult. The 2nd OBLI attacked and captured the bridge intact, but Mannerville-la-Raoult was only taken at dusk, at the cost of several casualties. The next day, 26August, the battalion captured Foulbec on the River Seine at 19:00, although not before <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> destroyed the bridge, and earlier that day the 1st RUR had captured Berville-sur-Mer. On 27August the division was ordered to concentrate in the area between Honfleur and Pont Audemer.|$|E

5|$|World War II in Europe {{began on}} 1 September 1939, with Nazi Germany's {{invasion}} of Poland. Two days later, the UK and France {{declared war on}} Germany. Poland's geographical location, however, prevented the Allies from intervening directly. Four weeks into the attack, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> successfully occupied Poland.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} {{the same time as}} Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th Légère, renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte and this time were successful, partly because the King's German Legion's ammunition ran out. However, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> held the centre of the battlefield for almost the entire day, and this had stalled the French advance.|$|E
5|$|Bombing of Normandy began {{around midnight}} {{with more than}} 2,200 British, Canadian, and American bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland. The coastal bombing attack was largely {{ineffective}} at Omaha, because low cloud cover made the assigned targets difficult to see. Concerned about inflicting casualties on their own troops, many bombers delayed their attacks too long and failed to hit the beach defences. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> 570 aircraft stationed in Normandy and the Low Countries on D-Day, and another 964 in Germany.|$|E

5|$|Brundage {{took the}} {{position}} that as <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> reported nondiscrimination to the IOC, and the IOC had accepted that report, US Olympic authorities were bound by that determination. Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent that with the Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure {{a place on the}} German team. Brundage stated on this issue that as only 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it would hardly be surprising if none did in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{discovered}} in Weizsäcker's office, Fleischmann's laboratory and the Strasbourg Hospital pointed to nuclear activities {{taking place at}} Stadtilm, Haigerloch, Hechingen, and Tailfingen. After establishing its headquarters in von Haagen's office Alsos staff uncovered documents concerning secret medical experiments at Natzweiler concentration camp. These indicated <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> been unable to develop a practical process for uranium enrichment. For {{the first time the}} Alsos Mission was able to categorically report that the Germans did not have nuclear weapons, and would not have them for some time.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann {{sent for}} Brand again {{a few days}} later. Eichmann was {{accompanied}} this time by Gerhard Clages, also known as Otto Klages, chief of Himmler's Sicherheitsdienst (security service) in Budapest. Clages' presence meant that three of Himmler's senior officers– Eichmann, Becher and Clages– had involved themselves with the Brand proposal. Clages handed Brand $50,000 and 270,000 Swiss francs that <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> intercepted, sent to the Aid and Rescue Committee by rescue workers in Switzerland via the Swedish Embassy in Budapest.|$|E

5|$|In early July, a {{few days}} after a communist-led mass {{uprising}} commenced, Aćimović reshuffled his government, replacing three commissioners and appointing deputies for most of the portfolios. By mid-July, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> decided that the Aćimović regime was incompetent and unable to deal with the uprising, and began looking for a replacement. At the end of August this resulted in the resignation of the Commissioner Government and the appointment of the Government of National Salvation led by former Minister of the Army and Navy General Milan Nedić, in which Aćimović initially retained the Interior portfolio.|$|E
5|$|In response, ETOUSA {{initiated}} Operation Peppermint. Special {{equipment was}} prepared. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The equipment was held in readiness, but the preparations were not needed, because <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> not developed such weapons.|$|E
5|$|Most of the German bombers {{had passed}} over {{and had an}} {{altitude}} advantage over French fighters trying to gain height to intercept. Skirmishes were few and far between, but some French units suffered heavy losses. For the attack, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>had</b> used the new C-250 Flammbombe (Flame Bomb) which had only been cleared for use 24 hours earlier. The incendiary bomb did some damage to hangars and parked aircraft.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>German</b> was {{far more}} skilled than the Japanese. Most of the Japanese that we fought were not skilled men.

They fought very, very hard, but they were not nearly as skillful as <b>the</b> <b>Germans.</b> But <b>the</b> <b>German</b> didn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> tenacity of the Japanese.|$|R

6000|$|It may be doubted {{whether a}} {{composite}} language like the English {{is not a}} happier instrument of expression than a homogeneous one like <b>the</b> <b>German.</b> We possess a wonderful richness and variety of modified meanings in our Saxon and Latin quasi-synonymes, which <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>have</b> not. For [...] "the pomp and prodigality of Heaven," [...] <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> must <b>have</b> said [...] "the spendthriftness."[1] Shakspeare is particularly happy in {{his use of the}} Latin synonymes, and in distinguishing between them and the Saxon.|$|R
