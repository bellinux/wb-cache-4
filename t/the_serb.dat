5|$|In July 1995, {{forces of}} the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) {{captured}} the town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia, which had been cut off and surrounded {{despite the presence of}} soldiers from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Thousands of refugees had crowded into the town to escape <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> advance. Following <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> takeover of Srebrenica, an estimated 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were systematically massacred by Serb forces between 11–15 July and another 25,000–30,000 were subjected to ethnic cleansing. It was the largest act of mass murder in Europe since World War II.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{available}} data from {{the archives of the}} former Republic of Serb Krajina, 350 Serbs who lived in the Vukovar area died in 1991. Among them, 203 were members of <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> Territorial Defence forces, while 147 were civilians.|$|E
5000|$|Vlastimir united several Serbian tribes, and Emperor Theophilos (r. 829-842) {{probably}} granted <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> independence, thus <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> acknowledged nominal overlordship of the Emperor.|$|R
25|$|Following {{his victory}} over the Hungarians John II {{launched}} a punitive raid against <b>the</b> <b>Serbs.</b> Dangerously for <b>the</b> Byzantines <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> had aligned themselves with Hungary. Many Serbian prisoners were taken, and these were transported to Nicomedia in Asia Minor to serve as military colonists. This was done partly to cow <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> into submission (Serbia was, at least nominally, a Byzantine protectorate), and partly to strengthen the Byzantine frontier in the east against <b>the</b> Turks. <b>The</b> <b>Serbs</b> were forced to acknowledge Byzantine suzerainty once again.|$|R
50|$|It is {{said that}} the village was {{established}} during the Great Migrations of <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> Great Migrations of <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> in <b>the</b> period between 1689 and 1739.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the month, <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> {{rebels and}} the JNA {{controlled}} nearly all of the southern bank of the river, and the lines of control in the region largely stabilised. Before the ceasefire of 3 January 1992, which implemented the Vance plan, <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> rebels and the JNA made two more unsuccessful attempts to push back the Croatian forces in the region. These attacks comprised the autumn campaign undertaken by the JNA—in the area of Slana and Novi Farkašić on 17–18 October and in the area of Sunja on 2 November. In the same period, the ZNG launched an unsuccessful offensive codenamed Operation Whirlwind to recapture Glina on 11–13 December. The 120 Croats who remained in the area of Dubica faced persecution, culminating in the Baćin massacre of more than 50 Croats on 21 October, and the rounding up and expulsion of the remainder on 20 November.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic hatred grew {{as various}} {{incidents}} fueled the propaganda machines on both sides. During his {{testimony before the}} ICTY, one of the top-Krajina leaders, Milan Martić, stated that <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> side started using force first.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{parties have}} won special seats reserved for representatives elected by minorities (also in alphabetical order): the Bosnian Democratic Party of Croatia, the Democratic Union of Hungarians of Croatia, the German People's Union– National Association of Danube Swabians in Croatia, the Independent Democratic Serb Party, the Party of Democratic Action of Croatia, and <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> People's Party.|$|E
50|$|It {{was formed}} by <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> of Croatia in {{response}} to the merging of the Military Frontier, inhabited by <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> back into <b>the</b> Kingdom of Croatia.|$|R
50|$|The fate of {{the guns}} is unclear. The Italians {{captured}} one as did the French (probably No. 4, which had been delivered shortly {{before the end of}} the war) and <b>the</b> <b>Serbs.</b> <b>The</b> former two scrapped theirs, but <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> had one during the interwar period.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the first}} {{uprising}} of <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> in 1805, Karanovac was heavily damaged {{and most of}} the Turkish population left, leaving <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> to continue development of the city during the period following the uprising.|$|R
5|$|After the JNA {{captured}} Vukovar on 18 November 1991, Osijek was {{the next}} target for its campaign in Croatia. The JNA units subordinated to the 12th (Novi Sad) Corps, supported by <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> Volunteer Guard, achieved modest advances in late November and early December, capturing several villages south of Osijek, but the Croatian Army maintained its defensive front and limited the JNA's advances.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{original}} objective was solely to protect <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> population against the Ustaše, Dangić quickly {{became an important}} factor in the conflict between the two groups in eastern Bosnia. The Germans sought to win Dangić over to collaboration in order to strengthen anti-Partisan operations in the region, where Dangić's Chetniks reportedly numbered about 10,000 men, but at this time neither Dangić nor any of Mihailović's other commanders had any arrangement with the Germans.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Kijevo was {{a village}} of 1,261 people, 99.6% of whom were Croats. It was {{surrounded}} by <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> villages of Polača, Civljane and Cetina. Following the Log revolution, the three Serb villages had {{become part of the}} SAO Krajina and road access to Kijevo was restricted as barricades were set up in Polača and Civljane on the roads serving the village. In response, its population set up an ad hoc militia.|$|E
50|$|When Bulgarian delegates in London bluntly warned <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> {{that they}} must not expect Bulgarian support on their Adriatic claims, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> angrily replied {{that that was a}} clear {{withdrawal}} from the prewar agreement of mutual understanding according to the Kriva Palanka-Adriatic line of expansion, but the Bulgarians insisted that in their view, the Vardar Macedonian part of the agreement remained active and <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> were still obliged to surrender the area as agreed. <b>The</b> <b>Serbs</b> answered by accusing the Bulgarians of maximalism, pointing out that if they lost both northern Albania and Vardar Macedonia, their participation in the common war would have been virtually for nothing.|$|R
50|$|The Great Migrations of <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> (Velike seobe Srba/Велике сеобе Срба), {{also known}} as the Great Exodus of <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> refers mainly to two large migrations of ethnic <b>Serbs</b> from <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire to the Habsburg Monarchy.|$|R
50|$|Realizing that Hungarian revolutionary {{leaders are}} not willing to {{recognize}} national rights of <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> political leaders of <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> decided to hold an assembly on which a separate Serb voivodeship within Austrian Empire would be proclaimed.|$|R
5|$|In May 1992, {{intensive}} shelling and infantry {{attacks on}} Bosniak {{areas in the}} municipality caused the Bosniak survivors to flee their homes. The majority of them surrendered or were captured by Serb forces. As <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> forces rounded up the Bosniak and Croat residents, they forced them to march in columns bound for {{one or another of}} the prison camps that <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> authorities had established in the municipality. On about 25 May 1992, about three weeks after the Serbs took control of the municipal government, and two days after the start of large scale military attacks on Bosniak population centers, Serb forces began taking prisoners to the Omarska camp. During the next several weeks, the Serbs continued to round up Bosniaks and Croats from Kozarac near Prijedor, and other places in the municipality and send them to the camps. Many Bosniak and Croat intellectuals and politicians were sent to Omarska. While virtually all of the prisoners were male, there were also 37 women detained in the camp, who served food and cleaned the walls of the torture rooms, and were repeatedly raped in the canteen; bodies of five of them have been exhumed.|$|E
5|$|On his {{northern}} frontier Manuel expended considerable {{effort to}} preserve the conquests made by Basil II over one hundred years earlier and maintained, sometimes tenuously, ever since. Due to distraction from his neighbours on the Balkan frontier, Manuel was kept from his main objective, the subjugation of the Normans of Sicily. Relations had been good with the Serbs and Hungarians since 1129, so <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> rebellion came as a shock. The Serbs of Rascia, being so induced by Roger II of Sicily, invaded Byzantine territory in 1149.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} cause for {{a confrontation with}} the JNA in Split was a blockade of the village of Kijevo, where Croatian authorities had established a new police station, imposed on 29 April. The village was surrounded by the JNA, commanded by Colonel Ratko Mladić, and <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> insurgent forces, cutting access and preventing delivery of supplies. Tuđman called on the public to bring the siege to its end.|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> from Serbia and <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> from <b>the</b> Habsburg Monarchy in the nineteenth century is important for understand­ing the process of national development of the Serbian people as a whole. Therefore the paper analyzes the controversy over Švabe or Nemačkari, as <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> from Austria were called, {{which was one of the}} factors responsible for internal instability of the Principality of Serbia in the nineteenth century...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Serbs</b> {{have many}} traditions. The Slava is an {{exclusive}} custom of <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> each family has one patron saint that they venerate on their feast day. The Serbian Orthodox Church uses the traditional Julian Calendar, as per which Christmas Day (December 25) falls currently on January 7 of the Gregorian Calendar, thus <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> celebrate Christmas on January 7, {{shared with the}} Orthodox churches of Jerusalem, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine and the Greek Old Calendarists.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{fundamental}} sources for the early Serbian history {{is the work of}} Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos (913-959), De Administrando Imperio. In eight chapters, <b>the</b> settlement of <b>Serbs</b> and their early history is described up until the reign of the author. The 32nd chapter, with the sub-chapter On <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> and <b>the</b> lands that they currently inhabit, gives a short note on the origin of <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> their homeland, and continues with the history of members of the oldest ruling family of <b>the</b> <b>Serbs.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{declaration}} on {{the takeover}} of Prijedor by Serb forces was prepared by Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) politicians and was repeatedly read out on Radio Prijedor {{the day after the}} takeover. Four-hundred Bosnian Serb policemen were assigned to participate in the takeover, the objective of which was to seize the functions {{of the president of the}} municipality, the vice-president of the municipality, the director of the post office, the chief of the police, etc. On the night of the 29/30 April 1992, {{the takeover of}} power took place. Serb employees of the public security station and reserve police gathered in Cirkin Polje, part of the town of Prijedor. The people there were given the task of taking over power in the municipality and were broadly divided into five groups. Each group of about twenty had a leader and each was ordered to gain control of certain buildings. One group was responsible for the Assembly building, one for the main police building, one for the courts, one for the bank and the last for the post-office. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) concluded that the takeover by <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> politicians was an illegal coup d'état, which was planned and coordinated long in advance with the ultimate aim of creating a pure Serbian municipality. These plans were never hidden and they were implemented in a coordinated action by <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> police, army and politicians. One of the leading figures was Milomir Stakić, who came to play the dominant role in the political life of the municipality.|$|E
5|$|About 19:00 on 7 April, German {{units in}} regimental {{strength}} {{with a few}} tanks began to cross the Drava near Barcs in the divisional sector. They quickly overcame {{the resistance of the}} 2nd Battalion of the 393rd Reserve Regiment, which was influenced by Ustaše propaganda. The border guards abandoned their positions and weapons and retreated to Virovitica. The 108th Infantry Regiment of the division had mobilised in Bjelovar and on 7 April was marching towards Virovitica to take up positions. That night, Croat members of the regiment revolted, arresting <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers. The regiment then marched back to Bjelovar, where it joined up with other rebellious units about noon on 8 April.|$|E
5|$|Although the Croatian {{government}} sponsored reconstruction {{efforts in}} and around Vukovar, the Serb-populated town centre remained in ruins until 2003. Both Croat and Serb residents believed the government had neglected it deliberately, in order to punish <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> community. Human Rights Watch noted that, of 4,000 homes that had been rebuilt, {{none of them were}} inhabited by Serbs. Unemployment was high because of the destruction of the town's major industries, and many of the inhabitants could not sell their houses. Most houses and many of Vukovar's historic buildings had been restored by 2011.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> large <b>Serb</b> migrations from Balkans to the Pannonian plain {{started in}} the 14th century and lasted {{until the end of}} the 18th century. The great migrations from 1690 and 1737-39 were the largest ones and were {{important}} reason for issuing the privileges that regulated <b>the</b> status of <b>Serbs</b> within Habsburg Monarchy. <b>The</b> <b>Serbs</b> that in these migrations settled in Vojvodina and Slavonia increased (partly) <b>the</b> existing <b>Serb</b> population in these regions and made <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> an important political factor in the Habsburg Monarchy over time.|$|R
50|$|The {{movie has}} been criticised {{for a lot}} of {{technical}} flaws, for example: <b>The</b> <b>Serbs</b> in <b>the</b> movie were speaking Hungarian rather than Serbian (as the actors playing <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> were all Hungarian and Cole spoke gibberish instead of Hungarian).|$|R
2500|$|Operation Deliberate Force, was {{initiated}} in August 1995 after <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> shelled a Sarajevo marketplace killing 38 civilians and wounding 85 more. A contingent from the 104th Fighter Wing {{participated in the}} action. [...] The intensity of the bombing stunned <b>the</b> <b>Serbs.</b> Coupled with victories of an American-trained Croatian-Muslim army in western Bosnia, that operation forced <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> to sue for peace. NATO halted the bombing on 14 September 1995, and ended Deliberate Force six days later.|$|R
5|$|Commemoration ceremonies honouring {{the victims}} of the camp have been {{organized}} by <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> National Council (SNV), representatives of the Jewish community in Croatia, and local anti-fascists since 2009. 24 June has since been designated as a Day of Remembrance of the Jadovno Camp in Croatia. A monument commemorating those who perished was constructed in 1975 and stood for fifteen years before being removed in 1990 prior to the outbreak of ethnic violence during the Croatian War of Independence. A replica of the original monument was constructed and dedicated in 2010, but disappeared within twenty-four hours of its inauguration.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> {{being the}} {{favourite}} {{to win the}} title throughout the Championships, Murray overcame Djokovic in a straight sets match that lasted over three hours, {{to become the first}} British winner of the men's singles title since Fred Perry in 1936, the first Scot of either sex to win a Wimbledon singles title since Harold Mahony in 1896, and to extend his winning streak on grass to 18 matches. With the win, he also became only the second man in the open era after Rafael Nadal to hold the Olympic singles gold medal and Wimbledon title simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{planning}} and orders for Operation Trio were finalised {{at a conference}} in Ljubljana on 28–29 March 1942. Laxa, General Mario Roatta (the commander of the Italian Second Army), and General der Artillerie Paul Bader (the commander of German forces in the NDH) negotiated a compromise permitting temporary non-political agreements to be concluded with the Herzegovinian Chetniks, led by Dobroslav Jevđević, but not with any of the Bosnian Chetnik groups, whose leaders were Petar Baćović in the area of Foča and Jezdimir Dangić, who was aligned with <b>the</b> <b>Serb</b> collaborationist Milan Nedić.|$|E
25|$|During the Revolutions of 1848, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> in <b>the</b> Austrian Empire proclaimed Serbian {{autonomous}} province known as Serbian Vojvodina. By a {{decision of the}} Austrian emperor, in November 1849, this province was transformed into the Austrian crown land known as the Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat (Dukedom of Serbia and Tamiš Banat). Against the will of <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> <b>the</b> province was abolished in 1860, but <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> from <b>the</b> region gained another opportunity to achieve their political demands in 1918. Today, this region is known as Vojvodina.|$|R
5000|$|Austrian {{historian}} Walther Wüst theorized in 1934 that Srbinda was a warlord {{and leader}} of <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> based on <b>the</b> fact that <b>Serbs</b> use <b>the</b> term [...] "Srbenda". He hypothesized that Srbinda and Srbenda were the same word, and that they meant someone great, strong, first among <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> - {{in line with the}} meaning of [...] "Srbenda". He also theorized that when the Veda texts mention that after Indra defeats Srbinda he [...] "let loose the floods", that floods were a metaphor for a migration of people, in this case <b>the</b> <b>Serbs,</b> migrating west.|$|R
50|$|During {{the night}} of the 27th of November, <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> regrouped. In <b>the</b> morning, the Bulgarians {{continued}} their advance. The column of Major Gudzhev attacked the Šumadija Division and, despite being outnumbered 2 to 1, the Bulgarians managed to push <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> to <b>the</b> river Temska. The retreat of the Šumadija Division forced the Drina Division to pull back as well and the Bulgarians pursued after them. On the left flank, the Bulgarians were also successful and <b>the</b> <b>Serbs</b> were defeated.|$|R
