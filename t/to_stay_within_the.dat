5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, {{and so there was}} enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that {{the federal government}} was still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E
5|$|Though Disney gave Nomura {{freedom in}} the {{characters}} and worlds used for the games, {{he and his staff}} tried <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> established roles of characters and boundaries of the worlds.

He also felt managing and keeping multiple worlds was problematic. When deciding which worlds to include in the game, the development staff tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting and made an effort to minimize any overlap in the overall look and feel of each world.|$|E

5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved inboard to make room for torpedo protection.

Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit {{spending}} and debt levels. However, in the early 2000s, some EU member states were failing <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> confines of the Maastricht criteria and turned to securitising future government revenues to reduce their debts and/or deficits, sidestepping best practice and ignoring international standards. This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels {{through a combination of}} techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off-balance-sheet transactions, and the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. From late 2009 on, after Greece's newly elected, PASOK government stopped masking its true indebtedness and budget deficit, fears of sovereign defaults in certain European states developed in the public, and the government debt of several states was downgraded. The crisis subsequently spread to Ireland and Portugal, while raising concerns about Italy, Spain, and the European banking system, and more fundamental imbalances within the eurozone.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the first}} issue of ASCII Media Works' Dengeki G's Magazine was published, the editors of the {{magazine}} have hosted reader participation games whose outcome is directly influenced by the people who read the magazine. Strawberry Panic!s origin was in the October 2003 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine where it was announced after the ending of Sakurako Kimino's previous work Sister Princess that a new reader participation project would start the following month. In the November 2003 issue, the first batch of characters from St. Miator were introduced (Nagisa, Shizuma, Tamao, and Chiyo) and it was revealed how readers could participate in the project. The initial system had the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna (given without surnames) who were sisters {{and at the same time}} younger sisters of the readers of the magazine, effectively putting the reader in the position of the elder brother. Each girl entered her respective school and became the main character of that school. It was explained that the coupling of the main characters could be to an upperclassman, a classmate, or an underclassman, but had <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> school they attended. For example, Nagisa, who attended Miator could not be coupled with another character from either Spica or Lulim at first. Playing the role of the elder brother, the reader gave advice to the younger sisters who were bewildered by their new lives at each of the schools. Thus, the readers had the ability to influence the coupling formations which would later be written by Kimino as short stories serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine.|$|E
5|$|The {{reform plan}} adopted in 2005 envisaged the {{formation}} of eighteen integrated brigades through the brassage process as its first of three stages. The process consists firstly of regroupment, where fighters are disarmed. Then they are sent to orientation centres, run by CONADER, where fighters take the choice of either returning to civilian society or remaining in the armed forces. Combatants who choose demobilisation receive an initial cash payment of US $110. Those who choose <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> FARDC are then transferred to one of six integration centres for a 45-day training course, which aims to build integrated formations out of factional fighters previously heavily divided along ethnic, political and regional lines. The centres are spread out around the country at Kitona, Kamina, Kisangani, Rumangabo and Nyaleke (within the Virunga National Park) in Nord-Kivu, and Luberizi (on the border with Burundi) in South Kivu. The process has suffered severe difficulties due to construction delays, administration errors, {{and the amount of}} travel former combatants have to do, as the three stages' centres are widely separated. Following the first 18 integrated brigades, the second goal is {{the formation of}} a ready reaction force of two to three brigades, and finally, by 2010 when MONUC is anticipated to have withdrawn, the creation of a Main Defence Force of three divisions.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{estimate}} the costs and outcomes associated with keeping gestational weight gain <b>within</b> <b>the</b> 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations. STUDY DESIGN: A decision analytic model was built using TreeAge software that compared the cost of gestational weight gain categorized by <b>staying</b> <b>within</b> versus exceeding <b>the</b> IOM guidelines in normal weight and obese women. We assumed the obesity prevalence from the most recent data in 2008 and applied to the estimated 4, 000, 000 million births per year. Outcomes included: gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, macrosomia (3 ̆e 4500 g), small-forgestational age, postterm delivery, cesarean delivery, postpartum weight retention, and child obesity. RESULTS: Normal weight women who gained <b>within</b> <b>the</b> IOM recommendations incurred 2, 502 less costs than normal weight women who exceeded the IOM recommendations. Obese women who gained <b>within</b> <b>the</b> IOM recommendations incurred 6, 501 less costs than obese women who exceeded the IOM recommendations. With lower costs and better outcomes adhering to IOM guidelines for gestational weight gain is a dominant strategy. When applied to the U. S. population, gaining within IOM guidelines could lead to 12. 7 billion dollars of savings. In addition, <b>staying</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> IOM guidelines would result in 76, 400 fewer cesarean deliveries for normal weight women and 408, 000 for obese women (see table). CONCLUSION: From a societal standpoint, there is economic benefit <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> IOM guidelines for gestational weight gain.
