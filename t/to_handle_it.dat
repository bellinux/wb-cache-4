The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not know how <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it,</b> but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy {{electrons and}} thus is relatively safe <b>to</b> <b>handle.</b> <b>It</b> decays with a half-life of 330days to californium-249, which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.|$|E

5|$|Many SCI {{patients}} have received misinformation {{about the effects}} of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it. Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired, it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality. Longer-term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important, yet sexuality {{is one of the most}} often neglected areas in long-term SCI rehabilitation, particularly for women. Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it.</b> Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject. Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information.|$|E
5|$|The finetooth shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans. However, when caught, this shark thrashes and snaps at {{anything}} within range, and people have been bitten attempting <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it.</b> Finetooth sharks are used for human consumption fresh or dried and salted. Other than off the southeastern United States, this species is of little commercial importance: it is small and occurs in water too shallow for most commercial and recreational fisheries, and is generally too fast-swimming to be caught by shrimp trawlers. Small numbers are taken incidentally by floating longlines and on hook-and-line. This species is susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate, and to habitat degradation due to its inshore habits.|$|E

In total, Camel pilots have been credited with the shooting down of 1,294 enemy aircraft, more than any other Allied fighter of the conflict. Towards the end of the Great War, the type had also seen use as a ground-attack aircraft, partially due to it having become increasingly outclassed as the capabilities of fighter aircraft on both sides was rapidly advancing at that time.|$|E
25|$|In July 1974, Flynt first {{published}} Hustler {{as a step}} forward from the Hustler Newsletter, which was advertising for his businesses. The magazine struggled for the first year, partly because many distributors and wholesalers refused <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it</b> as its nude photos became increasingly graphic. It targeted working-class men and grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around three million. The publication of nude paparazzi pictures of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in August 1975 was a major coup. Hustler has often featured more explicit photographs than comparable magazines and has contained depictions of women that some find demeaning, such as a naked woman in a meat grinder or presented as a dog on a leash– though Flynt later said that the meat grinder image was a criticism of the pornography industry itself.|$|E

The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi, but few paid it any heed or appear to have learned of it later. Meanwhile, the local CID had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds.

25|$|Despite strong {{sales of}} the M20, Mooney was short of cash. The {{development}} of the M22 Mustang had cost more than expected, and was ultimately unsuccessful. The collaboration with Mitsubishi had come with substantial financial assistance but proved {{too much for the}} company <b>to</b> <b>handle.</b> <b>It</b> went into chapter 7 bankruptcy in early 1969; American Electronics Laboratories quickly acquired Mooney in March of that year and invested US$600,000 to keep it operating. Sales that year were {{less than half of the}} previous year's figures, although a new model, the M20E Chapparal, was released with electrically-operated flaps and landing gear. AEL was unable to turn the company around and sold Mooney to Butler Aviation International in December 1969. AEL owned Mooney for just over 9 months and lost nearly a million dollars during that time. Butler Aviation also acquired the troubled Aerostar company and combined it with Mooney in an attempt to save both. The Mooney name was dropped in 1970, as was the M20 designation; the planes were called Aerostars.|$|E

25|$|From 1848 the {{brothers}} took out numerous patents related to steam power, with John Galloway taking a {{particular interest in}} issues to improve the efficiency of boilers. Before that they had registered at least one design to improve efficiency under the Designs Act of 1843. The most significant of the early patents was that of 11 March 1851 (England and Wales) and 14 April 1851 (Scotland) for the Galloway boiler, (UK patent 13532/1851, extended in 1865 for a further five years). They had built boilers of this type before the patent was granted, since at least 1849, and one was exhibited in 1851 at the Great Exhibition before being purchased by the West Ham Gutta Percha Company. The firm built approximately 9,000 of the type by 1891 and licensed the design for manufacture by other parties. So much work was created by {{this aspect of the}} business that in 1872 premises were obtained on Hyde Road, near Ardwick railway station, <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> <b>it,</b> leaving the Knott Mill works to concentrate on building engines.|$|E

The proposal achieves better results than the same oversampling method applied to the original input space. ...|$|R
