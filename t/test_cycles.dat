The VG20ET V6 was offered {{for the first}} time in Japan in 1984, in a model with an extended front end, called the Bluebird Maxima. This 2-litre V6 was available naturally aspirated or as an intercooled turbo. The U11 Maxima featured a larger 3.0L VG30E. There were also naturally aspirated or turbocharged 2-litre diesels. Counterintuitively, the turbodiesel had better gas mileage in standardized <b>test</b> <b>cycles,</b> presumably due to it being less stressed – as long as one did not take full advantage of its better performance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The direct {{verification}} of Rockwell testing machines comprises four parts such as test force, indenter, depth measuring device, and <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> {{as seen in}} ISO 6508 - 2. Among them, the {{verification of}} <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> is generally carried out by using a stopwatch on industrial sites, which is not so reliable. In addition to this, most of commercial hardness testing machines produced nowadays are automatically controlled by the embedded software, which makes {{it much more difficult}} to calibrate the <b>testing</b> <b>cycle.</b> It implies that even though hardness testing machines are advanced more, the calibration of the <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> does not keep up with their advancement. To overcome this problem, an on-site calibration system was developed to calibrate the <b>testing</b> <b>cycle</b> of both the automatically controlled as well as manually controlled Rockwell hardness testing machines. The calibration system is composed of load cell, indentation depth measuring apparatus and embedded clock. Using this system, measurement of test force, application velocity of test force, and indentation depth are possible simultaneously in real time, which enhances the efficiency and reliability of calibration procedure...|$|R
