5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A <b>third</b> <b>pillar</b> is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the reform process {{undertaken}} in the 1990 s, the Italian pension system has replaced a generous but unsustainable Defined Benefit formula with a Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) formula and opened the path for voluntary-based second and <b>third</b> <b>pillars.</b> While the reform has put the system on a sustainable path, its most relevant side effects consist in the transfer of the pension risk to the individuals, who are then more exposed to the consequences of unfavourable economic cycles and to financial crises. The extremely slow phasing in of the reform, however, undermines its credibility and raises risks of it backfiring. We propose three measures to avoid this: (1) acceleration of the full adoption of the NDC formula, to achieve uniformity of treatment of genders, cohorts, and working categories, (2) elimination of incentives to early retirement and introduction of flexible retirement, and (3) promotion of financial literacy. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} two parts. Part 1 {{presents}} the basic ideas underlying notional defined contribution (NDC) systems and discusses their main advantages and disadvantages. We {{argue that a}} NDC system is mainly a political device. It makes parametric reform, badly needed to stabilize the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pillars all over the World, easier because it exposes the trade-offs and clarifies concepts. It may also change the microeconomics of labor supply and savings. It does not, however, change the macroeconomics of PAYG systems and thus does not substitute for the introduction of pre-funded second and <b>third</b> <b>pillars.</b> NDC systems can be installed as individual account systems, as done most prominently in Sweden. However, {{they can also be}} mimicked by a set of rules in a conventional defined benefits PAYG system, showing that NDC systems are more a political than economic devices. Part 2 describes how the German pension reform proposals made in late summer 2003 effectively introduce a NDC system without explicit NDC-type accounting. ...|$|R

2500|$|Muslims fulfill this {{religious}} obligation {{by giving}} a fixed {{percentage of their}} surplus wealth. Zakat has been paired with such a high sense of righteousness that it is often placed {{on the same level}} of importance as performing the five-daily repetitive ritualised prayer (salat). Muslims see this process also as a way of purifying themselves from their greed and selfishness and also safeguarding future business. In addition, Zakat purifies the person who receives it because it saves him from the humiliation of begging and prevents him from envying the rich. Because it holds such a high level of importance the [...] "punishment" [...] for not paying when able is very severe. In the 2nd edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam it states, [...] "...the prayers of those who do not pay zakat will not be accepted". This is because without Zakat a tremendous hardship is placed on the poor which otherwise would not be there. Besides the fear of their prayers not getting heard, those who are able should be practicing this <b>third</b> <b>pillar</b> of Islam because the Quran states that this is what believers should do.|$|E
2500|$|The International Olympic Committee (IOC) {{recognizes that}} the Olympic Games demand {{tremendous}} environmental resources, activities, and construction projects that could be detrimental to a host city’s environment. In 1995, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch stated, “the International Olympic Committee is resolved {{to ensure that the}} environment becomes the third dimension of the organization of the Olympic Games, the first and second being sport and culture.” Acting on this statement, in 1996 the IOC added the ‘environment’ as a <b>third</b> <b>pillar</b> to its vision for Olympic games. The IOC requires cities bidding to host the Olympics to provide a comprehensive strategy to protect the environment in preparation for hosting, and following the conclusion of the Games. This initiative was most notably acted upon in 2000, when the “Green Olympics” effort was developed by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Beijing Olympic Games. The Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics effort to host environmentally friendly games resulted in over 160 projects meeting the goal of “green” games through improved air quality and water quality, implementation of sustainable energy sources, improved waste management, and environmental education. These projects included industrial plant relocation or closure, furnace replacement, introduction of new emission standards, and more strict traffic control. [...] Most of these measures were adopted on a temporary basis, and although real improvements were realized (particularly in air quality), most of these improvements had disappeared one year following the Games. [...] Although these improvements were short lived, IOC’s inclusion of environmental policies in evaluating and selecting host cities demonstrates a corporate responsibility that may be built upon in years to come. Detailed frameworks for environmental sustainability have been released for the 2018 Winter Olympics, and 2020 Summer Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, and Tokyo, Japan, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Public {{pensions}} - {{the primary}} pillar of old-age income provision - will, in the future, be less generous {{than they have}} been in the past, in particular owing to the impact of demographic change. The pension gap is supposed to be plugged by the second and <b>third</b> <b>pillars</b> of pension provision. However, people require reliable planning information if they are to exercise greater individual responsibility. It is therefore absolutely essential that adequate information is made available about the level of pension benefits that will be generated by each pillar of old-age pension provision. This paper outlines a number of different means of presenting the level of future pensions and the assumptions on which such extrapolations are necessarily based. Our work is based on an assumed average rate of inflation of 1. 5 % and an average rate of real income growth not exceeding 1. 5 %. This last figure is derived from calculations made in the framework of a macroeconomic simulation model. This model also shows that while the funded pillar of old-age pension provision is not entirely immune to population aging, it is not substantially threatened by a substantial decrease in stock market prices, the so-called "asset meltdown". ...|$|R
2500|$|There {{are three}} [...] "pillars" [...] of the UK pension system, which aim to ensure dignity {{and a fair}} income in retirement. The first pillar is the state pension, {{administered}} by the government, and funded by National Insurance contributions. The <b>third</b> <b>pillar</b> is private, or [...] "personal pensions", which individuals buy themselves. The second pillar, and deriving from the contract of employment, is occupational pensions. Traditionally, these came from a collective agreement, or from an employer setting one up. The Pensions Act 2008 gives every [...] "jobholder" [...] (defined as a worker, age 16 to 75, with wages between £5,035 and £33,540) {{the right to be}} automatically enrolled by the employer in an occupational pension, unless the jobholder chooses to opt out. This is a simple [...] "defined contribution" [...] scheme: whatever the jobholder contributes, they get out. Although collectively invested, benefits are individualised, meaning the risk of living longer and running out of money grows. To reduce administration costs, a non-departmental trust fund called the National Employment Savings Trust was established as a [...] "public option" [...] competing with private asset managers. Employers set aside an agreed percentage of jobholders' wages, and negotiate how much they will contribute. This is particularly important for people who do not created a union and collective bargained for an occupational pension. Collectively bargained pensions are often better, and historically had [...] "defined benefits": on retirement, people receive money based either on their final salary, or a career average of earnings {{for the rest of their}} lives. Living longer does not become an individual risk, but is collectivised among all contributors. In principle, the rules for pension trusts differ from ordinary law of trusts as pensions are not gifts and people pay for their benefits through their work. Pensions operating through contracts also engender mutual trust and confidence in the employment relationship. An employer is under a duty to inform their staff about how to make the best of their pension rights. Moreover, workers must be treated equally, on grounds of gender or otherwise, in their pension entitlements. The management of a pension trust must be partly codetermined by the pension beneficiaries, so that a minimum of one third of a trustee board are elected or [...] "member nominated trustees". The Secretary of State has the power by regulation, as yet unused, to increase the minimum up to one half. Trustees are charged with the duty to manage the fund in the best interests of the beneficiaries, in a way that reflects their preferences, by investing the savings in company shares, bonds, real estate or other financial products.|$|E

40|$|Australia’s {{approach}} to retirement incomes policy has three pillars: the means-tested age pension; compulsory superannuation; and voluntary saving, including saving via superannuation {{over and above}} that mandated by the superannuation guarantee. This paper examines the economic case for compulsory superannuation contributions and questions whether compulsory super {{is the most effective}} way of promoting household and national saving and reducing future demands on the federal budget from an ageing population when compared to alternative policy options. Most of the economic arguments for compulsory superannuation are second-best arguments made on the assumption that first-best outcomes are unattainable. There is considerable scope for public policy to address adverse interactions between the three pillars, the tax system and public expenditure that will increase voluntary saving, improve retirement incomes and reduce future demands on the budget without relying on further increases in compulsory superannuation contributions. The paper recommends a shift in compulsion from the accumulation to the decumulation stage of retirement saving through the mandatory annuitisation of superannuation benefits. The second and <b>third</b> <b>pillars</b> of retirement incomes policy should be merged into a single pillar based on a politically robust regime of tax-advantaged long-term voluntary saving via housing and superannuation...|$|R
40|$|Demographic change {{confronts the}} German Pay-As-You-Go pension system with serious problems. For this reason, {{reductions}} {{in the level of}} public pensions were adopted under the pension reform in 2001, which also strengthened significantly the funded second and <b>third</b> <b>pillars</b> of old-age provision. The introduction of the supplementary pension provision brings with itself two major risks we are going to analyse in the present paper. One risk is implied by the voluntariness of supplementary arrangements. There is uncertainty over whether households � in particular the less affluent ones � will show the willingness and/or the capability to accumulate supplementary savings for their old age consistently. A further risk for supplementary old-age provision - which could as well be seen as a chance � rests in the return on contributions. Critics of funded private retirement provision often point at the return risk, in particular {{against the backdrop of the}} recent developments on capital markets. This paper asks whether under these risks, households will be able to close the gap arising from a reduction of public pension levels and to which degree there is scope for temporary suspensions of contributions to supplementary schemes. ...|$|R

40|$|Putnam’s {{theory of}} "two-level games" has spawned {{numerous}} studies examining {{the interaction between}} international and domestic politics, many focusing on politics in the European Union. While noting that ratification may be formal or informal, much of this literature treats each important domestic actor {{as if it has}} de facto formal ratification power. This means that the literature overlooks the very real distinction between formal and informal ratification. Informal ratification may {{be thought of as a}} case in which the government pays "audience costs" for unpopular international agreements. In this case, a government must respond continuously to public opinion. This presents constraints very different from those faced by governments who must obtain the formal approval of the legislature (or other actor). For example, divided government has no effect on the likelihood of informal ratification but often does affect the distribution of gains, while it often affects the likelihood of formal ratification but often has no effect on the distribution of the gains. Because these kinds of ratification differ significantly, Putnam’s ratification metaphor is not always the most appropriate conceptualization of two-level politics in the European Union. The formal ratification metaphor is especially inappropriate for studying policy-making in the second and <b>third</b> <b>pillars</b> of the EU, which are mostly characterized by intergovernmental bargaining without formal ratification requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{demographic}} {{change and the}} fact that the benefits of a growing proportion of pensioners must be financed by fewer and fewer contributors, poses major problems for the German pay-as-you-go pension scheme. For this reason, the 2001 pension reform entailed a reduction in the level of statutory pensions and strengthened the funded second and <b>third</b> <b>pillars</b> of old-age pension provision. The 'Riester pension', introduced in 2001, aimed at encouraging the accumulation of additional private pensions, and therefore created a voluntary but highly subsidized private pension supplement. The savings incentives - flat-rate benefits and tax breaks – created by the reform were intended to motivate people in the public retirement insurance scheme to compensate for reductions in relative statutory pension levels by paying into private pension funds. 1 State subsidizes for Riester pensions are substantial: Contributions made by people on low earnings and parents attract subsidizes of over 50 per cent - in other words, the state delivers more than half of the savings put aside by these groups of people. How did these subsidies affect the savings behaviour of German private households? This paper uses the Riester pension as an ‘experiment’ that sheds light on how savings incentives work...|$|R
