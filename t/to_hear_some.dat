Since 1977 {{it is now}} officially called Quebec's National Holiday, (La fête {{nationale}} du Québec). That year, Jarry Park was chosen to present the most important event of the celebrations. 40,000 people came <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> of Québec's most acclaimed singers; namely Pauline Julien, Clémence Desrochers, Jean-Pierre Ferland, Christine Charbonneau, Hervé Brousseau, Les Cailloux, Pierre Calvé, Renée Claude et Pierre Létourneau.|$|E
25|$|In August 1969, the Woodstock Music and Art Fair {{took place}} in Bethel, New York, which for many, {{exemplified}} the best of hippie counterculture. Over 500,000 people arrived <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> of the most notable musicians and bands of the era, among them Canned Heat, Richie Havens, Joan Baez, Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Carlos Santana, Sly & The Family Stone, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, and Jimi Hendrix. Wavy Gravy's Hog Farm provided security and attended to practical needs, and the hippie ideals of love and human fellowship seemed to have gained real-world expression. Similar rock festivals occurred {{in other parts of}} the country, which played a significant role in spreading hippie ideals throughout America.|$|E

500|$|Like its predecessor, Experimental Jet Set was {{produced}} by the band and alternative rock veteran Butch Vig. According to the band, [...] "The idea this time was to cut {{as much of it}} live as we could, and not labor over polishing and overdubbing in the usual big-rock manner." [...] Similarly, guitarist Lee Ranaldo explained that the band wanted to achieve a more lo-fi approach: [...] "None of [...] music was labored, some of it was done in people's bedrooms, even. [...] to write the songs and record them simply and basically." [...] Additionally, the band ordered Vig to refrain from his desire to apply a buzz remover to several tracks. The album was engineered by John Siket and recorded at Sear Sound studio in New York City, the same studio where the band's 1987 album Sister was recorded. The band claimed that the album was recorded over the master tapes of Sister to save costs, and it is possible <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> parts of Sister during quiet sections of the final recording. The album was recorded on a two-inch 16-track analog tape recorder through antiquated equipment.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{had little}} {{difficulty}} in persuading his boss, Roy Featherstone, and Ron White, authoriser of EMI recordings, to allow Barrett to record {{with the company}} again. In April 1969, the young executive took over the project and Barrett began working on newer material, while reworking the 1968 recordings. Jones would later explain the rationale behind EMI letting Barrett record again: [...] "What was decided was {{to see what was}} the strength of Syd's new material, and plan accordingly. If it worked, then, O.K. we'd do an album. If not, we'd call it a day..." [...] In a meeting at Barrett's flat in Earls Court, unsure of Jenner's production technique, Jones asked <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> of the previous year's tapes; Barrett played him [...] "Swan Lee", [...] "Late Night", [...] "Rhamadam", [...] "Lanky (Parts One and Two)" [...] and [...] "Golden Hair". Of these, [...] "Swan Lee" [...] had no vocals, but Jones saw potential in the song; [...] "Late Night" [...] did have vocals and, Jones remarked, [...] "a certain charm"; while [...] "Golden Hair" [...] was [...] "great". After the playbacks, Barrett performed several songs on guitar for Jones: [...] "Opel" [...] and [...] "Clowns and Jugglers" [...] (both attempted during the sessions with Peter Jenner), and the newly written [...] "Terrapin" [...] and [...] "Love You".|$|E
500|$|Greenwald {{first tried}} {{to take control of}} the sounds from the {{expensive}} synthesizers Guitar Center was selling by recording samples of them, but was unimpressed with the results. On a later visit to the shop, he recorded what would be the first sound to be featured on the album; he taped a guy who [...] "was just going for it on a drum kit", lowering the speed of the sample of the drum recording he used. The singer described how he felt while editing the sample: [...] "I started <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> kind of solace in a place that is sonically hellish.” Greenwald started recording the album in a Guitar Center in Brooklyn, and then at a shop in Baltimore. Instead of looking to record instruments specifically planned for a song, Greenwald taped whatever sound he thought that could become better in quality when editing them later. Greenwald ended up with around 40 hours of iPhone recordings to work at his home. Some snippets were played through a 4-track tape recorder, others were old pedals and some were looped or used as synthesizer patches. These recordings were put together, EQ'd, mixed and mastered in Pro Tools. Much planning was put into how the recordings were edited together, as he tried to [...] "connect things that were seemingly un-connectable." [...] The end result was an album that featured ambient, dub, new-age, experimental and post-vaporwave styles.|$|E

[...] Jesal Padania of RapReviews {{commented that the}} album [...] "proved remarkably consistent throughout, and was a superb listening experience" [...] and considered it a studio release, stating [...] "this was a short sharp shock of awesome lyricism, and many, unofficially, consider {{this to be the}} closest cousin we will ever get to Illmatic II." [...] Pitchfork Medias Ryan Dombal cited the album as one of Nas' [...] "finest moments". About.com's Henry Adaso called it [...] "noteworthy because of its superiority to half the stuff in Nas' catalog." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Chris Ryan was less enthusiastic about the album, finding it [...] "somewhat inconsistent, and certainly too scattered to be considered an album per se," [...] even though it features [...] "some classics, such as the nostalgic 'Doo Rags,' that are not to be missed." [...] In its 2007 issue, XXL included The Lost Tapes in its list of [...] "classic" [...] albums to be given the publication's maximum [...] "XXL" [...] rating.

500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life.

2500|$|Enjoying good {{ticket sales}} {{and hoping to}} ensure its future, LOOM sought to raise funds to {{purchase}} the Eastside Playhouse. [...] However, by 1979, diabetes had blinded William Mount-Burke. He nevertheless continued to conduct performances from memory, to plan LOOM's future, and even to stage new shows after losing his sight completely. [...] For example, in 1980 Mount-Burke directed the first professional production of Arthur Sullivan and B. C. Stephenson's The Zoo given {{anywhere in the world}} since 1879, together with Cox and Box and Trial by Jury, repeating the triple bill the following year. During these seasons, despite Mount-Burke's declining health, the company attracted high-quality professional singers for their casts, generally improved costumes and sets, earned good reviews and enjoyed a seemingly secure financial future. [...] The New York Times wrote, in its preview of LOOM's 1981 spring season, [...] "The three works (Pinafore, Pirates and The Mikado) ...will be done in the best Savoyard tradition. Do not expect a fully mounted D'Oyly Carte theatrical version.... Expect, however, <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>some</b> fine voices and to be entertained." ...|$|E

At {{the time of the}} genocide, he was a pastor in the Baptist church in Nyakizu in southern Rwanda. According to Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the court found him guilty of orchestrating deadly attacks, and organising the torching of Tutsi homes. In a statement the court said he had spread anti-Tutsi propaganda and incited [...] "killings through fomenting anger and contempt towards Tutsis". It stated that [...] "The court has found Bazaramba guilty of an offence which without a genocidal intent would be judged as a murder or incitement to murder ... For those crimes, the only possible punishment is life imprisonment." [...] Helsingin Sanomat reported that he was acquitted of 10 counts of murder and of providing training and acquiring weapons.
