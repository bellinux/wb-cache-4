5|$|His season's best {{came under}} unusual {{circumstances}} at the British Grand Prix – {{due to a}} system malfunction he was initially timed by hand at dead on ten seconds, which was amended to 9.96s after video evidence was consulted. He could not match that form at the World 100m final: Kim Collins, Darrel Brown, Darren Campbell, and Chambers all finished within a split second {{of each other and}} Chambers was adjudged to have finished fourth. Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4×100m relay, allowing Joshua J. Johnson of the United States team to beat him to the finish line. In spite of his close fourth and a relay silver medal, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> disappointment in the press that Chambers' record breaking claims and gold medals had not materialised.|$|E
5|$|The 1920–21 {{campaign}} {{was the second}} season of competitive football in England after the First World War. Burnley's chairman, Harry Windle, had been elected to the position in 1909, and manager John Haworth was marking his 11th consecutive year in charge. After finishing as runners-up to West Bromwich Albion in the Football League First Division the previous season, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> eager anticipation within the club before the season began. Team captain Tommy Boyle claimed that his side was capable of building on its success of the previous season and winning the league championship, despite Burnley not having won a trophy since their FA Cup victory in 1914.|$|E

He held out for a new contract in the off-season, and finally signed with the White Sox a couple weeks {{before the beginning}} of the season after becoming the last remaining holdout. Grove was the workhorse of the White Sox, leading the team in games pitched (33) and started (30), while remaining the youngest pitcher on the roster. He finished the season with 217 pitched innings, a career best four shutouts, a 14–12 record, and a 3.44 ERA.|$|E

5|$|Hibernian played {{its first}} match on the Meadows, on 25 December 1875. The club {{first moved to}} the Easter Road area in 1880, to a ground known as Hibernian Park. This {{location}} {{had the advantage of}} being equidistant between their two main sources of support, the Irish immigrant communities in the port of Leith and the Old Town of Edinburgh. When Hibs suffered financial difficulties in the early 1890s, the lease on Hibernian Park expired and developers started building what would become Bothwell Street. The club was reformed in 1892 and a lease on a piece of land called Drum Park was secured. The site had restricted access from Easter Road, a pronounced slope and was in close proximity to Bank Park, the home of Leith Athletic. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> continuity from the previous ground, however, and the supporters were keen to get started again. The first match at Easter Road was played on 4 February 1893, a friendly against Clyde.|$|E
5|$|The {{coal mining}} {{industry}} of the Rhondda was artificially buoyed {{throughout the war}} years, though there were expectations {{of a return to}} the pre-1939 industrial collapse {{after the end of the}} Second World War. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> salvation when the government announced the nationalisation of the British Coalmines in 1947; but the following decades saw a continual reduction in the output from the Rhondda mines. From 15,000 miners in 1947, Rhondda had just a single pit within the valleys producing coal in 1984, located at Maerdy. The decline in the mining of coal after World War II was a country wide issue, but South Wales and Rhondda were affected to a higher degree than other areas of Britain. Oil had superseded coal as the fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure influencing the supply of oil. Of the few industries that were still reliant on coal, the demand was for quality coals, especially coking coal which was required by the steel industry. Fifty percent of Glamorgan coal was now supplied to steelworks, with the second biggest market being domestic heating, which the 'smokeless' coal of the Rhondda became once again fashionable after the publication of the Clean Air Act. These two markets now controlled the fate of the mines in the Rhondda, and as demand fell from both sectors the knock-on effect on the mining industry was further contraction. In addition exports to other areas of Europe, traditionally France, Italy and the Low Countries, experienced a massive decline; from 33 per cent around the start of the 20th century to roughly 5 per cent by 1980.|$|E

25|$|Maeno's suicide flight {{inspired}} {{a variety of}} reactions in Japan. According to an Associated Press article, many Japanese felt some sympathy with Maeno's actions because of the shame associated with the Lockheed scandal.

Ambassador McDonnough noted that heightened expectations and the desire to see the CDF operational in the shortest possible time, meant that Member States sometimes underestimated the work which had to be done to make the CDF ready for full operations.|$|E

Henry III fully endorsed Dafydd as Llywelyn's heir, and in 1226 Henry III had successfully petitioned the Papacy to free his sister Joan from any stigma of illegitimacy. In 1229, Dafydd traveled to London to do homage for the lands he would inherit, and Llywelyn arranged for the advantageous marriage between Dafydd and Isabella de Braose, daughter and co-heiress of Llywelyn's powerful ally the Marcher lord William de Breos.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Liga Mayor, {{there was}} no {{national}} football league in Mexico, and football competitions were held within relatively small geographical regions. The winners of the Primera Fuerza, a local league consisting of teams near and around Mexico City, was considered the national competition. There were other regional leagues such as the Liga Amateur de Veracruz, the Liga Occidental De Jalisco and the Liga del Bajío that also had notable clubs. Many club owners were not keen {{on the idea of}} establishing a professional league, despite paying players under the table. With the increasing demand for football, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> urgency to unite all the local amateur leagues in Mexico to progress as a football nation. The professional national league was finally established in 1943.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First World War <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> dissatisfaction in how honours were distributed. The effect was the passage of the Nickel Resolution. The resolution created a policy of Canadians not being appointed to peerages or titular honours, and the government of Canada only making recommendation for a handful of non-titular honours. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster reaffirmed the equality of the self-governing dominions of the British Empire, however there was no mechanism to establish honours specific to the dominions. In 1935, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal was established as the first award specifically for service in Canada. The Canadian government managed the creation of this medal by passing the recommendation for creating the honour on to the Dominions Office, who had experience with drafting Royal Warrants. In 1934, King George V signed the Royal Warrant creating the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal. Prime Minister R.B. Bennett countersigned the Royal Warrant 15 December 1934 signifying that the King was acting on the advice of his Canadian Ministry.|$|E

500|$|The last {{scene in}} the film was {{arranged}} for {{the last day of}} filming. Initially, the language was supposed to be more somber and classical, but Meyer made some last minute changes. Flinn said that Meyer [...] "was in an optimistic mood", and the director suggested that Kirk quote Peter Pan for the last lines: [...] "Second star to the right, and straight on till morning." [...] Emotions ran high as the last shots of the cast were captured; Shatner said, [...] "By the time we finished the last scene, which extended longer than we expected, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> irritation.

To everyone's surprise, though, the movie functioned as a [...] "great big classified ad", in that hundreds of Czech boys traveled to Zruč nad Sázavou and camped out in the woods in hopes of hooking up with the female factory workers, who responded appropriately by sneaking out of their dorms at night for assignations with the campers.|$|E

500|$|The Rules of the Game {{is remembered}} as a {{commentary}} on the moral callousness of the European upper class and their servants just {{before the beginning of}} World War II.

500|$|The {{response}} within New York to {{the appointment}} was mixed. The upstate New York media was generally optimistic about appointment of an upstate Senator, as one {{had not been}} elected since Charles Goodell left office in 1971. Many downstaters were disappointed with the selection, with some media outlets stating that Paterson had ignored the electoral influence of populous New York City and downstate on state politics. One questioned whether Paterson's administration was aware of [...] " [...] statewide elections are won and lost". [...] Gillibrand was relatively unknown statewide, and many voters found the choice surprising. One source stated, [...] "With every Democrat in New York ... angling for the appointment, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> bafflement, belittlement, and bruised egos when Paterson tapped the junior legislator unknown outside of Albany." ...|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, {{the most}} {{significant}} factor was the fighting qualities of the Japanese soldier. One Australian veteran, Sergeant Charles Lemaire, who had previously fought against the Germans at El Alamein with the 2/17th Infantry Battalion, described the Japanese as [...] "tenacious, brave, self-sacrificing". In {{the minds of the}} Australian soldiers, the Japanese had a reputation for being tough opponents and for not taking prisoners. Despite this perception amongst the Australians, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> confidence in their technological superiority. For the Japanese soldiers, the technological edge that the Australians possessed and their relatively abundant supply of ammunition and artillery and air support was the main psychological factor that governed their perceptions of the Australians as enemy. In order to counter this, Japanese commanders exhorted their troops to draw upon [...] "spiritual strength" [...] to achieve victory. In the end, although many of the significant actions of the campaign were infantry engagements which occurred {{a long way from the}} Australian base areas where their technological superiority was limited, the Australians' use of combined arms tactics ultimately proved decisive. Although preliminary aerial bombardment, particularly that which was employed around Sattelberg, proved largely ineffective in terms of its physical effects, it did serve to reduce Japanese morale. Used in combination with artillery preparation, which caused significant casualties, considerable disruption was caused to Japanese lines of communications that were already stretched. Suffering from ammunition shortages that limited their fire support, the Japanese defenders were overwhelmed by Australian infantry that had a level of artillery support that was unprecedented for an Australian division in the Pacific, and who advanced in concert with tanks that they employed in a manner that exploited the element of surprise.|$|E
