40|$|The {{development}} of new therapeutic strategies {{is essential for the}} management of gliomas, one of the most malignant forms of cancer. We have shown previously that the growth of the rat glioma C 6 cell line is inhibited by psychoactive cannabinoids (I. Galve-Roperh et al., Nat. Med., 6 : 313 – 319, 2000).

40|$|<b>The</b> {{carotid body}} (<b>CB)</b> {{is in charge}} of {{adjusting}} ventilatory and cardiovascular function during changes in arterial blood gases. Regardless this essential function, <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> has been implicated in the sensing of other physiological signals such as changes in blood flow and glucose levels. More important, malfunction of <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> chemoreceptors has been associated with the progression and deterioration of several disease states such as hypertension, heart failure, renal failure, insulin resistance, diabetes and sleep apnea. Although the mechanisms involved in the alterations of <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> function in pathophysiology are currently under intense research, the development of therapeutic approaches to restore normal CB chemoreflex function remains unsolved. Recent studies showing <b>the</b> effect of <b>CB</b> denervation in pathophysiology have unveiled a key role of these arterial chemoreceptors in the development of autonomic imbalance and respiratory disturbances, and suggest that targeting <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> could represent a novel strategy to improve disease outcome. Unfortunately, classical pharmacotherapy intended to normalize CB function may be hard to establish since several cellular pathways are involved in <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> dysfunction. Augmented levels of angiotensin II, endothelin- 1, cytokines and free radicals along with decreases in nitric oxide had all been related to <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> dysfunction. Moreover, changes in expression of angiotensin receptors, nitric oxide synthases and cytokines that take place within <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> tissue in pathological states also contribute to <b>the</b> enhanced <b>CB</b> chemoreflex drive. It has been shown in heart failure, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea that <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> becomes tonically hyper-reactive.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cb</b> {{value is}} a useful {{parameter}} for estimating the humidity control capacity of materials.

However, because {{it takes a long time}} to obtain <b>the</b> <b>Cb</b> values for materials at each temperature variation period, we developed an easier method based on a linear excitation-response theory to obtain <b>the</b> <b>Cb</b> values without measuring at each period.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{chromatoid body}} (<b>CB)</b> {{is a unique}} {{structure}} of male germ cells composed of thin filaments that condense into a perinuclear organelle after meiosis.

Precise staging of the seminiferous tubules and co-localization studies with MVH and MILI, two well recognized CB markers, documented that SAM 68 transiently associates with <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> in secondary spermatocytes and early round spermatids.

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{recognized}} that <b>the</b> cannabinoid receptor <b>CB</b> 2 may play a functionally relevant role in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). This role is mediated primarily through microglia, a resident population of cells in the CNS that is morphologically, phenotypically, and functionally related to macrophages. These cells also express <b>the</b> cannabinoid receptor <b>CB</b> 1. <b>The</b> <b>CB</b> 1 receptor (CB 1 R) is constitutively expressed at low levels while <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 receptor (CB 2 R) is expressed at higher levels and is modulated in relation to cell activation state. The relatively high levels of <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 R correspond with microglia being in ‘responsive' and ‘primed' states, suggesting the existence of a ‘window' of functional relevance during which activation of <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 R modulates microglial activities. Signature activities of ‘responsive' and ‘primed' microglia are chemotaxis and antigen processing, respectively. The endocannabinoid 2 -arachidonylglycerol has been reported to stimulate a chemotactic response from these cells through <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 R. In contrast, we have shown in vivo and in vitro that the exogenous cannabinoids delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol and CP 55940 inhibit the chemotactic response of microglia to Acanthamoeba culbertsoni, an opportunistic pathogen that is the causative agent of Granulomatous Amoebic Encephalitis, through activation of <b>the</b> <b>CB</b> 2 R.

40|$|International audienceThe genome of male {{germ cells}} is {{actively}} transcribed during spermatogenesis to produce phase-specific protein-coding mRNAs and {{a considerable amount}} of different noncoding RNAs.
