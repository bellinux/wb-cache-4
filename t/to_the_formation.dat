5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and coagulation are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E

5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E

Because Mesa Verde is slanted to the south, the proper geological term is cuesta, not mesa. The park {{is made up of}} several smaller cuestas located between canyons. Mesa Verde's slant contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of the alcoves that have preserved the area's cliff dwellings.|$|E

5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive {{lung disease}} in which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor airflow (airflow limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of lung tissue (known as emphysema) and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace lung tissue. This form of disease is called bullous emphysema.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} popular than some men's {{football}} events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd), women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when The Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, {{on the grounds that}} the game (as played by women) was distasteful. Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted. This led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of the English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds.|$|E

5|$|Feminism was {{challenged}} by various minority groups for not entirely addressing {{the needs of}} minority populations.
