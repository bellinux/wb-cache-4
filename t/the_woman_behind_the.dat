25|$|Maike Vogt-Lüerssen {{argues that}} <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> famous smile is Isabella of Aragon, the Duchess of Milan. Leonardo was the court painter for the Duke of Milan for 11 years. The pattern on Mona Lisa's dark green dress, art critic Maike Vogt-Lüerssen believes, {{indicates}} {{that she was}} a member of the house of Sforza. Her theory is that the Mona Lisa was the first official portrait of the new Duchess of Milan, which requires that it was painted in spring or summer 1489 (and not 1503).|$|E

2500|$|Gerrick D. Kennedy {{from the}} Los Angeles Times {{wrote that the}} {{documentary}} [...] "remains a victory for her fans. Casual viewers will most likely glean {{the same sense of}} the superstar's life as one might from a magazine feature. But for serious fans of the fiercely private superstar, this remains a window into her life." [...] The Hollywood Reporters David Rooney said, [...] "this is less a documentary portrait than a micromanaged video diary exploring the R superstar's relationship with her laptop. The HBO film will be candy to her fan base; just don't expect startling insights into <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> talent." [...] Tirdad Derakhshani of the Philadelphia Media Network wrote that Life Is But a Dream [...] "is a carefully filtered snapshot of an artist who has enough power to become maker of her own myth." [...] Writing for Zap2it, Geoff Berkshire called it a [...] "vanity project and calculated act of image control. The only thing revealed by the film -- co-directed, co-written and co-executive produced by Beyoncé herself -- is a narcissistic inability to give up that desire for control." [...] Television critic Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times gave a negative review for the film, writing, [...] " [...] is as contrived as , but probably for good reason it is neither daring nor entirely truthful. It's an infomercial, not just about Beyoncé's talent onstage but her authenticity behind the scenes. She is a people-pleasing diva and she wants to keep it that way." ...|$|E

50|$|Two {{workers at}} a {{cosmetics}} counter {{in a department}} store (Haggard and Abbington), and their boss (MacNeill).

60|$|It was {{an awful}} trip! Part of the distance, indeed, the trio were borne along well out of the sea, though the waves leaped hungrily up and sent spray over them, but as they drew near the shore they were dipped again and again into the foam, so that the little cabin boy needed all his energy and knowledge, {{as well as his}} bravery and strength, to prevent his charge being washed out. Amid ringing cheers from the fishermen-- and a treble echo from <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> wall--they were at last safely landed.|$|R

60|$|But her {{genius for}} expedients saved her from this humiliation. She had to {{purchase}} some sewing-cotton, {{and some other}} little things, and when she had bought them, she handed her bundle to <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> counter, and {{asked her if she}} would not be so good as to have that wrapped up with the other things. It was a good deal to ask, she knew, and the woman smiled, for the articles she had bought would not make a package as large as her hand. However, her request was complied with, and she took away a very decent package, with the card of the store stamped on the outside. I suppose that there are not more than half a dozen {{people in this country who}} would refuse Euphemia anything that she would be willing to ask for.|$|E
6000|$|He stopped once only {{on his way}} to {{the hotel}} to look at a toyshop in one of the great thoroughfares. The {{miniature}} ships in the window reminded him of his nephew. [...] "My little name-sake will be sadly disappointed at not seeing me to-morrow," [...] he thought. [...] "I must make it up to the boy by sending him something from his uncle." [...] He went into the shop and bought one of the ships. It was secured in a box, and packed and directed in his presence. He put a ca rd on the deck of the miniature vessel before the cover of the box was nailed on, bearing this inscription: [...] "A ship for the little sailor, with the big sailor's love."--"Children like to be written to, ma'am," [...] he said, apologetically, to <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> counter.

60|$|Jacob, who {{occasionally}} {{went to the}} saloon with Ned, was more and more convinced that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> bar was the girl he had known in Piper's Court; and the sudden change in her face when he had spoken to her as to what her past history might be, had still more brought Ned over {{to the belief that}} the lad might be right. He himself was feeling anxious and undecided. He seemed no nearer getting at the end he desired than he had been a month before, and he could not conceal from himself that this girl showed pleasure when she met him, that her manner softened, and that once or twice when he had come suddenly upon her, her cheek had flushed. An occasional rough joke from his mates showed that it was considered in camp a settled thing that he would carry off the woman whose presence was considered by the superstitious miners to have brought luck to them all.|$|E
50|$|The Avalon series retells the Matter of Britain {{from the}} point of view of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> throne. Through a set of stories that spans several centuries, it tells of how the mystic isle of Avalon was created, its history, life in Britain under Roman authority, and how Avalon and its ancient traditions faded from the world because of a new religion, Christianity. All stories are told by women who were {{powerful}} during their lifetime, such as Eilan, High Priestess of the Forest House, Helena, mother of the Roman Emperor Constantine, and Morgaine, High Priestess of Avalon (later remembered as the sorceress Morgan le Fay).|$|R

60|$|The only address I {{knew was}} the Hotel des Belges, but Strickland had long left that, {{and they would}} have no {{recollection}} of him. With that queer idea of his to keep his whereabouts secret, it was unlikely that, on leaving, he had said where he was going. Besides, it was more than five years ago. I felt pretty sure that he had not moved far. If he continued to frequent the same cafe as when he had stayed at the hotel, it was probably because it was the most convenient. Suddenly I remembered that he had got his commission to paint a portrait through the baker from whom he bought his bread, and it struck me that there one might find his address. I called for a directory and looked out the bakers. There were five in the immediate neighbourhood, and the only thing was to go to all of them. Stroeve accompanied me unwillingly. His own plan was to run up and down the streets that led out of the Avenue de Clichy and ask at every house if Strickland lived there. My commonplace scheme was, after all, effective, for in the second shop we asked at <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> counter acknowledged that she knew him. She was not certain where he lived, but it was in one of the three houses opposite. Luck favoured us, and in the first we tried the concierge told us that we should find him on the top floor.|$|E
