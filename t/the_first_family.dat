5|$|Both of Mario Andretti's sons, Michael and Jeff, were auto racers. Michael {{followed}} in his father's footsteps {{by winning the}} IndyCar title, with Mario's nephew John Andretti joining the series in 1988. This meant that the Andrettis became <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>family</b> to have four relatives compete in the same series. With Mario sharing driving duties with sons Michael and Jeff at the 1991 Rolex 24 at Daytona, driving a Porsche 962, the Andretti clan finished 5th. Mario's grandson Marco completed his first full season in the Indy Racing League (IRL) in 2006, driving for his father Michael's Andretti Green Racing team. Marco {{finished second in the}} 2006 Indianapolis 500 and so became the first third-generation recipient of the race's Rookie of the Year Award.|$|E
5|$|Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre in San Jose, California, was {{the first}} {{location}} to open on May 17, 1977. The concept was authored by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, credited with bringing video games such as Pong to the mainstream. The Pizza Time Theatre was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>family</b> restaurant to integrate food, animated entertainment, and an indoor arcade. Following a filing for bankruptcy, the chain was acquired by competitor Showbiz Pizza Place in 1984, forming Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc. In 1990, the company began unifying the two brands {{with the goal of}} renaming every location to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza. They redesigned the logo in 1994, dropping Pizza from each store's name. In 1998, Showbiz Pizza Time, Inc. became CEC Entertainment, Inc. As of 2017, 523 Chuck E. Cheese stores are open.|$|E
5|$|If two of {{the three}} given circles do not intersect, a center of {{inversion}} can be chosen so that those two given circles become concentric. Under this inversion, the solution circles must fall within the annulus between the two concentric circles. Therefore, they belong to two one-parameter families. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>family</b> (Figure7), the solutions do not enclose the inner concentric circle, but rather revolve like ball bearings in the annulus. In the second family (Figure8), the solution circles enclose the inner concentric circle. There are generally four solutions for each family, yielding eight possible solutions, consistent with the algebraic solution.|$|E

5|$|During the deportations, {{he tried}} to secure more work permits from the Germans but they refused to issue them. He {{attempted}} to protect those he could. During the Aktion on 3–5 November, in which the paperwork of everyone in the ghetto was checked, holders of work passes– which allowed the holder to protect a spouse and only two children under 16– were checked and anyone not listed on someone's work permit was sent to Ponary. At one point, while Gens was checking permits, a family with three children went through the checkpoint, and Gens pulled aside the third child. Shortly afterwards, a family with only one child passed through the checkpoint. Gens began berating the father for losing track of his second child, and pushed the third child from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>family</b> into the second family.

5|$|There {{have been}} six {{official}} residences of Indiana's governors since Indiana became a state, but only five were actually inhabited by <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>family.</b> There were four other unofficial residences that governors also lived in while no other accommodations were available. The first residence {{of a state}} governor was in Corydon on a small hill overlooking the first statehouse; Governor Jonathan Jennings and his wife Anne lived in it from 1816 until 1822. The home was visited by United States Presidents Andrew Jackson and James Monroe. The building is no longer standing but a new home has been built upon its original foundation and uses its cellar as a basement. Governor William Hendricks also lived in Corydon at Governor Hendricks Headquarters, an unofficial residence purchased by Hendricks from Davis Floyd and located on the same block as Jennings' home. Floyd had built the home for himself, but lost it after the Panic of 1819. Hendricks lived there during his term as governor, from 18221825, and later sold it.|$|E
