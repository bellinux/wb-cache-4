30|$|After the <b>template</b> <b>frame</b> is constructed, {{detecting}} all {{the transition}} effects for locating slow-motion replays {{can be done}} effectively. One possible way is to generate the processing units by the similar procedures in the template training phase, that is, some refined processing units are extracted, and their DC frames are compared with the <b>template</b> <b>frame</b> based on the similarity of colors and masks. Nevertheless, the misses of detecting the effects may occur. In order to find all the transition effects related to the slow-motion replays, we choose a rather conservative way by matching the frames near the detected scene-change frames with the template. Because the number of scene changes is large in a video, we employ the intra-coding rate of P frames to reduce such cases of matching. According to Figure 5, the intra-coding rate in a P frame is usually quite high. Therefore, when we construct the template of the transition effect in this video, we also calculate {{the average of the}} largest intra-coding rate in the effect and scale this value by a factor (0.7) as the threshold. Given a scene-change frame, we check the intra coding rates of P frames in around 2 seconds’ span. If the intra-coding rate of P frame is higher than this threshold, the matching of these DC frames with the <b>template</b> <b>frame</b> will be done to determine whether a transition effect happens here. This method can effectively avoid skipping the possible transition effects and an efficient implementation can also be achieved. Again, the matching is basically executed by comparing the luminance values of pixels covering the effect in the <b>template</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E

We used a <b>template</b> <b>frame</b> of NGC 3190 taken {{during the course of}} our galaxy imaging project, fortunately, just a few days before SN 2002 bo was discovered. The aim of this project is to collect template frames of nearby galaxies that are potential hosts of bright SNe. Subtraction of pre-SN images helped us to exclude the background light contamination of the host galaxy. The maximum occurred at JD 2452346, with maximal V brightness of 13. 58. MLCS analysis led to T 0 (B) =JD 2452346. 1 pm 0. 8 (fiducial B-maximum), E(B-V) = 0. 24 pm 0. 02, mu 0 = 32. 46 pm 0. 06, Delta=- 0. 14 pm 0. 04. E(B-V) = 0. 24 (2) indicates a significant extinction in the host galaxy as the galactic reddening is negligible toward NGC 3190. The accepted value of Delta indicates that SN 2002 bo was a slightly overluminous SN by about 0. 14 relative to fiducial SN Type Ia. The distance turned out to be 31. 0 pm 3 Mpc. In addition, the heavily obscured SN 2002 cv was also detected on the I frame taken on JD 2452434 (June 8, 2002), and a variable star is found in the field, very close to the host galaxy.

40|$|Many {{real-time}} multiprocessor scheduling {{techniques have}} been proposed to guarantee the timely execution of periodic preemptive real-time tasks.

We therefore address the problem of multiprocessor scheduling for preemptive real-time tasks so that the timeliness of the system can be guaranteed even in the presence of faults. This work focuses on global scheduling where tasks can migrate across processors. We consider two varieties of global multiprocessor scheduling: in the frame-based model, an aperiodic task set is scheduled to create a <b>template</b> (<b>frame),</b> and that schedule may be executed periodically. In the periodic model, each task in the set has a separate period, and is executed with no explicitly predetermined schedule.

Among all of them, the time warped speech signal matching is of great interest {{and has been a}} tough challenge for the researchers. The literature contains a variety of techniques to measure the similarity between speech utterances, however there are some limitations associated with these techniques. This paper introduces an adaptive framing based continuous speech tracking and similarity measurement approach that uses a Kalman filter (KF) as a robust tracker. The use of KF is novel for time warped speech signal matching and dynamic time warping. A dynamic state model is presented based on equations of linear motion. In this model, fixed length frame of input (test) speech signal is considered as a unidirectional moving object by sliding it along the template speech signal. The best matched position estimate in template speech (sample number) for corresponding test frame at current time is calculated. Simultaneously, another position observation is produced by a feature based distance metric. The position estimated by the state model is fused with the observation using KF along with the noise variances. The best estimated frame position in the template speech for the current state is calculated. Finally, forecasting of the noise variances and <b>template</b> <b>frame</b> size for next state are made according to the KF output. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed technique in terms of time warped speech signal matching as well as in computation cost...|$|E
30|$|Some {{comments}} about our experiments are as follows: The detections of transition effects can provide us the video segments of interest, which have more unified structures, {{so we can}} use low-level or MPEG-domain features for the effective content classification. Our research objective is to design a practical highlight extraction scheme for digital video recorders so we still prefer to adopt the compressed-domain approach and employ the transition effect detection to exclude less possible data from processing. If the restrictions of complexity/cost are a bit relaxed, we may choose to expand/decode some frames and make use of high-level features to improve the performance of our content classification. The other concern is the several empirically set thresholds, which may be affected by such factors as bit rates and resolutions of videos. The problem may become less serious if the manufacturer can test many videos, probably with different levels of compression, recorded by this specific video recorder to decide suitable thresholds. In addition, since the same transition effect will appear repeatedly in the recorded video, the methodology of majority voting is quite effective. We may also adjust the thresholds during the training process {{to ensure that a}} template can be successfully made. Nevertheless, commercials have to be excluded from the training process because the same commercial may also appear several times. These commercials may not cause problems in the detection phase though. Finally, there exists a trade-off between execution speed and accuracy. To avoid missing the detections of effects, we may select more candidate frames for testing with the cost of more computation. The same issue exists in the template construction. The more processing units are considered when constructing the template, the better quality the <b>template</b> <b>frame</b> will be and the more execution time will be expected. The major drawback of this work is that our scheme only works on the sports videos with transition effects, although we think that the usage of transition effects is a trend in sportscast nowadays.|$|E

30|$|So far we {{have shown}} that {{representing}} the <b>template</b> <b>frames</b> by GMMs and using the local distance measures of LLR or KL significantly improved the accuracy performance over our HMM baselines, and the proposed methods are much {{more effective than the}} conventional template matching methods where the <b>template</b> <b>frames</b> use the original speech features. A question naturally arises is how would the proposed template-matching methods interact with an underlying acoustic model from which the GMMs are derived and the phone or word lattices are generated, and of particular interest is that as a baseline HMM system improves, whether the performance gain we have observed by the proposed template matching methods can still hold. This is a relevant issue since a baseline HMM system can be improved by using more advanced training methods and better features. Recently, a major advance has been made in using deep neural networks (DNNs) with many hidden layers for speech acoustic modeling, where the resulting DNNs learn a hierarchy of nonlinear feature detectors that can capture complex statistical patterns for speech data. For example, context-independent, pre-trained DNN/HMM hybrid architectures have achieved competitive performance in TIMIT phone recognition [38], context-dependent DNN/HMM has led to large improvements to several public domain large speech recognition tasks [39], and dumping features from deep convolutional neural networks to train GMM/HMM-based systems achieved higher accuracy performance than DNN/HMM hybrid architectures in several tasks [40].|$|R

The 3 D {{real-time}} terrain rendering over a {{large scale}} of mission area {{is crucial to the}} military applications such as mission flight simulation, flight training simulation, and situational GIS, etc. In this paper, we propose two processes to enhance the real-time processing. One is a fast view frustum culling based on the quad-cell bounding box and the dynamic allocation. This approach, what we call a “IP:Intersection Polygon”, utilizes terrain data property which is a skewed 3 D, and significantly reduces the computation time for identifying the terrain cells which are likely to contribute to the rendered scene, while maintaining the accuracy similar to existing methods. The other is a continuous levels of detail(CloD) to handle the out-of-core elevation data and ortho-rectified images as texture. We extend the existing in-core method to memory-efficient out-of-core with geo-morphing which has no cracks and negligible waving popping. The proposed processes are performed with the consistent hierarchical quadtree and predictive cell fetching according to priority that helps down the resolution. We also make TERRAN more promising by incorporating techniques like multi-threads, texture <b>templates,</b> and <b>frame</b> regulations, which greatly affect the smooth rendering.

30|$|Relative to the above-discussed efforts, our {{approach}} as {{proposed in the}} current work falls into the hybrid category, but our integration of statistical modeling and template representation and matching are tighter, since we not only rescore the lattices generated by the HMM baseline, but we also use the baseline phonetic decision tree (PDT) structures to define the tied triphone templates, representing the <b>template</b> <b>frames</b> by the GMMs and using the LLR and KL distances to measure the differences of speech frames represented in this way. In the aspect of reducing computation and memory costs, we absorb the training data information into template representatives through clustering and estimation, rather than selecting a subset of training data as the templates.

The Dynamic Time Warping algorithm (DTW) is the backâ€“bone of the newly developed algorithm called DTW fixing frame algorithm (DTWâ€“FF) {{which is designed to}} perform template matching for the input preprocessing.

The new method {{presented in this}} paper described how the LPC feature is extracted and those coefficients are normalized against the template pattern according to the selected average number of frames over the samples collected. The idea behind this method is due to neural network (NN) limitation where a fixed amount of input nodes is needed for every input class especially in the application of multiple inputs. The new feature processing used the modified version of traditional DTW called as DTW-FF algorithm to fix the input size so that the source and <b>template</b> <b>frames</b> have equal number of frames. Then the DTW-FF coefficients are retained and later being used as inputs into the MLP neural network training and testing.

The speaker recognition is performed using the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm to enhance the recognition performance. The results compare DTW using LPC coefficients to BPNN with DTW-FF coefficients; BPNN with DTW-FF coefficients shows a higher recognition rate than DTW with LPC coefficients. The last task is to introduce another input feature into the neural network, namely pitch.

We try here to address this extremely large question by focusing on one particular element of imaginary creations, the specific case of human-animal hybrids. Human-animal hybrids are common inhabitants of human imaginary spaces, being regularly encountered across numerous mythologies, {{as well as in}} modern popular culture. If human imagination was unconstrained, it would be expected that such hybrid creatures would display roughly half human and half animalistic features. Using several different popular science fiction and fantasy settings, we conducted an analysis of the morphological traits of human-animal hybrids, both anatomical and phenotypic. Surprisingly, we observed extremely high conservation of human morphological traits in human-animal hybrids, with a contrasting high use of phenotypic (“cosmetic”) alterations, and with highly stereotyped patterns of morphological alterations. While these alterations were independent of the setting considered, shape alterations were setting-dependent and used as a way to increase internal coherence. Finally, important gender differences were observed, as female human-animal hybrids retained significantly more human traits than males did, suggesting that conservation of female appearance may bear essential evolutionary importance. Taken together, these results demonstrate the existence of strong cognitive <b>templates</b> which <b>frame</b> and limit the expression of the capacity of human imagination, and unveil some of the psychological mechanisms which constrain the emergence of imaginary spaces. </p...|$|R
