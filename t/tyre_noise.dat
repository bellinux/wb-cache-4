40|$|Increasing {{competition}} has set {{pressure on the}} product development process to reduce development time and costs. Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) {{has been used to}} decrease development times by facilitating early predictions of product performances and qualities. Especially in early phases of product development, models with sufficient accuracy can provide valuable decision supports in order to pass legislations and fulfill customer expectations. Acoustic performance and sound quality are essential parts of the perceived product functionality and quality. A powerful method in product sound development is to combine recordings and simulations into auralizations. Interior vehicle noise {{is an important factor in}} the perceived product quality where <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> is a dominant source. The objective of this licentiate thesis was to lay the foundation for an auralization model of interior <b>tyre</b> <b>noise.</b> The aim of the model is to use the results from for example FEM simulations of tyre/road interaction and filter it through experimentally measured transfer functions into the cabin of the car. By varying compounds, components and road profiles in simulations, <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> can be auralized in different cars in an early design phase. <b>Tyre</b> <b>noise</b> predictions and auralizations are relevant both in tyre and car development. The vibrations generated by the tyre/road interaction are transferred through the hubs of the car and into the cabin as structure borne sound. The hub acts as the coupling element and describes the boundary condition for the rim. In paper I, the mechanical mobility of a hub was measured in 6 -DOF. Measurement results showed good multiple coherences, reciprocities and low random errors in the frequency range 0 - 300 Hz. The measured mobilities will be used to transform operational forces and moments into velocities and will be implemented as boundary conditions in FEM simulations. For auralizations of the air-borne <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> contribution, knowledge of the required accuracy in positioning of sources and receivers is essential. In Paper II, variations in perceived sound caused by displacements of source and listening positions were assessed to find the smallest displacement giving a just audible differences. In addition, binaural transmissibility functions were measured from a loudspeaker near a wheel to an artificial head inside the car. Results showed that the accuracy in the positioning of the source and the receiver needed to be smaller than 2 cm to avoid audible differences. In order to generalize auralizations of interior <b>tyre</b> <b>noise,</b> audible variations in specimens of nominally identical products need to be known. In Paper III, variations in perceived interior sound between tyres of different brands and specimens of nominally identical cars were assessed. The differences between five nominally identical cars were found to be two to three times larger than the difference between two tyre modelsGodkänd; 2011; 20110511 (lofmag); LICENTIATSEMINARIUM Ämnesområde: Teknisk akustik/Engineering Acoustics Examinator: Professor Anders Ågren, Institutionen för ekonomi, teknik och samhälle, Luleå tekniska universitet Diskutant: Professor Jan-Olov Aidanpää, Institutionen för teknikvetenskap och matematik, Luleå tekniska universitet Tid: Tisdag den 14 juni 2011 kl 13. 00 Plats: F 341, Luleå tekniska universitetCASTT - Centre for Automotive Systems Technologies and Testin...|$|E

40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} noise regulations concerning automotive vehicles {{particularly in}} Europe are forcing Tyre manufacturers {{as well as}} the automotive manufacturers to reduce radiated noise. With the future moving towards electric/hybrid vehicles, the ever present <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> will become more dominant. Even in the case of automotive engines running on fossil fuels, <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> dominates above speeds of 40 Km/h. Understanding the causes of <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> is the first step towards finding engineering solutions to reduce it. Numerical modelling can help the tyre engineer in understanding the causes of tyre-road noise with a design tool. In the present work, the noise radiated by the tyre surface is computed numerically using three different computational techniques. Both the time domain approach and the frequency domain approaches are used and the results are compared. The input structural vibrations are computed in ABAQUS (Ref. 1) and the results are then imported to LMSVirtual. Lab (Ref. 2) for further acoustic computations. As the main focus of this work is on the acoustic computations, only {{a brief description of the}} process involved in the structural vibration calculations is provided. In the present work, the “Horn effect” is inherently captured in the acoustic simulations. Two model tyres, viz., with tread pattern and with circumferential grooves is evaluated. The presence of tread leads to the phenomenon of stick slip and stick snap mechanisms contributing to the overall <b>tyre</b> <b>noise.</b> In addition, the motion of air through the grooves causes air pumping noise. It is to be noted that the structural vibration computations were performed on a rotating tyre that translated on a stationary road. In other words, the tyre underwent rotational as well as translational displacement. The acoustic computations are however performed on a stationary tyre model. One of the challenges addressed in the present work is the conversion of transient vibration results on a stationary acoustic mesh. The surface accelerations, required as boundary conditions, are converted to the frequency domain by the Fast Fourier Transformation for the Harmonic computations. The details of the structural models {{as well as the}} acoustic models and a short description of the techniques used in the computations of the radiated noise are described in the next section...|$|E

40|$|The regular {{tyre tread}} pattern design process is often based upon {{experience}} and experimental evaluations and may take about 2 years. The use of engineering tooling could improve and speed up this process. The research objective is therefore to develop experimental and simulation tooling by which interior <b>tyre</b> tread pattern <b>noise</b> can be predicted, analysed and optimized. The physics of tyre-road noise is {{explained in a}} comprehensive manner as {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics is needed to evaluate, measure, analyse or optimize tyres with respect to noise. The first engineering tool developed is an instrumented vehicle with dedicated measurement and processing technologies, enabling quantification of the terminology used in subjective evaluations of tyre-road noise. The three most important <b>tyre</b> tread pattern <b>noise</b> characteristics are: level, tonalness and modulation/drumming. They can be quantified, respectively, by the Sound Pressure Level, the so-called order spectrum and the (bandpass filtered) sound pressure variation during one tyre revolution. While rolling on smooth roads, the tyre tread pattern geometry in the tyre-road contact is considered to be the main origin of contact pressure variations, resulting in vibrations and noise. The second engineering tool is a simulation procedure of this source. In the new source modelling approach, the averaged tread pattern height in contact is calculated. The model predicts (R 2 = 0. 76) the correct trends of the three <b>tyre</b> tread pattern <b>noise</b> characteristics, by using the trend of their geometrical cause. The model can be used to reduce exterior as well as interior <b>tyre</b> tread pattern <b>noise.</b> From these <b>tyre</b> tread pattern <b>noise</b> characteristics dedicated Sound Quality Metrics are defined: for level the Standard Deviation (STD), for tonalness the Order Prominence (OP) and for modulation the Multi-Order Modulation (MOM). They correspond very well (respectively R 2 = 0. 96, 0. 60 and 0. 80) with the human perception of the noise characteristics. An increase in each of the metrics results in a worse subjective perception of the <b>tyre</b> tread pattern <b>noise.</b> The metrics are applicable for measured and simulated sounds. In the third engineering tool the three metrics are combined to model the human percpetion of <b>tyre</b> tread patternn <b>noise.</b> The human perception model is obtained through a linear regression of these tyre related Sound Quality Metrics on the subjective rating of simulated sounds. The output of the model is called the Sound Quality Preference Index (SQPI) predicting the human perception of tyre tread pattern sounds correctly (R 2 = 0. 94).

40|$|Reduction of the {{transportation}} noise nuisance has become an important challenge in today's societies. As a consequence of engine noise reduction, tyre / road contact noise is now {{the main source of}} traffic noise under normal driving conditions. In this respect, the aim of the present work is to understand and to control the mechanisms of tyre radiation by designing accurate tools to predict the <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> radiation over arbitrary impedance surfaces. Tyre radiation is modelled using the Equivalent Sources method. Besides low frequency limitations because of two [...] dimensional simplifications, this model is proved to be an accurate tool for predicting <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> over acoustically rigid surfaces. Ground effects induced by absorbing surfaces are only approximated. Therefore, a model for the propagation of sound due to an arbitrary order source over an arbitrary impedance plane is developed. It is mainly an alternative to integral equation methods. In addition, the exact solution to this problem is presented. Based on the two previous models, an iterative model of the tyre radiation over arbitrary impedance surfaces is implemented. Comparison with horn effect sound amplification indicate that this model is accurate for homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous absorbing surfaces. Using this model, trends for the tyre radiation over absorbing surfaces are discussed in a parametrical study. The work presented in this thesis gives further insights into the mechanisms of tyre / road noise radiation; furthermore, it allows to study the possibilities of reducing traffic noise by the use of so [...] called "low [...] noise" road surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{produced}} from the tyre - road surface interface {{is one of}} the most important contributions to the overall traffic noise, and there is an increasing requirement for predicting the trye - road noise leaves prior to road construction in the Netherlands.

Based on these considerations, models are developed for evaluating the <b>tyre</b> - road <b>noise</b> from the asphalt mixture compositions and road surface characteristics. They are statistical models developed from the measurements on thin layer surfacings in the Netherlands. Different regression methods, model types and input variable combinations are taken into account. The selection of the model is due to the fitness of the prediction and validation by using measurement data from in service road sections.

By using these models, only a small number of input variables are required and liable predictions can be provided.

40|$|Noise levels due to {{road traffic}} have reached {{intolerable}} high levels {{in and around}} many urban areas all around the world. Because of health reasons and reasons of well- being these noise levels have to be reduced. The noise produced from {{the interaction between the}} rolling tyre and road surface {{is one of the most}} important contributions in the overall traffic noise. Therefore solutions for noise level reduction have to be found in that interface. A noise reducing pavement is considered as an effective way to reduce the <b>tyre</b> - road <b>noise</b> from the source where it generates. Towards further understanding and improvement of the noise reduction ability of pavements, research was carried out in this PhD thesis to determine the relationship between the road material properties, surface characteristics and the noise levels, and to develop models which can be used for guiding the design of noise reducing pavements. As one of existing road surfaces, the thin layer surfacing eliminates the <b>tyre</b> - road <b>noise</b> by combining a small surface texture and a high porosity. In recent years, it became popular for using it on urban and provincial road sections in the Netherlands and some other European countries. Replacing porous asphalt with thin layer surfacings on highways is also considered an option in the Netherlands. As there are limited investigations on the relation between <b>tyre</b> - road <b>noise</b> and the influencing parameters for this type of surface, the research in this thesis focuses on thin layer surfacings. The study starts with a review of existing researches on <b>tyre</b> - road <b>noise.</b> It provides basic knowledge about <b>tyre</b> - road <b>noise</b> and the influencing parameters related to the road surface. The related measurement methods and models developed were summarized. Comments were made on these existing studies and the shortcomings were pointed out. A research plan was then proposed based on the comments of the current researches and aiming for improving the existing knowledge of <b>tyre</b> - road <b>noise</b> on thin layer surfacings. Measurements were carried out for investigating the influence of mixture compositions on surface characteristics. Both laboratory and in-situ measurements were involved. In the laboratory tests, thin layer surfacing samples with different mixture compositions were designed and produced; core samples were also used which were drilled from trial road sections in the Netherlands. The surface characteristics studied included: surface texture, sound absorption, mechanical impedance and stiffness. Methods for testing the surface characteristics and mixture compositions were discussed. Experimental work was also undertaken for developing new methods in testing the surface characteristics. A contribution of this thesis to <b>tyre</b> - road <b>noise</b> related measurement is the application of a new type of technology for measuring the sound absorption of a road surface. It is based on testing the sound pressure and sound particle velocity close to the sample surface. According to the analysis of the test results, this measurement method proved to provide reliable results of sound absorption for road surface samples. Furthermore, suggestions were given for the application of the method in road engineering measurements. Surface characteristics and mixture compositions of thin layer surfacings were then measured. The influence of the material properties on surface characteristics, including texture, sound absorption, mechanical impedance and stiffness, were observed based by comparing test results obtained on materials with different mixture compositions. Moreover, in the study, the degree of connectivity of air voids in the road surface sample was determined. A relationship between the mechanical impedance and stiffness of road surface material was also developed. Comments were given for noise reduction by taking into account the mechanical impedance of road surfaces. The investigation of the effect of surface characteristics on <b>tyre</b> - road <b>noise</b> was performed by means of statistical analyses. Data used in the analysis were from thin layer surfacing sections in the Netherlands. The two important surface characteristics, surface texture and sound absorption were taken in to account. Correlation analysis and linear regression analysis were adopted for observing the relationship between the surface characteristics and noise levels. The individual effect of a certain surface characteristic can be reflected by the regression equations. Furthermore, the influence of driving speed of the vehicle, the tyre types and small changes of surface characteristics were also discussed. In the end, a model which predicts the <b>tyre</b> - road <b>noise</b> levels for thin layer surfacings was developed. The model was built by means of regression analysis by using the data from the laboratory measurements and an existing database. With the model, noise levels can be predicted using a small number of input parameters of material properties or surface characteristics. The model was validated by using data from in service thin layer road surfaces. The model can be used for predicting noise levels and helps to improve the design of noise reducing surfaces.

40|$|Introduction: Environmental noise {{pollution}} {{is an important}} issue that affects health and quality of life of millions of people in the modern world. One of the main sources of environmental {{noise pollution}} is the noise generated by road traffic. To reduce road traffic noise, the automotive industry has done a great deal of research and development in the recent decades. As a result of these efforts, such earlier important contributors to the overall automotive noise, as powertrain and exhaust noise, have been reduced considerably for nearly all driving conditions, so that the dominant contributor has become tyre/road noise. According to the tyre/road noise reference book written by Sandberg and Ejsmont, there are two different groups of generation mechanisms for tyre/road noise: (i) tyre vibrations; and (ii) aerodynamical effects in or around the tyre. In contrast to noise generated by tyre vibrations, the aerodynamical mechanisms of <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> generation have received relatively little attention in the past. Therefore, the main aim of the research reported in this paper was to undertake comprehensive experimental investigations of aerodynamically related mechanisms of tyre/road noise...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{improvements}} in combustion engines and electric engines for cars, <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> {{has become the}} prominent noise source at low and medium speeds. Models exist that simulate the noise produced by a rolling tyre, as do models that auralize specific traffic situations from a basic data set. A model that combines both could assist in the planning stage of a tyre by delivering not only estimates of the physical behaviour of the tyre, but also by further making the resulting sound perceivable. Further, such a model could help to design acoustic traffic situations with full control of all parameters. Focusing on that, this thesis has three aims. All {{focus is on the}} perception of the sound of a car from the outside, perceived by, for example, a pedestrian.  The first aim is to combine an established model for <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> (SPERoN) with an auralization tool. The combined model can predict the spectrum of a car pass-by at 7. 5 m, as well as reproduce the sound at a given listener position.  Psychoacoustic judgements are used to compare the modelled signals with recorded signals.  It was found that responses for simulated and recorded signals correlated for all cases, but the ranked orders differed slightly.  The second aim focuses on the perception of tyre–road noise and whether it can be differentiated and characterized by its perceptual qualities. When designing tyre sounds, the main aim should be to increase the pleasantness of the total vehicle sound while maintaining the carried information and reducing the sound level. Achieving this requires an understanding of how physical changes in a tyre are reflected in the perception of that tyre.  Listeners were asked to judge different tyre–road combinations and their perception in terms of their emotional and psychoacoustic responses. The results confirmed that rolling noise can be perceptually differentiated.  The third aim in this thesis was to increase understanding of the parameters that influence the detection of a single car in background traffic noise. For this, both variations in the sound of the test car and in the background (e. g. distance, traffic amount, speed, tyre/engine noise) were investigated and found to influence the reaction time. The introduced auralization method was utilized to generate the sound files for the different traffic situations. <br /...|$|E

In this paper, a measurement technique is described with which {{it is possible to}} perform in situ sound absorption measurements for oblique incidence. The measurements are performed with a small microphone array, the 8 p-probe, and the theory is based on the local plane wave assumption. In this paper, an approach is proposed to determine whether a surface behaves as a locally reacting surface or a nonlocally reacting surface, which is an important characteristic for optimising asphalt pavements for noise reduction and for modelling techniques. Measurements at various angles of incidence are performed to demonstrate this approach as well as measurements of the absorption coefficient at normal incidence to validate the 8 p-probe with impedance tube measurements...|$|R
40|$|Road {{traffic noise}} {{is one of}} the major {{environmental}} noise sources that is known to cause health problems. Despite existing noise reception items, the continuing growth of traffic causes higher levels than the lims allow. Consequently, excessive costs are incurred for noise barriers along roads and motorways. It's therefore essential to investigate the options for noise abatement at the source. Road traffic noise emission has been measured at two sites in the Netherlands in order to obtain operational and statistical data during a 24 -hour period. These measurements allowed to determine the contribution of various vehicle groups to the L DEN and to examine these in more detail. The results confirm that at some motorway locations, heavy trucks can have a dominant contribution to he L DEN. It was also found that not only <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> but also powertrain noise from the exhaust, engine and transmission can contribute significantly at around 80 km/h. New tools allow to evaluate the causes of the higher noise contribution from particular vehicle groups in normal road conditions. Not only the nominal emission from the ype est and the vehicle speed of heavy vehicles are relevant, but also the maintenance condition...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{improvements}} on combustion-engines and electric-engines for cars, <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> {{has become}} the prominent noise source at low and medium speeds. Models exist that simulate the noise produced by a rolling tyre, as do models that auralize different traffic situations from a basic data set. When constructing a tyre it is of interest if improvements and planned changes are not only physically measurable, but that they also can be perceived. Focussing on that, two aims were followed in this thesis. The first aim was to combine an established model for <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> (SPERoN) with an auralization tool. The combined model can predict the spectrum of the sound at 7. 5 m, as well as reproduce the sound for a given listener position. The auralization uses a methodology where recorded sounds are converted to source signals for engine and tyre/road-interaction. These can be shaped by the spectra estimated in SPERoN and synthesized back into a pass-by signal. Psychoacoustic judgements were {{used to compare the}} modelled signals with recorded signals. To see how well the modelled signals match the real recorded signals for perception, two listening-tests were performed. The simulated and recorded signals were rated by pleasantness, loudness, roughness and sharpness using semantic differentials. It was found that responses for simulated and recorded signals correlate for all cases, but rankings could not be reproduced exactly. The model can be further improved to be more applicable for listening tests. The model has been optimized after a first validation. The second aim laid focus on the perception of tyre/road noise. When designing tyre sounds, the main aim should be to increase the pleasantness of the total vehicle sound while maintaining the carried information and reducing the sound level. To {{be able to do this}} an understanding of how physical changes in a tyre are reflected in the perception of the same tyre is essential. Thus, the second aim was to see if the rolling noise of a tyre can be both differentiated and characterized by its perceptual qualities. The focus is on the perception of the sound outside the car, perceived by for example a pedestrian. Listeners have judged different road tyre combinations and their perception in terms of their emotional responses (pleasantness, activation and stress) and their psychoacoustic responses (loudness, sharpness, roughness, and pitch). The results confirmed that rolling noise can be perceptually differentiated. It is further possible to differentiate between the effects of the street and the effects of the tyre on all emotional and most psychoacoustic parameters. The results suggest that changes to road surfaces or tyres can affect both emotional and psychoacoustic perceptual qualities...|$|E
40|$|Noise from motorbikes and scooters is a {{specific}} problem that mostly affects cities with small streets and mostly in the South of Europe. The motorbikes and scooters are badly perceived by citizens if they circulate during nighttimes, since they cause annoyance and even awakenings. Within {{the framework of the}} IMAGINE European project, some measurement campaigns were performed to gather data on the noise emitted by different types of motorbikes and scooters or mopeds, both at constant speed and during acceleration. This article presents the averaged trends of noise values recorded, as a function of speed, acceleration and vehicle type. The relationship between noise and twowheeler speed differs from that of a car, mostly because <b>tyre</b> <b>noise</b> is not relevant and because the engines run at high regimes (rpm) even at low speed. The HARMONOISE vehicle categorisation was adopted, but for scooters and mopeds more categories were used, to consider e. g., quad on one side and more common two-wheelers on the other. Data presented are useful to be put into a calculation model that considers scooters and motorbikes separately from other road vehicles, and it is mostly suitable for the HARMONOISE model for which these data were on purpose collected.

40|$|Current Swiss policy {{aiming to}} reduce the {{environmental}} footprint of heavy vehicles is presented. The environmental footprint of 46 heavy vehicle cases defined as dynamic load, noise, vibration and gaseous emissions is measured based on criteria set by the European project Eureka Logchain footprint. These parameters were measured for freight vehicles selected from the traffic stream and were compared to the criteria set up {{as a result of}} current Swiss policy. Results show that parameters that are currently controlled and their reduction encouraged such as gaseous emissions, axle loads and gross weight are indeed below or close to acceptable limits. However, other important parameters such as <b>tyre</b> pressure and <b>noise</b> remain higher than acceptable limits. In order to encourage the operation of vehicles with a low total environmental footprint parameters need to be set and controlled systematically.

40|$|Adhesion forces {{influence}} the automotive tyre / road surface contact for certain tyre / road combinations, leading to enhanced rolling resistance, <b>tyre</b> vibrations, and <b>noise</b> excitation. A model {{was developed to}} predict the contact force and noise generation for hastily separation of two macroscopic objects. The model is formulated in the time domain for two elastic bodies in non-linear dynamic contact. The contact area is spatially discretised in contact points and the dynamic response is calculated convolving the contact forces with pre-calculated impulse responses of the interacting objects. The adhesion forces are included allowing negative forces through the contacts, which break at a given condition; at a critical force in its simplest form. Parameters on a micro-scale influencing this condition are discussed. Time records of contact forces and sound pressures as samples of tyre tread are hastily separated from road surfaces samples were acquired. A qualitative comparison between calculated and measured data demonstrates the feasibility of the model...|$|R
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} noise {{reduction}} system {{for use in}} high noise environments such as motor racing. First, {{an analysis of the}} audio data received from the driver reveals that the main noise sources are from the engine, airflow and tyres. These are found to relate to engine speed, road speed and throttle position information that is received in a data stream from the car's on-board computer. A two-stage noise compensation strategy is proposed which first suppresses engine harmonics using adaptive filtering with engine speed reference information taken from the data stream. Second, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) prediction of the <b>tyre</b> and airflow <b>noise</b> is made from data stream values and this is combined with spectral subtraction for noise suppression. Human listening tests reveal that both noise reduction stages lead to good improvements in the intelligibility of the speech with a comparative mean opinion score (CMOS) of + 1. 57 being obtaine...|$|R
