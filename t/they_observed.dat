However, McCabe’s friend and former teammate Fingleton, now a journalist, criticised the Australian team for not wearing black armbands.|$|E
5|$|On October27, the S/V Fantome, a schooner, last {{reported}} {{its location}} {{to the south}} of Guanaja, while trying to escape the brunt of the storm.

5|$|The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) {{announced}} in 2010 that a biodiversity study from 2009 {{in the gallery}} forest of Ranobe near Toliara in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown to science, and possibly a new species. They noted {{a significant difference in}} coloration between the two known species and the specimen <b>they</b> <b>observed.</b> However, further testing was required to confirm the discovery.|$|E

5|$|The program {{suggests}} that the reaction time of state-run television crews and police on Tiananmen Square demonstrates they had advance knowledge of the event. <b>They</b> <b>observed</b> that officers arrived almost immediately on the scene equipped with numerous fire extinguishers.

5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, <b>they</b> <b>observed</b> that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E

5|$|Between 4:45 and 5:00 pm, {{a number}} of people in the area of Winona, Minnesota, were observing a {{thunderstorm}} approaching from the northwest. These people told the Civil Aeronautics Board that the storm was increasing in intensity, and <b>they</b> <b>observed</b> increasing amounts of thunder and lightning. The aircraft continued on course in the direction of Winona, where it encountered the thunderstorm. The aircraft was seen flying below the clouds before entering the roll cloud, or leading edge of the thunderstorm. This was the last reported sighting of the aircraft; seconds later, local observers saw pieces of the aircraft falling from the sky.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the beds are folded and faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. This {{was one of the}} first areas in the world to undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. <b>They</b> <b>observed</b> the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith to the creation of a testable hypothesis, which he termed the Principle of Faunal Succession.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, Governor Shelby {{called for}} volunteers {{to serve in}} the Army of the Northwest. Colonel John Allen raised a regiment, and Madison was {{commissioned}} as his second-in-command. The regiment, known as the 1st Rifle Regiment of Kentucky Volunteers, fought under James Winchester at the Battle of Frenchtown. Winchester was captured by General Henry Procter, but about four hundred men under Madison repelled several charges by the British. Madison's men believed they had won the victory when <b>they</b> <b>observed</b> a white flag {{in the midst of the}} British force, but the flag was being waved by Winchester as an order for Madison's force to surrender.|$|E

5|$|However, in a {{field study}} {{published}} in 1987, researchers Cristina Ramo and Benjamin Busto found evidence of interbreeding in a population where the ranges of the scarlet and white ibises overlap along the coast and in the Llanos region of Colombia and Venezuela. <b>They</b> <b>observed</b> individuals of the two species mating and pairing, as well as hybrid ibises with pale orange plumage, or white plumage with occasional orange feathers; their proposal that these birds be classified as a single species, has been followed by least one field guide. Hybrid ibises have also been recorded in Florida, where the scarlet ibis has been introduced into wild populations of American white ibis. Birds of intermediate to red plumage have persisted for generations.|$|E
5|$|In 1526, Portuguese ships {{arrived in}} Mangalore, {{and the number}} of local {{converts}} to Christianity slowly increased. However, a sizeable Christian population did not exist there until {{the second half of the}} 16th century, when there was a large-scale immigration of Christians from Goa to South Canara. They were reluctant to learn the local languages of South Canara and continued to speak Konkani, the language they brought from Goa, so that local Christians had to learn Konkani to converse with them. After this migration, the skilled Goan Catholic agriculturists were offered various land grants by the native Bednore rulers of South Canara. <b>They</b> <b>observed</b> their traditional Hindu customs in conjunction with the newfound Catholic practices, and preserved their lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|In February 1940, Glenn Seaborg and Edwin McMillan {{produced}} plutonium-239 {{through the}} bombardment of uranium. In their experiments bombarding uranium with deuterons, <b>they</b> <b>observed</b> {{the creation of}} neptunium, element 93, which then underwent beta-decay {{to form a new}} element, plutonium, with 94 protons. Kennedy built a series of detectors and counters to verify the presence of plutonium. He used mica sliced razor thin to produce a window to count alpha particle emissions, and ionization chamber with a magnetic field to separate the beta particles from the neptunium from alpha particles from the plutonium.|$|E

5|$|In time, the {{ineffectiveness}} of the CIP {{began to}} concern the Eisenhower administration, who {{were worried about}} the lack of industrialization. The corruption that permeated the initiative remained a problem. The rural peasants of Vietnam, who comprised more than 80% of the population, were unaffected by the aid package except for the resentment that it instilled in them when <b>they</b> <b>observed</b> the relative affluence of their city counterparts compared to their own impoverished state. However, the program was credited with transforming the textile industry, as 25,000 sewing machines were imported {{in the first year of}} its operation.|$|E
5|$|Rodin {{was born}} in 1840 into a working-class family in Paris, the second child of Marie Cheffer and Jean-Baptiste Rodin, who was a police {{department}} clerk. He was largely self-educated, and began to draw at age ten. Between ages 14 and 17, Rodin attended the Petite École, a school specializing in art and mathematics, where he studied drawing and painting. His drawing teacher, Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran, believed in first developing the personality of his students so that <b>they</b> <b>observed</b> with their own eyes and drew from their recollections. Rodin still expressed appreciation for his teacher much later in life. It was at Petite École that he first met Jules Dalou and Alphonse Legros.|$|E
5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that G-spot and clitoral orgasms are of the same origin. Masters and Johnson {{were the first to}} determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's sexual response cycle to different stimulation, <b>they</b> <b>observed</b> that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|E

5|$|The only Allied {{military}} forces at Tulagi were 24 commandos from the Australian Army's 2/1st Independent Company, under Captain A. L. Goode, and about 25 personnel from 11 Squadron RAAF, under F/O R. B. Peagam, operating a seaplane base on nearby Gavutu-Tanambogo with four PBY Catalina maritime patrol aircraft. Three Allied coastwatchers were also located nearby, on Guadalcanal island. The {{task of the}} coastwatchers was to report on any enemy movements, or suspicious activity, that <b>they</b> <b>observed</b> {{in the vicinity of}} their stations. In the belief that it might prevent them being executed for espionage, all of the coastwatchers were commissioned as Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve officers, and they were directed by Lieutenant Commander Eric Feldt, who was located at Townsville in Australia.|$|E
5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type of experiment. They made a model-size airfoil and a counter-acting flat plate, both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars. Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus, <b>they</b> <b>observed</b> that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E
5|$|When Rovio {{began writing}} new {{versions}} of the game for other devices, new issues came to light. As the team began working on a version for Android systems, <b>they</b> <b>observed</b> {{the large number of}} configurations of device types and {{versions of the}} Android software. The number of combinations of software version, processor speed and even user interfaces was significantly larger than that for the iOS version. Ultimately, the team settled on a minimum set of requirements, even though that left nearly 30 types of Android phones unable to run the game, including some newly released phones. It was released on October 15, 2010. One month after the initial release on Android, Rovio Mobile began designing a lite version of the game for these other devices.|$|E
