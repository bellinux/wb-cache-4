5|$|Burzahom's ceramic {{industry}} was mostly of hunting based culture and {{is different from}} the Chinese Neolithic pottery. The economy of the people was found to be based on hunting and gathering with a nascent stage of cultivation practices. Pottery made in Burzahom showed close affinity to <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in the Swat valley in Pakistan, particularly in respect of its shapes and decorations of the black ware pottery. The burial practices and type of tools recovered from the site were inferred as having close resemblance to <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in the North Chinese Neolithic culture.|$|E

40|$|Research {{methods that}} claim to use the {{scientific}} approach in design research can be grouped into three categories: <b>those</b> <b>founded</b> on empirical evidence of human designing activity; <b>those</b> <b>founded</b> on axioms and their derivations; and <b>those</b> <b>founded</b> on conjectures of potentially useful processes.

5|$|A {{number of}} these circles {{were built in the}} area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than <b>those</b> <b>found</b> elsewhere.

5|$|Ancient India, {{particularly}} the centuries {{in which the}} Mahavira and the Buddha lived, were one of intense intellectual debates, especially {{on the nature of}} reality and self or soul.

5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials similar to <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E
5|$|Building {{blocks of}} DNA (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) {{may have been}} formed extraterrestrially in outer space. Complex DNA and RNA organic {{compounds}} of life, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.|$|E

The highest medieval stone vault in England is at Westminster Abbey at , that at York Minster being of the same height but despite its appearance, not actually of stone, but wood.

5|$|Djungarian hamsters {{are common}} as pets in Europe and North America, and exhibit greater {{variance}} in their coats than <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in the wild. They reproduce often—more so than Syrian hamsters, {{and as they}} have no fixed breeding season, can continue to produce large numbers of offspring all year round. Young pups act aggressively to one another, while breeding females may show similar aggression to males.|$|E
5|$|DragonFly BSD {{supports}} Amiga-style resident applications feature: {{it takes}} a snapshot of a large, dynamically linked program's virtual memory space after loading, allowing future instances of the program to start {{much more quickly than}} it otherwise would have. This replaces the prelinking capability that was being worked on earlier in the project's history, as the resident support is much more efficient. Large programs like <b>those</b> <b>found</b> in KDE Software Compilation with many shared libraries will benefit the most from this support.|$|E
