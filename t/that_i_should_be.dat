She stated in the San Francisco Bay Review that Hal Turner 'announced to his listeners in 2006 <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> lynched {{on my way to}} vote.' Mr. Turner was on the FBI's payroll as an informant at the time.|$|E

What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself.|$|E

[...] Just to hear Zadok the Priest, I think, has lifted me to Cloud Nine, because it's something that I love. [...] And to hear that {{and to have the}} Queen pass so close to me. [...] And yes, she smiled. [...] She smiled at me.|$|E

500|$|My disgust at this {{proposition}} was, I think, chiefly due to Victor Hugo's latter novels, which I regard as pretentious and untrue to nature. To this perhaps was added some feeling of indignation <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{asked to give}} way to a Frenchman. The Frenchman had broken his engagement. He had failed to have his work finished by the stipulated time. From week to week and from month to month he had put off the fulfilment of his duty. And because of these laches on his part,— on the part of this sententious French Radical,— I was to be thrown over! ...|$|E
500|$|Those in the {{lifeboats}} were {{horrified to}} {{hear the sound of}} what Lawrence Beesley called [...] "every possible emotion of human fear, despair, agony, fierce resentment and blind anger mingled– I am certain of those– with notes of infinite surprise, as though each one were saying, 'How is it possible that this awful thing is happening to me? <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> caught in this death trap? Jack Thayer compared it to the sound of [...] "locusts on a summer night", while George Rheims, who jumped moments before Titanic sank, described it as [...] "a dismal moaning sound which I won't ever forget; it came from those poor people who were floating around, calling for help. It was horrifying, mysterious, supernatural." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{then went}} out on a rainy night and [...] "to make her clothes heavy with water, she {{walked up and down}} about half an hour" [...] before jumping into the River Thames, but a {{stranger}} saw her jump and rescued her. Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, {{which was one of the}} calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> dishonoured.|$|E

But in this work, {{as in all}} other, I had my temptations {{attending}} me, {{and that}} of divers kinds; as sometimes <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> assaulted with great discouragement therein, fearing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> able to speak a word at all to edification; nay, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> able to speak sense unto the people; at which times <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have such a strange faintness and strengthlessness seize upon my body, that my legs have scarce been able to carry me {{to the place of}} exercise.|$|R

500|$|... "Traditional" [...] {{accounts}} of Steinitz {{describe him as}} having a sharp tongue and violent temper, perhaps partly because of his short stature (barely five feet) and congenital lameness. He admitted that [...] "Like the Duke of Parma, I always hold the sword {{in one hand and}} the olive branch in the other", and under severe provocation he could become abusive in published articles. He was aware of his own tendencies and said early in his career, [...] "Nothing would induce me to take charge of a chess column ...Because I should be so fair in dispensing blame as well as praise <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> sure to give offence and make enemies." [...] When he embarked on chess journalism, his brutally frank review of Wormald's The Chess Openings in 1875 proved him right on both counts.|$|E
500|$|... "First and {{foremost}} I {{thought it was}} a good record. It was poppy and catchy and perfect for the summer. I think my core audience is young teenage girls and gay guys. Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] The other thing that 'Chico' had going for it was that the music was Latin-based, I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way. So it was a strange example of synchronicity <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> ready to go with a Latin track which I had written almost a year before".|$|E
500|$|In 2013 Chinen {{stated that}} [...] "Mehldau {{is the most}} {{influential}} jazz pianist of the last 20 years". Pianist Ethan Iverson, a contemporary of Mehldau's, stated that Mehldau was the principal influence on his peers, {{beginning in the late}} 1990s. Pianist Gerald Clayton (born 1984) summarized Mehldau's importance in a 2013 interview: [...] "He brought in a new feel and sound in jazz. I don't know a single modern pianist who hasn't taken something from Brad. I told him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> arrested for all the stuff I've stolen from him." [...] Redman said in 2010 that Largo had been particularly important to musicians: [...] "Brad has had a lot of influential records, [...] if you talk to musicians, especially younger musicians, so many of them will name that as a defining record." [...] Marco Benevento and Aaron Parks are among the improvisers who have been affected by the 2002 album.|$|E

500|$|More {{critical}} {{assessments of}} Markham's {{life and work}} were to follow. Hugh Robert Mill, Shackleton's first biographer and for many years the RGS librarian, referred to the dictatorial manner in which Markham had run the Society. In time, questions would be raised about the accuracy {{of some of his}} Hakluyt translations, and about the evidence of haste in the preparation of other publications. On a personal level he had made enemies as well as friends; Frank Debenham, the geologist who served with both Scott and Shackleton, called Markham [...] "a dangerous old man", while William Speirs Bruce wrote of Markham's [...] "malicious opposition to the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition". Bruce's colleague Robert Rudmose-Brown went further, calling Markham [...] "that old fool and humbug". These protestations reflected Markham's protective attitude towards Scott; according to Bruce, [...] "Scott was Markham's protégé, and Markham thought it necessary, in order to uphold Scott, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> obliterated". He added that [...] "Scott and I were always good friends, in spite of Markham." [...] Markham's writings on naval history have been criticised by modern scholars due to his nationalistic exaggeration of English sailors' achievements in the Age of Discoveries.|$|E
500|$|Bond, already ambitious, asked Gilbert if {{he might}} be able to {{increase}} the size of her role. [...] Gilbert tried to mollify her in a letter, concluding, [...] "I am writing such a particularly good part for you in the new piece <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> distressed beyond measure if you should leave us. I've never said as much as this to any actor or actress before. I don't say it to induce you to play so insignificant a part as Edith, for if you left us now, and came back to us to play that part, I should be satisfied. But if you didn't play it, my calculations would be all upset, and I should lose a dear little lady for whom I have always had a very special regard." [...] True to Gilbert's word, Edith was followed by a string of roles of increasing importance. [...] First was Lady Angela in Patience (1881–82). [...] Bond did not much like the role, writing later that she did not relate to the sentimental lady of luxury indulging in the aesthetic craze. At the same time, Bond was becoming known to theatregoers and attracting the attention of young men. [...] Having had such bad experiences with romance in the past, Bond ignored such attentions. [...] One poem sent to her by an admirer ran in mock-Gilbertian style as follows (in part): ...|$|E
500|$|Bondfield's {{career was}} punctuated by [...] "firsts", in union, {{parliament}} and government spheres. Her own view of these achievements was modest: [...] "Some woman {{was bound to}} be first. <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> was the accident of dates and events". Her appointment as Minister of Labour propelled her into what was, in 1929, the hardest job in the cabinet, and in common with other ministers, her lack of experience in government left her heavily dependent on her official advisers. By temperament a realist, she based her actions in government on economic facts rather on party or sectional interests; thus she became [...] "caught between the opposition claims that she was soft on the unemployed, and her own backbenchers' jibe that she had abandoned the workers". Her stance, and her seemingly equivocal attitude towards MacDonald's apostasy, reduced her standing in her own party for decades, so that when Barbara Castle was appointed as Minister of Labour by Harold Wilson in 1968, she insisted that the ministry's name be changed to [...] "Department of Employment", for fear of association with Bondfield's term in office. Castle refused to contribute a preface to Fabian Society booklet celebrating Bondfield's life, because she considered her predecessor's actions close to political betrayal. In 2001, a speech by Tony Blair celebrating the Labour Party's 100 years in parliament paid tributes to many heroes of the movement's early years; Bondfield's name was not mentioned.|$|E

500|$|Heywood {{opened his}} defence on 17 September {{with a long}} {{prepared}} statement read {{by one of his}} lawyers. It began with a frank acknowledgement of his predicament: to be even accused of mutiny was to [...] "appear at once the object of unpardonable guilt and exemplary vengeance". His case rested on a series of arguments which, as historian Caroline Alexander points out, are not wholly consistent. First, Heywood pleaded his [...] "extreme youth and inexperience" [...] as the cause of his failure to join Bligh and the loyalists in the open boat, insisting that [...] "...I was influenced in my Conduct by the Example of my Messmates, Mr. Hallet and Mr. Hayward ... the latter, tho' he had been many years at Sea, yet, when Christian ordered him into the Boat he was ... so much overcome by the harsh Command, that he actually shed tears." [...] Heywood then cited a different reason for staying aboard Bounty: Bligh's launch was overloaded, and its destruction would be assured [...] "by the least addition to their Number". Finally, Heywood maintained he had intended to join Bligh but had been stopped: [...] "...on hearing it suggested <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> deem'd Guilty if I staid in the Ship, I went down directly, and in passing Mr. Cole told him in a low tone of voice that I would fetch a few necessaries in a Bag and follow him into the Boat, which at that time I meant to do but was afterwards prevented." ...|$|E
500|$|Only days later, Carey began posting {{irregular}} voice {{notes and}} messages on her official website: [...] "I'm {{trying to understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself." [...] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E
500|$|One reader was Sam Simon, a {{producer}} of the animated sitcom The Simpsons. He sent Meyer a compilation reel of Simpsons shorts from Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show that preceded {{the development of the}} series. Meyer turned down the job initially, but was offered a second chance to work as a creative consultant in the fall of 1989, which he accepted. Simon hired Meyer along with Army Man contributors Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. Meyer often played {{an active role in the}} show's extensive group script rewriting sessions in the [...] "rewrite room", a role he performed more than solo script work; indeed he has only been credited for writing twelve episodes. A. O. Scott described him as the [...] "guru" [...] of the room. In the room, according to Mike Reiss, writers would [...] "involuntarily glance at Meyer for approval when they pitch lines of their own". By 1995, Meyer became tired of the show's lengthy writing schedule and decided to leave after the sixth season to work on a film or TV pilot script. He soon returned, however, as a consultant and later as a part of the writing staff again and an executive producer. In 2004 he noted: [...] "It's hard to leave The Simpsons. Every once in a while I get romantic notions <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> doing something much more subterranean. Something like Army Man, or maybe guerrilla filmmaking." [...] He has attempted several TV projects that were not picked up. He left the show in 2006, and received his final credits in season 17. Meyer returned to co-write the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie, which he later had mixed feelings about: [...] "We worked so hard, and people liked it, but it still feels slapdash to me.” ...|$|E
