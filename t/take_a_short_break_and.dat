5000|$|The {{third day}} {{starts in the}} moorlands and moves into alpine desert, with fewer trees and more rocks. The highest point is {{the base of the}} Lava Tower, after which the trail descends into the Barranco Valley. More {{vegetation}} is present in this zone, especially the area just before the campsite. This area is called the [...] "Garden of the Senecios", which features many of the huge senecio plants. Shorter lobelia plants are also present. [...] The fourth day starts with the ascent of the Barranco Wall, which is considered a scramble in climbing terms. The trail continues with many up and down sections across small streams and rivulets and finally crosses the Karanga River to the Karanga campsite. The fifth day follows the path up and across a rocky zone, finishing at the high camp Barafu. Very little vegetation {{can be found on the}} inhospitable terrain. A field of sedimentary rocks litters the ground. (Note - the six-day trek omits the Karanga campsite, and trekkers continue directly to Barafu on the same day.) The summit is usually attempted on the very early morning of the sixth day (around midnight). Barafu is also used as a summit campsite for the Umbwe route. Trekkers typically take somewhere between five and seven hours to ascend, using headlamps and cold weather gear. Making the ascent on a full moon or shortly thereafter can make the headtorch unnecessary. The first milestone, generally reached shortly after dawn, is Stella Point (18652 ft), which is on the crater rim. Following Stella Point, the trail continues for another 60 minutes to Uhuru Peak, the summit. The descent back to Barafu takes roughly four hours. Some trekkers scree slide down the slope, which entails skidding/running down the loose gravel at medium speed. From Barafu, trekkers typically <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>break,</b> <b>and</b> continue downwards through the alpine desert and ensuing moorlands to Mweka Camp. The seventh and final day has trekkers continue through the montane forest to Mweka Gate. Troops of black-and-white colobus monkeys can often be seen in the dense growth.

40|$|It’s {{about time}} {{to wrap up}} my {{graduate}} study and now I feel like standing {{on the deck of}} a vessel which is slowly approaching a tranquil harbor.

Though it’s not a continuance of amusement, I would have been excited occasionally as when surfing in the shore. Not to mention, there were several times when I felt like paddling in the thunderstorm. However, I have met many good people during the course and been able to manage the cruise to this point with helps and encouragements from those people. My supervisor, lab mates, friends, staffs, faculties, committee members, soccer teammates, colleagues, [...] . There are so many people I have been beholden to and I appreciate all of them with all my heart. As for Dr. Shih, I really don’t know how to thank him. He has always shown me a boundless interest in my research and given me overflowing advices. What I have achieved during the course is entirely due to his supervision and enthusiasm...|$|E
