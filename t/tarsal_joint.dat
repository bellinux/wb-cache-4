5|$|Caddisfly larvae are aquatic, {{with six}} pairs of {{tracheal}} gills {{on the underside}} of the abdomen. The eggs are laid above water on emergent twigs or vegetation or on the water surface although females of some species enter water to choose sites. Although most species lay eggs, a few in the genus Triplectides are ovoviviparous. Some species lay eggs on land and although most are associated with freshwater, a few like Symphitoneuria are found in coastal saline water. Philanisus plebeius females lay their eggs into the coelomic cavity of intertidal starfish. The larvae are long and roughly cylindrical, very similar to those of lepidoptera but lacking prolegs. In case-bearing species, the heads are heavily sclerotinised while the abdomen is soft; the antennae are short and the mouthparts adapted for biting. Each of the usually ten abdominal segments bears a pair of legs with a single <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint.</b> In case-bearing species, the first segment bears three papillae, one above and two at the sides, which anchor the larva centrally in the tube. The posterior segment bears a pair of hooks for grappling. There are five to seven larval instars, followed by an aquatic pupa which has functional mandibles (to cut through the case), gills, and swimming legs.|$|E

50|$|The complex {{motion of}} the {{subtalar}} joint occurs in three planes and produces subtalar inversion and eversion. Along with the transverse <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> (i.e. talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joint), the subtalar joint transforms tibial rotation into forefoot supination and pronation. The axis of rotation in the joint is directed upward 42 degrees from the horizontal plane and 16 degrees medially from the midline of the foot. However, together, the subtalar facets form a screw or Archimedean spiral, right-handed in the right foot, about which subtalar motion occurs. So, during subtalar inversion, the calcaneus also rotates clockwise and translates forward along the axis of the screw. Average subtalar motion is 20-30 degrees inversion and 5-10 degrees eversion. Functional motion during the gait cycle is 10-15 degrees (the heel strikes the ground in slight inversion followed by quick eversion).|$|E

5000|$|As {{indicated}} by the Babylonian name it is a [...] "walking serpent." [...] A striking feature is the scaly coat and the great tail of a serpent's body. The head with the forked tongue is purely that of a serpent, and is in fact that of the horned viper, so common in Arabia, which bears the two erect horns, of which, {{as in the case}} of the bulls, only one is visible in the purely profile attitude. Behind lie two spiral combs similar to those so generously bestowed on the heads of the frequently represented Chinese dragon. The tail ends in a small curved sting. The legs are those of some high-stepping feline animal, probably a cheetah. The hinder feet are those of a strong raptorial bird (Fig. 33) with powerful claws and great horny scales.

This paper describes {{the outcome of the}} intra-articular treatment of 51 horses with the condition with either methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) or triamcinolone acetonide (TR), either with or without hyaluronic acid (HA). The outcome was assessed in terms of the changes in the horses’ grade of lameness. Follow-up information was obtained from the owners by means of a telephone questionnaire. Horses treated once with MPA or TR, either with or without HA, improved after a median of 56 days (P&# 60; 0 · 0001), and {{there was no significant difference}} between MPA and TR. There was no significant further improvement in the horses treated twice. In the horses in which there was a diffuse increase in the uptake of a radiopharmaceutical by the distal <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints,</b> identified by scintigraphy, the lameness tended to improve (P= 0 · 032), whereas in the horses in which the uptake was focal, it did not.

After slaughtering, synovial fluid specimens were taken from <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> of all animals, aseptically and concentrations of zinc, copper, selenium, iron and vitamin A, E and C were assayed. Concentrations of selenium and vitamin C in arthritic joints were significantly lower than clinically healthy camels (P< 0. 05). Zinc concentration of arthritic synovial fluid was significantly higher than normal joints. These data showed that the arthritis could change the synovial fluid vitamins and trace elements in dromedary camels. In conclusion, the results of the current research showed that arthritic joints are in an oxidative stress situation and information regarding the changing patterns of vitamins and trace elements in synovial fluids can be considered as prognostic and diagnostic criteria for articular inflammatory processes...|$|R
50|$|The {{crown and}} nape are black, with the {{individual}} feathers rather long and loosely arranged, tipped with buff narrowly barred with black. The sides {{of the head and}} neck are a more uniform tawny-buff, irregularly barred with black. The mantle, scapulars and back are of a similar colour but are more heavily barred, the individual feathers having black centres and barring. The head has a yellowish-buff superciliary stripe and a brownish-black moustachial stripe. The sides of the neck are a rusty-brown with faint barring. The chin and throat are buff, the central feathers on the throat having longitudinal stripes of rusty-brown. The breast and belly are yellowish-buff, with broad stripes of brown at the side and narrow stripes in the centre. The tail is rusty-buff with black streaks in the centre and black mottling near the edge. The wings are pale rusty-brown irregularly barred, streaked and mottled with black. The plumage has a loose texture, and elongated feathers on the crown, neck and breast can be erected. The powerful bill is greenish-yellow with a darker tip to the upper mandible. The eye has a yellow iris and is surrounded by a ring of greenish or bluish bare skin. The legs and feet are greenish, with some yellow on the <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> and yellow soles to the feet.

5000|$|As seen {{in about}} half of the [...] "booted eagle" [...] group, the {{juvenile}} crowned eagle has strikingly different looking plumage compared to the adults. Much variation occurs as the maturation process occurs. A great majority of juveniles have a white head and underside, which contrast with the thighs and legs, which are heavily spotted with black. The juvenile eagle's back is light brown or grayish-brown, with pale feather edgings that often give the back a scaled appearance, especially on the upper-wing coverts. There is often a pinkish red wash on the upper chest. Just-fledged chicks tend have dark patched faces, freckled bibs and slightly barred chests and spotted legs. Less common juvenile crowned eagle plumages, possible even when they are under a year of age and still under parental care, may include eagles so stripy that they which one could easily have aged as two- to three-year-olds. The tail of the juvenile is black with three pale bars and a narrow black tip. The juvenile eagle's cere is grey and the feet are dull yellow. By 4 months post-fledgling, the inner thighs, previously poorly covered with downy type feathers, are covered with small feathers. While the pale 'morph' young just prior to leaving the nest usually have unmarked tarsus, they soon get spots on the front part of the tibio <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint.</b> The tibio tarsal pad is still bare and obvious up until it is a year old, whereupon it vanishes only to return to incubating females. Eye color is variable too with some having khaki light brown just prior to fledging and others with adult-like yellow ochre eyes. Up to 15 months after leaving the nest, the immature eagles more closely resemble the plumage they have at first independence than the adult's plumage. The juvenile may be confused with the similarly colored juvenile martial eagle, especially in flight. It is distinguished from the martial species in having a much longer, more heavily barred tail, much shorter wings and spotted thighs.|$|E

40|$|For the equine veterinarian, it {{is often}} {{difficult}} to interpret degenerative radiographic changes in the small <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> of clinically healthy young horses on sales or prepurchase radiographs. The aim of this study was to expand the knowledge in this area by investigating the prevalence and progression of degenerative radiographic findings of the small <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> in a homogenous population of young horses. For this purpose, the first part of the study comprised the radiographic examination of 292 two-year-old, clinically healthy and untrained Warmblood stallions to determine the prevalence of radiographic degenerative changes in the small <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints.</b> The second part of the study assessed the development of such degenerative changes over five to sixteen months. This time period is relevant for the public sale or stallion approval preparation of the horses. Follow-up radiographs of 77 stallions with degenerative changes were taken and evaluated to monitor the development of these changes over time. A standardized evaluation of the radiographs was guaranteed by a detailed evaluation scheme and three experienced and specifically qualified investigators. Our hypotheses were: a. Degenerative radiologic findings in the small <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> have a high prevalence even in young and clinically healthy horses, b. Such radiologic changes can be dynamic over a short period of time. In the first part of the study, 22. 6 % of the stallions showed radiologic changes consistent with degenerative joint disease. There were osteophytes in the distal intertarsal and/or tarsometatarsal joint in 15. 4 %, areas of reduced radiopacity in the central tarsal or third tarsal bone in 6. 5 %, narrowing of the joint space of the distal intertarsal and/or tarsometatarsal joint in 0. 3 %, and sclerosis at the distal intertarsal joint in 0. 7 % of the horses. Dorsoproximal spurs at the third metatarsal bone were observed in 27. 4 % of horses; this was the most common radiologic finding. However, this finding alone did not result in the radiologic diagnosis of degenerative joint disease. In part two of the study, there was a tendency for progression of the findings “spur at third metatarsal bone” and “osteophytes at distal intertarsal and/or tarsometatarsal joint” over time. The finding “areas of reduced radiopacity in the central tarsal or third tarsal bone” appeared to be regressive over time. While the progression of spurs and osteophytes was expected as described in the literature, there was an unexpected regressive dynamic of areas of reduced radiopacity in the small tarsal bones. In the literature, these changes have been interpreted as lytic areas and as a sign of degenerative joint disease. A regression of bone lysis secondary to degenerative joint disease is not described in the literature and seems not plausible. However, it is possible that such areas of reduced radiopacity in the small tarsal bones are due to a delayed increase in bone density in young horses – such areas could really be regressive due to the significant potential for bone remodelling, especially in young animals. Results of our study confirm the high prevalence of degenerative radiographic changes of the small <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> even in young, untrained and clinically healthy Warmblood stallions. However, areas of reduced radiopacity in the small tarsal bones can be regressive over a short period of time and should be evaluated cautiously concerning the radiologic diagnosis of degenerative joint disease...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring insect metamorphosis, {{the steroid}} hormone 20 -hydroxyecdysone (20 E) is {{responsible}} for coordinating the differentiation of adult structures. Several structures of the Drosophila melanogaster adult leg, the six distalmost joints, the bristles, and the pretarsal claws, were examined to investigate how 20 E controls their development in vitro. Joints, bristles, and claws were dependent on 20 E for differentiation between 20 – 22 and 24 – 26 h after puparium formation (APF). After 26 – 28 h APF, differentiation became hormone independent. Tissue-specific markers in 20 E-free cultures showed that the bristle and joint cells had not undergone any further morphogenetic progression. In contrast, the pretarsi underwent partial differentiation. The concentration of 20 E required for differentiation was structure specific; <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> required higher concentrations of 20 E (greater than 400 ng 20 E/ml) than pretarsal claws, bristles, and other joints (greater than 40 ng 20 E/ml).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{dependence}} of {{the movements of the}} calcaneus, cuboid, navicular, and talus on each other have been described as the tarsal gearbox. To provide a basis of its modeling, data on transmissions between <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> rotations within this gearbox are required. The feasibility of tibiocalcaneal rotations to predict <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> rotations is of interest because a meaningful relation would allow the use of common motion analysis with skin markers to investigate rearfoot kinematics. METHODS: We performed linear regression analyses between <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> and tibiocalcaneal rotations on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging of tibia and tarsal bone positions during quasi-static foot pronation and supination. RESULTS: In the frontal plane and transverse planes, linear models were found to predict <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> rotations quite well (r(2) = 0. 83 - 0. 97 for the frontal plane and r(2) = 0. 73 - 0. 95 for the transverse plane). For each degree of talocalcaneal rotation, there was 1. 8 degrees of talonavicular rotation in the frontal plane and 1. 6 degrees in the transverse plane; each degree of talocalcaneal rotation resulted in 0. 6 degrees of calcanealcuboid rotation in the frontal plane and 0. 7 degrees in the transverse plane; each degree of calcaneocuboid rotation resulted in 3 degrees of talonavicular rotation in the frontal plane and 2. 8 degrees in the transverse; each degree of tibiocalcaneal rotation resulted in 0. 9 degrees of talocalcaneal rotation in the frontal plane and 0. 9 degrees in the transverse plane; and each degree of tibiocalcaneal rotation resulted in 1. 6 degrees of talonavicular rotation in the frontal plane and 1. 3 degrees in the transverse plane. CONCLUSION: The present study provides a basis on which the tarsal gearbox in the frontal and the transverse planes under quasi-static conditions can be modeled. Furthermore, it is concluded that tibiocalcaneal rotations are practical for predicting <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint</b> rotations during quasi-static motions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Little {{information}} on quantitative sagittal plane postural alignment and evolution in children exists. The objectives {{of this study}} are to document the evolution of upright, static, sagittal posture in children and to identify possible critical phases of postural evolution (maturation). Methods A total of 1084 children (aged 4 – 12 years) received a sagittal postural evaluation with the Biotonix postural analysis system. Data were retrieved from the Biotonix internet database. Children were stratified and analyzed by years of age with n = 36 in the youngest age group (4 years) and n = 184 in the oldest age group (12 years). Children were analyzed in the neutral upright posture. Variables measured were sagittal translation distances in millimeters of: the knee relative to the <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint,</b> pelvis relative to the <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint,</b> shoulder relative to the <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint,</b> and head relative to the <b>tarsal</b> <b>joint.</b> A two-way factorial ANOVA was used to test for age and gender effects on posture, while polynomial trend analyses were used to test for increased postural displacements with years of age. Results Two-way ANOVA yielded a significant main effect of age for all 4 sagittal postural variables and gender for all variables except head translation. No age × gender interaction was found. Polynomial trend analyses showed a significant linear association between child age and all four postural variables: anterior head translation (p Conclusion A significant linear trend for increasing sagittal plane postural translations of the head, thorax, pelvis, and knee was found as children age from 4 years to 12 years. These postural translations provide preliminary normative data for the alignment of a child's sagittal plane posture. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was {{to understand how the}} stance-phase kinematics of the hindlimb of trotting horses change with speed under 3 conditions (level, loaded and incline), to compare our results with the predictions of the spring-mass model and to help focus our future studies of muscle function. Video recordings were made of 5 Arabian horses trotting on a treadmill. Five consecutive strides were digitised and averaged for each trial. The angle-time diagrams were qualitatively similar to those reported previously. As speed increases, the range of motion of the hindlimb increases, as predicted by the spring-mass model. This is the result of increased range of motion in the coxofemoral and <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints.</b> The hindlimb does not ‘land short- take off long’. When trotting up an incline, the hindlimb undergoes a greater range of motion because of increased retraction resulting from increased extension of the coxofemoral joint. At hoof contact on an incline, the 3 proximal joints are more flexed than on the level. Carrying a load had no effect on kinematics. These results suggest that there may be larger changes in strain with speed in muscles acting at the coxofemoral and <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> than at the femorotibial joint, and that locomotion up an incline will change muscle strain more than carrying a load...|$|R
2500|$|The {{ancestors}} of the horse came to walk only {{on the end of}} the third toe and both side toes. Skeletal remnants show obvious wear on the back of both sides of metacarpal and metatarsal bones, commonly called the [...] "splint bones". They are the remnants of the second and the fourth toe. Modern horses retain the splint bones; they are often believed to be useless attachments, but they in fact play an important role in supporting the carpal joints (front knees) and even the <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints</b> (hocks).|$|R
40|$|Epitheliogenesis {{imperfect}} (EI) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} skin defect that is clinically identified with absence of cutaneous epithelium of the limbs, muzzle and nostrils as well as oral mucous membranes. This congenital newborn desease is reported mainly in domestic animals. The present study described EI in a 13 day-old, female crossbred Holstein calf. Gross examination showed epithelium agenesis of two front and hind limbs skin around the carpal and <b>tarsal</b> <b>joints,</b> and also extensive areas of the metacarpal and metatarsal regions. The calf died 5 days after antibiotic therapy and use of topical cream...|$|R
