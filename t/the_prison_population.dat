40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIIMPORTANCE In 1939, English mathematician, geneticist, and {{psychiatrist}} Lionel Sharples Penrose {{hypothesized that}} the numbers of psychiatric hospital beds and <b>the</b> sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> were inversely related; 75 years later, the question arises {{as to whether the}} hypothesis applies to recent developments in South America. OBJECTIVE To explore the possible association of changes in the numbers of psychiatric hospital beds with changes in <b>the</b> sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> in South America since 1990. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We searched primary sources for the numbers of psychiatric hospital beds in South American countries since 1990 (the year that the Latin American countries signed the Caracas Declaration) and compared these changes against <b>the</b> sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations.</b> <b>The</b> associations between the numbers of psychiatric beds and <b>the</b> sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> were tested using fixed-effects regression of panel data. Economic variables were considered as covariates. Sufficiently reliable and complete data were obtained from 6 countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The numbers of psychiatric beds and <b>the</b> sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations.</b> RESULTS Since 1990, the numbers of psychiatric beds decreased in all 6 countries (ranging from - 2. 0 % to - 71. 9 %), while <b>the</b> sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> increased substantially (ranging from 16. 1 % to 273. 0 %). Panel data regression analysis across the 6 countries showed a significant inverse relationship between numbers of psychiatric beds and sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations.</b> On average, <b>the</b> removal of 1 bed was associated with 5. 18 more prisoners (95 % CI, 3. 10 - 7. 26; P =. 001), which was reduced to 2. 78 prisoners (95 % CI, 2. 59 - 2. 97; P <. 001) when economic growth was considered as a covariate. The association between the numbers of psychiatric beds and <b>the</b> sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> remained practically unchanged when income inequality was considered as a covariate (- 4. 28 [95 % CI, - 5. 21 to - 3. 36]; P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Since 1990, the numbers of psychiatric beds have substantially decreased in South America, while the sizes of <b>the</b> <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> have increased against a background of strong economic growth. The changes appear to be associated because the numbers of beds decreased more extensively when and where <b>the</b> sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations</b> increased. These findings are consistent with and specify the assumption of an association between the numbers of psychiatric beds and <b>the</b> sizes of <b>prison</b> <b>populations.</b> More research is needed to understand the drivers of the capacities of psychiatric hospitals and prisons and to explore reasons for their associatio...|$|R
