5|$|<b>The</b> <b>moat</b> was {{situated}} {{at a distance}} of about 20m from the outer wall. <b>The</b> <b>moat</b> itself was over 20m wide and as much as 10m deep, featuring a 1.5m tall crenellated wall on the inner side, serving as a first line of defence. Transverse walls cross <b>the</b> <b>moat,</b> tapering towards the top {{so as not to be}} used as bridges. Some of them have been shown to contain pipes carrying water into the city from the hill country to the city's north and west. Their role has therefore been interpreted as that of aqueducts for filling <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> and as dams dividing it into compartments and allowing the water to be retained over the course of the walls. According to Alexander van Millingen, however, there is little direct evidence in the accounts of the city's sieges to suggest that <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> was ever actually flooded. In the sections north of the Gate of St. Romanus, the steepness of the slopes of the Lycus valley made the construction maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> problematic; it is probable therefore that <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> ended at the Gate of St. Romanus, and did not resume until after the Gate of Adrianople.|$|E
5|$|A moat, {{approximately}} 190 metres (620 feet) to {{the south}} of the castle, was constructed in mediaeval times, likely {{around the time of the}} rebuilding in 1305. A Scheduled Ancient Monument in its own right, <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> encloses approximately an acre of land around the property. <b>The</b> <b>moat</b> may have been an enclosure surrounding farm buildings connected to the castle.|$|E
5|$|St Briavels Castle {{is located}} on a spur {{dominating}} a position above the River Wye, on {{the western edge of}} the Forest of Dean. The castle is predominantly built of local old red sandstone and limestone. The castle site is surrounded by an in-filled moat; now a garden, <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> was originally wet and fed by a spring underneath <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> itself.|$|E
5000|$|Aragalur {{literally}} means [...] "six moat place" [...] or {{the village}} having six <b>moats.</b> <b>The</b> <b>moats</b> were historically located near Kuyavar Street, Pullaakulam (North), Soleswaran Temple, Kottikulam (North), Kavarai Street & Uppulimedu. One {{of the records}} suggest that <b>the</b> <b>moats</b> {{could have been in}} concentric circles. Most of <b>the</b> <b>moats</b> have been filled and flattened to keep up the population growth.|$|R
50|$|The {{artificial}} island {{created by the}} excavation of <b>the</b> <b>moats</b> was densely occupied during the Terminal Classic but only one residence was excavated in the area between <b>the</b> <b>moats.</b> <b>The</b> Terminal Classic palaces at the site consisted of wide platforms measuring approximately 10 by 20 m and thickly coated in plaster.|$|R

5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} barbican had been {{demolished}} {{to make way}} for houses and <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> had begun to be occupied with housing. By 1600 <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> was almost entirely silted up and houses had been built all {{around the edge of the}} bailey wall. In 1611 King James I sold Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert Younglove, who in turn sold it to Christ Church College in 1613. The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years. By this time Oxford Castle was in a weakened state, with a large crack running down the side of the keep.|$|E
5|$|The Forbidden City is {{surrounded}} {{on three sides}} by imperial gardens. To the north is Jingshan Park, also known as Prospect Hill, an artificial hill created from the soil excavated to build <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> and from nearby lakes.|$|E
5|$|The area {{surrounding}} Bodiam Castle was landscaped {{when the}} castle was built, {{to increase its}} aesthetic appeal. Archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham have described Bodiam {{as one of the}} best examples of landscaping to emphasise a castle. The water features were originally extensive, but only <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> survives, along with the earthworks left over from its construction. Roughly rectangular, <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> is supplied by several springs, some of them within it, which made it difficult to drain during the excavations of the 1930s. A moat can prevent attackers from gaining access to the base of a castle's walls, but in the case of Bodiam it also had the effect of making the castle appear larger and more impressive by isolating it in its landscape. <b>The</b> <b>moat</b> is now regarded more as an ornamental feature than a defence. The approach to the castle through <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> and satellite ponds was indirect, giving visitors time to view the castle in its intended splendour. Military historian Cathcart King describes the approach as formidable, and considers it the equal of the 13th-century castles of Edward I in Wales, such as Caerphilly Castle.|$|E

40|$|Iron Age {{occupation}} {{of a large}} number of sites in the Mun River Valley, northeast Thailand are characterised by distinctive encircling earthworks, these sites being commonly known as “moated sites”. The previous focus on the “moat” as an essential structure has tended to obscure the relationship between site and landscape. This paper reports the preliminary results of the first excavation of any significance within <b>the</b> <b>moats</b> themselves at six sites – Noen U-Loke, Non Muang Khao, Ban Non Khrua Chut, Ban Non Ngiu, Ban Makham Thae and Ban Non Wat – where the structure of <b>the</b> <b>moats</b> has been examined in section. Lithology, stratigraphy and cross-sectional morphology have been recorded and from these observations several broad conclusions may be reached and are reported here. Typically, subsurface features comprise infilled river channels and an undulating bedrock and alluvial surface. Significantly, the surficial morphology of <b>the</b> <b>moats,</b> and notable <b>the</b> regularity of shape and patterning of <b>the</b> <b>moats</b> in plan, usually does not reflect buried channel morphology. The surficial patterning of <b>the</b> <b>moats</b> may, indeed, be a relatively recent phenomenon, and the buried channel features probably reflect more accurately the landscape of the period of Iron Age {{occupation of}} the region...|$|R
50|$|The castle complex {{included}} three moats, one of which—the outer moat—is now buried. Parts of <b>the</b> central <b>moat</b> {{and all of}} <b>the</b> inner <b>moats</b> survive. <b>The</b> <b>moats</b> have an average width of 20 m, a maximum width of 34.5 m, and a depth of about 2.7 m. <b>The</b> Three Country <b>Moat</b> (sangoku-bori) is a 2500 m2 pond which exists inside the castle; one {{of the purposes of}} this moat was to store water for use in fire prevention.|$|R
5|$|The {{parliamentary}} clerk {{continued to}} live alongside the tower, except during the interregnum of 1649 and 1660, when the House of Lords was temporarily abolished. The sewer feeding into <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> was blocked up around {{the middle of the}} century, and <b>the</b> <b>moat,</b> which previously seems to have been kept clean, was allowed to gradually fill up with debris, despite complaints from the House of Lords that this put the Jewel Tower at greater risk of fire and thieves.|$|E
5|$|Edward Somerset made minor {{improvements}} to {{the interior of the}} castle {{at the start of the}} 17th century, but focused primarily on the exterior, expanding and developing the gardens and building <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> walk around the Great Tower. The resulting gardens were considered the equal of any other others in the kingdom at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the skulls of {{two male}} Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from {{northwest}} Africa {{were found in}} <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> area of the Tower. Radicarbon tests dated them from 1280-1385 and 1420-1480. During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste.|$|E

5000|$|A new outer moat was constructed, and <b>the</b> earlier <b>moat</b> became <b>the</b> inner <b>moat.</b> <b>The</b> area {{took the}} name Okuruwauchi ( [...] , [...] "within the enclosure") around 1629, when Edo Castle was completed.|$|R
5|$|The castle was redeveloped in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, {{probably}} by the Praters: the windows were enlarged to let in more light; a grand staircase was built in one of the towers; a Catholic altar was installed, and a revetment, or terrace, was built around the inside of <b>the</b> <b>moat,</b> leaving it 25 feet (7.6 m) wide.|$|E
5|$|The fight {{started with}} the three battalions of the Spanish first line {{advancing}} upon the Dutch camp, each one {{trying to be the}} first to laid its bridge over <b>the</b> <b>moat.</b> Haultpenne's Wallons, headed by Sergeant-Major Camille Sacchino, moved up to Deurne, crossing the Schijn river at the small village of Immerseel. Valdés' Germans advanced frontally to Borgerhout across the Borsbeek road, and Figueroa's Spaniards took the Voetweg road to assault the Dutch camp from the south. While the sleeves of musketeers from the Spanish and German units exchanged fire with the Dutch troops covered by the rampart, Sacchino's Walloons drove the defenders of Deurne behind the Groot Schijn stream and took its bridge. De la Noue sent reinforcements there to content the assault, but they arrived too late to prevent the Walloons from laying their bridge over <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> and began to climb the rampart, starting a close combat with the Dutch troops. In the meantime, the Spanish and German troops, supported by two or three artillery pieces, breached the rampart, crossed <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> and also started to come inside Borgerhout, where De la Noue and Norreys' men reorganized and stood on the barricaded streets.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} and {{the buildings}} inside the bailey were made habitable again in 1906 {{and became a}} Youth Hostel in 1948. In 1961 <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> was partly infilled {{and turned into a}} garden. The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument.

5|$|After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre-war {{owners of}} the {{property}} laid claim to Clifford's Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property. Repairs {{were made to the}} tower, and it became a magazine for storing gunpowder and shot. Attempts were made to restore the condition of <b>the</b> <b>moat,</b> which had become badly silted. Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period, including George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only one}} bomb {{fell on the}} Tower of London in the First World War (it landed harmlessly in <b>the</b> <b>moat),</b> the Second World War left a greater mark. On 23 September 1940, during the Blitz, high-explosive bombs damaged the castle, {{destroying}} several buildings and narrowly missing the White Tower. After the war, the damage was repaired and the Tower of London was reopened to the public.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{then joined}} the revolt by Henry's sons in 1173. The attempt to {{overthrow}} Henry was unsuccessful, and in punishment the king ordered several Bigod castles, including Framlingham, to be destroyed. The king's engineer, Alnoth, destroyed the fortifications and filled in <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> at Framlingham between 1174–6 {{at a total}} cost of £16 11s 12d, although he probably shored up, rather than destroyed, the internal stone buildings.|$|E

50|$|In the 15th century a two story {{fortification}} {{was built}} near {{the tower and}} protected {{with a series of}} <b>moats.</b> In <b>the</b> 16th century, however, it was demolished and replaced with the current chapel. <b>The</b> <b>moats</b> were filled in and today only <b>the</b> main <b>moat</b> remains.|$|R
5|$|In {{the outer}} garden is an arboretum, planted in 1977 by Bishop John Bickersteth {{to commemorate the}} Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The mute swans on <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> {{have been trained to}} ring bells by pulling strings, to beg for food. The first swans were trained by one of the daughters of Bishop Hervey in the 1870s. Two swans which were given to the bishop by Queen Elizabeth II in 2006, are still able to ring for lunch fed to them by the caretakers who live in the gatehouse.|$|E
5|$|The Crown {{took over}} the castle again in 1670, and Robert Holmes, the new Captain of the Isle of Wight, {{had some of the}} guns brought back from Cowes to the castle. The site was refortified and a new battery placed on the {{adjacent}} quay, but the older earthworks were demolished and <b>the</b> <b>moat</b> was filled in. Holmes built a mansion for himself alongside the castle, where on three occasions he hosted the King.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moat</b> Studios in London {{recorded}} Nebulous in stereo, {{with each}} half-hour episode typically taking {{one day to}} record, including read-through and rehearsal. Nicholas Briggs produced the sound, {{using a combination of}} synthesised effects from a Roland SH-101 and foley sound effects. Briggs also carried out the studio editing in order to bring the 30-minute episodes down to the 28 minutes mandated by the BBC to allow time for radio trailers between programmes.|$|E

50|$|Barnardiston is {{also the}} {{location}} of two of only 32 scheduled ancient monuments in Suffolk, <b>the</b> <b>moats</b> and carp pond of a medieval manor. The manor itself was not listed separately in the Domesday book but its moats and carp-pond are scheduled as being prior to 1150 AD. The manor was not present on the 1850 enclosure map, which shows another building, probably a previous rectory, outside <b>the</b> <b>moats</b> in <b>the</b> outer enclosure adjacent to the church.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>moats,</b> Palaemon adspersus, Macrobrachium, nukaebi (Paratya improvisa) and Procambarus clarkii were found, in many numbers except Macrobrachium. Procambarus clarkii was not {{obtained}} in <b>the</b> Dokan <b>Moat.</b> In <b>the</b> eastern Garden, a crab, sawagani or (Geothelphusa dehaani) was confirmed. In <b>the</b> <b>moats,</b> parasitic crustaceans {{were found in}} stone moroko, Carassius auratus langsdorfii, Carassius cuvieri and in some shrimps. As land living crustaceans, 16 species of Isopoda and two species of Gammaridea were found. The most common Isopoda was Tokyo koshibiro dangomushi which is usually found in deep woods. Three species of Harpacticoida were found from the soil, indicating a stable circumstance of the Palace like woods in the mountains.|$|R
