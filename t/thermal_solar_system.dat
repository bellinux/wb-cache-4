Foram analisadas três opções para aquecimento de água com reservatório de acumulação: sistema com resistência elétrica, sistema solar com concentrador e sistema solar sem concentrador. Calculou-se o custo total dessas alternativas e o valor presente líquido do sistema solar suplementado por lenha de eucalipto comprada, lenha de eucalipto produzida na propriedade rural, energia elétrica e gás liquefeito de petróleo (GLP).

Analysis is based on basic energy balance for hybrid flat plate collector and storage tank, respectively, {{in the terms of}} design and climatic parameters. Further, an analysis has also been extended for hot water withdrawal at constant collection temperature.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the analysis made on an integrated system for heating and DHW generation, which serves thirty families, accommodated into two blocks of apartments. The system {{consisting of a}} gas modulating condensing boiler (220 kW) used for heating and DHW, and of a heat pump (130 kW) used as integration to the boiler. A <b>thermal</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> with evacuated tube is also considered (thirty collectors, south-west orientation and 45 ° slope); the energy produced is used both for heating and for DHW generation. Three storage tanks are installed: {{one of them is}} designed to integrate the thermal sources for heating, the other two work in parallel for the DHW production. The plant described is complex and each circuit (boiler, heat pump, solar field) needs to be managed according to all the other systems in an integrated way. The aim of the analysis is to figure out the optimum design for the control and the regulation system, in order to maximize the exploitation of the solar energy, to increase the load factor of the heat pump and to manage the boiler operation for achieving the highest efficiency at partial loads. The buildings and the plant have been modeled in details, to ensure a good correspondence to the real case.

40|$|Moldova is {{a country}} that during the last twenty years, since the {{declaration}} of their independence, has had big problems within the energy sector. The infra structure that exist is outdated and there are few national sources of energy. Today Moldova import 94 - 98 % of the total energy consumption from surrounding countries. The usage of renewable energy sources is today low and in its beginning. There have been a few previous projects within the area. In 2010 Borlänge Energy AB and the Peace&Love Foundation took  an initiative to start up two Youth Centres, one in the countryside and one in the capital, Chişinău. These centres will not only contribute to offer a sanctuary for young people but as well function as a good example of energy efficient construction and the usage of renewable energy sources. The projects’ purpose is to design an ecologically sustainable solution for the building construction, the supply of domestic hot water and the domestic heating for the Youth Centre that will be built in Lozova, Moldova. The aim is to present a final suggestion of this complete system in a report. The gathering of information is based on literature but also interviews and study visits. All the stages have been done both in Moldova and Sweden. The work is done within the three areas: Energy smart building construction, <b>thermal</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> for domestic hot water and heat and biomass fueled boilers for small scale use. The domestic heating system is based primarily on sun energy with a complimenting biomass boiler. Different materials for the building construction are compared with a starting point in different traditional types of buildings. Three different standardized cases are put against each other and these results in a recommendation of a low U-value. Meaning a value of how high the flow of energy is allowed to be through the house. This U-value is then used to obtain the total annual energy use which then lies as ground for the sun- and biomass energy system. Moldova’s biomass resources are mapped to identify possible choices for the biomass boiler. An evaluation of the boiler that in the end will give the best result for the environment is done. In the simulation program Polysun two different cases of combined sun and biomass systems are compared to each other. One system is designed with more basic technique and the other one is designed with more advanced technique. The results from Polysun and the Moldovan capability to receive the technique are taken into consideration and in the end the system designed with basic technique is chosen...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a process of}} solar potential optimization for residential buildings in high density urban areas. The process is validated through its application to the project of a mixed use, {{net zero energy building}} including public facilities and four levels of apartments. The optimization process concerns three phases: energy, solar and panelling optimization. The design approach combines parametric volume transformations (Rhinoceros - Grasshopper), solar dynamic analysis (Daysim) and solar maps analysis (DIVA for Rhino). The energy optimization regards the reduction of the heated volume, compared with the allowable volume defined by the regulations of the city of Milan, to a smaller one with lower internal heights, minimizing the building’s energy demand. The solar optimization is focused on the transformation of the initial volume based on the local urban parameters (distance among buildings, allowable profile, building’s height, plot ratio), in order to improve the solar exposure and maximize the solar access. The façades are modified to reduce the overshadowing effect of the nearby buildings, maintaining the same volume. The optimized volume derives from parametric studies about solar availability tilting the vertical facades away from the vertical. Solar dynamic annual analyses were conducted using Daysim and DIVA for Rhino in order to compare the initial and the solar optimized scenarios. The first set of simulations was carried out on both the isolated initial and optimized volumes, while the second set was carried out on the latter volumes placed in the district, thus affected by the surroundings. The loss in floor area due to the slope of the south and east façades is balanced by the addition of living areas facing the inner court without losing any commercial floor area. This choice allows a comparison of the two buildings, which have different shapes but the same volume. The annual solar mapping analysis is performed to localize the most irradiated parts of the building envelope, giving the possibility to design both a photovoltaic or <b>thermal</b> <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> with variable density elements. The results show the increase of available solar radiation in solar optimized design, while the panelling study permitted to optimize both technology and energy design of the solar systems required and furthermore to justify the architectural choices that led the building’s design. The studies have demonstrated that through the optimization of the building shape, it is possible to obtain a huge improvement in the amount of solar radiation available on the façades, while keeping the same envelope surface. The next steps of the research will be focused on the analysis of both photovoltaic and solar thermal panels’ efficiency, as well as the related assessment of increased surface temperatures on the façades, due to the solar energy system integration...|$|E
