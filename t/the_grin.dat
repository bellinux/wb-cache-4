500|$|Conversely, John Levesque {{called the}} show a [...] "keeper" [...] {{in his review}} for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and applauded the series subtle, improvised style. Chicago Sun-Times {{journalist}} Phil Rosenthal commended the episode. In his review, he wrote, [...] "Rather than big laughs, it's more likely to elicit <b>the</b> <b>grin</b> of bemused recognition. It's not about sight gags or clever puns. It's not about parodying the sitcom form. This sweet ass seriesis not always subtle - unless a child showing another how {{to have fun with}} a runny nose is intellectual - but it nicely plays off the inherent absurdities and weirdness of everyday modern life." [...] Dennis Landmann of DVD Freak wrote that the episode [...] "sets up the tone quite well, for it develops the aspirations of Brendon becoming a filmmaker," [...] and praised the confrontational scenes that occur between McGuirk and Brendon.|$|E
500|$|Once {{it became}} a Final Fantasy title, <b>the</b> <b>Grin</b> founders stated, [...] "We wanted {{to come in and}} {{revolutionize}} Final Fantasy, which is exactly what they need." [...] Fortress was to be set in the fictional world of Ivalice, specifically the version seen in Final Fantasy XII, only set some time in the future. In addition to many original characters and locations, concept art for the game included the character Ashe and a Judge from Final Fantasy XII, as well as chocobos and other recurring creatures of the Final Fantasy series. A portfolio video created by lead technical artist Anders Bodbacka revealed that Larsa Solidor and Basch fon Ronsenburg from Final Fantasy XII were also to be featured. The setting was to be different from a normal Final Fantasy game, with familiar characters exploring a [...] "Nordic" [...] version of Final Fantasy, and [...] "primarily set in a massive fortress" [...] according to Linda Dahlberg, a Grin associate producer. Other landscapes such as plains, forests, deserts and snowfields were also designed.|$|E
