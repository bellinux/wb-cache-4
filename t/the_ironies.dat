500|$|There {{are many}} {{accounts}} of Johnson suffering from bouts {{of depression and}} what Johnson thought might be madness. As Walter Jackson Bate puts it, [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> of literary history is that its most compelling and authoritative symbol of common sense—of the strong, imaginative grasp of concrete reality—should have begun his adult life, {{at the age of}} twenty, in a state of such intense anxiety and bewildered despair that, at least from his own point of view, it seemed the onset of actual insanity". To overcome these feelings, Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities, but this did not seem to help. Taylor said that Johnson [...] "at one time strongly entertained thoughts of Suicide". Boswell claimed that Johnson [...] "felt himself overwhelmed with an horrible melancholia, with perpetual irritation, fretfulness, and impatience; and with a dejection, gloom, and despair, which made existence misery".|$|E

40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{presented}} {{study was}} to investigate the influence of voice intonation on the comprehension of ironic utterances in 4 - to 6 -year-old Polish-speaking children. 83 preschool children were tested with <b>the</b> <b>Irony</b> Comprehension Task (Banasik & Bokus, 2012). In <b>the</b> <b>Irony</b> Comprehension Task, children are presented with stories in which ironic utterances were prerecorded and read by professional speakers using an ironic intonation. Half of the subjects performed <b>the</b> regular <b>Irony</b> Comprehension Task while the other half were given a modified version of <b>the</b> <b>Irony</b> Comprehension Task (ironic content was uttered using a non-ironic intonation). Results indicate that children from the ironic intonation group scored higher on <b>the</b> <b>Irony</b> Comprehension Task than children who heard ironic statements uttered using a neutral voice. Ironic voice intonation appeared to be a helpful cue to irony comprehension...|$|R
500|$|In 1974 {{the rock}} singer Alan Price {{released}} [...] the [...] "Jarrow Song", which helped {{to raise awareness}} of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. The town of Jarrow contains several commemorations, including a steel relief sculpture by Vince Rea at the new railway station, a tile mural designed by local schoolchildren, and a bronze sculpture—"The Spirit of the Crusade" [...] by Graham Ibbeson—in the town centre. Buildings and street names bear the names of Wilkinson and Riley. Perry writes that [...] "In Jarrow, landscape and memory have fused together, just as the red hot rivets once fastened great sheets of steel in Palmer's Yard".|$|E

The aims of this research are to identify, classify and analyze <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> and how they are illustrated in searching the Holy Grail and identify and analyze <b>the</b> placement of <b>irony</b> in searching <b>the</b> Holy Grail in novel The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. In conducting this research, the methodology used is descriptive method by Winarno (1984). The approach used in this research is intrinsic approach by Wellek and Warren (1977). Theory of irony by Landy (1972), <b>the</b> classification of <b>irony</b> from theory of Edgar V. Roberts (1983) and theory of plot by Tasrif (in Nurgiyantoro: 2002) are used to do the analysis. The results of this research show that <b>the</b> <b>irony</b> and its three types: verbal irony, dramatic irony and irony of situation are found in <b>the</b> novel. Verbal <b>irony</b> is illustrated through the character of Andre Vernet. Dramatic irony is illustrated through the character 2 ̆ 7 s statement of Teacher.

2500|$|Edith Terry, {{author of}} How Asia Got Rich, {{said that because}} Japanese people are [...] "mastering" [...] a [...] "Western game" [...] people have some pride {{and at the same}} time feel {{insecurity}} because the [...] "game" [...] is on [...] "Western terms" [...] rather than [...] "Japanese terms." [...] The standard presentation of Japanese names in English differs from the standard presentations of modern Chinese names, since modern Chinese names are usually not reversed to fit the western order in English, except when the Chinese person is living or traveling outside of China. The convention regarding Japanese names also differs from Korean names, which are usually in Korean order unless the Korean person is abroad. Power wrote that the difference between the treatment of Japanese names and of Chinese and Korean names often results in confusion. Terry wrote, [...] "it was one of <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> of the late twentieth century that Japan remained stranded in the formal devices underlining its historical quest for equality with the West, while China set its own terms, in language as in big-power politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Karnad {{started writing}} plays, Kannada {{literature}} was highly {{influenced by the}} renaissance in Western literature. Writers would choose a subject that looked entirely alien to manifestation of native soil. C. Rajagopalachari's version of the Mahabharata published in 1951, left a deep impact on him and soon, sometime in the mid-1950s, one day he experienced a rush of dialogues by characters from the Mahabharata in his adopted Kannada. [...] "I could actually hear the dialogues being spoken into my ears ... I was just the scribe," [...] said Karnad in a later interview. Yayati was published in 1961, when he was 23 years old. It {{is based on the}} story of King Yayati, one of the ancestors of the Pandavas, who was cursed into premature old age by his preceptor, Shukracharya, who was incensed at Yayati's infidelity. Yayati in turn asks his sons to sacrifice their youth for him, and one of them agrees. It ridicules <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> of life through characters in Mahabharata. It became an instant success, immediately translated and staged in several other Indian languages.|$|E

[...] As of 1989, Pinyin became the preferred romanization system in works discussing contemporary China, while English-language books relevant to Japanese history still used the Wade–Giles system to romanize Chinese names more often than other romanization systems. As of 1993, Wade–Giles was still used in Taiwan. Unlike mainland Chinese, Taiwanese people usually place a dash between the two characters of the given name, similar to Korean names. This is also the case for the standard styling of Hong Kong Chinese names, where the given name is hyphenated. Names of Malaysian Chinese and Singaporean Chinese people are often expressed in three parts.|$|E

2500|$|The play, however, doesn’t simply {{depict the}} fall of one order, it also depicts the rise of another; [...] "How the nation might have {{remained}} true to itself is signified by the words and deeds of Talbot. What she {{is in danger of}} becoming is signified by the shortcomings of the French, failings that crop up increasingly amongst Englishman [...] also manifest are an English decline towards French effeminacy and the beginnings of reliance upon fraud and cunning rather than manly courage and straightforward manly virtue." [...] If the old mode of honourable conduct is specifically represented by Talbot and Henry V, the new mode of duplicity and Machiavellianism is represented by Joan, who employs a type of warfare with which Talbot is simply unable to cope. This is seen most clearly when she sneaks into Rouen and subsequently refuses to face Talbot in a battle. Talbot finds this kind of behaviour incomprehensible and utterly dishonourable. As such, he finds himself fighting an enemy who uses tactics he is incapable of understanding; with the French using what he sees as unconventional methods, he proves unable to adapt. This represents one of <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> in the play's depiction of chivalry; it is the very resoluteness of Talbot's honour and integrity, his insistence in preserving an old code abandoned by all others, which ultimately defeats him; his inability to adjust means he becomes unable to function in the newly established 'dishonourable' context. As such, the play is not entirely nostalgic about chivalry; [...] "so often the tenets of chivalry are mocked by word and action. The play is full of moments of punctured aristocratic hauteur." ...|$|E
2500|$|The British scholar Margaret Kirkham {{argued that}} Austen was a feminist writer who liked complexity, humor, and in {{presenting}} puzzles for her readers, {{and many have}} missed the feminist irony {{of the character of}} Price. Kirkham argued that Austen was a feminist in the sense she believed that women were equally endowed with reason and common sense with men, and the ideal marriage should be between two people who love each other. Kirkham argued that Mansfield Park was an attack upon the Swiss writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s 1762 book Emile, or On Education and those influenced by him, which depicted the ideal woman as fragile, submissive, [...] and physically weaker than men. At the beginning of the novel, Price with her constant illnesses, timid disposition, submissiveness, and fragility conforms outwardly to Rousseau’s ideal woman, and she is miserable for it. Kirkham wrote that Price, through her reason and common sense is able to triumph in the end, which contradicts the prevailing ideal of femininity in Regency England. In the 1772 court case Somerset v Stewart, where slavery was declared by the Lord Justice Mansfield to be illegal in the United Kingdom (through not the British Empire), in a much quoted line, one of the lawyers for James Somerset, the slave demanding his freedom had said [...] "English air is too pure for slaves to breath", citing a ruling from a court case in 1569 freeing a Russian slave brought to England. Throughout the novel, Austen makes repeated references to the refreshing, wholesome quality of English air, an subtle attack upon Sir Thomas who owes slaves on his plantation in Antigua and treats Price in the earlier parts of the novel like a slave, yet enjoys the English air, oblivious to <b>the</b> <b>ironies</b> involved. Austen was an avid abolitionist who often read anti-slavery books, and it is likely she was familiar with Lord Mansfield's ruling that anyone who breathed English air was free and could never be a slave.|$|E

What was our shame and grief the next morning to find it was a cigar factory, and to learn that cigar and cigarette making was almost the chief industry of the mother Boston.
