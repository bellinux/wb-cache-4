Scully successfully resuscitates Lisa. Jason confronts his elderly self in the computer mainframe room at the cryogenic lab, where <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> has erased all of Jason's files from the computer. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> tells Jason that the success of their research made time travel possible, but also plunged the world into chaos. Jason lunges at <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> choking him. Wrapping his arms around his younger self, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> bursts into flames, and the fire consumes them both. Later, Lisa sets to work at the cryonics lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> replied. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> and requested that he become his student.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> is {{probably}} less than 250 years old, and may soon collapse. The stack is {{not mentioned in}} the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a headland exists at the point where <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> is now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> had been separated from the mainland.

5|$|The next day, Black finds a {{group of}} obelisks in the woods. He is about to examine one when Beebe appears, chased by dogs. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> also arrives, and Black asks him to call off his dogs. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> denies the dogs are his, but they retreat regardless. Black then sees that the obelisks all bear an ouroboros, {{the symbol of the}} Millennium Group. He visits the Old Man's home, where the two speak about the Group and its symbolism, and the coming millennium. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> then brings Black to a {{clearing}} full of the wild dogs, where the latter realizes they are embodiments of the evil in the world. He approaches them as stands his ground, being struck by several visions as he does so. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> then explains that the world's balance between good and evil is being lost as the millennium approaches, and that Beebe's home, built on sacred ground, {{is one of the many}} small things upsetting this balance.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> kills Dr. Yonechi (Hiro Kanagawa), a Japanese researcher, by {{pricking}} {{him with}} a metallic stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli (Susan Lee Hoffman), who recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound {{has not yet been}} invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he bursts into flames. Police receive a tip that <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne glasses in the cryology lab.

Elsewhere, an Odessa agent murders <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> in Frank's home; the loss serves to reunite Watts, Means and Black, who contrive a plan to strike back at Odessa. As the Elder conducts a funeral for <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man,</b> a carbomb kills his assassin, while Odessa's Paraguayan headquarters is destroyed and Knight's company is raided and closed.

Later that night Black is visited by Means and <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> (R. G. Armstrong), another high-ranking Group member. They explain to Black that the Group has, throughout history, been privy to scientific discoveries of which the public has no knowledge. Johnstone had theorised the existence of a tear in the universe which would reach Earth in several decades; his death may be connected to this theory. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> also explains that the Group has been infiltrated in the hopes of splintering it, by members of the Odessa network—a faction founded by fugitive Nazis which had previously been known for its anti-communist work and has now turned its focus to the Millennium Group.|$|E

It began when a young bespectacled male passenger tapped the shoulder of a middle-aged man in front of him who was chatting on his mobile phone, asking the man to lower his voice. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> later claimed that when he was tapped on the shoulder, he was under stress from an argument with his girlfriend and was calling the Samaritans. However, the younger man said that he was in fact merely chatting with friends. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> turned around and started a monologue, ranting about being unnecessarily provoked under stress. The younger man, who seldom talked back, expressed a desire to end the discussion. However, the middle-aged man insisted that the matter was not settled and requested an apology from him.
