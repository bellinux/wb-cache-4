The restaurant participates in the Disney Dining Plan. Meals are served starting at 10:30a.m. on Sundays and Wednesdays, and starting at 11:00a.m. every other day of the week. The restaurant closes each day {{at the same time that}} the park does, which is in the late evening. <b>The</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> the same all day, without a distinction between lunch and dinner. A full bar service is available, and there is also a limited wine selection.|$|E
5|$|The {{in-flight}} food is catered by TajSATS Air Catering, another {{joint venture}} between Tata and a Singaporean company, headed by Chef Arun Batra, formerly the executive chef of the Taj Hotels group. Vistara offers four different meals for each cabin for different {{time of the day}} — breakfast, refreshment, lunch and dinner with options of one vegetarian and one non-vegetarian dish in economy class; two vegetarian dishes and one non-vegetarian dish in premium economy; and two vegetarian and two non-vegetarian dishes for business-class cabin. <b>The</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> typically changed every seventh day and there are different menus for lunch and dinner.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> {{created by}} Bosi. He has been {{described}} as an innovator and his work has been compared to that of Heston Blumenthal at The Fat Duck. One of the new dishes Bosi introduced following his move to London was a two-part pork dish. The first part was roasted suckling pig served with sea urchin, kohlrabi and a fondant of sweet potato. The second, inspired by his daughter, featured a sausage roll with a salad and a truffle dressing. Other dishes have included roast chicken with an onion fondue and licorice, and desserts include a chocolate tart served with basil ice cream.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> restaurant's <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> {{influenced}} by <b>the</b> previous restaurants which Locatelli worked at, including The Savoy Hotel and at Olivio, where <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>was</b> centred on Italian peasant foods. It initially launched {{with a series}} of set price <b>menus,</b> with <b>the</b> idea that <b>the</b> <b>menus</b> would <b>be</b> changed on a monthly basis. The dishes avoid using butter as an ingredient, only one dish in <b>the</b> original 1995 <b>menu</b> <b>was</b> served with butter—a dish of pappardelle pasta with chicken livers and sage.|$|R

When playing certain Virtual Console titles, with the {{exception}} of the Nintendo 64 and Neo Geo, this will also create a suspend point.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> {{traditional}} American {{food with}} international influences. [...] Zagats [...] describes the cuisine as New American. Bernard Laskowski, formerly of Chicago restaurants Marche and mk, {{is the executive}} chef. The Park Cafe, adjacent to the Park Grill, offers takeout food such as salads and sandwiches.|$|E
500|$|Schwa has {{received}} positive reviews from the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune, Frommer's, and GQ, among others. [...] In 2006, Phil Vettel of the Chicago Tribune described the food as four-star quality, while giving the restaurant an overall rating of three stars (out of four) because of below-average service. Vettel added that nearly every item on <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> [...] "wonderful". Vettel returned to Schwa after the 2008 relaunch and concluded [...] "Schwa {{is at least}} as good as it was in its early days, and probably better". [...] He credited Carlson's increased focus on the dining room for the improvement, and maintained Schwa's three-star rating.|$|E
500|$|Schwa is a tiny, [...] {{restaurant}} {{located in}} the Wicker Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. [...] Seating 26, it features what chef Michael Carlson describes as a [...] "pared-down" [...] approach to food and {{has been described as}} being on the forefront of a new [...] "molecular gastronomy" [...] style of cooking. [...] <b>The</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> short and constantly changing. [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun Times, Allecia Vemillion calls dinner at Schwa [...] "a window into Carlson's own brain – laser-focused on food with little time for anything else." [...] Unlike typical upscale restaurants, Schwa does not have a wine list, a liquor license, or even stemware.|$|E

5000|$|Mac OS X {{features}} a completely redesigned Apple menu. System management functions from <b>the</b> Special <b>menu</b> have <b>been</b> merged into it. <b>The</b> Apple <b>menu</b> <b>was</b> missing entirely from the Mac OS X Public Beta, {{replaced by a}} nonfunctional Apple logo {{in the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> bar, but <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>was</b> restored in Mac OS X 10.0. The quick file access feature implemented in System 7 was removed, although a third-party utility, Unsanity's FruitMenu, restored <b>the</b> Apple <b>menu</b> to its classic functionality until it stopped working with the advent of OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard).|$|R
500|$|The menu at Schwa {{is hard to}} classify. Schwa chef Jonathan Ory {{describes}} it as [...] "modern American", but sous-chef Gaetano Nardulli disagrees: [...] "I don't think it's contemporary American, not at all." [...] Food critic Alan Richman {{describes it}} as [...] "one of a kind... earnest, innocent, irresistible, and imaginative". [...] <b>The</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> famous for using sophisticated ingredients to create, as one critic put it, [...] "poetic courses". [...] Surprising ingredients such as jellyfish, roe, tongue, and offal are found in {{a large number of}} dishes, as are unusual combinations such as oysters and oatmeal. [...] No portion of the meal is spared from experimentation; tomato sorbet finds its way into the salad, while the consommé soup features melon pieces.|$|E
500|$|The {{restaurant}} has fourteen tables, and can seat 42 diners. It {{has a very}} high proportion of chefs working at the restaurant, 42, equating to one chef per diner. Much of <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> developed by experimentation: for example, the egg and bacon ice cream came about following Blumenthal investigating the principles of [...] "flavour encapsulation". A research laboratory where Blumenthal and his team develop dishes is two doors away opposite the Hinds Head pub, which is also owned by the chef. It was {{where the majority of}} the laboratory scenes for the television series Heston Blumenthal: In Search of Perfection were filmed. The lab equipment includes a centrifuge which is used to make chocolate wine, and a vacuum oven. The restaurant takes reservations up to 2 months in advance, and in 2011 it was receiving some 30,000 calls for reservations per day, although that figure also included people who couldn't get through and were redialling.|$|E
500|$|...hack//frägment is a {{multiplayer}} {{online game}} {{based on the}} fictional MMORPG, The World. It was released only in Japan on November23, 2005 and online service ended on January18, 2007, after being extended two months because of its popularity. Famitsu Weekly gave [...]hack//frägment a cumulative score of 29 out of 40 over four reviews, much like its reviews of the main series. Designer Hiroshi Matsuyama described the game {{as a way to}} see how players would react to online play. The game uses the same game engine as the [...]hack video game series and thus, its gameplay is identical, with the exception of online mode. Players explore areas and fight monsters in real time. A major difference is that during online play, the action does not pause when <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> opened. Players may still use the skill [...] "Data Drain" [...] to weaken monsters and collect rare items. The user interface and control scheme are otherwise unchanged.|$|E

500|$|The {{series is}} typical of action {{role-playing}} games, in which players attack enemies in real time. The game's action pauses whenever <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> opened to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player directly controls Kite and the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide the computer-controlled characters with guidelines ("attack", [...] "first aid", [...] "magic", etc.) or issue direct commands. Most hostile creatures are contained within magic portals and combat will not begin until the player character approaches the portal and releases the monsters inside. Kite possesses a unique ability called [...] "Data Drain" [...] which allows him to transform these enemies into rare items. Many boss monsters are known as [...] "Data Bugs"—enemies with corrupted data which gives them infinite health. Data Drain is used to repair the damaged monsters' data and render them vulnerable but its use increases Kite's level of infection, randomly causing harmful side effects. The infection can be cured by defeating enemies without Data Drain.|$|E
500|$|The A-series has a {{capacity}} of 207 seated passengers, while the B-series has room for 250. The difference {{is due to the}} B-series having a smaller bistro and more compact seating. In the A-series, each of the four cars has seating in a different color (blue in BFM73 car, green in BMU73, red in BFR73, and yellow leather in BM73 and in the bistro area in BFR73). Originally, three of the cars had floors with carpet, while the fourth car (BFM73) had vinyl, of consideration to people with allergies. The carpets were removed in about 2005 as it was difficult to keep them clean. Seating is in two classes, standard and Komfort (originally [...] "Plus"); the latter (BM73 car) with leather seating and power supply for laptops. All the cars have cherry tree wood interior. The trains are equipped with a dining section (BFR73 car) and warm meals can be served at the seat or in the diner. <b>The</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> according to the time of day, with breakfasts in the morning and larger meals in the afternoon and evening. The trains also feature a family section with a play area and HC area (BFM73 car). The BFM73 car has also a bicycle room behind the driver's cab. From 2011, the trains are equipped with free wireless Internet.|$|E
2500|$|Simplitas/Smith's Arcadian {{restaurant}} {{has become the}} rage of London, as <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> that of the simple life. Simplitas, however, is not living and spreading the simple life as his Arcadian friends had hoped, but rather is having [...] "the time of his life." [...] Mrs. Smith becomes suspicious of Simplicitas, and in endeavouring to explain the reason for an all-night absence, he tells another lie. He falls into the ornamental well in the restaurant and emerges as his former self, with his bald head and shaggy whiskers, to the astonishment and somewhat to the confusion of his wife. Sombra and Chrysea, realising that their mission to make all London tell the truth has failed, return to Arcadia – but they leave two happy couples behind.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>menu</b> of Teremok <b>was</b> {{composed of}} {{several types of}} blini and kvass.

50|$|SAP {{transaction}} codes can be {{entered into the}} Transaction code field to navigate the user directly to the screen or program task bypassing <b>the</b> SAP <b>menu.</b> This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> preferred method of using SAP because navigating <b>the</b> <b>menus</b> <b>is</b> time-consuming {{and you need to}} know where to look in <b>the</b> <b>menus.</b> However, <b>the</b> user must know the transaction code.|$|R
50|$|Menus {{are backed}} with a {{slightly}} translucent solid gray, and when <b>menu</b> items <b>are</b> highlighted they appear blue.

Some are inside, {{some are}} outside, but <b>the</b> <b>menu</b> <b>is</b> essentially the same: hot dog with drink, pizza, frozen yogurt, various drinks, baked items, and sandwiches. Costco offers a quarter-pound 100% beef hot dog or Polish sausage and [...] drink (with refills) for US$1.50, the same price since 1985. In Australia, the hot dog is made of pork and is sold with a large soda for AUD$1.99. In Canada, the price for a hot dog and soda with refills is C$1.50. In Mexico, the hot dog is made of 100% beef and includes a drink (with refills) for Mex$30. In the UK, the hot dog is also made from beef and customers also get a drink (with refills) for £1.50. Costco sold more than 82 million quarter-pound (113 g) hot dogs in its food courts in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|There are, however, {{additional}} named items {{not on the}} menu, but {{available at}} every In-N-Out.

These variations include 3x3 (which has three patties and three slices of cheese), 4x4 (four patties and four slices of cheese), Neapolitan shakes, grilled cheese sandwich (consists of the same ingredients as the burgers except the meat, plus two slices of melted cheese), Protein style (wrap with lettuce; consists of the same ingredients as the burgers except buns), and Animal Style. Both Protein and Animal Style are house specialties {{that the company has}} trademarked because of their association with the chain.
