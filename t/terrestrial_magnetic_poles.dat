He attributed such changes to either a fluctuation in the Earth's magnetic intensity or the shifting positions of the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|E
40|$|One reconsiders the {{well-known}} principles of matter motion {{in space and}} time, retaining for the inertia principle the name of motion conservation principle and introducing a new principle of the space treble entity, that explain the composition and decomposition theorem of the vectorial magnitudes and permit {{a good understanding of}} the equations transformation, necessary to the relative motions. These considerations have a special importance in our recent studies after the years 1990, concerning the relative motions of the real fluids in mobile trihedrons being in a rotational or translation motion with respect to a fix trihedron, with outstanding results in the theory of turbo machines, of ocean currents and <b>magnetic</b> <b>terrestrial</b> <b>poles,</b> pipe vibration, tire hydroplaning, wave propagation, etc...|$|R

50|$|The <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> are {{relatively}} stationary in position {{over time and}} because of this, researchers often use magnetic minerals, like magnetite, {{in order to find}} at what latitude the continent was positioned relative to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> of that time. Since the continents have been moving relative to the pole; it is as if they were immobile and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> was moving instead. If enough data is collected, it is then possible to reconstruct the motion of the continents relative to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles.</b> The apparent polar wander is the path that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> appears to take according to the data on a continent. When multiple continents are moving relative to each other, the path their <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> will follow will be different from the others. Conversely, when two continents are moving parallel to each other their path will be the same.|$|R

5000|$|More plausibly, however, radio-quiet {{neutron stars}} {{may simply be}} pulsars which do not pulse in our direction. As pulsars spin, it is theorized they emit {{radiation}} from their <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles.</b> When the <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> do not lie on the axis of rotation, and cross the line {{of sight of the}} observer, one can detect radio emission emitted near the star's <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles.</b> Due to the star's rotation this radiation appears to pulse, colloquially called the [...] "lighthouse effect". Radio-quiet neutron stars may be neutron stars whose <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> do not point towards the Earth during their rotation.|$|R

5000|$|All magnets {{have two}} poles, where {{the lines of}} {{magnetic}} flux enter and emerge. By analogy with the Earth's magnetic field, these are called the magnet's [...] "north" [...] and [...] "south" [...] poles. The convention in early compasses was to call {{the end of the}} needle pointing to the Earth's North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> the [...] "north pole" [...] (or [...] "north-seeking pole") and the other end the [...] "south pole" [...] (the names are often abbreviated to [...] "N" [...] and [...] "S"). Because opposite poles attract, this definition means that the Earth's North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> is actually a <b>magnetic</b> south <b>pole</b> and the Earth's South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> is a <b>magnetic</b> north <b>pole.</b>|$|R

50|$|Its {{southern}} hemisphere counterpart is the South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole.</b> Since the Earth's magnetic field {{is not exactly}} symmetrical, the North and South <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Poles</b> are not antipodal, meaning that a straight line drawn {{from one to the}} other does not pass through the geometric centre of the Earth.|$|R
25|$|A {{geomagnetic}} storm causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, {{and bring the}} aurora to lower latitudes. It was hardly ever seen near the geographic pole, which is about 2000km away from the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole.</b> The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval") is slightly different, being centered about 3–5 degrees nightward of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole,</b> so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> in question is in between the observer and the Sun. The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called magnetic midnight.|$|R

500|$|One way {{to define}} a pole is as {{a point where the}} {{magnetic}} field is vertical. This can be determined by measuring the inclination.

They can migrate rapidly: movements of up to [...] per year have been observed for the North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole.</b> Over the last 180 years, the North <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Pole</b> has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the Boothia Peninsula in 1831 to [...] from Resolute Bay in 2001.

30|$|The north <b>magnetic</b> dip <b>pole</b> {{velocity}} {{has more}} than doubled in the last 30 years. This observation, together with the decrease in the Earth’s magnetic dipole intensity over the last century has raised the concern of a possible approaching polarity reversal. We show that this rapid variation is in fact to be expected, and will not affect the dipolar field as a whole, but only the north <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole.</b> We demonstrate how this rapid displacement of the north <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> is made possible by the horizontal field morphology. This rapid variation of north <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> position does not imply any important modification of the core processes associated with field generation. The north <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> position being very sensitive to small as well as rapid variations of the field, we show that it can very effectively be used as a passive tracer (or indicator) of field variations. Indeed, its velocity over the last century very accurately indicates the geomagnetic impulses (or jerks) that were so far observed only in observatory data.|$|R

2500|$|The {{magnetic}} compass is very reliable at moderate latitudes, but in geographic regions near the Earth's <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles</b> it becomes unusable. [...] As the compass is {{moved closer to}} one of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>poles,</b> the <b>magnetic</b> declination, the difference between the direction to geographical north and magnetic north, becomes greater and greater. At some point close to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>pole</b> the compass will not indicate any particular direction but will begin to drift. Also, the needle starts to point up or down when getting closer to the poles, because of the so-called magnetic inclination. Cheap compasses with bad bearings may get stuck because of this and therefore indicate a wrong direction.|$|R
