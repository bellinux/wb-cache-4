40|$|The {{subject of}} topological {{materials}} has attracted immense attention in condensed-matter physics, because they host new quantum states of matter containing Dirac, Majorana, or Weyl fermions. Although Majorana fermions can only {{exist on the}} surface of topological superconductors, Dirac and Weyl fermions can be realized in both 2 D and 3 D materials. The latter are semimetals with Dirac/Weyl cones either not <b>tilted</b> (<b>type</b> I) or <b>tilted</b> (<b>type</b> II). Although both Dirac and Weyl fermions have massless nature with the nontrivial Berry phase, the formation of Weyl fermions in 3 D semimetals require either time-reversal or inversion symmetry breaking to lift degeneracy at Dirac points. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that canted antiferromagnetic BaMnSb 2 is a 3 D Weyl semimetal with a 2 D electronic structure. The Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations of the magnetoresistance give nearly zero effective mass with high mobility and the nontrivial Berry phase. The ordered magnetic arrangement (ferromagnetic ordering in the ab plane and antiferromagnetic ordering along the c axis below 286 K) breaks the time-reversal symmetry, thus offering us an ideal platform to study magnetic Weyl fermions in a centrosymmetric material...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{feasibility}} study of jet propulsion for remote operated vehicles (ROV’s). The concept {{of using a}} <b>tilting</b> <b>type</b> nozzle for improved maneuverability is discussed. Though the propulsion efficiency of jets is less {{compared to that of}} the propeller for the velocity ranges usually encountered in ROV movements, the implementation of jet propulsion is considered in view of the advantages in improving maneuvering qualities. Also, the simplicity of the system and les complexity in pressure compensation adds to its advantages. This study concentrates on the selection of an optimum nozzle configuration for ROV’s. [...] An experimental set-up was designed and fabricated for this investigation. Ten different plexi-glass conical nozzles were used for five different circular disk shaped drag plates, simulating the drag of the ROV motion under water. Energy losses were determined both experimentally and theoretically. Wall effects encountered in the experimental tank were compensated by towing the model in an open water wave tank for the same range of speeds. It was found that the propulsion efficiency is maximum for one particular nozzle over a wide range of flow rates encountered in the experiments. Finally, a feasible design of a jet propelled ROV with <b>tilting</b> <b>type</b> nozzles is presented. This design could be fabricated and tested for commercial production...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{downlink}} of a multicell MIMO system where clusters of multi-antenna base stations jointly serve multiple single-antenna users, {{commonly referred to}} as a network MIMO system. Most of the previous studies on network MIMO have only considered the azimuth pattern of the antenna, while ignoring the elevation pattern. In this paper, we consider both the azimuth and the elevation patterns and investigate the impact of the elevation angle tuning parameter, denoted as the antenna tilt, on the performance of such systems. Using system simulations, it is shown that the promised performance gains of network MIMO systems over conventional non-coordinated systems, crucially depend on the choice of the right tilt setting including the <b>tilt</b> <b>type,</b> i. e., mechanical or electrical, and the tilt angle.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for characterizing the full five {{parameter}} heterophase interface character distributions (HICD) using two-dimensional electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) images. We apply the HICD method to determine the orientation relationships and three-dimensional normal vectors of Cu-Nb interfaces in both physical vapor-deposited (PVD) pure Cu-Nb (4 μm individual layer thickness) and accumulative roll-bonded (ARB) alloyed Cu-Nb multilayer composites (200 - 600 nm layer thickness). The HICD analysis shows that { 1 1 2 } Cu planes are most preferentially and frequently bonded with { 1 1 2 } Nb planes with Kurdjumov-Sachs and Nishiyama-Wasserman misorientations in the ARB alloyed Cu-Nb multilayers. These interfaces differ from the { 1 1 1 } Cu||{ 1 1 0 } Nb interfaces predominantly found in the PVD pure Cu-Nb multilayered thin films. Also, pure <b>tilt</b> <b>type</b> interfaces with a [1 1 1]/ 30 ° misorientation and { 1 1 0 } Cu planes bonded to { 1 1 2 } Nb planes were found in ARB alloyed Cu-Nb multilayers. In the ARB material the observed Cu-Nb interfaces differ from what would be obtained from random pairings of the Cu and Nb orientations {{in terms of the}} relative intensities (in multiples of random distribution) and shapes of the interface normal peaks, which indicates that these interfaces were preferentially selected during the high strain ARB process. The measured ARB textures along the interface also differ from the theoretical rolling textures for each bulk single phase metal, suggesting that during ARB layer refinement these interfaces have some influence on slip activity by constraining grain deformation or through the kinetics of dislocation-interface interactions. close 383...|$|E

The fraction of statically recrystallized (SRX) grains progressively increased with the holding time and closely matched the softening fraction measured from the offset flow stress approach. The corresponding texture was weak and preserved its character with the holding time.

With {{the current}} lack of {{clinically}} relevant classification methods of septal deviation, computer-generated models are important, as septal cartilage is indistinguishable on current imaging methods, making preoperative planning difficult.

Regardless of the force direction, with increasing force, the septum first <b>tilts</b> (<b>type</b> I) and then crumples into a C shape (type II) and finally into an S shape (type III).

The data are discussed particularly in terms of the distribution of boundary planes, and also with respect to the potential relationship between the planes distribution and the misorientation distribution. Approximately 20, 000 grains comprised the total sample population, giving rise to more than 77, 000 grain boundary line segments. This {{is the first time that}} the orientation of a large sample population of grain boundary planes has been measured in a grain boundary engineered material. The most important findings of the investigation were that the distribution of planes shows a prevalence of tilt boundaries, especially asymmetric <b>tilt</b> <b>types,</b> and the presence of twist boundaries. This distribution is a consequence of the low energy of these boundary types. Furthermore more than three-quarters of boundaries could be considered to be ‘potentially special’.
