40|$|After lentectomy {{through the}} pupillary hole, the outer cornea of larval Xenopus laevis can undergo {{transdifferentiation}} <b>to</b> <b>regenerate</b> <b>a</b> new lens. This process is elicited by inductive factor(s) {{produced by the}} neural retina and accumulated into the vitreous chamber. During embryogenesis, the outer cornea develops from the outer layer of the presumptive lens ectoderm (PLE) {{under the influence of}} the eye cup and the lens. In this study, we investigated whether the capacity of the outer cornea <b>to</b> <b>regenerate</b> <b>a</b> lens is the result of early inductive signals causing lens-forming bias and lens specification of the PLE, or late inductive signals causing cornea formation or both signals. Fragments of larval epidermis or cornea developed from ectoderm that had undergone only one kind of inductive signals, or both kinds of signals, or none of them, were implanted into the vitreous chamber of host larvae. The regeneration potential and the lens-forming transformations of the implants were tested using an antisense probe for pax 6 as an earlier marker of lens formation and a monoclonal antibody anti-lens as a definitive indicator of lens cell differentiation. Results demonstrated that the capacity of the larval outer cornea <b>to</b> <b>regenerate</b> <b>a</b> lens is the result of both early and late inductive signals and that either early inductive signals alone or late inductive signals alone can elicit this capacity...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Retinal {{regeneration}} research {{holds potential}} for providing new avenues {{for the treatment}} of degenerative diseases of the retina. Various animal models have been used to study retinal regeneration over the years, providing insights into different aspects of this process. However the mechanisms that drive this important phenomenon remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we introduce and characterize a new model system for retinal regeneration research that uses the tadpole of the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. Methods: The neural retina was surgically removed from Xenopus laevis tadpoles at stages 51 – 54, and a heparin-coated bead soaked in fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF- 2) was introduced in the eyes to induce regeneration. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses as well as DiI tracing were performed <b>to</b> characterize the <b>regenerate.</b> <b>A</b> similar surgical approach but with concomitant removal of the anterior portion of the eye was used to assess the capacity of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) <b>to</b> <b>regenerate</b> <b>a</b> retina. Immunohistochemistry for FGF receptors 1 and 2 and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (pERK) was performed to start elucidating the intracellular mechanisms involved in this process. The role of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was confirmed through a pharmacological approach using the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U 0126. Results: We observed that Xenopus laevis tadpoles were able <b>to</b> <b>regenerate</b> <b>a</b> neural retina upon induction with FGF- 2 in vivo.
