Her Campuss Kelly Tierney noted the enthusiasm displayed by Oliver's fans during the segment and wrote: While John Oliver simply considers himself a comedian, it is apparent that he is doing much more than comedy. [...] He informs us of real issues we otherwise wouldn't hear or think deeply about, which in and of itself is brilliant, but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action about these issues. He shows us that there really is something we can do and helps us <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> can enact change.|$|E

[...] Taylor's deputy, U. Alexis Johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem. He suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately, they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart. He proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the HNC rather than the dissolution of the entire body, hoping the HNC could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory. The four officers did not give a clear answer to Johnson's idea, indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying [...] "the door is not closed".|$|E
500|$|Moore {{stated in}} 1985 {{that if the}} limited series was well-received, he and Gibbons would {{possibly}} create a 12-issue prequel series called Minutemen featuring the 1940s superhero group from the story. DC offered Moore and Gibbons chances to publish prequels to the series, such as Rorschach's Journal or The Comedian's Vietnam War Diary, as well as hinting {{at the possibility of}} other authors using the same universe. Tales of the Comedian's Vietnam War experiences were floated because The 'Nam was popular at the time, while another suggestion was, according to Gibbons, for a [...] "Nite Owl/Rorschach team" [...] (in the manner of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)). Neither man felt the stories would have gone anywhere, with Moore particularly adamant that DC not go forward with stories by other individuals. Gibbons was more attracted {{to the idea of a}} Minutemen series, because it would have [...] " [...] homage to the simplicity and unsophisticated nature of Golden Age comic books—with the added dramatic interest that it would be a story whose conclusion is already known. It would be, perhaps, interesting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> got to the conclusion." ...|$|E

At the committee's inaugural meeting, Livni characterized the Palestinian motion as [...] "part of an orchestrated diplomatic and legal struggle that is meant to create legitimacy for a Palestinian state with all that that means, and to deny legitimacy to the State of Israel." [...] She argued that despite the lack of attention it receives, [...] " [...] is a war front as any other." [...] The committee's mandate, according to Livni, is to [...] "deal with lawfare not only <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> can defend ourselves, but also to try to change international trends against Israel in a legal context and how to deal with moves the Palestinians are trying to make over Israel's head." ...|$|E

Kỳ explained that the situation mandated {{the dissolution of the}} council, saying [...] "We know you want stability, but you cannot have stability until you have unity". He claimed that some HNC members were disseminating coup rumors and creating doubt among the population and that [...] "both military and civilian leaders regard the presence of these people in the High National Council as divisive of the Armed Forces due to their influence". Kỳ then promised that he would explain the decision at a media conference and that he and his colleagues would return to their military roles in the near future. Thiệu said [...] "I do not see how our action has hurt the Hương government ... Hương now has the full support of the Army and has no worries from the High National Council, which we have eliminated".

2500|$|Britain's {{economic}} {{weakness and}} {{its dependence on}} the financial support of the United States (Britain had received a large American loan in 1946 and the Marshall Plan began in mid-1947), left him little alternative but to yield to American pressure over Palestine policy. At the reconvened London Conference in January 1947, the Jewish negotiators were only prepared to accept partition and the Arab negotiators only a unitary state (which would automatically have had an Arab majority). Neither would accept limited autonomy under British rule. When no agreement could be reached, Bevin threatened to hand the problem over to the United Nations. The threat failed to move either side, the Jewish representatives because they believed that Bevin was bluffing and the Arabs because they believed that their cause would prevail before the General Assembly. Bevin accordingly {{announced that he would}} [...] "ask the UN to take the Palestine question into consideration." [...] A week later, the strategic logic of Britain retaining a presence in Palestine was removed when the intention to withdraw from India in August of that year was announced. The decision to allow the United Nations to dictate the future of Palestine was formalised by the Attlee government's public declaration in February 1947 that Britain's Mandate in Palestine had become [...] "unworkable." [...] Of the UN partition plan which resulted, Bevin commented: [...] "The majority proposal is so manifestly unjust to the Arabs that it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> could reconcile it with our conscience." [...] During the remainder of the Mandate, fighting between the Jewish and Arab communities intensified. The end of the Mandate and Britain's final withdrawal from Palestine was marked by the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the start of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when five Arab states intervened in the inter-communal fighting. [...] The Arab armies were led by the state with that position which was most effective, Jordan, whose military forces were trained and led by British officers. The war ended with Israel, in addition to the territory assigned by the UN {{for the creation of a}} Jewish state, also in control of much of the Mandate territory which had been assigned by the UN for the creation of an Arab state. The remainder was divided between Jordan and Egypt. Hundreds of thousands of, overwhelmingly Arab, civilians had become displaced.|$|E

We will program in simulink <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> can <b>we</b> simulate a sine wave and obtain a optimized wave. Also <b>we</b> will <b>see</b> <b>how</b> can <b>we</b> change the initial conditions of our parameters in simulation on the run. Secondly we will build a finite state machine that will show a tradeoff between position and velocity using sine wave. It is encountered with many usual problems. We will fix those problems using simulation in simulink at small intervals of time...|$|R
