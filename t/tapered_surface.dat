50|$|The USP is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol with a {{mechanically locked}} breech using the short recoil method of operation. This rather conventional lock-up system {{has a large}} rectangular lug over the barrel’s chamber that rides into and engages the ejection port cut-out in the slide. When a cartridge is fired, pressures generated by the ignited powder drive the cartridge casing back against the breech face on the slide, driving back both the barrel and slide as they remain locked together in the manner described above. After 3 mm of unrestricted rearward travel, the projectile has left the barrel and gas pressures have dropped to a safe level. A shaped lug {{on the underside of}} the barrel chamber comes into contact with a hooked locking block at the end of the steel recoil spring guide rod, lowering the rear end of the barrel and stopping the barrel's rearward movement. The recoil spring assembly is held in place by the slide stop lever’s axis pin and a round cut-out at the front of the slide. For enhanced reliability in high-dust environments, the locking surface on the front top of the barrel’s locking lug is tapered with a forward slope. This <b>tapered</b> <b>surface</b> produces a camming action which assists in positive lock-up in the presence of heavy fouling and debris. In this way, the USP shares many design features with the M1911 pistol, although apparently updated for easier operation.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Retrieval {{analysis}} of metal-on-metal hip stems showed negligible wear (< 1 mm 3) {{of the male}} <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> in all cases. This supports retention of a well-fixed, undamaged stem during revision surgery Introduction. Wear and corrosion at the taper junction of metal-on-metal total hip replacements (MOM-THR) is likely {{to contribute to the}} high revision rates reported by joint registries. Studies have shown significant volumes of measured material loss at the female <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> (femoral head), but no study has reported data for the male <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> (stem). The decision to retain a well-fixed stem at revision is uncertain, particularly in cases where the taper junction may be responsible for the need for revision surgery. This is an important consideration given the increasing burden of MOM revisions and the considerable increase in morbidity associated with revision of the stem. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure the volume of material loss of both the ‘female’ and ‘male’ <b>taper</b> <b>surfaces</b> and determine the relative contribution of each to the total material loss at the taper junction. Methods. This was a retrospective study of 90 retrieved components from revision surgery of large diameter MOM-THRs, in which revision included removal of the stem. The series included four contemporary metal-on-metal bearing designs and six different stem designs. We recorded all commonly reported clinical data. We then measured the volume of material loss from each of the <b>taper</b> and bearing <b>surfaces</b> using a validated method. Additionally, each of the <b>taper</b> <b>surfaces</b> were examined microscopically and corrosion was graded according to a well-published four-tiered classification. Results. The median volume of material lost from the male <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> was 0. 29 mm 3 (0. 00 - 0. 83). This was significantly less than the median volume of material lost from the female <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> (p < 0. 001), which was 1. 31 mm 3 (0. 57 - 17. 03).

40|$|Assessment of the head-stem taper {{junction}} {{requires the}} estimation of material loss from the <b>taper</b> <b>surfaces</b> of both femoral head and stem. This paper describes a method for the measurement and analysis of material loss from the modular taper junction of hip replacements, in particular femoral stem tapers where generally the entire <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> has been engaged. In such cases no direct unworn datum is readily identifiable to assess material loss. The highly anisotropic topology of some stem designs poses additional challenges to the measurement and analysis process. Estimation of material loss of retrieved femoral stems is further complicated by retrieval damage or surface deposits often present on the <b>taper</b> <b>surface.</b> The femoral head tapers typically exhibit areas of pristine surface attributed to the difference in taper length compared to the engaging stem. These areas can be selected as unworn when employed in the analysis process, provided they do not show surface damage or deposits. Measurement of the <b>taper</b> <b>surfaces</b> has been performed using a Talyrond (Ametek, Inc., US) out-of-roundness measurement instrument equipped with a 5 µm diamond tip stylus. Vertical axial traces were employed to digitize the <b>surface</b> of the <b>taper.</b> Measurement data has been analyzed using a multi stage process that has been specifically adapted for stem tapers.

The <b>taper</b> <b>surfaces</b> of femoral heads and trunnions of femoral stems are generally machined to a certain roughness to enhance fixation. However, {{the effect of the}} surface roughness of these surfaces on the fixation, wear and consequently clinical outcomes of the design is largely unknown. In this study, we asked whether a micro-grooved trunnion surface finish (1) improves the fixation and (2) reduces the wear rate at the taper junction of THRs. We used 3 D finite element (FE) models of THRs to, firstly, investigate the effect of initial fixation of a Cobalt-Chromium femoral head with a smooth <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> mated with a Titanium (1) micro-grooved and (2) smooth, trunnion surface finishes. Secondly, we used a computational FE wear model to compare the wear evolution between the models, which was then validated against wear measurements of the <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> of explanted femoral heads. The fixation at the taper junction was found to be better for the smooth couplings. Over a 7 million load cycle analysis in-silico, the linear wear depth and the total material loss was around 3. 2 and 1. 4 times higher for the femoral heads mated with micro-grooved trunnions. It was therefore concluded that smooth <b>taper</b> and trunnion <b>surfaces</b> will provide better fixation at the taper junction and reduce the volumetric wear rates...|$|R
40|$|Introduction It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the release of metal debris due to mechanical wear, fretting and corrosion at the head-stem taper junction may contribute to the high revision rates of MOM-THAs [1, 2]. A peer reviewed, semi-quantitative corrosion and fretting scoring system of the femoral stem and head tapers using visual assessment, was developed by Goldberg et al. [3]. This method involves assigning scores on a scale of 1 (no visible signs of corrosion or fretting) to 4 (severe corrosion or fretting) based on the prevalence of black debris, pits or etch marks (corrosion) and fretting scars. However, this method has not been validated and the reproducibility of such a measure is unknown. Furthermore, whilst scoring a component allows the examiner to quickly quantify the appearance of <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> damage in the form of corrosion or fretting, it is unclear as to how this relates to the actual volume of material loss at the taper. The aims of this study were to: (1) determine the inter-observer variability of the visual scoring method for the assessment of corrosion and fretting of MOM-THA taper junctions; (2) determine the prevalence and severity of corrosion and fretting at the taper junction; (3) determine the strength of correlation between corrosion and fretting scores and the actual volume of material lost at the taper junction. Methods Macroscopic and stereomicroscopic examinations of the head <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> of 150 retrieved MOM-THA implants were performed by two experienced independent observers using methods previously defined [3] to assess corrosion and fretting. Both observers were blinded to all other clinical and component data. A Leica M 50 microscope with x 40 magnification was used to examine each surface. The visual appearance of fretting was considered as regions of the <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> that were damaged with small scars running perpendicular to the circumferential machine lines of the taper screw thread. The visual appearance of corrosion was defined as regions of discolouration or dullness on the <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> or the presence of black debris, pits or etch marks. The prevalence of corrosion and fretting was quantified using a scoring scale of 1 (none) to 4 (severe), as described previously [3]. Corrosion and fretting scores were assigned to the distal and proximal regions of the <b>taper</b> <b>surface,</b> Figure 1. Overall scores for corrosion and fretting were then assigned to each taper following assessment of each surface as a whole. The volume of material loss at each of the <b>taper</b> <b>surfaces</b> was measured using a Talyrond 365 (Hobson, Leicester, UK) roundness measuring machine, using a published method [4]. The corrosion score relating to the overall <b>surface</b> of each <b>taper</b> was plotted against the measured volume of material loss. All statistical analysis was performed using Stata/IC version 12. 1 [StataCorp, College Station, TC, USA] and throughout a p value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Cohen’s weighted Kappa statistic (κ) was used to measure the inter-observer agreement of the Goldberg scores [5]. Kappa values were assessed using the criteria described by Landis and Koch where κ ≤ 0 = poor, 0. 01 to 0. 20 = slight, 0. 21 to 0. 40 = fair, 0. 41 to 0. 60 = moderate, 0. 61 to 0. 80 = substantial, 0. 81 to 1 = almost perfect [6]. Neither the volumetric measurement data nor corrosion scores were normally distributed. Therefore, to determine the strength of correlation between the two, we used the Spearman Rank test. Results Table 1 summarises the inter-observer agreement data for the Goldberg scores of the <b>taper</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The observed agreement for the overall corrosion and fretting scores were 95...|$|R

A second type of sleeve was machined through both facing and turning with polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) and plunge grinding with Al 2 O 3 wheels. The results indicated that when turning using mixed alumina inserts, better surface finish was obtained using the uncoated insert and appreciable differences between the two grades were not observed for the dimensional and squareness deviations. When comparing turning with PCBN and plunge grinding, considerable differences in the surface roughness results were observed, i. e., when generating a <b>tapered</b> <b>surface,</b> lower Ra values were given by grinding, whereas when producing a flat surface, best results were recorded after face turning.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} model is used to predict the oscillatory flow through tapered cylindrical tube sections (jet pumps). The asymmetric shape of jet pumps results in a time-averaged pressure drop {{that can be used}} to suppress Gedeon streaming in closed-loop thermoacoustic devices. However, previous work has shown that flow separation in the diverging flow direction counteracts the time-averaged pressure drop. In this work, the characteristics of flow separation in jet pumps are identified and coupled with the observed jet pump performance. Furthermore, it is shown that the onset of flow separation can be shifted to larger displacement amplitudes by designs that have a smoother transition between the small opening and the <b>tapered</b> <b>surface</b> of the jet pump. These design alterations also reduce the duration of separated flow, resulting in more effective and robust jet pumps. To make the proposed jet pump designs more compact without reducing their performance, the minimum big opening radius that can be implemented before the local minor losses have an influence on the jet pump performance is investigated. To validate the numerical results, they are compared with experimental results for one of the proposed jet pump designs.

40|$|Corrosion of modular taper {{junctions}} of hip implants may {{be associated}} with clinical failure. Taper design parameters, as well as the intraoperatively applied assembly forces, have been proposed to affect corrosion. Fretting corrosion is related to relative interface shear motion and fluid ingress, which may vary with contact force and area. It was hypothesised in this study that assembly forces modify the extent and distribution of the surface contact area at the taper interface between a cobalt chrome head and titanium stem taper with a standard threaded surface profile. Local abrasion of a thin gold coating applied to the stem taper prior to assembly was used to determine the contact area after disassembly. Profilometry was then used to assess permanent deformation of the stem <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> profile. With increasing assembly force (500 N, 2000 N, 4000 N and 8000 N) the number of stem <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> profile ridges in contact with the head taper was found to increase (9. 2 ± 9. 3 %, 65. 4 ± 10. 8 %, 92. 8 ± 6. 0 % and 100 %) and the overall taper area in contact was also found to increase (0. 6 ± 0. 7 %, 5. 5 ± 1. 0 %, 9. 9 ± 1. 1 % and 16. 1 ± 0. 9 %). Contact was inconsistently distributed over the length of the taper. An increase in plastic radial deformation of the surface ridges (- 0. 05 ± 0. 14 μm, 0. 1 ± 0. 14 μm, 0. 21 ± 0. 22 μm and 0. 96 ± 0. 25 μm) was also observed with increasing assembly force. The limited contact of the <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> ridges at lower assembly forces may influence corrosion rates, suggesting that the magnitude of the assembly force may affect clinical outcome. The method presented provides a simple and practical assessment of the contact area at the taper interface...|$|R

40|$|Liquid {{dispensing}} {{and writing}} in the extremely small size regime are important for applications in many current technologies, such as micro/nano fabrication, biological/chemical patterning and analysis, and drug discovery. Most of current dispensing/writing methods can be sorted into a category of liquid flowing through tiny tubes or nozzles that requires inputting an impulse energy, which leads to complex procedures, expensive equipment and narrow material applicability, especially for biomaterials. Here, we report a method {{that may lead to}} a new category: liquid flows over the <b>tapered</b> <b>surface</b> of a pin with longitudinal nano grooves on the surface to uninterruptedly perform droplet dispensing and direct writing. The dispensed droplet diameters were controllable from several microns down to 150 nm, and the written line heights were as low as 5 nm. The mechanism underlying automatic liquid storage on conical surface and spontaneous liquid transport through nano grooves is revealed and well modeled by a simple relationship. Furthermore, the nano-grooved pins are much simpler and cheaper in fabrication than nanoscale tubes and nozzles, and pins have much depressed clogging problems that are typically troublesome for tubes and nozzles. Our new strategy may constitute a basis for creating liquid dispensing/writing technologies that are simultaneously smaller, simpler, faster and applicable for more types of materials.

40|$|Abstract. Soda-Lime {{glass is}} a very hard and brittle {{material}} which is commonly used as window panels and many other common applications. Due to its low fracture toughness {{it is very difficult}} to machine and obtain good surface finish under nornal cutting conditions. Hence, machining has to be done in ways to avoid brittle fracture on the finished machined surface. Such machining is only possible under ductile mode machining conditions when the removal of material is performed in the plastic state. However, ductile mode machining requires that during machining the temperature generated in the cutting zone in the working temperature range of glass to avoid crack formation during machining. This makes all types of machining of glass an extremely challenging affair, given the current state and mode of mechanical machining. This research paper elucidates the results of an experimental study for determination of critical depth of cut as a function of cutting parameters in high speed end milling of soda-lime glass. The critical depth is defined as the depth of cut at which crack formation the material is initiated for a given high speed attachment. In determining the critical depth as well as the ductile brittle transition depth, machining was performed on a <b>tapered</b> <b>surface.</b> Vibration signals from an accelerometer in time domain (amplitude vs. time display) and the surface characteristics were used in identifying the critical depth of cut. The new method has been found to be useful in online determination of the critical depth, as well as the brittle-ductile transition depth, for generating crack-free surfaces with good surface finish in high speed end milling of soda lime glass...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{nitriding}} {{is known}} to be an effective method to improve the surface hardness and wear resistance of titanium and its alloys. However, the process requires a gas chamber and this greatly limits the practicability for treating orthopaedic implants which involve complex-shaped parts or curved surfaces, such as the <b>tapered</b> <b>surface</b> in a femoral stemor the ball-shaped surface in a femoral head. To tackle this problem, a direct laser nitriding process in open atmosphere was performed on commercially pure titanium (grade 2, TiG 2) and Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy (grade 5, TiG 5) using a continuous-wave (CW) fibre laser. The effects of varying process parameters, for instance laser power and nitrogen pressure on the surface quality, namely discolouration were quantified using ImageJ analysis. The optimised process parameters to produce the gold-coloured nitride surfaces were also identified: 40 W(laser power), 25 mm/s (scanning speed), 1. 5 mm(standoff distance) and 5 bar (N 2 pressure). Particularly, N 2 pressure at 5 barwas found to be the threshold above which significant discolouration will occur. The surface morphology, composition, microstructure, micro-hardness, and tribological properties, particularly hydrodynamic size distribution of wear debris, were carefully characterized and compared. The experimental results showed that TiG 2 and TiG 5 reacted differently with the laser radiation at 1. 06 μm wavelength in laser nitriding as evidenced by substantial differences in the microstructure, and surface colour and morphology. Furthermore, both friction andwear properties were strongly affected by the hardness and microstructure of titaniumsamples and direct laser nitriding led to substantial improvements in their wear resistant properties. Between the two types of titanium samples, bare TiG 2 showed higher friction forces and wear rates, but this trend was reversed after laser nitriding treatments...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: There is a {{two-fold}} {{difference in}} failure rate {{between the two}} most commonly used metal-on-metal (MOM) bearing types in the US. We compared these two bearing types; one with a 36 mm diameter with a modular cup and one with a diameter > 36 mm with a monoblock cup. Methods: This was a retrospective study involving 60 retrieved LD-MOM-THR hips of 2 different cobalt-chromium bearing designs (n= 30 in each group) from a single manufacturer that had been paired with a single cementless titanium 12 / 14 stem design from the same manufacturer (Table 1). One group consisted of a monoblock cup whilst the other had a modular cup design with separate metal shell and liner components. Paired t-tests revealed that {{the two groups were}} statistically matched in relation to patient age, gender and time to revision. We used a well-published scoring method to visually assess the severity of corrosion at each head <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> on a scale of 1 (none) to 4 (severe). We then used a roundness-measuring machine to measure the volume of material loss at the <b>taper</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The statistical significance of any differences between the two hip designs in relation to corrosion scores and material loss were then evaluated. Results: We found that 93...|$|R

Retrieved hips have {{a wide range of}} wear rates of their bearing and <b>taper</b> <b>surfaces</b> and there is no agreement regarding the cause of failure. Detailed visual inspection {{is the first step in}} the forensic examination of failed hip components and may help explain the mechanisms of failure. The aim of this study was to determine if there was a correlation between the results of detailed inspections and the volumetric wear of the bearing and <b>taper</b> <b>surfaces</b> of retrieved hips. Method Detailed, non-destructive macroscopic and stereomicroscopic examinations of 89 retrieved MOM hip components were performed by a single experienced examiner using quantitative assessment to document the severity of 10 established damage features: Light scratches, Moderate scratches, Heavy scratches, Embedded particles, Discolouration, Haziness, Pitting, Visible wear zone, Corrosion, Fretting Each surface was considered in terms of zones comprising of quadrants (cup, head, and taper) and subquadrants (cup and head), Figure 1. Each zone was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 by determining the percentage of the surface area of the zone that exhibited the feature in question: a score of 0 = 0...|$|R
30|$|The joints {{fabricated}} using STC and TAC pin profile, {{using both}} cooling medium, resulted in defects at the stir zone. The plain, featureless surface area offers lower friction over the plasticized material which promotes slipping condition. In addition, the featureless surface cannot direct the material flow intensively. Palanivel et al. {{reported that the}} plain <b>taper</b> <b>surface</b> results drop in frictional heat because of lower heat generation during sliding over sticking condition (Palanivel et al. 2012). Thus, an insufficient heat state is prevailing in the SZ while using the above two pin profiles.|$|R
