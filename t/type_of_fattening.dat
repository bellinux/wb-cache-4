The research was carried out on 57 <b>fattening</b> pigs <b>of</b> both sex, divided into two groups by their housing. Each group consisted of pigs of two genotypes, i. e. three-way crossbreeds of Large White and German Landrace (LW x GL) in the dam line, and of German Landrace and 8 Pietrain (P) in the sire line. Pigs were fed ad libitum with isocaloric and isoprotein diets. During the whole experiment, temperature, air moisture, air circulation speed and the content of NH 3 and CO 2 were measured in pens. No statistically significant differences were recorded with respect to temperature, air moisture, air circulation speed and content of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and ammonia (NH 3) in the air in pens with deep litter and without it (P> 0. 05). Pigs housed without deep litter had statistically highly significant (P< 0. 01) higher final weights than pigs kept on deep litter. Pigs crossed with Pietrain as a terminal breed, kept in pens without deep litter, had statistically significantly higher (P< 0. 05) average daily gains than pigs of the same genotype kept on deep litter. In the finishing phase <b>of</b> <b>fattening,</b> group <b>of</b> pigs being kept in pens without deep litter had statistically higher average daily gains than pigs kept on deep litter (P< 0. 05).

Bulls were five months old when the research commenced and they were eleven months old when the reserch was terminated. All body dimensions were measured by Litin stick except for breast circuit, metacarpus circuit and body weight. Bulls were tied and remained at the same place during their fattening period staying in ordinary cow-shed made of brick. All height measures increased at the relatively equal pace during the fattening period. Withers height increased most and back height increased the least. Tenderness of the back appeared to be most prominent at the end <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> period. Concerning length dimensions, body length developed quickest, head length slowest. As far as body width of bulls is considered the fastest growth was recorded concerning pelvis breadth; head front breadth increased the least. Breast depth was most notable at the point of bulls entering the category of very good condition during their fattening process. Brest circuit increase, as well as metacarups circuit and body weighat increase, were considerably quicker during the period of bulls going from medium condition category to good condition category then from the middle to the end <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> period.

The main {{requirements}} for modern pig production farming: high productivity <b>of</b> swine, good <b>fattening</b> and meat characteristics. While implementing these requirements one should achieve that swine are fed a wholesome balanced diets, appropriate breeding methods are selected, successive targeted selection towards productivity and product quality {{is carried out}} and optimal storage conditions are provided. Aim of the work: to identify and evaluate {{the differences in the}} compactness and meat content index <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> pig productivity. Tasks of the work: 1. Carry out pig body measurements <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> productivity. 2. Perform the fat thickness measurements of the longest back muscle and back. 3. To identify the relations of the compact and meat content index with pig productivity. The work was carried out at the Lithuanian Veterinary Academy, Department of Animal Husbandry and at the State Swine Breeding Station, Jadvimpolio village, Baisogala adm. area, Radviliškis district. The research was carried out with the get <b>of</b> two different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> productivity <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> swine. By the end <b>of</b> the control <b>fattening,</b> body measurements <b>of</b> the <b>fattened</b> get were carried out. In order to calculate the compactness index, the following was measured: body length in cm, chest volume in cm. The compactness index was calculated by the following formula: volume of the chest / body length x 100. In order to calculate the meat content index, the following was measured: back fat thickness in mm, the longest dorsal muscle thickness in mm. The meat content index was calculated by the following formula: thickness of fat / back muscle thickness x 100. Prior to the control slaughter, the lean meat content of the get <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> swine was phenotypically evaluated (with Piglog ultrasonic device in the range of 105, 85 - 110 kg). The following was identified: back fat thicknesses at Fat 1 and Fat 2 points, mm, the longest dorsal muscle thicknesses mm, lean meat percentage. In order to evaluate the relations of the compactness and meat content index with the productivity of swine, after the completion of control feeding of the get and the control slaughter, the following indicators <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> and met characteristics were evaluated: hot carcass weight in kg, carcass yield percentage, daily weight gain in g, feed consumption per 1 kg of weight gain, carcass and bacon halves length in cm, area of the longest dorsal muscle cm², ham weight in kg, fat thickness at 6 to 7 mm rib in mm, fat thickness behind the last rib in mm. Conclusions: 1. After the assessment of the universal indices of compactness and meat content if swine with different productivity it was fond that the compactness index was 3. 94 percent higher for the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> universal productivity swine, and the meat content index was 0, 78 percent higher for the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> meat productivity swine. 2. After measuring the body length and volume of the chest of the meat and universal <b>type</b> <b>of</b> swine it was determined that the body length during the universal productivity <b>type</b> <b>of</b> swine was 0. 16 percent higher (P < 0, 05), chest volume was 4. 18 percent higher (P < 0, 05) for the meat productivity <b>type</b> <b>of</b> swine. 3. After measuring the longest back muscle and back fat thickness it was found that in meat productivity <b>type</b> <b>of</b> swine, the longest dorsal muscle thickness was 1. 07 percent bigger (P < 0, 05) than the universal <b>type</b> <b>of</b> swine, and the back fat thicknesses in points Fat 1 Fat 2 respectively were 1. 62 percent (P< 0, 05) and 0. 69 percent (P < 0, 05) higher for the meat productivity <b>type</b> <b>of</b> swine. 4.

The research was carried out with the method of case study on fattening cattle Kastamar, Terbanggi Besar sub district, Lampung Tengah district. Location determination research done deliberately (purposive) with the consideration that the population of cattle in Terbanggi Besar sub district, Central Lampung district was the largest cattle population in the province of Lampung, and in the location of such research has not made any calculation of the cost of goods production. Methods of data analysis methods used were cost of goods production of full costing methods, and cost of goods production of variable costing methods. The results showed: (1) the cost production <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> cattle owned Kastamar using full costing method in period I, II, and III was Rp 40, 369 /kg, Rp 40, 082 /kg, and Rp 41, 854 /kg, (2) the cost production <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> cattle owned Kastamar using variable costing method in period I, II, and III was Rp 38, 115 /kg, Rp 37, 946 /kg, and Rp 39, 481 /kg, revenues fattening cattle owned Kastamar to the period I, II, III was Rp 43, 795, 082, Rp 52, 404, 082, and Rp 41, 866, 082, cost of sold beef at butcher in the period I, II, and III was Rp 112, 182 /kg, Rp 111, 632 /kg, and Rp 112, 724 /kg...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the impact of sowing {{structure}} on family farm competiveness using the model of family farm directed at the final production <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> beef cattle in the conditions of unchanged estate size. Applying a partial budget analysis, it was examined whether the decision on buying alfalfa hay or mercantile maize on the market and changing the sowing structure was economically justified and under what conditions using additional procedure of sensitive analysis. Applying this approach, it was investigated to what extent that decision contributed to improving the family farm profitability. The results of the conducted research show that the decision on buying mercantile maize mainly contributes to improving competitiveness of family farms directed at the final production <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> beef cattle compared with the decision on buying alfalfa hay. It is the consequence of the fact that buying mercantile maize on the market will enable sowing structure changes, that is, buying mercantile maize will make the area free, which according to some conservative estimations, can be used for the production of sufficient amounts of alfalfa and silage maize for <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> additional 19 head, whereas buying alfalfa hay will make the area free, which can be used for production of sufficient amounts of mercantile and silage maize for <b>fattening</b> <b>of</b> additional 6 head. In addition, it is shown that more rational way of organizing family farms directed at the final production <b>of</b> <b>fattened</b> beef cattle can additionally use available land resources and in that way increase profitability and improve competitiveness...|$|R

40|$|Large {{quantities}} of serum are produced during the strained yoghurt manufacturing process, {{which is the}} predominant <b>type</b> <b>of</b> yoghurt in Greece. However, the exploitation of this by-product as an alternative source of energy, protein and mineral elements in animal diets {{has not yet been}} examined. Therefore, this experiment was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} dietary yoghurt serum supplementation on growth performance and antioxidant status in sheep. Fourty eight male 2 months old lambs of Chios breed were randomly assigned to three experimental groups; control group was fed with a commercial basal diet, whereas the other two groups consumed the same diet, with the only difference that concentrated feed was uniformly supplemented with two levels of yoghurt serum powder (YS 1 : 25 g/kg feed or YS 2 : 50 g/kg feed). Lambs were weighed in a weekly basis from the beginning until the end of the experiment and blood samples were collected to measure antioxidant status. No significant effect of yoghurt serum powder on growth performance <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> lambs was demonstrated, even after 28 days of dietary supplementation (P> 0. 05). At the same time, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in blood plasma were not significantly different among the experimental groups (P> 0. 05) and no incidents of lambs with diarrhea were recorded. It can be concluded that yoghurt serum powder appears as a promising alternative of the cereals in the diets <b>of</b> <b>fattening</b> lambs, since no negative effects on growth performance and health status were observed...|$|R
