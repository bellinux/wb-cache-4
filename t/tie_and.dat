5|$|Celtic's first European semi-final {{since the}} early 1970s saw them paired against Portuguese side Boavista.

5|$|In 1904, {{after five}} years at Carlisle (see below), Warner {{returned}} to Cornell but his 1904 team was little improved over the previous year. The following two years were better, with the 1905 team losing to undefeated champion Penn by one point. Their game next year was a scoreless <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> Cornell lost only one game that season (to Princeton).|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, {{work on the}} Princes Street section stopped due to {{contractual}} disagreements between <b>TIE</b> <b>and</b> BSC {{after the}} latter submitted a request for an additional £80 million of funding. Edinburgh Council believed the contractors' claims were unjustified as they had agreed to fixed-price contracts. After negotiations, BSC agreed to commence construction in March 2009 within the original budget, although disagreements remained. Work restarted and line construction went ahead.|$|E

5|$|Q.: After {{the final}} match of the 2000–01 season, Nelson {{finished}} in the third promotion place ahead of Atherton Laburnum Rovers. However, Atherton LR were {{given the chance to}} replay their final game after their opponents had fielded an ineligible player. Atherton LR won the replayed <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> finished third ahead of Nelson.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Celtic found {{themselves}} drawn with AC Milan, Ajax and again Barcelona {{in the group}} stage. The campaign was dismal, winning only once with a 21 home win over Ajax, and slumping to a 61 rout away against Barcelona in the final group match. That game saw Celtic concede the most goals they had ever done in a single European <b>tie,</b> <b>and</b> equalled their previous heaviest defeat in Europe, a 5–0 loss to Artmedia Bratislava.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} parsimonious general {{equilibrium}} model where agents allocate time across three activities: production, trade, and leisure. Leisure includes time spent socializing, which economizes transaction costs. Our framework yields multiple equilibria {{in terms of the}} number of social <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> predicts that the number of social ties is positively associated with development, a relationship we observe in cross-country data. The model captures additional dimensions of data, namely: (i) increasing income inequality, but converging growth rates; (ii) an association between weak social <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> development; and (iii) an association between number of social <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> size of the transaction sector. ...|$|R
50|$|Centola and Macy {{found that}} {{information}} and disease spread as “simple contagions,” requiring only one contact for transmission, while behaviors typically spread as “complex contagions,” requiring multiples sources of reinforcement to induce adoption. Centola’s work builds on Granovetter’s work {{on the strength of}} weak <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> threshold models of collective behavior, as well as Duncan Watts and Steve Strogatz’s work on small world networks. Centola and Macy show that the weak <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> small worlds networks are both very good for spreading simple contagions. However, for complex contagions, weak <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> small worlds can slow diffusion.|$|R
5|$|According to Vid Gaković, who was {{a member}} of National Unity in 1914, Stojanović was an ambitious and talented young man. He was {{determined}} that his voice would be heard and he liked being the centre of attention. He was severe to younger members of the association, whom he sometimes sharply criticised. Nevertheless, younger students liked being around him. Gaković described him as a tall and handsome man who greatly cared about his appearance; he wore a bow <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> a broad-brimmed hat.|$|E
5|$|After five {{straight}} championship wins in the AAFC and NFL, the Browns appeared poised to bring another trophy home in 1951. The team finished {{the regular season}} with 11 wins and a single loss {{in the first game}} of the season. Cleveland faced the Rams on December 23 in a rematch of the previous year's title game. The score was deadlocked 17–17 in the final period, but a 73-yard touchdown pass by Rams quarterback Norm van Brocklin to wide receiver Tom Fears broke the <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> gave Los Angeles the lead for good. The 24–17 loss was the Browns' first in a championship game.|$|E
5|$|Another Green Wing {{series of}} running jokes is about hair. One {{of the more}} notable was various cracks about Mac's untidy hair, with Sue lending him a hair <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> hair clips before he goes in for an interview. Another was the {{character}} Karen getting her hair trapped in a printer in the first episode. Mac was {{often referred to as}} a Ginger by the other characters. Guy's hair becomes gradually curlier as the series goes on and Rachel dyes her hair from blonde to brunette after the first series. Other recurring jokes include Boyce's practical jokes, the bizarre games played by the human resources staff and surgery scenes where Caroline, Guy and Mac mess around while performing operations.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, the 2013–14 {{season was}} plagued by injuries, {{suspensions}} and a high turnover of players, and the Panthers fell to fourth in the final league table. They once again reached the Challenge Cup final, but were considered outsiders against a Belfast Giants team that comfortably won the league championship and finished 32 points ahead of Nottingham. The Panthers lost the first leg 5–2, a result that left the Giants as strong favourites to lift the cup. However, the Panthers won the second leg 4–1 to level the <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> force overtime. When that finished goalless, goaltender Craig Kowalski saved all three Belfast penalty shots and Petr Kalus scored to give Panthers a 7–6 aggregate victory and a fifth consecutive Challenge Cup.|$|E
5|$|For Bradford, it was {{the first}} time they had played at Wembley in their 93-year history. City {{finished}} sixth during the regular league season only winning a play-off place with a victory on the final day of the season. They came from two goals down during the semi-finals against Blackpool to gain a place in the play-off final. Having been relegated the previous season, Notts County had the chance to win an instant promotion back to the First Division. They finished fourth during the regular season and defeated Crewe Alexandra in the semi-final by drawing the away <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> winning by one-goal in the second leg at home.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino based Allen's {{characterization}} on Robin, the shorter-haired female {{protagonist of}} her one-shot comic Zone. She designed Allen's clothing to resemble {{that of the}} nineteenth century, giving him a ribbon <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> other accessories to appear gentlemanly. Hoshino gave him a pentagram-shaped scar for an intimidating image, and a calm demeanor different from her typical rambunctious, rude characters. In the anime television series, Allen was voiced by Sanae Kobayashi. The voices were recast for the 2016 anime television series D.Gray-man Hallow, with Ayumu Murase replacing Kobayashi. In the English adaptation of the anime series, Allen has been voiced by Todd Haberkorn.|$|E

In 1953, the El Salvador national football team took part in its fifth CCCF Championship, the 1953 CCCF Championship, hosted in Costa Rica, together with seven other national teams. Costa Rica became champions for the fourth time, and El Salvador finished in fifth place again.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's blood-stained shirt, <b>tie</b> <b>and</b> jacket {{are now in}} the {{possession}} of the Los Angeles County District Attorney. Controversy arose in 2010 when Kennedy's clothing was transported to the California Homicide Investigators Association conference in Las Vegas, where they were included in a temporary public display of never-before-seen artifacts from crime scenes related to prolific serial killers and infamous murders, such as the Black Dahlia murder and the killing of Hollywood actress Sharon Tate. The items and Kennedy's clothing were subsequently removed from the exhibit, with the LAPD apologizing to the Kennedy family.|$|E
5|$|McMillin's {{success in}} Louisiana {{allowed him to}} move on to Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, where he was the school's 13th head {{football}} coach for three seasons (1925–1927).

Geneva College fans generally consider McMillin among the best coaches in school history. His teams, renowned for playing some of the best teams in college football, prided themselves on a challenging schedule. Geneva opened the 1926 season with a 16–7 upset of Harvard.|$|E
