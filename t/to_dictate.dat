5|$|During the 13th and 14th centuries the barbican was developed. This {{consisted}} of a rampart, ditch, and possibly a tower, {{in front of the}} gatehouse which could be used to further protect the entrance. The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defence but also <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> the only approach to the gate.|$|E
5|$|At Chelsea, Fàbregas {{played a}} similar playmaking role in midfield, using his technique, ball control, vision, and passing ability <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> the tempo of his team's play, {{while he was}} {{supported}} by defensive midfielders, {{in order to give}} him more space and time on the ball. In this deeper creative role, he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho, where he proved to be an effective assist-provider.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to use {{systematic}} teaching in a clinical setting using software to teach reading and writing in one boy with learning difficulties and obtain accurate performance in dictation. In the pre-test, the student showed good performance in matching-to-sample tasks (96 % in matching printed words <b>to</b> <b>dictated</b> words; 88 % in matching pictures <b>to</b> <b>dictated</b> words), although he obtained a low percentage of correct answers in the dictation of constructed responses (52 %) and manuscripts (24 %). The teaching strengthened the selection of printed words matched <b>to</b> <b>dictated</b> words and copying words. The student obtained 100 % correct answers in the teaching tasks. In post-tests of dictation, he obtained 100 % correct answers in constructed response and 96 % correct answers in manuscripts. The results indicate that carefully teaching copying may promote accuracy in the performance of responding to minimal units in dictation tasks...|$|R
30|$|In the posttests, {{all of the}} {{participants}} maintained 100 % accuracy for the construction of printed sentences under auditory and visual control (AE and BE, respectively) and matching printed sentences <b>to</b> <b>dictated</b> sentences (AC). While the other participants were 100 % accurate in the AC relation during the pretests, LET only reached this performance after training. Auditory control over picture selection was obtained after training, and all {{the participants}} had 100 % correct responses when matching pictures <b>to</b> <b>dictated</b> sentences (AB). After training, the CB relation was derived, and {{all of the participants}} had 100 % accuracy when matching pictures to printed sentences.|$|R

He was conscious that those were his final days, and had time <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> his last will and receive last rites. Władysław died around 2am on the night from 19 to 20 May 1648.|$|E
5|$|With professionalism legalised, Preston flourished. Keen to {{make use}} of tactics, Sudell {{was the first person to}} use a {{blackboard}} <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> positions and strategy to his players. In 1887, Preston recorded the biggest win in the history of the FA Cup, beating Hyde 26–0 in the first round. The club progressed to the final having amassed a run of 42 consecutive wins in all competitions, but were beaten in the FA Cup Final by West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
30|$|Equivalence-based {{instruction}} (EBI) {{can produce}} integration between verbal operants and derive one repertoire from another through {{the transfer of}} stimulus control (de Rose, de Souza, & Hanna, 1996; Mackay & Sidman, 1984; Sidman, 1986). Experimental studies have reported that populations with normal hearing first learn oral tacts (BD), and the accurate oral-textual operant (CD) is provided from equivalence relations that are formed (de Rose et al., 1996; Sidman, 1971). In an inverse route, children with CIs present improvements in oral-tact (BD) accuracy after EBI that includes oral-textual operants (CD) (Almeida-Verdu & Golfeto, 2016). In the study by Anastácio-Pessan et al. (2015), the participants were children with CIs who presented good oral-reading (CD) performance but inaccurate picture tacting (BD). Conditional relations between dictated words and pictures (AB) and between dictated words and printed words (AC word) were strengthened using an MTS procedure, including relations between dictated syllables and printed syllables (AC syllabic). The results showed that after strengthening equivalence relations (between dictated words, pictures, and printed words), accurate speech also started to occur under the presence of pictures. Analogously, Lucchesi et al. (2015) taught children with CIs who were not readers to relate pictures <b>to</b> <b>dictated</b> words (AB), printed words <b>to</b> <b>dictated</b> words (AC word), and printed syllables <b>to</b> <b>dictated</b> syllables (AC syllabic) using an MTS procedure. The training also included constructing printed words conditionally <b>to</b> <b>dictated</b> words using a constructed-response matching-to-sample (CRMTS) procedure. The participants learned to read and improved picture tacting.|$|R

5|$|As {{the crisis}} eased, New Jersey was {{released}} {{to continue her}} interrupted voyage. She anchored at Long Beach 5 May 1969, her first visit to her home port in eight months. Through the summer months, New Jerseys crew toiled to make her ready for another deployment, and deficiencies discovered on the gun line were remedied. According to official reports, though, reasons of economy were <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> otherwise: on 22 August 1969 the United States Secretary of Defense released {{a list of names}} of ships to be inactivated; {{at the top of the}} list was New Jersey. Five days later, Captain Snyder was relieved of command by Captain Robert C. Peniston.|$|E
5|$|In early 1813, Ernest was {{involved}} in political scandal during an election contest in Weymouth following the general election the previous year. The Duke was shown {{to be one of}} three trustees who were able <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> who would represent Weymouth in Parliament. It being considered improper for a peer to interfere in a Commons election, there was considerable controversy, and the Government sent Ernest to Europe as an observer to accompany Hanoverian troops, which were again engaged in war against France. Though he saw no action, Ernest was present at the Battle of Leipzig, a major victory for the Allies.|$|E
5|$|The couple {{established}} Marlborough House {{as their}} London residence and Sandringham House in Norfolk as their country retreat. They entertained on a lavish scale. Their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles {{because most of}} Queen Victoria's relations were German, and Denmark was at loggerheads with Germany over the territories of Schleswig and Holstein. When Alexandra's father inherited the throne of Denmark in November 1863, the German Confederation {{took the opportunity to}} invade and annex Schleswig-Holstein. Queen Victoria was of two minds whether it was a suitable match given the political climate. After the marriage, she expressed anxiety about their socialite lifestyle and attempted <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> to them on various matters, including the names of their children.|$|E

Silesian magnates were accustomed <b>to</b> <b>dictating</b> elections.|$|R
5|$|Cerny's {{personal}} interests changed throughout the project, {{leading to the}} inclusion of new ideas absent from the original design documents. The game's enemy characters were designed by Cerny and Sam Comstock, who also animated them. Enemies had to be small in size due to technical limitations. Cerny and Comstock purposely omitted faces to give them unique designs and create a minimalistic appearance similar to the courses. Atari's management, however, suggested that the marble should have a smiley face to create an identified character, similar to Pac-Man. As a compromise, the cabinet's artwork depicts traces of a smiley face on the marbles. Flanagan programmed a three-dimensional physics model <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> the marble's motions and an interpreted script for enemy behavior. As Marble Madness neared completion, the feedback from Atari's in-house focus testing was positive. In retrospect, Cerny wished he had included more courses to give the game greater longevity, but extra courses would have required more time and increased hardware costs. Atari was experiencing severe financial troubles {{at the time and}} could not extend the game's development period as it would have left their production factory idle.|$|E
5|$|Formal end-of-year {{examinations}} commence {{starting in}} Year 4 <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> class streaming {{arrangements for the}} following year. Students are examined in English, Maltese, mathematics, religion and social studies. Despite the fact that eleven-plus examinations highlight inequality and failures, and are recognized as ineffective educational tools by experts, Malta still implements such exams. In Year 6, when most pupils have turned eleven years of age, an eleven-plus exam is given to students to determine which students attend which secondary schools. Students are tested in English language, Maltese language, mathematics, social studies and religion; the latter is optional for those not adhering to the faith taught in schools. While 73 per cent of eleven-year-old students sat the eleven-plus exam in 2001, only about 54 percent pass it each year. Students achieving success in the eleven-plus exam go on to attend prestigious 'junior lyceums' during their secondary years, whilst {{those who do not}} attend 'area secondary schools'. This is similar to the operation of the Tripartite System in the United Kingdom following World War II.|$|E
5|$|Germany did not {{recognize}} the new king and {{its relationship with the}} council remained tense. The council was not allowed to determine the borders of Lithuania, establish an embassy in Berlin, or begin forming a stable administrative system. It received small funds to cover its expenses only in September 1918. The situation changed when the German Revolution started and Germany lost the war in fall of 1918 – it was no longer in a position <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> terms. On 2 November, the council adopted the first provisional constitution. The decision to invite King Mindaugas II was annulled and this helped to reconcile the political factions. The functions of government were entrusted to a three-member presidium, and Augustinas Voldemaras was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers. The first government was formed on 11 November 1918, the day that Germany signed the armistice in Compiègne. The council began to organize an army, police, local government, and other institutions. It also expanded to include ethnic minorities (Jews and Belarusians). There were no women in the council, despite a petition that gathered 20,000 signatures.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Beebe went on an {{expedition}} to Haiti in order to document its marine life. Anchoring his ship the Lieutenant in the harbor of Port-au-Prince, he performed over 300 helmet dives examining the area's coral reefs and classifying the fish that inhabited them. These dives involved several technological innovations: a watertight brass box {{which could be used}} to house a camera for underwater photography, and a telephone which was incorporated into the diving helmet, allowing the diver <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> observations to someone on the surface instead of having to take notes underwater. Within a hundred days, Beebe and his team had created a catalog of species inhabiting the area nearly as long as what had been assembled on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in the past four hundred years. In 1928 Beebe and Tee-Van published an illustrated and annotated list of 270 such species, which was expanded in 1935 bringing the total to 324. Beebe provided an account of this expedition in his 1928 book Beneath Tropic Seas, which was the first of his books to receive less than enthusiastic reviews, due to its episodic structure.|$|E
5|$|In November 1949 {{he joined}} Second Division club Hull City for a {{transfer}} fee of £19,000. He chose {{to join the}} Tigers ahead of bigger clubs like Arsenal and Manchester City who had shown interest in signing him {{due to the fact}} that Hull were managed by Raich Carter, who had been a great player before and after World War II. Carter did improve Revie's game but was not a success as Hull manager, as City finished mid-table in 1949–50 and 1950–51, before becoming involved in a relegation battle in 1951–52. Teammate Andy Davidson later said Revie failed to fulfil his potential at Boothferry Park as he was not a tough player, and the rest of the Hull team were not physically dominant enough to protect him and allow him <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> play with his accurate passing. As at Leicester, Revie felt the time had come for him to move on and handed in a transfer request once Carter departed.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland, former Covenanter James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose led a {{campaign}} {{in favour of}} the king in the Highlands from 1644. Few Lowland Scots would follow him, but, aided by 1,000 Irish, Highland and Islesmen sent by the Irish Confederates under Alasdair MacDonald (MacColla), he began a highly successful mobile campaign, winning victories over local Covenanter forces at Tippermuir and Aberdeen against local levies; at Inverlochy he crushed the Campbells; at Auldearn, Alford and Kilsyth he defeated well-led and disciplined armies. He was able <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> terms to the Covenanters, but as he moved south, his forces, depleted {{by the loss of}} MacColla and the Highlanders, were caught and decisively defeated at the Battle of Philiphaugh by an army under David Leslie, nephew of Alexander. Escaping to the north, Montrose attempted to continue the struggle with fresh troops. By this point the king had been heavily defeated at the Battle of Naseby by Parliament's reformed New Model Army and surrendered to the Scots forces under Leslie besieging the town of Newark in July 1646. Montrose abandoned the war and left for the continent.|$|E

5|$|On March 3, 1918, Germany and the now-Bolshevik Russia {{signed the}} Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. It {{declared}} that the Baltic nations were in the German interest zone and that Russia renounced any claims to them. On March 23, Germany recognized independent Lithuania {{on the basis of}} the December 11 declaration. However, in substance, nothing had changed either in Lithuania or in the Council's status: any efforts to establish an administration were hindered. This situation changed when the German Revolution started and Germany lost the war in the fall of 1918 – it was no longer in a position <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> terms. The Council of Lithuania adopted the first provisional constitution on November 2. The functions of government were entrusted to a three-member presidium, and Augustinas Voldemaras was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers of Lithuania. Complete international recognition took several years; the US affirmed it on July 28, 1922.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the mutiny on French rule was minimal, in the short and long term. The {{military}} casualties inflicted on the French army in the attack were in single figures and the attack did not generate widespread awareness among the populace, as the intended popular uprising did not occur. Instead, the attack backfired and saw {{a large number of}} VNQDĐ members killed, captured or executed. The subsequent French military and civilian crackdown saw military security increase and the VNQDĐ's ability to threaten French authority in Vietnam was extinguished. The vast majority of the leadership were killed or sentenced to death, and the remnants of the VNQDĐ fled to China, where several factions emerged under disparate leadership. In the long run, Yen Bay allowed the Indochinese Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh to inherit the VNQDĐ's status as the leading anti-colonial revolutionary movement. After the Second World War, an opportunity to fight for Vietnamese independence arose, and this allowed the communists in the Viet Minh <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> the platform of the independence movement. As a result, the communists were able to position themselves to become the dominant force in Vietnam post-independence.|$|E
5|$|Aleppo {{was then}} a major {{intellectual}} center of the Ottoman Empire, featuring many thinkers and writers concerned with {{the future of the}} Arabs. It was in the French missionary schools that the Marrash family learnt Arabic with French and other foreign languages (Italian and English). But Francis at first studied the Arabic language and its literature privately. At the age of four years, Marrash had contracted measles, and had ever since suffered from eye problems that had kept worsening over time. Hoping to find a treatment, his father had therefore taken him to Paris in 1850; Francis stayed there for about a year, after which he was sent back to Aleppo while his father remained in Paris. In 1853, Francis accompanied his father once again, on a business trip of several months to Beirut, where there was a noticeable presence and cultural influence of Europeans. Francis experienced similar cultural contact later on, when he received private tutoring in medicine for four years under a British physician, in Aleppo—he had by then developed a keen interest in science, and in medicine in particular. At the same time, he wrote and published several works. Marrash practiced medicine for about a year; however, deeming it safer for his trade to become a state-licensed physician, he went to Paris in 1866 so as to continue his medical education at a school. But his fragile health and his growing blindness forced him to interrupt his studies within a year after his arrival. He returned to Aleppo completely blind, but still managed <b>to</b> <b>dictate</b> his works.|$|E
