Although the importance and desirability of accurate methods of ascertaining the cost of production is generally conceded, and while much attention has been devoted to this subject, and large sums of money expended annually in perfecting cost keeping records, there is a general lack of knowledge in many instances of the principles involved; and the problem now in hand is to present an analysis of the elements <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> make cost, and to indicate the lines along which methods must be devised to gather and classify the facts that are used in its actual determination.

25|$|In 2007, {{the private}} concessionaires in Casablanca, Tangiers and Tetouan, {{as well as}} the public water utility of Meknes began to {{implement}} water supply and sanitation pilot projects on the basis of an innovative output-based aid approach. The objective is to extend water and sewer connections to 11.300 households in poor, unzoned, periurban neighbourhoods. The pilot projects are part of the National Human Development Initiative and are funded through a US$ 7 million grant by the Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) administered by the World Bank. It {{is the first time that}} GPOBA, which promotes primarily the private sector, provided grants to a public water operator. The average subsidy level per connection amounts to USD 169 for water supply and to USD 606 for sanitation. The average subsidy level per connection is 35 percent. Operators also developed awareness raising campaigns to make people aware of the option to connect to sewers through teams <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> market places. Under the output-based aid approach investments are pre-financed by the concessionaires or the public utility that are being reimbursed by GPOBA only after a verification process certifies that the households have been connected and receive an adequate service. According to the World Bank, the output-based aid approach has helped to improve processes, overcome financing obstacles and mobilize stakeholder partnership.|$|E

[...] He continued by stressing the poem's wide acceptance: [...] "The fame of the Elegy has spread to all countries and has exercised an influence on all the poetry of Europe, from Denmark to Italy, from France to Russia. With the exception of certain works of Byron and Shakespeare, no English poem has been so widely admired and imitated abroad and {{after more than a}} century of existence we find it as fresh as ever, when its copies, even the most popular of all those of Lamartine, are faded and tarnished." [...] He concluded with a reinforcing claim on the poem's place in English poetry: [...] "It possesses the charm of incomparable felicity, of a melody that is not too subtle to charm every ear, of a moral persuasiveness that appeals to every generation, and of metrical skill that in each line proclaims the master. The Elegy may almost be looked upon as the typical piece of English verse, our poem of poems; not that it is the most brilliant or original or profound lyric in our language, but because it combines in more balanced perfection than any other all the qualities <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the production of a fine poetical effect." ...|$|E
