5|$|In 1846, the Andover workhouse scandal, where {{conditions}} in the Andover Union Workhouse {{were found to be}} inhumane and dangerous, prompted a government review and the abolition of the Poor Law Commission which was replaced with a Poor Law Board which meant that a Committee of Parliament was to administer the Poor Law, with a cabinet minister as head. Despite <b>this</b> <b>another</b> scandal occurred over inhumane treatment of paupers in the Huddersfield workhouse.|$|E
5|$|In {{directed}} planar graphs, simple directed cycles are dual to directed cuts (partitions of the vertices {{into two}} subsets such that all edges go in one direction, from one subset to the other). Strongly oriented planar graphs (graphs whose underlying undirected graph is connected, {{and in which}} every edge belongs to a cycle) are dual to directed acyclic graphs in which no edge belongs to a cycle. To put <b>this</b> <b>another</b> way, the strong orientations of a connected planar graph (assignments of directions {{to the edges of}} the graph that result in a strongly connected graph) are dual to acyclic orientations (assignments of directions that produce a directed acyclic graph).|$|E
5|$|In the Hen and Chicken Islands, Pacific rats were {{eradicated}} on Whatupuke in 1993, Lady Alice Island in 1994, and Coppermine Island in 1997. Following this program, juveniles {{have once}} again been {{seen on the}} latter three islands. In contrast, rats persist on Hen Island of the same group, and no juvenile tuatara had been seen there as of 2001. In the Alderman Islands, Middle Chain Island holds no tuatara, but it is considered possible for rats to swim between Middle Chain and other islands that do hold tuatara, and the rats were eradicated in 1992 to prevent <b>this.</b> <b>Another</b> rodent eradication was carried out on the Rangitoto Islands east of D'Urville Island, {{to prepare for the}} release of 432 Cook Strait tuatara juveniles in 2004, which were being raised at Victoria University as of 2001.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} Victoria the Great and Sixty Glorious Years caused Hollywood studios to take notice. Neagle and Wilcox began an {{association}} with RKO Radio Pictures.

25|$|Following <b>this,</b> <b>another</b> problem arose {{with the}} International Cricket Council over the tournament dates, which {{clashed with the}} ICC Champions Trophy, and the CLT20 was moved to December 2008.

In November 2008, the tournament was again put in {{jeopardy}} when Mumbai suffered terrorist attacks and the organisers attempted to reschedule again to early 2009. In December 2008, it was finally pushed to September 2009, when it was successfully held as per the plans for the 2009 edition.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} DCSD {{decision about}} Lomborg provoked a petition signed by 287 Danish academics, primarily social scientists, who criticised the DCSD {{for evaluating the}} book {{as a work of}} science, whereas the petitioners considered it clearly an opinion piece by a non-scientist. The Danish Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation then asked the Danish Research Agency (DRA) to form an independent working group to review DCSD practices. In response to <b>this,</b> <b>another</b> group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures, primarily from the medical and natural sciences community, to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the DRA.|$|E

25|$|Plans for the highway, first {{named the}} Lakeshore Expressway, were first {{developed}} {{prior to the}} formation of Metro Toronto. In the post-war period, the population of greater Toronto was growing at a rate of 50,000 persons per year, the ownership of private automobiles was growing, and the traffic between downtown Toronto and the western suburbs was regularly stuck in 'traffic jams.' (The Sunnyside stretch of the Lake Shore Boulevard and Queen and King Streets in the Parkdale–High Park area were apparently notorious for <b>this.)</b> <b>Another</b> reason for the proposal to build the lake shore highway was the expected opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway and the need for adequate roadways to serve the expanded port facilities.|$|E
25|$|The most {{underdeveloped}} mass ceramics area is in tableware, porcelain and stoneware. Mexico {{has only}} two major tableware manufacturers, Anfora and Santa Anita, which produce porcelain and stoneware respectively. Anfora {{is the only one}} that has been successful in exporting its goods to US companies including Panera Bread, Pottery Barn and Starbucks. Most of these ceramics are imported from other countries such as the United States, Japan and Germany despite its ability to produce it itself. However, the lack of certain raw materials may partially explain <b>this.</b> <b>Another</b> problem is the continued production of lead glazed ware, which cannot be exported. While lead free and low lead glazes have been developed for use with low temperature firing, the most traditional, only about half of artisans use it.|$|E
25|$|The British {{considered}} {{producing an}} atomic bomb without American help, but it would require overwhelming priority, disruption to other wartime projects was inevitable, and it was unlikely to be ready in time to affect {{the outcome of the}} war in Europe. The unanimous response was that before embarking on <b>this,</b> <b>another</b> effort should be made to secure American cooperation. At the Quebec Conference in August 1943, Churchill and the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, signed the Quebec Agreement, which merged the two national projects. The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee and the Combined Development Trust to coordinate their efforts. The 19 September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period.|$|E

25|$|Latif's team next {{assignment}} was the ICC Intercontinental Cup and Afghanistan play Scotland in the final. Latif stated that Afghanistan {{likes to play}} aggressive cricket and that the players are mentally very tough and hate to lose. On 2 December the match against Scotland started and because of Hamid Hassan Scotland were bowled out for 212. More than half of Scotland's runs came from Neil McCallum who scored 104*. Afghanistan {{got off to a}} good start but collapsed to 171 all out, giving Scotland a 41-run lead. Despite <b>this</b> <b>another</b> great bowling performance from Hassan and Samiullah Shenwari meant that Scotland were skittled for just 82 in their second innings. On the third day Afghanistan sealed victory early in the day with seven-wickets in hand courtesy of a superb 56* by Mohammad Shahzad.|$|E

500|$|Following <b>this,</b> <b>another</b> lull in {{fighting}} along the 38th parallel occurred, during which both sides {{took time to}} fortify their positions and conduct fewer patrols. As the need for offensive action diminished, on 10 July, the U.S. Army ordered the deactivation of all of its Ranger companies. In doing so, the Army noted that {{the establishment of the}} Ranger companies had only been a trial directed by The Pentagon, which had been completed. The decision was further clarified in relation to the 2nd Ranger Company, with the Army stating that [...] "racial differences" [...] had prevented the company from being used effectively in offensive operations.|$|E

500|$|The British {{considered}} {{how they}} would produce a bomb without American help.
