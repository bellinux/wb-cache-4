5|$|Due to the {{outbreak}} of the First Muslim Civil War and the priorities on other fronts, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century. The Khazars, on their part, only launched a few raids into the Transcaucasian principalities that were loosely under Muslim dominion: in 661/662, <b>they</b> <b>launched</b> a raid into Albania but were defeated by the local prince; in 683 or 685 (also a time of civil war in the Muslim world), a large-scale raid across Transcaucasia was more successful, capturing much booty and many prisoners.|$|E

5|$|On a {{personal}} level, Grace was still unqualified {{as a doctor}} and had a growing family to support, his daughter Bessie being born in May.

He then needed a practice and this was effectively purchased for him by MCC in 1878 after <b>they</b> <b>launched</b> a National Testimonial on his behalf, though the underlying and hopeful purpose of the appeal was to terminate Grace's embarrassing mercenary activity.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarians {{strengthened}} {{their control}} over the Carpathian Basin by defeating a Bavarian army in a battle fought at Brezalauspurc on 4 July 907. <b>They</b> <b>launched</b> a series of plundering raids between 899 and 955 and also targeted the Byzantine Empire between 943 and 971. However, they gradually settled in the Basin and established a Christian monarchy, the Kingdom of Hungary around 1000.|$|E

5|$|While F-105s did score 27 air-to-air victories, {{the overall}} {{exchange}} ratio was near parity. On January 2, 1967, the Americans sprang a surprise on the MiGs when <b>they</b> <b>launched</b> Operation Bolo. F-4 Phantoms, {{using the same}} radio call signs, direction of approach, altitude, and speed as a typical flight of bomb-laden F-105s, lured a group of MiG-21s toward what the MiG pilots thought would be easy prey. The result was seven MiG-21s shot down within 12 minutes for no U.S. losses.|$|E
5|$|After his expulsion, Soedjatmoko {{moved to}} Surakarta and studied Western history and {{political}} literature, {{which led to}} an interest in socialism. Some figure that affected him besides Karl Marx were Ortega y Gasset and Jan Romein. While in Surakarta he also worked at his father's hospital. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence, Soedjatmoko was asked to become Deputy Head of the Foreign Press Department in the Ministry of Information. In 1946, {{at the request of}} Prime Minister Sjahrir, he and two friends established a Dutch-language weekly, Het Inzicht (Inside), as a counter to the Dutch-sponsored Het Uίtzicht (Outlook). The next year, <b>they</b> <b>launched</b> a socialist-oriented journal, Siasat (Tactics), which was published weekly. During this period Soedjatmoko dropped the name Mangoendiningrat, as it reminded him of the feudal aspects of Indonesian culture.|$|E

5|$|Although the Byzantine–Bulgarian {{conflict}} {{that began in}} 913 was provoked by the Byzantines, it was the Bulgarian monarch Simeon I (r. 893–927) who was seeking pretext to wage war and fulfil his ambitions to claim an imperial title for himself and to assume the throne of Constantinople. Unable to confront the Bulgarians, the Byzantines reluctantly recognized Simeon I as Emperor of Bulgaria (in Bulgarian, Tsar) as early as July 913 but the decision was revoked after a palace coup in Constantinople in 914. Three years later, in 917, the main Byzantine forces were routed in the Battle of Achelous and the Bulgarians took the military initiative. In the four year that followed <b>they</b> <b>launched</b> a number of successful campaigns, reaching the walls of Constantinople and the Isthmus of Corinth.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1857 the Beetons had {{considered}} using the magazine columns {{as the basis}} of a book of collected recipes and homecare advice, Hughes believes, and in November 1859 <b>they</b> <b>launched</b> a series of 48-page monthly supplements with The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine. The print block for the whole series of the supplements was set from the beginning so the break between each edition was fixed at 48 pages, regardless of the text, and in several issues the text of a sentence or recipe is split between the end of one instalment {{and the beginning of the}} next.|$|E

On the night of 2728 March, Guam {{and the rest of}} Cruiser Division 16 bombarded the airfield on Minamidaitō. After concluding the bombardment, Guam returned to the carrier screen while they conducted operations off Nansei Shoto until 11 May. The ship then steamed to Ulithi for periodic maintenance and to replenish ammunition and supplies. She {{then returned}} to Okinawa, assigned to Task Group 38.4 of William Halsey's Third Fleet. She continued to provide anti-aircraft defense for the carriers while <b>they</b> <b>launched</b> fighter sweeps of Kyushu.

5|$|In August, Khánh {{gave himself}} more powers, {{provoking}} widespread riots and demonstrations across the nation, with Buddhist activists prominent in expressing opposition against Khánh. The anarchy forced Khánh {{to back down}} and make concessions, {{and he ended up}} in a weaker position than before. Among the concessions he made was to remove or demote some Catholic officials who had been close to Diệm's religiously discriminatory rule, angering the minority Catholic community. Among those demoted were Generals Phát and Đức, both Catholic. <b>They</b> <b>launched</b> a coup attempt backed mainly by Catholic elements against Khánh before dawn on 13 September. They took over the city without firing a shot, and used the national radio station to proclaim the deposing of Khánh's junta. There was little initial reaction from most of the military commanders, including Thi.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} Germanicus reached Pannonia, Severus was {{attacked}} in Moesia, but successfully repelled the rebels. By the time Germanicus arrived the rebels had withdrawn to mountain fortresses from which <b>they</b> <b>launched</b> raids. The Romans were tactically unsuited at countering raids, so Tiberius had to utilize his auxiliary forces and divided his army into small detachments to cover more ground. Tiberius {{appears to have}} been conducting a war of attrition against the rebels who were now occupying strong defensive positions. In addition, the Romans began working to drive the rebels out of the countryside offering forgiveness to any tribes that would lay down their arms, and a scorched earth policy was implemented through which Tiberius may have been hoping to starve the enemy out. While most of his detachments saw little action at the time, Germanicus did defeat the Mazaei, a Dalmatian tribe.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August, 1916, Bulgaria invaded Greece, easily conquering all Greek {{territory}} {{east of the}} Struma, {{since the}} Greek Army was ordered not to resist by the pro-German King Constantine. The surrender of territory recently won with difficulty in the Second Balkan War of 1913 {{was the last straw}} for many supporters of Liberal Party politician Eleftherios Venizelos. With Allied assistance, <b>they</b> <b>launched</b> a coup which secured Thessaloniki and most of Greek Macedonia, causing the National Schism. In June 1917, the Venizelists gained full control of the country, immediately declaring war on the Central Powers and joining the Allied Army of the Orient operating on the Balkan Front. The Greek entry into the war, along with the 24 division reinforcements that the army had received in the spring of the same year, created a strategic advantage for the Entente.|$|E

5|$|On 30 November, the 2/23rd {{reached the}} Song, {{fighting}} {{its way across}} and the next day, after sharp fighting amidst a renewed local counterattack by Japanese forces, Kuanko was taken. To {{the north of the}} abandoned village, the Japanese were positioned in strength and <b>they</b> <b>launched</b> a strong counterattack, which retook the vital high ground for them but was checked from progressing further by a heavy Australian artillery bombardment. At this stage, the 2/24th Infantry Battalion was released from its portage task and it was sent west to conduct a flanking movement around the Japanese position, cutting the Kuanko–Wareo track and capturing Kwatingkoo and Peak Hill early on 7 December, following a Japanese withdrawal. From there, it was a short march on to Wareo, which the Australians secured early the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Khazars and the Arabs {{came into}} {{conflict}} {{as a result}} of the first phase of Muslim expansion: by 640, the Arabs had reached Armenia, and in 642, <b>they</b> <b>launched</b> their first raid across the Caucasus under Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah. In 645/646, the Arabs defeated a Byzantine army in Armenia, reinforced with Khazar and Alan contingents. It was followed by an attempt in 651/652 to advance onto the Khazar capital, Balanjar, but the Arabs were heavily defeated in a battle before the city, resulting in the death of Abd ar-Rahman's brother Salman and 4,000 Muslim troops. Three years later, the Khazars repelled a retaliatory campaign under Habib ibn Maslama.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{had been}} {{competing}} with the US in landing {{a man on the}} Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V.

On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, <b>they</b> <b>launched</b> Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.|$|E
