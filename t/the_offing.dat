5|$|Originally it {{was thought}} that the {{temporary}} pawn sacrifice 9...b5 was an easy equalizer: after 10.Nxb5 Nxe4?! 11.Bxe4 Re8 Black seemingly regains the sacrificed piece without trouble. But in Alburt–de Firmian, USA ch 1990, White uncorked 12.Ng5! and went on to win: this move was judged the most important theoretical novelty in Volume 50 of Chess Informant. Only later was it discovered that the immediate 10...Re8 is a better way of recovering the pawn, with a complicated game in <b>the</b> <b>offing.</b>|$|E

(Panzerjäger Brechen Durch!), {{written by}} Alfred-Ingemar Berndt, a {{journalist}} and close associate of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, is an eye-witness account of the battles {{that led to the}} fall of France. When the 1940 attack was in <b>the</b> <b>offing,</b> Berndt joined the Wehrmacht, was sergeant in an anti-tank division, and afterward published his recollections. The book was originally issued by Franz Eher Nachfolger, the central publishing house of the Nazi Party, in 1940.|$|E
5|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate on the {{development}} of a new public transport structure, with monorails and light rail both being considered. A light rail link to Gosport was authorised in 2002 with completion expected in 2005, but it is unlikely that the project will be completed following the refusal of funding by the Department for Transport in November 2005. In April 2011, an article appeared in Portsmouth News suggesting a new scheme could be in <b>the</b> <b>offing</b> by running a light rapid transit system over the line to Southampton via Fareham, Bursledon, and Sholing, thus replacing the existing heavy rail services.|$|E

5|$|As Germany's {{military}} and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took {{the lives of thousands}} of people. Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in <b>the</b> <b>offing,</b> the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.|$|E
5|$|Madhoji Bhonsle, {{also known}} as Appa Saheb, {{consolidated}} his power in Nagpur after {{the murder of his}} cousin, the imbecile ruler Parsoji Bhonsle. He entered into a treaty with the British on 27 May 1816. He ignored the request of the British Resident Jenkins to refrain from contact with Baji Rao II. Jenkins asked Appa Saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to the residency, which he also refused to do. Appa Saheb openly declared support for the Peshwa, who was already fighting the British near Pune. As it was now clear that a battle was in <b>the</b> <b>offing,</b> Jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby British East India Company troops. He already had about 1,500 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Hopentoun Scott. Jenkins sent word for Colonel Adams to march to Nagpur with his troops. Like other Maratha leaders, Appa Shaeb employed Arabs in his army. They were typically involved in holding fortresses. While they were known to be among the bravest of troops, they were not amenable to discipline and order. The total strength of the Marathas was about 18,000.|$|E
5|$|Nasser was {{informed}} of the British–American withdrawal via a news statement while aboard a plane returning to Cairo from Belgrade, and took great offense. Although ideas for nationalizing the Suez Canal were in <b>the</b> <b>offing</b> after the UK agreed to withdraw its military from Egypt in 1954 (the last British troops left on 13 June 1956), journalist Mohamed Hassanein Heikal asserts that Nasser made the final decision to nationalize the waterway between 19 and 20 July. Nasser himself would later state that he decided on 23 July, after studying the issue and deliberating {{with some of his}} advisers from the dissolved RCC, namely Boghdadi and technical specialist Mahmoud Younis, beginning on 21 July. The rest of the RCC's former members were {{informed of the}} decision on 24 July, while the bulk of the cabinet was unaware of the nationalization scheme until hours before Nasser publicly announced it. According to Ramadan, Nasser's decision to nationalize the canal was a solitary decision, taken without consultation.|$|E

40|$|Size {{fractionation}} of phytoplankton {{stock in}} the surface water was studied in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Bucket sampling from 0 m and pump sampling from 8 m depth were conducted for the surface water. A total of 75 pairs of samples were collected along {{the course of the}} icebreaker SHIRASE during the cruise of the 27 th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE- 27) from December 1985 to March 1986 for observing geographical distribution of phytoplankton stock and for evaluating the effectiveness of the pump system. Chlorophyll a concentration in the surface water was high at the southern margin of the Subantarctic water (52 - 55 °S) reaching more than 1. 32 μgl^ (December) and more than 0. 59 μgl^ (February to March). Chlorophyll a concentration in the Indian sector of the Antarctic water varied geographically; high in <b>the</b> eastern <b>offing</b> of Enderby Land and low in <b>the</b> western <b>offing.</b> <b>The</b> standing stock of nanoplankton (, respectively. Netplankton fraction (> 20 μm) was higher than smaller fractions (0. 18 ± 0. 28 μgl^). Regional variations of the total phytoplankton chlorophyll stock are mainly associated with variations in netplankton fraction stock. No significant difference of chlorophyll a concentration between the bucket-sampled water and the pumped-up water was detected by statistical analysis. This reveals that the pumped-up water is sufficient for chlorophyll analysis in the routine works of marine biological program of JARE...|$|R

60|$|The {{appearance}} of the ocean, {{in the space between}} the more distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about it. Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in <b>the</b> remote <b>offing</b> lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing of water in every direction--as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise.

60|$|A midsummer's day was {{breaking}} lazily on the Atlantic. There was not wind {{enough to move}} the vapors in <b>the</b> foggy <b>offing,</b> but where <b>the</b> vague distance heaved against a violet sky there were dull red streaks that, growing brighter, presently painted out the stars. Soon the brown rocks of Greyport appeared faintly suffused, and then the whole ashen line of dead coast was kindled, and the lighthouse beacons went out one by one. And then a hundred sail, before invisible, started out of the vapory horizon, and pressed toward the shore. It was morning, indeed, {{and some of the}} best society in Greyport, having been up all night, were thinking {{it was time to go}} to bed.|$|R

60|$|In {{the applause}} that followed, and the {{clicking}} of glasses, Senor Perkins slipped away. He mingled {{a moment with}} some of the other guests who had already withdrawn to the corridor, lit a cigar, and then passed through a narrow doorway on to the ramparts. Here he strolled to some distance, as if in deep thought, until he reached a spot where the crumbling wall and its fallen debris afforded an easy descent into the ditch. Following the ditch, he turned an angle, and came upon the beach, and the low sound of oars in <b>the</b> invisible <b>offing.</b> A whistle brought the boat to his feet, and without a word he stepped into the stern sheets. A few strokes of the oars showed him that the fog had lifted slightly from the water, and a green light hanging {{from the side of the}} Excelsior could be plainly seen. Ten minutes' more steady pulling placed him on her deck, where the second officer stood with a number of the sailors listlessly grouped around him.|$|R
60|$|As soon as captain Truck {{arrived at}} the mouth of this passage, he felt so much {{encouraged}} by the appearance of things that he gave the concerted signal for the ship to veer round and to stand to the southward.

The error on the experimental bottle filling plant can be defined without any interference using analog values taken from pressure sensors and linear potentiometers.
