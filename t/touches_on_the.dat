5|$|Written {{in formal}} Malay and {{including}} traditional Minangkabau storytelling {{techniques such as}} pantuns, Sitti Nurbaya <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> themes of colonialism, forced marriage, and modernity. Well-received upon publication, Sitti Nurbaya continues to be taught in Indonesian high schools. It {{has been compared to}} Romeo and Juliet and the Butterfly Lovers.|$|E
5|$|Five {{companies}} did {{the visual}} effects – Industrial Light & Magic, Double Negative, Moving Picture Company, Cinesite and Peerless – {{under the supervision}} of Steve Begg. The computer-generated effects included set extensions, digital <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> vehicles, and crumbling buildings. A sixth one, Framestore, handled the title sequence, the seventh in the series designed by Daniel Kleinman. It took four months to complete, and centred on an octopus motif reminiscent of the Spectre logo, along with images of love and relationships.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa {{nevertheless}} {{continued to}} work. He wrote the original screenplays The Sea is Watching in 1993 and After the Rain in 1995. While putting finishing <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> latter work in 1995, Kurosawa slipped {{and broke the}} base of his spine. Following the accident, he would use a wheelchair {{for the rest of his}} life, putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film. His longtime wish—to die on the set while shooting a movie—was never to be fulfilled.|$|E

It is only the third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later said that if he had written about the killings as they were depicted in the film, the repressive New Order government would have had him shot.|$|E
5|$|Few {{tasks were}} left to {{complete}} when the 1977 construction season began. Most of the pump stations had been turned over to operating personnel by construction workers, and environmental mitigation and cleanup {{was in full swing}} as Alyeska repaired tundra damage caused by construction. Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned the job of finishing the final <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main pipeline. The last 160 miles of hydrostatic testing were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 miles of pipe were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total. On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.|$|E
5|$|Mihardja, a journalist-cum-literary {{editor who}} {{associated}} with the eccentric poet Chairil Anwar and the Socialist Party of Indonesia, wrote Atheis from May 1948 to February 1949. The Indonesian used in the novel was influenced by Sundanese and harkens back to earlier works by Minang writers, as opposed to Mihardja's contemporaries who attempted {{to distance themselves from}} the earlier style. Dealing mainly with faith, the novel also <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> interactions between modernity and traditionalism. Although the writer insisted that the work was meant to be realistic, symbolic representations from subjective meanings to the novel being an allegory have been advanced.|$|E

5|$|The second {{argument}} that Fodor provides {{in favour of}} representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relation between the representational theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations {{goes hand in hand}} with the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the form of the symbols which they elaborate. And this is the computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.|$|E
5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, {{which partly}} <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will {{to the human}} soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar {{to the formation of}} habits. This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2013, during at the 2013's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Pusha T {{announced}} that he would be going to Paris later this week, just to put on some final <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album, afterwards he would announce a release date. In June 2013, Pusha T had been set to turn in the album to Def Jam for mastering, however, Kanye West presented Pusha with some additional beats. This resulted in Pusha going back to the studio to continue the recording. In early stages in the recording process, he began working on the album with Kanye West, Symbolyc One, The Neptunes, Bangladesh, and Ryan Leslie. Since then, he has confirmed that he was working with The-Dream, Just Blaze, No I.D., Nottz, Don Cannon, Nashiem Myrick, Carlos Brody (of The Hitmen), DJ Mano, Swizz Beatz, Rico Beats, Travi$ Scott, Hudson Mohawke, Young Chop, and Sham, amongst others on the album's production. On August 4, 2013 he {{announced that}} the song he wants to be the album's intro is produced by Joaquin Phoenix. On August 22, 2013, Pusha T appeared on MTV's RapFix and told Sway Calloway that the bulk of the album's production would be handled by Kanye West, while confirming production by Pharrell, Swizz Beatz, The-Dream, Nottz, and Don Cannon to be featured on the album.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to {{what the}} title might suggest, the book only briefly <b>touches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{philosophy}} of vegetarianism and the associated diet.

This showcases the current trend surrounding veganism around the world and especially in the Western world, where it has gone from a niche modus vivendi to a fairly common one.|$|E

40|$|A unique {{behavioural}} syndrome {{in humans}} followed two separate strokes involving both parietotemporal regions. The behavioural alterations {{resemble those of}} Denny-Brown and Chambers' monkey with bilateral ablation of the parietal lobe which were characterised by strong withdrawal or refusal to be <b>touched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> limbs and head. In both humans and animals, <b>touch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> limbs or head elicited exaggerated withdrawal movements and refusal to be <b>touched</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lips and tongue resulted in difficulty in feeding. These behavioural alterations {{can be interpreted as}} loss of exploratory activities towards extrapersonal space, or more positively, as rejection of contact with the environment. This rejection behaviour in which tactile, visual, and/or gustatory exploration tendencies are altered, is a counterpart of human frontal lobe syndrome and human Klüver-Bucy syndrome...|$|R
