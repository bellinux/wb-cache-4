40|$|In early modem England, necromancy was {{a general}} term applied to the {{practice}} of black magic. Manuals for summoning demons, the dead, and other reprobate apparitions were available to the practitioners of this art, and descriptions of necromancy appeared in other genres ranging from theory to fiction. What the necromancer practiced in secret became a popular narrative made up of elements gleaned from the writings of supporters and detractors of magic. Orthodox Christians, Occultists, and skeptics all denounced the activities of necromancers by publishing descriptive accounts. These divergent bodies of literature inadvertently diffused a legend of the necromancer into public discourse. This thesis explores the curiosity and wonder that these narratives of necromancy provoked as they were staged in the theater. I examine Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus as the culmination of public concepts of necromancy and, in turn, I elucidate what <b>this</b> play has <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the necromantic characteristics [...] specifically, taboo interests and excessive accumulation [...] of the surrounding culture. Likewise, I investigate the presence of necromancy in William Shakespeare's Hamlet in order to analyze the fantastic characteristics of the Ghost and its influence on Hamlet's actions in the play. The fantasy of necromancy [...] of delving into taboo subjects and bringing forth aberrant apparitions [...] materializes in drama, articulating curiosity and wonder as affects rather than as the technical instruments of epistemology...|$|R

30|$|What does <b>this</b> {{framework}} have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> {{the recession}} {{that hit the}} Netherlands {{in the aftermath of}} the financial crisis? We assume that the economy was in steady state before the financial crisis hit, except for the fact that it ran it excessively generous system of tax deductibility of mortgage interest that had lost its credibility. As discussed in Section 2, people might dispute this assumption, claiming that housing was overvalued anyway. As said, we find it hard to square that with the empirical evidence.The financial crisis has affected the Dutch economy along three canals. First, there was an aggregate loss of output/productivity, almost throughout the Western world, as discussed in Section 2. It is unclear what part of the reported output loss can be ascribed to an “exogenous” financial shock, coming unexpectedly, and what part is due to the endogenous mechanisms described below. We take 5 % productivity loss as a reasonable number for the “exogenous” initial impact. It is about the fall in gdp relative to trend all six countries listed in Figure 1 experienced in 2009. Other things equal, a permanent 5 % productivity loss implies that consumption should go down by 5 %. <b>This</b> also applies <b>to</b> the consumption of housing services. Since we assume that the economy is in steady state before the crisis hit, this implies that after the hit, the stock of housing was 5 % above its steady state.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} a piece of wide-scale mixed-methods {{research}} that examines the motivations behind women who watch gay male pornography. To date there has been very little interdisciplinary research investigating this phenomenon, despite a recent survey by PornHub (one of the largest online porn sites in the world) showing that gay male porn is the second most popular choice for women porn users out of 25 + possible genre choices. While both academic literature and popular culture have looked at the interest that (heterosexual) men have in lesbian pornography, considerably less {{attention has been paid to}} the consumption of gay male pornography by women. Research looking at women's consumption of pornography from within the Social Sciences is very focused around heterosexual (and, to a lesser extent, lesbian) pornography. Research looking more generally at gay pornography/erotica (and the subversion of the ‘male gaze’/concept of ‘male as erotic object’) often makes mention of female interest in this area, but only briefly, and often relies on anecdotal or observational evidence. Research looking at women's involvement in slashfic (primarily from within media studies), while very thorough and rich, tends to view slash writing as a somewhat isolated phenomenon (indeed, in her influential article on women's involvement in slash, Bacon-Smith talks about how ‘only a small number’ of female slash writers and readers have any interest in gay literature or pornography more generally, and this phenomenon is not often discussed in more recent analyses of slash); so while there has been a great deal of very interesting research done in this field, little attempt has been made to couch it more generally within women's consumption and use of pornography and erotica or to explore what women enjoy about watching gay male pornography. Through a series of focus groups, interviews, and an online questionnaire (n = 275), this exploratory piece of work looks at what women enjoy about gay male pornography, and how it sits within their consumption of erotica/pornography more generally. The article investigates what <b>this</b> has <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the existence and nature of a ‘female gaze’...|$|R
40|$|There {{has always}} been an air of {{suspicion}} about those who think philosophically about the nature and values of physical education. On the one hand, physical education teachers are apt to claim that theirs is essentially a practical vocation; a calling to the teaching of physical activities that can help students to live better lives. What need have they of a philosophy? On the other hand, philosophers of education, notably in the liberal-analytical tradition, have often sought to cast a dim light on physical education, thinking it valuable (on good days at least) – but not educationally so. I shall try in <b>this</b> chapter <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something <b>about</b> the nature and values of physical education; the knowledge and the values that are inherent within its activities and those external ones which can be gained from them. The chapter revolves around a critique of some recent theoretically sophisticated attempts to discuss the nature and educational status of physical education by three philosophers David Carr (1997), Jim Parry (1998) and Andrew Reid (1996 a, 1996 b, 1997). I try to show where their arguments are both helpful but ultimately inadequate for the task of illuminating what physical education ought properly to consist of and how it might better prove its educational status and value. In particular, I try to show how it is absolutely necessary to think philosophically about the nature and values of activities that are thought to constitute physical education. ...|$|R

40|$|Geometric {{mechanics}} {{is often}} commended for its breadth (e. g., fluids, circuits, controls) and depth (e. g., identification of stability criteria, controllability criteria, conservation laws). However, {{on the interface}} between disciplines it is commonplace for the analysis previously done on each discipline in isolation to break down. For example, when a solid is immersed in a fluid, the particle relabeling symmetry is broken because particles in the fluid behave differently from particles in the solid. This breaks conservation laws, and even changes the configuration manifolds. A second example {{is that of the}} interconnection of circuits. It has been verified that LC-circuits satisfy a variational principle. However, when two circuits are soldered together this variational principle must transform to accommodate the interconnection. Motivated by these difficulties, this thesis analyzes the following couplings: fluid-particle, fluid-structure, and circuit-circuit. For the case of fluid-particle interactions we understand the system as a Lagrangian system evolving on a Lagrange-Poincare bundle. We leverage <b>this</b> interpretation <b>to</b> propose a class of particle methods by "ignoring" the vertical Lagrange-Poincare equation. In a similar vein, we can analyze fluids interacting with a rigid body. We then generalize <b>this</b> analysis <b>to</b> view fluid-structure problems as Lagrangian systems on a Lie algebroid. The simplicity of the reduction process for Lie algebroids allows us to propose a mechanism in which swimming corresponds to a limit-cycle in a reduced Lie algebroid. In the final section we change gears and understand non-energetic interconnection as Dirac structures. In particular we find that any (linear) non-energetic interconnection is equivalent to some Dirac structure. We then explore what <b>this</b> insight has <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> variational principles, using interconnection of LC-circuits as a guiding example. </p...|$|R
40|$|Bell playing clocks are clocks {{in which}} the {{movement}} plays a programmed melody {{on a series of}} tuned bells at set times. This type of clock flourished in the mid- 18 th century. A large number of bell playing clocks have been preserved. These clocks provide an interesting musicological source for the music that the clock owners heard daily. What was the musical repertoire on 18 th century bell playing clocks in the Netherlands, and what does <b>this</b> have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the clock owners’ taste in music? A collection of recordings by Melgert Spaander, a clockmaker from Zutphen, and eight bell playing clocks in Utrecht’s Museum Speelklok’s collection {{serve as the basis for}} this study. Most bell playing clocks were either longcase clocks or table clocks. There was considerable English influence on the Dutch clock market: English clockmakers worked in the Netherlands, clocks for the Dutch market were made in England, and Dutch clockmakers ordered parts from England. Clockmakers virtually never made a clock entirely by themselves; many aspects, such as crafting the cabinet, were contracted out. Customers could commission a clock, buy one ready-made from a clockmaker, or lease or acquire one through an estate sale or lottery. The movements in bell playing clocks would have been made by clockmakers. A musician was recruited to help with the arrangements, however. Bell playing clocks were quite expensive, and owners predominantly belonged to a wealthy ruling class. Due to the technical and acoustic limitations of bell playing clocks, relatively short, simple melodies were programmed. The melodies usually had a Dutch title, but there were also French and a few English titles, too. In any case, many of the melodies originally came from France. Dances, especially minuets, and songs were the most popular choices for bell playing clocks. Clock owners would have heard serious songs set to the melodies, for example about politics or love, but the vast majority were drinking songs, songs about comical, waggish courtships, and even risqué songs. The most widely programmed melody on bell playing clocks has the standard title ‘Allemande ik prees weleer’. The bell playing clock owners would have been familiar with the melodies not only from their clocks. Bell playing clock melodies were also available as sheet music and heard in the theatre, as house music for royalty and on organ clocks, but most of all in the carillon repertoire (as far as popular music is concerned), as well as published in books featuring instrumental tunes and songbooks. Although some of the books of instrumental tunes were for ‘traditional’ professional musicians, most were used by the more affluent Dutch who took lessons from professional musicians. The songbooks featuring the most bell playing clock repertoire were likewise intended for the well-to-do circles...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{carries out}} a careful {{linguistic}} comparison between Giuseppe Baretti (1760) ’s and Dr. Johnson (1755) ’s grammars of English to assess {{to what extent}} Baretti’s work and linguistic views were influenced by his mentor. Although Baretti was accused of plagiarizing Johnson’s grammar both in his time and nowadays, a more careful and balanced assessment of his work points out that he does in fact admit to having taken and even copied from Johnson {{and that he is}} very good at reworking and adapting Johnson’s text for his own purpose, context and audience. While Johnson has to do with an English public, the Italian author focuses on the Italian student of English and has thus to highlight all the similarities and dissimilarities between the two languages, and all the relating problematic issues. Baretti’s main aim consists in making his grammaticographic treatment as easier and comprehensible as possible: in fact, he shortens what he deems too philological and erudite, he removes the linguistic niceties of Johnson’s presentation (information about English grammarians, specific language varieties etc.), and he employs a simple language, full of metaphors and images that can be easily understood by his readership. Moreover, his whole text is noted for its familiar, friendly and, at times, joking tone, which Baretti can convey by pointing out his own past difficulties as a student of English and by playing with his interlocutor. Baretti’s intellectual strength, linguistic skills and original approach shine through his grammar. Although he was ready to recognize Johnson’s pre-eminence, he did not give up using his brains, and was able to put forward original considerations and personal remarks, thus revealing his enthusiastic commitment and outstanding personality. Finallly, by reworking Johnson’s grammar, Baretti has contributed some innovative material and techniques to the early tradition of Italian grammars of the English language. In an even larger perspective, what <b>this</b> paper tries <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Baretti and Johnson, and their grammar books, illustrates a crucial moment in the complex and intriguing history of the linguistic, literary and cultural relations between England and Italy...|$|R
