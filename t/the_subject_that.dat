5|$|In 1869, the United States Post Office {{issued the}} first U.S. Postage stamp to depict an actual {{historic}} event, and <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> was chosen was the Pony Express. Until then only {{the faces of}} George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson {{were found on the}} face of U.S. Postage. Sometimes mistaken for an actual stamp used by the Pony Express, the 'Pony Express Stamp' issue was released in 1869 (8 years after the Pony Express service had ended) to honor the men who rode the long and sometimes dangerous journeys and to commemorate the service they provided for the nation. In 1940 and 1960 commemorative stamps were issued for the 80th and 100th anniversaries of the Pony Express respectively.|$|E

Although {{his role in the}} establishment of a one-party state in Zambia was controversial, he shrewdly produced a report on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that,</b> in some respects, stood the test of time. He seemed to lack personal ambition and did not enrich himself through political office. His deep interest in Tonga culture, language and history led him to make a small contribution to Tonga literature: his Chitonga novel, Kabuca Uleta Tunji, was awarded the Margaret Wrong medal in 1956. His daughter Elizabeth Muyovwe is a Justice of the Supreme Court of Zambia. His brother Mark Chona also played a prominent part in Zambia's political and public life.|$|E

25|$|Planometria, or, The Whole Art of Surveying of Land was a {{pamphlet}} written in 1650 by Leybourn and published under the pseudonym Oliver Wallinby. Leybourn expanded {{this into a}} full book, The Compleat Surveyor which {{was first published in}} 1653, by his own press. This was the first book published on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> did not contain an extensive argument justifying surveying. The book outlined the various instruments used in surveying, and how they were employed. This book was one of the standard references in the field {{for the remainder of the}} 17th century and into the 18th century. The book instructed property surveyors on the construction of property maps, and how to make the appropriate coloured inks for the maps. At this time, the use of private estates maps was starting to become fashionable, to the extent that some very pleased clients would display the coloured maps for their guests to view. The book also contains instructions on mathematical measures. The section on the use of Gunter's chains as a unit of length shows early use of decimals in surveying. Leybourn would later expand and clairify this in his 1657 work Arithmetick, Vulgar, Decimal and Instramental.|$|E

Following disputes between Parliament and King Charles I over the execution of the Thirty Years' War, Parliament refused to grant subsidies to support the war effort, leading to Charles gathering [...] "forced loans" [...] without Parliamentary approval and arbitrarily imprisoning those who refused to pay. Moreover, the war footing of the nation led to the forced billeting of soldiers within the homes of private citizens, and the declaration of martial law over large swathes of the country.|$|E
500|$|The {{works in}} this series are {{regarded}} as having [...] "dense abstract complexity" [...] to blur the clarity of his earlier references while emphasizing [...] "...the bravura of the brushstroke..." [...] rather than <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> {{it is used to}} depict. [...] The use of the artist's paintbrush to create enormous renditions of house-painter brushstrokes in the quasi-mechanical Lichtenstein style is a commentary on his own painting actions. The series was a response to the Pop Art critics of the day, who were mostly abstract expressionist. He expropriated the most basic element of expressionism in his own style both in painting and in sculpture. The series of Brushstroke canvases is regarded as a group of works that parody [...] gestural painting by commenting on the normal individual relationship between the artist and his tools.|$|E

50|$|Besides inspiring {{a number}} of {{replications}} and extensions, the weapons effect and Berkowitz and LePage’s original study has received major criticism. First, replications have not always found the weapons effect. In 1971, Ellis and colleagues gave 104 <b>subjects</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to shock a confederate (a research assistant who pretends to be another person) after receiving no shocks, 2 shocks, or 8 shocks from this confederate. This created angered and non-angered subjects. For some of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> weapons {{were present in the}} study room; furthermore, researchers told some of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> confederate was a policeman and researchers told the other group that the confederate was a student. This study did not find weapons to be aggression-eliciting stimuli, with {{no significant difference in the}} number of shocks administered among those who had a weapon in the study room and those who did not, regardless of level of shock originally received by <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> Interestingly, when researchers told <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> confederate was a student, the presence of weapons in the study room in combination with a <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> was not angered at the study onset, inhibited the number of shocks administered. Also, when researchers told <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> confederate was a policeman, the presence of weapons in the study room in combination with a <b>subject</b> <b>that</b> was angered at the study onset, inhibited the amount of shocks <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> administered.|$|R
