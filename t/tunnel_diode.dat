The result is obtained that the exciton of the luminescence in the quantum well is partly come from the cap layer in the experiment. So the photoluminescence spectrum {{is closely related to}} the electron transport in the resonant <b>tunnelling</b> <b>diode</b> structure. This offers a method by which the important performance of resonant <b>tunnelling</b> <b>diode</b> could be forecast by analysing the integrated photoluminescence intensities...|$|R

2500|$|However, the tetrode had one new problem. In any tube, {{electrons}} {{strike the}} anode with sufficient energy {{to cause the}} emission of electrons from its surface. In a triode this so-called secondary emission of electrons is not important since they are simply re-captured by the more positive anode (plate). But in a tetrode they can be captured by the screen grid (thus also acting as an anode) since it is also at a high voltage, thus robbing them from the plate current and reducing the amplification of the device. Since secondary electrons can outnumber the primary electrons, in the worst case, particularly as the plate voltage dips below the screen voltage, the plate current can decrease with increasing plate voltage. This is the so-called [...] "tetrode kink" [...] and {{is an example of}} negative resistance which can itself cause instability. The otherwise undesirable negative resistance was exploited to produce an extremely simple oscillator circuit only requiring connection of the plate to a resonant LC circuit to oscillate; this was effective over a wide frequency range. The so-called dynatron oscillator thus operated on the same principle of negative resistance as the <b>tunnel</b> <b>diode</b> oscillator many years later. Another undesirable consequence of secondary emission is that in extreme cases enough charge can flow to the screen grid to overheat and destroy it. Later tetrodes had anodes treated to reduce secondary emission; earlier ones such as the type 77 sharp-cutoff pentode connected as a tetrode made better dynatrons.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1960s {{the use of}} tunnel diodes in logic {{circuits}} was an active research topic. When compared to transistor logic gates of the time, the <b>tunnel</b> <b>diode</b> offered much higher speeds. Unlike other diode types, the <b>tunnel</b> <b>diode</b> offered the possibility of amplification of signals at each stage. The operating principles of a <b>tunnel</b> <b>diode</b> logic rely on biasing of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>diode</b> and supply of current from inputs over a threshold current, to switch the diode between two states. Consequently, <b>tunnel</b> <b>diode</b> {{logic circuits}} required a means to reset the diode after each logical operation. A simple <b>tunnel</b> <b>diode</b> gate offered little isolation between inputs and outputs and had low fan in and fan out. More complex gates, with additional tunnel diodes and bias power supplies, overcame some of these limitations. [...] Advances in discrete and integrated circuit transistor speed and the more nearly unilateral nature of transistor amplifiers overtook the <b>tunnel</b> <b>diode</b> gate {{and it is no}} longer used in modern computers.|$|E

50|$|All MJ {{photovoltaic}} cells use III-V semiconductor materials. GaAsSb-based heterojunction <b>tunnel</b> <b>diodes,</b> instead of conventional InGaP highly doped <b>tunnel</b> <b>diodes</b> described above, {{have a lower}} tunneling distance. Indeed, in the heterostructure formed by GaAsSb and InGaAs, the valence band of GaAsSb {{is higher than the}} valence band of the adjoining p-doped layer. Consequently, the tunneling distance dtunnel is reduced and so the tunneling current, which exponentially depends of dtunnel, is increased. Hence, the voltage is lower than that of the InGaP tunnel junction.GaAsSb heterojunction <b>tunnel</b> <b>diodes</b> offer other advantages. The same current can be achieved by using a lower doping. Secondly, because the lattice constant is larger for GaAsSb than Ge, one can use a wider range of materials for the bottom cell because more materials are lattice-matched to GaAsSb than to Ge.|$|R

50|$|Lambda diodes work {{at higher}} voltage than tunnel diodes. Whereas a typical <b>tunnel</b> <b>diode</b> may exhibit {{negative}} differential resistance approximately between 70 mV and 350 mV, this region occurs approximately between 1.5 V and 6 V in a lambda diode {{due to the}} higher pinch-off voltages of typical JFET devices.

40|$|Interband <b>tunnel</b> <b>diodes</b> {{are widely}} used to {{electrically}} interconnect the individual subcells in multi-junction solar cells. <b>Tunnel</b> <b>diodes</b> have to operate at high current densities and low voltages, especially when used in concentrator solar cells. They represent {{one of the most}} critical elements of multi-junction solar cells and the fluctuations of the peak current in the diodes have an essential impact on the performance and reliability of the devices. Recently we have found that GaAs <b>tunnel</b> <b>diodes</b> exhibit extremely high peak currents that can be explained by resonant tunnelling through defects homogeneously distributed in the junction. Experiments evidence rather large fluctuations of the peak current in the diodes fabricated from the same wafer. It is a challenging task to clarify the reason for such large fluctuations in order to improve the performance of the multi-junction solar cells. In this work we show that the large fluctuations of the peak current in <b>tunnel</b> <b>diodes</b> can be caused by relatively small fluctuations of the dopant concentration. We also show that the fluctuations of the peak current become smaller for deeper energy levels of the defects responsible for the resonant tunnelling...|$|R

We show that the influence of the non-parabolicity of the bands on the position of the energy levels in the quantum well for the simple resonant tunnelling structure is of the same order as the shifts induced by the charging of the quantum well.
