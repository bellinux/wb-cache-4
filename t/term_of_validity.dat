40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} {{limits of}} validity to opened or reconstituted vials and cytostatic mixtures {{according to their}} physico- chemical stability {{and the level of}} risk and preparation requirements. The level of risk and preparation requirements were assigned by the risk matrix the Guide of Good Practice of Preparation of Drugs in Hospital Pharmacy Services. Method: A table of stabilities of cytostatic drugs was developed. Physicochemical stability data were obtained from data sheets and literature reviews. The level of risk was assigned by the matrix of risk depending on the requirements of each preparation. When the physico-chemical stability was equal to or higher than indicated by the matrix, it is assumed the terms of validity of the matrix; otherwise, validity periods coincided with the peak period of physicochemical stability. Results: 61 drugs were reviewed. It was assumed the chemical <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> in 45. 9 % of opened/reconstituted vials and 50. 8 % of cytostatic mixtures, and indicated by the risk in the rest array, respectively. According to the matrix, the level of risk was medium in most of cytostatic drugs. Only one preparation was high risk. No preparation obtained low-risk. Conclusions: To assign the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> of opened/reconstituted vials and cytostatic mixtures not only it is necessary to consider physical and chemical stability.

40|$|Historically, the {{philosophical}} {{literature on the}} ontological argument has primarily been concerned with {{the assessment of the}} argument in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> its <b>validity</b> or lack thereof. Rarely have the logical foundations <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> itself been investigated in their relation to the argument. My thesis seeks to remedy this omission by investigating the correlation between changing conceptions of logic and ontological argumentation. To do so, I discuss the conceptions of logic employed by three of the most notable modern expositors of the ontological argument: Leibniz, Kant and Frege. I characterize their conceptions <b>of</b> logic in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> formality and modality and subsequently relate these characterizations to their respective critiques of the ontological argument, establishing that an important correlation exists between one's conception of logic and one's assessment of ontological argumentation. In conclusion, I argue for the importance of understanding ontological argumentation not only in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> its <b>validity</b> within a given conception of logic, but also in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the conception of logic itself...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: A short {{screening}} tool for high-risk individuals with personality disorder (PD) is useful both for clinicians and researchers. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the validity and reliability of the Farsi version of the Standardized Assessment of Personality-Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS). Methods: The original English version of the SAPAS questionnaire was translated into Farsi, and then, translated back into English by two professionals. A survey was then conducted using the questionnaire on 150 clients of primary health care centers in Tabriz, Iran. A total of 235 medical students were also studied for the reliability assessment of the questionnaire. The SAPAS was compared to the short form of Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). The data analysis was performed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve technique, operating characteristic for diagnostic efficacy, Cronbach's alpha, and test-retest for reliability evaluation. Results: We found an area under the curve (AUC) of 0. 566 [95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 0. 455 - 0. 677]; sensitivity of 0. 89 and specificity of 0. 26 at the cut-off score of 2 and higher. The total Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0. 38 and Cohen's kappa ranged between 0. 5 and 0. 8.

Furthermore, a comparison between various commercial products was also performed. As a result, the stability of available iodine in 0. 5 % povidone-iodine solution {{was found to be}} affected by light, temperature and the sealability of the container. Of the storage methods investigated in the present study, the method of keeping the highest available iodine concentration was to store the povidone-iodine solution in a closed container under a light-shielded state at 4 °C. The <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> was 3 or 4 weeks in Hisiiode disinfectant solution or other products (Isodine? solution, Popiyodon solution, Negmin? solution, Popyral disinfectant solution and Iodine M disinfectant solution), respectively in storage in a closed container under a light-unshielded state at room temperature, which was the usual method of a disinfectant, from the results of a stability test of available iodine in 0. 5 % povidone-iodine solution. It was confirmed that bactericidal activity was maintained until at least 4 weeks after preparation in every commercial product from the results of a bactericidal activity test on the solution in the usual storage method (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans).

40|$|Since {{social media}} gains ever {{increasing}} popularity, Online Social Networks have become important repositories for information retrieval. The concept of social search, therefore, is gradually being {{recognized as the}} next breakthrough in this field, and {{it is expected to}} dominate topics in industry. However, retrieving information from OSNs with high Quality of Experience is non-trivial {{as a result of the}} prevalence of mobile applications for social networking services. For the sake of shortening user perceived latency Web caching was introduced and has been studied extensively for years. Nevertheless, the previous works seldom focus on the Web caching solutions for social search. In the context of this master’s thesis project, emphasis is given to the design of a Web caching system which is used to cache public data from social media with the objective of improving the user experience in terms of the freshness of data and the perceived service latency. To be more specific, a Web caching strategy named Staleness Bounded LRU algorithm is proposed to limit the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>validity</b> of the cached data. In addition, a Two-Level Web Caching System that adopts the SB-LRU algorithm is proposed in order for shortening the user perceived latency. Results of trace-driven simulations and performance evaluations demonstrate that serving clients with stale data is avoided and the user perceived latencies are significantly shortened when the proposed Web caching system is used in the use case of unauthenticated social search. Besides, the design idea in this project is believed to be helpful to the design of a Web caching system for social search, which is capable of caching user specific data for different clients...|$|E
