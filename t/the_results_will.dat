25|$|A Y-DNA {{haplotype}} is the numbered {{results of}} a genealogical Y-DNA STR test. Each allele value has a distinctive frequency within a population. For example, at DYS455, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> show 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 repeats, with 11 being most common. For high marker tests the allele frequencies provide a signature for a surname lineage.|$|E
25|$|Election {{results are}} {{announced}} through live broadcasts by {{radio and television}} stations. Some newspapers print special editions to cover the election results. In most constituencies, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> {{be out on the}} night of the election day. In some rural constituencies and constituencies that need recounts, the results may not be announced until the next day.|$|E
25|$|Double-blind {{methods can}} be applied to any {{experimental}} situation {{in which there is a}} possibility that <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be affected by conscious or unconscious bias on the part of researchers, participants, or both. For example, in animal studies, both the carer of the animals and the assessor of the results have to be blinded; otherwise the carer might treat control subjects differently and alter the results.|$|E

25|$|In 2009 {{the same}} company started a project to use 23,000 liters of water in a {{seasonal}} storage tank, heated up by evacuated solar tubes throughout the year, with the aim to provide the house with enough heat throughout the winter months thus {{eliminating the need for}} any electrical heat to keep the house comfortably warm. The system is monitored and documented by a research team from The University of Ulster and <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be included in part of a PhD thesis.|$|E
25|$|A small {{investment}} fund can potentially yield a higher return {{because it can}} concentrate its investments in {{a small number of}} good opportunities without driving up the purchase price as they buy in, and later sell them without driving down the sale price as they sell off. Conversely, a large {{investment fund}} must spread its investments among so many securities that its results tend to track those of the market as a whole. As the size of the market controlled grows, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be closer to market average.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} that the gas mixture in a cylinder is thoroughly mixed before analysing or <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be inaccurate. When partial pressure or mass blending is done at low flow rates the gases entering the cylinder are not moving fast enough to ensure good mixing, and particularly when blends contain Helium, they may tend to remain in layers due to density differences. This is termed stratification, and if left long enough, diffusion will ensure complete mixing. However, if the gas is to be analysed soon after blending, mechanical agitation is recommended. This may be by lying a single cylinder on a flat surface and rolling it for a short period, but twins are more usually inverted a few times. Stratification is more pronounced with blends containing helium, but can also lead to inaccurate analysis of Nitrox blends.|$|E

2500|$|The real-valued {{sinusoidal}} function representing either voltage {{or current}} may be broken into two complex-valued functions.

Given the symmetry, we only need to perform the analysis for one right-hand term; <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be identical for the other.

2500|$|In {{marketing}} situations, it {{is important}} that the prior probability is (1) chosen correctly, and (2) is understood. [...] A disadvantage to using Bayesian analysis is that there is no ‘correct’ way to choose a prior, therefore the inferences require a thorough analysis to translate the subjective prior beliefs into a mathematically formulated prior to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> not be misleading and consequently lead to the disproportionate analysis of preposteriors. The subjective definition of probability and the selection and use of the priors have led to statisticians critiquing this subjective definition of probability that underlies the Bayesian approach.|$|E

RTL's Head of Programm Frank Hoffmann stated in April 2014 that he wants to keep the series for the years the come, although the ratings continued to fall, especially in the live shows. He further explained that the live-shows will be cut to an [...] "absolut minimum". In Fall 2014, RTL gave closer details to the changes of Season 12. The liveshows are replaced with pre-recorded concerts in clubs in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Only the announcement of <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>will</b> be broadcast live.
