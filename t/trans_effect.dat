Here, we evaluate allelic <b>effects,</b> cis and <b>trans</b> regulation, and dominance patterns of transcripts that are genetically variable {{in a natural}} population of Drosophila melanogaster. Our results indicate that genetic variation due to the third chromosome causes mainly additive and nearly additive effects on gene expression, that cis and <b>trans</b> <b>effects</b> on gene expression are numerically about equal, and that cis effects account for more genetic variation than do <b>trans</b> <b>effects.</b> We also evaluated patterns of variation in different functional categories and determined that genes involved in metabolic processes are overrepresented among variable transcripts, but those involved in development, transcription regulation, and signal transduction are underrepresented.

25|$|The <b>trans</b> <b>effect</b> in square {{complexes}} can {{be explained}} in terms of an addition/elimination mechanism that goes through a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate. Ligands with a high <b>trans</b> <b>effect</b> are in general those with high π acidity (as in the case of phosphines) or low-ligand lone-pair–dπ repulsions (as in the case of hydride), which prefer the more π-basic equatorial sites in the intermediate. The second equatorial position is occupied by the incoming ligand; due to the principle of microscopic reversibility, the departing ligand must also leave from an equatorial position. The third and final equatorial site is occupied by the trans ligand, so the net result is that the kinetically favored product is the one in which the ligand trans to the one with the largest <b>trans</b> <b>effect</b> is eliminated.|$|E
25|$|In {{inorganic}} chemistry, the <b>trans</b> <b>effect</b> is the labilization (making more reactive) of ligands {{that are}} trans to certain other ligands, which {{can thus be}} regarded as trans-directing ligands. It is attributed to electronic effects and it is most notable in square planar complexes, although {{it can also be}} observed for octahedral complexes. The cis effect is most often observed in octahedral transition metal complexes.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} <b>trans</b> <b>effect</b> can {{be measured}} experimentally using X-ray crystallography, and is observed as a stretching of the bonds between the metal and the ligand trans to a trans-influencing ligand. Stretching {{by as much as}} 0.2 Å occurs with strong trans-influencing ligands such as hydride. A cis influence can also be observed, but is smaller than the trans influence. The relative importance of the cis and trans influences depends on the formal electron configuration of the metal center, and explanations have been proposed based on the involvement of the atomic orbitals.|$|E
40|$|Regulation of gene {{expression}} is usually separated into cis and trans components. The separation may become artificial if {{much of the}} variation in expression is under multigenic and epistatic (e. g., cis-by-trans) control. There is hence a need to quantify the relative contribution of cis, <b>trans,</b> and cis-by-trans <b>effects</b> on expression divergence at different levels of evolution. To do so across the whole genome, we analyzed the full set of chromosome-substitution lines between the two behavioral races of Drosophila melanogaster. Our observations: (i) Only ≈ 3 % of the genes with an expression difference are purely cis regulated. In fact, relatively few genes are governed by simple genetics because nearly 80 % of expression differences are controlled by at least two chromosomes. (ii) For 14 % of the genes, cis regulation does play a role but usually in conjunction with trans regulation. This joint action of cis and <b>trans</b> <b>effects,</b> either additive or epistatic, is referred to as inclusive cis effect. (iii) The percentage of genes with inclusive cis effect increases to 32 % among genes that are strongly differentiated between the two races. (iv) We observed a nonrandom distribution of trans-acting factors, with a substantial deficit on the second chromosome. Between Drosophila racial groups, trans regulation of expression difference is extensive, and cis regulation often evolves in conjunction with <b>trans</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
40|$|Chromatin {{accessibility}} is {{an important}} functional genomics phenotype that influences transcription factor binding and gene expression. Genome-scale technologies allow chromatin accessibility to be mapped with high-resolution, facilitating detailed analyses into the genetic architecture and evolution of chromatin structure within and between species. We performed Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements sequencing (FAIRE-Seq) to map chromatin accessibility in two parental haploid yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus and their diploid hybrid. We show that although broad-scale characteristics of the chromatin landscape are well conserved between these species, accessibility is significantly different for 947 regions upstream of genes that are enriched for GO terms such as intracellular transport and protein localization exhibit. We also develop new statistical methods to investigate the genetic architecture of variation in chromatin accessibility between species, and find that cis effects are more common and of greater magnitude than <b>trans</b> <b>effects.</b> Interestingly, we find that cis and <b>trans</b> <b>effects</b> at individual genes are often negatively correlated, suggesting widespread compensatory evolution to stabilize levels of chromatin accessibility. Finally, we demonstrate {{that the relationship between}} chromatin accessibility and gene expression levels is complex, and a significant proportion of differences in chromatin accessibility might be functionally benign...|$|R

40|$|Background: Rasgrf 1 is {{imprinted}} in mouse, displaying paternal allele specific {{expression in}} neonatal brain. Paternal expression {{is accompanied by}} paternal-specific DNA methylation at a differentially methylated domain (DMD) within the locus. The cis-acting elements necessary for Rasgrf 1 imprinting are known. A series of tandem DNA repeats control methylation of the adjacent DMD, which is a methylation sensitive enhancer-blocking element. These two sequences constitute a binary switch that controls imprinting and represents the Imprinting Control Region (ICR). One paternally transmitted mutation, which helped define the ICR, induced paramutation, in trans, on the maternal allele. Like many imprinted genes, Rasgrf 1 lies within an imprinted cluster. One of four noncoding transcripts in the cluster, AK 015891, {{is known to be}} imprinted. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we demonstrate that an additional noncoding RNA, AK 029869, is imprinted and paternally expressed in brain throughout development. Intriguingly, any of several maternally inherited ICR mutations affected expression of the paternal AK 029869 transcript in trans. Furthermore, we found that the ICR mutations exert different <b>trans</b> <b>effects</b> on AK 029869 at different developmental times. Conclusions/Significance: Few <b>trans</b> <b>effects</b> have been defined in mammals and, those that exist, do not show the great variation seen at the Rasgrf 1 imprinted domain, either in terms of the large number of mutations that produce the effects o...|$|R

Most (∼ 70 %) differences in nucleosome positioning between two closely related yeast species are due to cis effects. Cis effects are primarily due to divergence of AT-rich nucleosome-disfavoring sequences, but are not associated with divergence of nucleosome-favoring sequences. Differences in nucleosome positioning propagate to multiple adjacent nucleosomes, supporting the statistical positioning hypothesis. Divergence of nucleosome positioning is excluded from regulatory elements and is not correlated with gene expression divergence, suggesting a neutral mode of evolution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Immunometabolism plays {{a central}} role in many cardiometabolic diseases. However, a robust map of immune-related gene {{networks}} in circulating human cells, their interactions with metabolites, and their genetic control is still lacking. Here, we integrate blood transcriptomic, metabolomic, and genomic profiles from two population-based cohorts (total N[*]=[*] 2168), including a subset of individuals with matched multi-omic data at 7 -year follow-up. Results: We identify topologically replicable gene networks enriched for diverse immune functions including cytotoxicity, viral response, B cell, platelet, neutrophil, and mast cell/basophil activity. These immune gene modules show complex patterns of association with 158 circulating metabolites, including lipoprotein subclasses, lipids, fatty acids, amino acids, small molecules, and CRP. Genome-wide scans for module expression quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) reveal five modules with mQTLs that have both cis and <b>trans</b> <b>effects.</b> The strongest mQTL is in ARHGEF 3 (rs 1354034) and affects a module enriched for platelet function, independent of platelet counts. Modules of mast cell/basophil and neutrophil function show temporally stable metabolite associations over 7 -year follow-up, providing evidence that these modules and their constituent gene products may play central roles in metabolic inflammation. Furthermore, the strongest mQTL in ARHGEF 3 also displays clear temporal stability, supporting widespread <b>trans</b> <b>effects</b> at this locus. Conclusions: This study provides a detailed map of natural variation at the blood immunometabolic interface and its genetic basis, and may facilitate subsequent studies to explain inter-individual variation in cardiometabolic disease...|$|R
