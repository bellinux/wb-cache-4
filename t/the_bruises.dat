25|$|Brady's first {{witnesses}} {{during the}} trial included Betty Campbell, a model, who attended the September 5 party and testified that she saw Arbuckle {{with a smile on}} his face hours after the alleged rape occurred; Grace Hultson, a local hospital nurse who testified it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process; and Dr. Edward Heinrich, a local criminologist who claimed he found Arbuckle's fingerprints smeared with Rappe's blood on room 1219's bathroom door. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. During cross-examination, Betty Campbell, however, revealed that Brady threatened to charge her with perjury if she did not testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced the St. Francis hotel maid, who testified that she had cleaned the room before the investigation even took place and did not find any blood on the bathroom door. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab was furthermore able to get Nurse Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe's bladder could very well have been a result of cancer, and that <b>the</b> <b>bruises</b> on her body could also have been a result of the heavy jewelry she was wearing that evening. During the defense stage of the trial, McNab called various pathology experts who testified that although Rappe's bladder had ruptured, there was evidence of chronic inflammation and no evidence of any pathological changes preceding the rupture; in other words, there was no external cause for the rupture.|$|E

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to compare different methods to measure bruise susceptibility of fruit. In order to compare measured values with actual commercial bruising, an appropriate test method to simulate impact damage during handling was developed, employing a revolving tumbler. From <b>the</b> analysis of <b>bruise</b> damage produced by the tumbler on four apple cultivars under different storage treatments, {{it was found that}} a large percentage of bruises were less than 1. 5 cm in area, and <b>the</b> number of <b>bruises</b> above 1. 5 cm did not change between treatments. It was concluded that laboratory measurements involving high impact energy levels may be insensitive as indicators of bruising levels on fruit during commercial operations. The impact loads produced by this method was very similar to those incurred by a practical grader, as indicated by Instrumented Sphere measurements. The tumbler test permitted examination of actual grader damage relationships with standard tests. Three standard impact tests (vertical drop test, double and single pendulum test) were conducted on four cultivar apples: Splendour, Granny Smith, Pacific Rose, and Braeburn. Four different shapes of impact surface were used for each impact test. It was found that bruise susceptibility varied with different impact tests. Regression analysis was made on the data obtained from standard impact tests and tumbler test to find the correlation between <b>the</b> <b>bruise</b> susceptibility and <b>the</b> <b>bruise</b> area/apple. Bruise susceptibility obtained from the vertical drop test using the hockey ball was closely related to <b>the</b> <b>bruise</b> area per apple produced by the tumbler test (R = 0. 72). <b>The</b> <b>bruise</b> factor obtained from the single pendulum test using the flat indenter also showed a correlation with <b>the</b> <b>bruise</b> area per apple produced by the tumbler test (R = 0. 78). However, <b>the</b> <b>bruise</b> susceptibility produced by the double pendulum test and single pendulum test was not well correlated with <b>the</b> <b>bruise</b> area/apple and bruise number/apple produced by tumbler test. <b>The</b> <b>bruise</b> susceptibility produced by using the pyramid indenters from three standard impact tests was not well correlated with <b>the</b> <b>bruise</b> area per apple and <b>the</b> number of <b>bruises</b> per apple produced by <b>the</b> tumbler test. <b>Bruise</b> susceptibility, <b>bruise</b> area, and <b>the</b> shape of <b>the</b> <b>bruise</b> depended upon <b>the</b> shape of the indenter used for the experiment and the method used to conduct the impact tests. Splendour, Granny Smith and Pacific Rose all had similar bruise susceptibilities, but Braeburn was significant less susceptible to bruising. Generally, bruise susceptibility increased with storage time in all cultivars. Apples stored in a low humidity environment (65 % RH) generally had lower bruise susceptibilities after 2 months storage for the flat and hockey ball indenters but not for pyramid indenters on Splendour and Braeburn apples, when compared with 90 % RH storage. Bruise susceptibilities at 0. 5 ° C were higher than at room temperature. Fruit firmness also decreased with storage time. Bruise shape depended upon the indenter surface shape. The flatter indenters produced bruises which were less deep than the hockey ball and pyramids. <b>The</b> <b>bruise</b> shape was elliptical for the flat plate, a circle for the hockey ball, and a rhombic for the pyramid indenters. There was no cracking below <b>the</b> <b>bruise</b> region for any apples when the flat plate indenter was used in the three standard impact tests. However cracks were found below <b>the</b> <b>bruise</b> region in Splendour, Pacific Rose, and Braeburn apple (but not for Granny Smith apples) when any pyramid indenter was used. The pyramid indenters produced a more linear relationship between a 2 / 3 power impact energy and bruise area (without skin removal) than either a spherical or a flat indenter. Bruise visibility depended on the impact surface shape and energy levels. Some bruise produced from standard impact tests, when the flat indenter used, were not visible unless the apple skin was removed. Braeburn required a greater impact energy to produce an initial bruise than other cultivars. Once <b>bruising</b> began <b>the</b> visibility of <b>bruising</b> increased with an increase in energy levels...|$|R
25|$|At the Walford In Bloom competition, {{there is}} a gas {{explosion}} and Martin is panicked when he cannot find Stacey and hits a police officer, resulting in two weeks imprisonment. When Kush suffers a cardiac arrest, he is diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome, which is hereditary. Stacey worries that Arthur could die and tells Bex {{about the possibility of}} Arthur having the syndrome. A doctor assures Stacey that the chance of Arthur displaying symptoms at a young age is small. After Stacey misses Lily's dance show, she tells Lily about Arthur's condition. Stacey is annoyed with Whitney when she takes Lily and Arthur for breakfast and Lily is fed up of being ignored by an exhausted Stacey. When Lily refuses to eat her tea, Stacey physically takes Lily to go upstairs in the presence of Carmel, who refuses to leave Stacey with Lily and Arthur. Arthur undergoes an ECG and Stacey, Kush and Martin are told by the specialist that Arthur is at high risk at having the condition, but cannot have an operation or tests like Kush due to his age. Stacey is anxious that Arthur having a cardiac arrest is a sign of the condition and his parents are told about equipment that is not available on the NHS. Stacey is angry with Martin that he asked Kush for money to buy the equipment. Stacey and Martin panic when Arthur will not wake up, and when they receive Arthur's medical records at the hospital, Stacey and Martin are told that Arthur has swallowed Stacey's bipolar medication. Carmel is horrified when she finds bruises on Arthur's arms, and expresses her concerns to Kush that Stacey is unwell, while Stacey tells her sister-in-law Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) that he gained <b>the</b> <b>bruises</b> in hospital. However, Lily tells Carmel that Stacey was responsible, so Carmel reports it to social services, but tries to retract what she said after realising it was a mistake. Social services visit Stacey and Martin and tell them they received a report about Arthur. Arthur and Lily are placed in Carmel's care until social services have investigated. Arthur is looked over by a doctor, who has no concerns and Stacey and Martin can have Arthur and Lily back. Social worker Fiona Payne (Sandra James-Young) tells Stacey and Martin she will be conducting further home visits. Lily tells Stacey and Martin that she injured Arthur. After speaking with Lily, Fiona tells Stacey and Martin that Lily feels pushed out with Arthur and is anxious about the new baby. Kush and Carmel admit Carmel called social services, enraging Stacey, who bans them both from seeing Arthur before suffering an eclamptic seizure. She is taken to hospital, where her and Martin are told her baby will have to be delivered prematurely {{due to a lack of}} oxygen. The baby is delivered, though Martin is told that there are complications. Stacey goes to see her daughter, but changes her mind and snaps at Martin for allowing Carmel to look after Lily. Stacey later sees her daughter. Stacey and Martin's daughter is put on a ventilator. Stacey grows annoyed at Martin suggesting baby names, but confides in Max about her feelings. Stacey apologises to Martin and they name their daughter Hope.|$|E

500|$|Several {{factors have}} led to {{speculation}} that Webster was not alone when he killed Leigh. According to the transcript of Webster's confession, he was never asked if he acted alone. Carrington accused police of accepting Webster's confession at face value, ignoring both forensic and witness evidence. Her investigations highlighted several discrepancies in Webster's confession, and in the forensic evidence. For example, Webster stated in his confession that he had choked Leigh {{with his left hand}} as he knelt beside her although, according to the autopsy report, <b>the</b> <b>bruises</b> on Leigh's neck were consistent with being choked with a right hand. Carrington also questioned Webster's statement that he walked along lit streets {{to the other side of}} the Stockton peninsula to wash his bloodstained hands, when he could have washed his hands in total darkness at the beach less than [...] away. She also queried his claim that he had blood on his hands but none on his clothes, despite Leigh having been struck so hard blood was splattered 2.8 metres one way from her body and 1.3 metres the other way. Webster stated that he walked to the beach with Leigh, though according to police reports four witnesses said she walked to the beach alone; two witnesses stated they saw Webster and Wilson leave the surf club together. Neither NC1 nor Wilson had a reliable alibi for their whereabouts at the time of the murder; Wilson told police he was alone on the beach when Leigh walked past him as she left the club, minutes before she was murdered. Webster's statement that he only penetrated Leigh with his finger has been considered by various sources to be inconsistent with the autopsy findings of genital trauma, and the trauma is also inconsistent with NC1's account that his sex with her was consensual. In reviewing the autopsy, Boettcher said that the numerous blows which killed Leigh came from multiple directions, and were probably inflicted with different items, indicating the possibility of more than one perpetrator.|$|E

Her eyes are covered by a scarf and she has bruises on her belly and around her crotch area. Idolator writer Mike Wass named the cover art [...] "a cross between Frankenstein and Michael Jackson". Matthew Jacobs from The Huffington Post found the cover relatively modest compared to the previous single covers of songs from Artpop. John Walker from MTV News compared the cover to director Tim Burton's works and called it [...] "terrifying". He described Gaga's face and the grills as [...] " [...] the gum-less teeth of a long-buried skull cast in titanium" [...] and believed that the hands and legs were prosthetic.

Peyton sees that Brooke is beaten up, but Brooke lies and says she fell down the stairs, and Peyton believes her, not knowing that Brooke was attacked. Peyton meets a famous musician named Mick Wolf, who used to know Ellie. He is the one who asked Mia about Peyton during the tour. He keeps dodging around the subject of Peyton's real father, but says a little more about him each time Peyton brings him up. Peyton continues to get to know Mick and continues to ask about her real father. When she asks him why her parents gave her up and, he replies, [...] "We... I mean they, had a tough decision." [...] Mick accidentally lets the truth slip out, and suddenly Peyton realizes this is her father. She invites him over for a nice dinner together, he instead goes and gets drunk at a bar after being sober for a year (as shown by a sobriety chip in his pocket). She and Lucas have also set a date for their wedding, which causes conflict between Lucas and Lindsey with regards to the book tour for his second book.
