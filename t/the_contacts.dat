30|$|From a {{mathematical}} point of view, <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> {{problem can be}} solved for both wheel-rail and wheel-roller <b>contact</b> according to <b>the</b> following four steps [11, 12]. The {{first step is to}} solve the geometrical problem, in which the locations of <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> points on <b>the</b> <b>contacting</b> bodies are determined. This is followed by solving <b>the</b> normal <b>contact</b> problem, in which the shape and size of <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> patch formed in <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> interface due to body deformation and the corresponding pressure distribution over <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> patch are determined. The third step is to deal with the kinematic problem, in which normalized kinematic quantities, the so-called creepages, are determined. These quantities measure the relative velocities between <b>the</b> <b>contacting</b> bodies at <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> points. In <b>the</b> final step, the tangential problem is solved; this concerns the prediction of tangential stresses at <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> interface which is generated by friction and creepages within <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> zone [11, 13, 14].

5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} {{granular}} layer from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. <b>The</b> <b>contacts</b> between mossy fibers and granule cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the granule cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E
