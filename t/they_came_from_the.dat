5|$|After {{the last}} ice age only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and woolly {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northern part of the Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Altgens was {{featured}} in two AP dispatches issued on November 22, 1963. He initially reported hearing two shots, but thought someone had been setting off fireworks. For a November 25 story, Altgens wrote {{that he did not}} know the origin of the gunshots until later, but he believed <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other side of Elm Street, opposite the presidential limousine from where he was standing.|$|E

The battle was at times particularly brutal when Loyalists met Patriots, as {{in some cases}} <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same communities. The prisoners, who were first kept in Bennington, were eventually marched to Boston.|$|E

5|$|An {{attempt to}} open a sealed chamber using a Borazon drill fails to make progress. However, a few moments after the drill is stopped, a small hole is seen, though the drill operator, Sladden (Duncan Lamont), is certain it was not created by his machine. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to {{preserve}} the bodies before they decay. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> planet Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between {{the appearance of the}} creatures and images of the Devil.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania has a {{long history}} of stone arch bridges, {{including}} the oldest such bridge in use in the United States, the 1697 Frankford Avenue Bridge over Pennypack Creek in Philadelphia. Such bridges typically used local stone, with three types of finishing possible. Rubble or third-class masonry construction used stones just as <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> quarry; squared-stone or second-class masonry used stones that had been roughly dressed and squared; and ashlar or first-class masonry used stones which had been finely dressed and carefully squared. Rubble masonry was the quickest and cheapest for construction, and had the largest tolerances. Many of the oldest stone bridges in Pennsylvania were built using rubble masonry techniques.|$|E
5|$|A {{category}} of historical and geographical literature, focused on regional history and geography, {{emerged during the}} 18th century among Greek scholars. This kind of literature combined the collection of ethnographic data with a conviction in geography's moral and religious purpose. Major representatives of this field were two scholars and clerics, Daniel Philippidis and Grigorios Konstantas. <b>They</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> village of Milies in Thessaly, modern Greece, and were nicknamed Dimitrieis, from the ancient name of their birthplace (Dimitrias). Both scholars were active members of the Greek diaspora in the Danubian Principalities, in modern Romania, where they studied and taught at the courts of the Greek Orthodox Phanariot and the Princely Academies of Bucharest and Iaşi. This environment offered in general a special attraction for ambitious and educated Greek people from the Ottoman Empire, contributing to the enlightenment of their nation. Philippidis' and Konstantas' work Geographia Neoteriki, published in Vienna in 1791, belongs to a body of contemporary texts which strove to map out the European parts of the Ottoman Empire and Greece in particular.|$|E

25|$|Curtin {{formed a}} close working {{relationship}} with the Allied Supreme Commander in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur. Curtin realised that Australia would be ignored unless it had a strong voice in Washington, D.C., and he wanted that voice to be MacArthur's. He gave over control of Australian forces to MacArthur, directing Australian commanders to treat MacArthur's orders as if <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Australian Government.|$|E

Both William Crookes (in the 1880s) and German {{physicist}} Johann Hittorf, a co-inventor and early researcher of the Crookes tube, found that paper wrapped photographic plates placed near the tube became unaccountably fogged or flawed by shadows, {{although they had}} not been exposed to light.

25|$|Initially, {{the purpose}} of the {{colonization}} policy was unrelated to the ethnic makeup, being to increase the population of the rather sparsely populated area, in order to better exploit its resources.

25|$|The {{ancient history}} of the Nagas is unclear.

25|$|Due to his {{advanced}} age, Augustus {{was unable}} {{to travel to the}} east himself. There were few the Emperor trusted to settle matters in the east, but he was confident Gaius could. Gaius made a good choice, because his presence represented that of the imperial family - all orders, promises, or threats coming from him were as valid as if <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Emperor himself. Nonetheless, he was only eighteen, and therefore too young for the conduct of important business.|$|E

25|$|In forming {{their view}} of Attila's people, the Romans tapped into attitudes {{inherited}} from the Greeks. These were the vilest creatures imaginable. <b>They</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> North and everyone knew that the colder the climate was, the more barbaric the people were. They knew nothing of metal, had no religion and lived like savages, without fire, eating their food raw, living off roots, and meat tenderized by placing it under their horses' saddles. They had no buildings, of course, {{not so much as}} a reed hut, indeed, they feared the very idea of venturing under a roof.|$|E

25|$|The {{estimates}} on {{the number}} of participants in the Labour Day celebrations on Taksim Square in 1977 is usually given as 500,000 citizens. Many participants and in particular the Maoist bloc had not even entered the square when shots were heard. Most witnesses stated that <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> building of the water supply company (Sular İdaresi) and Intercontinental Hotel (now the Marmara Hotel), the tallest building in Istanbul in 1977. Subsequently the security forces intervened with armoured vehicles making much noise with their sirens and explosives. They also hosed the crowd with pressurized water. People tried to escape through Kazancı Yokuşu, the nearest exit from the square, however a track blocked escape route. Most casualties were caused by the panic that police intervention created.|$|E
