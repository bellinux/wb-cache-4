5|$|One of {{the oldest}} sectors of Dubrovnik was {{constructed}} around a Late Antique castle by the sea, which stretched landwards {{a bit more than}} it does today. It was constructed {{on the site of the}} Pre-Romanesque cathedral and the Rector's Palace, thus encircling the city's harbour. The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Miličević in the late 15th century. Notably, the harbour was noticeably painted on <b>the</b> <b>palm</b> <b>of</b> St. Blaise in a triptych painted by the artist Nikola Božidarević around 1500.|$|E
5|$|A {{major element}} of the plot {{is based on the}} wuxia film series Palm of Ru Lai (如來神掌), {{released}} in 1964. Sing studied the fighting style used in Palm of Ru Lai ("Buddhist Palm style"), from a young age and used it at the end of Kung Fu Hustle. In reality, the Buddhist Palm fighting style does not leave palm-shaped craters and holes on impact. Instead, the user delivers powerful punches using his palm. The Beast's name in Chinese, Huoyun Xieshen (火雲邪神; Evil Deity of the Fiery Cloud), and the fight with the Landlady and her husband are also references to <b>the</b> <b>Palm</b> <b>of</b> Ru Lai, in which a mortally wounded master strikes the patterns of his art's final techniques into a bell so that his apprentice can learn from it. Kung Fu Hustle also contains direct references to characters from Louis Cha's wuxia novels. For example, the landlord and landlady refer to themselves as Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü, the names of characters in Cha's The Return of the Condor Heroes, when they met the Beast.|$|E
