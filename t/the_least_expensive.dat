5|$|A {{light rail}} system for Greater Manchester emerged from {{the failure of the}} 1970s Picc-Vic tunnel scheme to obtain central {{government}} funding. A light-rail scheme was proposed in 1982 as <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> rail-based transport solution for Manchester city centre and the surrounding Greater Manchester metropolitan area. Government approval was granted in 1988 and the network began operating services between Bury Interchange and Victoria on 6 April 1992, becoming the United Kingdom's first modern street-running rail system; the 1885-built Blackpool tramway being the only first-generation tram system in the UK that had survived up to Metrolink's creation.|$|E

In Amsterdam, on Christmas Day, Abdulmutallab checked in for Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit with only carry-on luggage. On March24, 2011, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Abdulmutallab chose to attack Detroit because the plane ticket there was <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> of tickets to potential US targets, which included Chicago and Houston.

5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E
5|$|With the {{formation}} of WMATA in October 1966, planning of the system shifted from federal hands to a regional body {{with representatives of the}} District, Maryland and Virginia. Congressional route approval was no longer a key consideration. Instead, routes had to serve each local suburban jurisdiction to assure that they would approve bond referenda to finance the system. Because <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> way to build into the suburbs was to rely upon existing railroad right-of-ways, the Orange Line took much of its present form, except that it also featured a further extension along the railroad to Bowie, Maryland and along the Dulles Access Road to the Dulles Airport.|$|E
5|$|Derfflinger was {{constructed}} at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg under construction number 213. She was <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> {{of the three}} ships, {{at a cost of}} 56 million gold marks. The ship was ready to be launched on 14 June 1913, but during the ceremony, one of the wooden sledges upon which the hull rested became jammed. It took until 12 July for her to enter the water. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. Lützow was built at the Schichau dockyard in Danzig under construction number 885, at the cost of 58million gold marks. The ship was launched on 29 November 1913, and after lengthy trials, commissioned on 8 August 1915. Hindenburg, the final member of the class, was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, under construction number 34. The ship was built at a cost of 59million gold marks, the most expensive of the three vessels. She was launched on 1 August 1915 and commissioned on 10 May 1917.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>least</b> {{computational}} <b>expensive</b> Hamiltonian (methods) and wavefunction (basis sets) for diatomic nickel-aluminum (NiAl), was calculated, {{along with}} the ground state, bond length, frequency, and binding energy. Researchers believe nickel-aluminum {{can be used in}} high performance turbine jet engines, in place of aluminum-coated nickel. The effects of basis functions under increasing levels of theory were compared to methods under increasing levels of theory. The free energy at two possible ground states, doublet or quartet, of nickel-aluminum was compared. The results consistently show the ground-state of nickel-aluminum is the doublet, and therefore has a bond between two valence electrons, one from each nickel and aluminum, and one unpaired electron. The data converged when using large number of basis sets, but did not produce precise results when compared with different methods. Results suggest the density-functional theory (DFT) and an augmented correlation consistent basis set are needed, at minimum, to properly optimize nickel-aluminum. <b>The</b> <b>least</b> computationally <b>expensive,</b> most precise basis set/method combination for diatomic NiAl allows for further research in <b>the</b> <b>least</b> computationally <b>expensive</b> combination, of method and basis set, for large microclusters of NiAl, which could be used in engines as well...|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 19,499,337 gold dollars were coined, of which 18,223,438 were struck at Philadelphia, 1,004,000 at New Orleans, 109,138 at Charlotte, 90,232 at San Francisco and 72,529 at Dahlonega. According to an {{advertisement}} in the February 1899 issue of The Numismatist, gold dollars brought $1.80 each, still in demand as {{a birthday present}} and for jewelry. That journal in 1905 carried news of a customer depositing 100 gold dollars into a bank; the teller, aware of the value, credited the account with $1.60 per coin. In 1908, a dealer offered $2 each for any quantity. As coin collecting became a widespread pastime in the early 20th century, gold dollars became a popular specialty, a status they retain. The 2014 edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins rates <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> gold dollar in very fine condition (VF-20) at $300, a value given {{for each of the}} Type 1 Philadelphia issues from 1849 to 1853. Those seeking one of each type will find the most expensive to be a specimen of the Type 2, with the 1854 and 1855 estimated at $350 in that condition; the other two types have dates valued at $300 in that grade.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in May 1957, bids {{opened for}} the part of US 80 between Grossmont Boulevard in La Mesa and Chase Avenue in El Cajon, that would connect to the new SR 67 freeway. Groundbreaking took place on June 10, and the project was to cost $3.6 million. The {{rebuilding}} of the Cabrillo Freeway interchange became a priority due to the availability of federal funding, and due to the traffic problems encountered with having ramps entering from {{both the left and}} the right. In July, the Highway Development Association decided to formally raise the issue of the incomplete highway survey through Imperial County at the next California Highway Commission meeting. In 1958, federal funds were allocated to construct US 80 from Taylor Street to Fairmount Avenue as an eight-lane freeway, and from there to 70th Street as a divided highway. In August, the state announced that there were four proposed routes for US 80 through the mountains, including one with a tunnel. A contract was later awarded to construct the freeway from Taylor Street to the Cabrillo Freeway at a cost of $1.2 million. In November, Caltrans announced that the Walker Canyon route had been chosen for US 80, which would allow for the route to be constructed in stages, as well as being <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> alternative.|$|E
5|$|The 1986 SQL {{standard}} basically adopted Codd's proposal {{after an}} implementation prototype in IBM System R. Although Don Chamberlin recognized nulls (alongside duplicate rows) {{as one of}} the most controversial features of SQL, he defended the design of Nulls in SQL invoking the pragmatic arguments that it was <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>expensive</b> form of system support for missing information, saving the programmer from many duplicative application-level checks (see semipredicate problem) while at the same time providing the database designer with the option not to use Nulls if he so desires; for example, in order to avoid well known anomalies (discussed in the semantics section of this article). Chamberlin also argued that besides providing some missing-value functionality, practical experience with Nulls also led to other language features which rely on Nulls, like certain grouping constructs and outer joins. Finally, he argued that in practice Nulls also end up being used as a quick way to patch an existing schema when it needs to evolve beyond its original intent, coding not for missing but rather for inapplicable information; for example, a database that quickly needs to support electric cars while having a miles-per-gallon column.|$|E
