This new technology, along with special clothing and oxygen masks, was researched and tested.

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Birmingham, Titterton worked in a research position under Mark Oliphant, who recruited him to work on radar for the British Admiralty during {{the first part of}} the Second World War. In 1943, he joined the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, where he helped develop the first atomic bombs. He eventually became one of the laboratory's group leaders. He participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at the Bikini Atoll in 1946, where he performed the countdown for both <b>tests.</b> <b>With</b> the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave.

5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested in target and drop tests, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before Hiroshima. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was insufficient uranium-235. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough {{that it was only}} deemed necessary to do laboratory <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work. Thirty-two drop tests were conducted at Wendover, and only once did the bomb fail to fire. One last-minute modification was made, to allow the powder bags of propellant that fired the gun to be loaded in the bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{started the}} tour patchily, {{although}} Australia won their first four matches by an innings. In his first four innings, Brown passed five only once, scoring 72 against Oxford University.

Brown entered the <b>Tests</b> <b>with</b> 504 runs at 56.00 in the lead-in tour matches.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, {{all three}} ships {{had been reduced}} to the reserve fleet and were {{primarily}} employed as training ships. They continued in this role during World War I, training men to operate the machinery of warships and transports for the war effort. They were all decommissioned by 1920. Illinois was loaned to the New York Naval Militia and was converted into a floating arsenal. Renamed Prairie State in 1941, she was eventually sold for scrapping in 1956.

However, he performed poorly in the five <b>Tests,</b> <b>with</b> 204 runs at 25.50.

5|$|Harvey then {{returned}} to productivity with 145 against Warwickshire and added a further half-century in the remaining matches.

Harvey compiled 197 runs at 19.70 in five <b>Tests</b> <b>with</b> two half centuries. It was by far his most unproductive summer in England, with 976 runs at 31.48.

An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E
