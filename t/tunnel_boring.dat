5|$|Work on Phase III {{started in}} 2011, with 2016 being the planned deadline, more than 20 <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> {{machines}} were used simultaneously to expedite the work, {{and the actual}} work was completed in fy2017-2018.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{approved}} in December 2007, but was temporarily cancelled a year later. Construction began in May 2010. The <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> machine began work in November 2011 and completed the second tunnel in May 2013. The tunnel was opened to traffic on August 3, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Phase 1 of the Second Avenue Line, {{which opened}} in January 2017, is entirely in Manhattan. It runs under Second Avenue from 65th Street to 105th Street, with {{stations}} at 72nd Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street. It is double-tracked along its entire length, with tracks in parallel tubes bored by <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> machines. Each station's platforms sit between these tracks. North of 96th Street, both tracks continue as storage tracks until they end at 105th Street.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{started in}} November 1996, with the moving of {{underground}} pipes and wires around the station areas. In August 1997, work {{started at the}} depot, and in September, COMET started the first mainline work. In October and November, the two <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> machines (TBM), christened Liva and Bette, were delivered. They started boring each barrel of the tunnel from Islands Brygge in February 1998. The same month, the Public Transport Authority gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro. The section between Fasanvej and Frederiksberg is a former S-train line, and was last operated as such on 20 June 1998.|$|E
5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1998 and was opened on July 18, 2009, {{as part of}} the inaugural Link line, after five years of <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> and station construction. It consists of a single island platform, divided into two sections by the twin bores of the Beacon Hill Tunnel; four high-speed elevators ferry passengers from the platform to the surface entrance. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. Beacon Hill Station is also served by two King County Metro buses that stop at a pair of sheltered bus stops on Beacon Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Excavation of the {{downtown}} bus tunnel began in early 1987, and construction reached the University Street area later that year. The twin <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> machines used to excavate the tunnel reached University Street in October 1987, and continued north towards Westlake station. In December, Metro agreed to pay $2.4 million to real estate developer Marathon Company for use of a city block they owned adjacent to the station for equipment staging and storage, delaying the planned construction of office buildings on the site. During excavation and construction of the University Street tunnel station, cracks and minor settling {{were found in the}} historic Seattle Tower, located nearby. The ground around the tower was later stabilized to prevent additional settlement, and was renovated with private funding in 1990.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{there was}} just one <b>Tunnel</b> <b>bore</b> but in 1900 the line was {{increased}} to four tracks and a second <b>tunnel</b> <b>bore</b> was built, one carrying the Fast lines from Leeds and the other the Slow lines.The Southern tunnel was closed in 1968 coinciding with the final closure of the Great Northern Branch Line from Shipley to Laisterdyke via Idle and Thackley.At the Western mouth of the Tunnel stood the original Idle station (albeit closer to Thackley than Idle), which opened in 1847 and closed the following year in 1848.|$|R
5|$|Metro {{awarded a}} $44.1 million {{contract}} {{to a joint}} venture of Atkinson and Dillingham companies to build the tunnel's 3rd Avenue segment as well as Pioneer Square station. Excavation of the station from street level began in March 1987, and the project's twin <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> machines reached James Street from Union Station in September. In June 1987, Atkinson-Dillingham and Metro were fined $80,000 after drilling at the station severed three electric power transmission lines, causing a day-long power outage in downtown Seattle, affecting the City Hall and Public Safety Building. Work in the tunnel station was also blamed for shaking in the City Hall and Public Safety Building, requiring monitoring equipment {{to be set up}} by Metro.|$|E
5|$|The Downtown Transit Project {{subcommittee}} unanimously approved Metro {{recommendations that}} would {{reduce the number of}} bus tunnel stations from six to five, saving $35 million, as well as opting for <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> machines for the 3rd Avenue segment to minimize surface-level disruptions that would be present from cut-and-cover excavation. Stations would be located at Union Station south of Jackson Street, under 3rd Avenue and James Street, under 3rd Avenue and University Street, at the Westlake Mall and at 9th Avenue and Pine Street near the Washington State Convention Center. The Metro Council approved the station sites and use of tunnel-boring machines in July 1985, proceeding with final design by approving a $25.9 million contract with Parsons Brinckerhoff for engineering work related to the project.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E

5|$|On March 20, 2007, upon {{completion}} of preliminary engineering, the MTA awarded a contract for constructing the tunnels between 92nd and 63rd Streets, a launch box for the <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> machine (TBM) at 92nd to 95th Streets, and access shafts at 69th and 72nd Streets. This contract, valued at $337 million, was awarded to S3, a joint venture of Schiavone Construction, Skanska USA Civil, and J.F. Shea Construction. A ceremonial groundbreaking took place on April 12, 2007, at the 99th Street tunnel segment built in the 1970s. At the time, {{it was announced that}} passengers would be able to ride trains on the new line by the end of 2013. Actual construction work began on April 23, 2007, with the relocation of utility pipes, wires, and other infrastructure, which took 14 months.|$|E
5|$|Beacon Hill Station {{opened to}} the public on July 18, 2009 during a weekend of free service celebrating the inaugural day of Central Link service. The line's opening was delayed from its {{projected}} July 3 date due in part to slowdowns in Beacon Hill construction. The year after the line opened, nine air pockets above the tunnel, caused by soil slides above the <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring</b> machine, were discovered and filled with cement to prevent sinkholes. Service to the southbound platforms at Beacon Hill and Mount Baker were suspended for a daylong emergency drill in November 2010, briefly restricting service to the northbound platform while maintaining a 10-minute headway. During a winter storm in January 2012, an overnight train running to keep the overhead catenary free of ice stalled inside the Beacon Hill Tunnel, allowing for ice build up that canceled Link service for several hours. In late 2013, Beacon Hill Station was closed for two hours after the discovery of smoke in the tunnel, station, and nearby Mount Baker Station, coming from a homeless encampment {{on the west side of}} Beacon Hill. The incident prompted Sound Transit to hold meetings with the Seattle Fire Department on preventing a total system shut-down in the event of an electrical fire.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to be}} dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from <b>tunnel</b> <b>boring,</b> which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E
