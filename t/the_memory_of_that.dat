500|$|All of the novel's storylines concern {{memory in}} some sense or another. The most {{apparent}} confrontation of memory is {{on the part of}} Urania Cabral, who has returned to the Dominican Republic {{for the first time in}} 30 years, and is forced to confront her father and the traumas that led her to leave the country at 14. She was the victim of sexual abuse at the hands of the dictator himself, a sacrifice her father made to try to gain favor with the dictator again, a fact to which she alludes throughout the book, but which is only revealed at the very end: the book concludes with her recounting <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> night to her aunt and cousins, who never knew the true reason she left the country. When her aunt is surprised that she remembers all these details, she responds that while she forgets many things, [...] "I remember everything about that night." [...] For Urania, forgetting the atrocities committed by the regime is unacceptable. Her father, on the other hand, is not capable of joining her in this process of remembering, since he has suffered a stroke and is not capable of speaking; however, Urania is angry that he chose to forget these things while he was still capable of acknowledging them.|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, the {{memories}} {{that contribute to}} an impression appear {{to be influenced by}} negativity and the source of behaviour. [...] Research on the subject indicates that {{people are more likely to}} remember negative behaviour when it is perceived as coming from a moral or dispositional source, and positive behaviour when seen as coming from either a person's ability or a need to suit the situation. [...] Positive behaviours result from a desire to appear socially acceptable, whereas negative behaviours are more revealing of the individual's personality. [...] Thus, negative behaviours lead to more questioning of the individual's actual personality, which in turn results in more methodical processing of that person's behaviour. This is believed to produce better memory for events by forming more associative links to <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> behaviour. [...] However, positive behaviour may also be subject to this improved memory if there is reason to doubt the behaviour. [...] If a critical assessment of an individual's actions results in a contrast to their positive image, the amount of interaction with that person will decrease.|$|E

50|$|Boogiepop Phantom is set {{one month}} later and {{revolves}} around {{the consequences of the}} pillar of light. Echoes' light inadvertently allowed <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> night to continue as holograms, giving rise to a mixed reality where past and present co-exist, and forced the evolution of the citizens, including those who were administered the Towa drug by Dr Kisugi. The series is concerned with these evolved individuals, how evolution affected their lives, and their disappearance after meeting Boogiepop Phantom. The Phantom explains it hid them below the city to save them, and that although their bodies no longer function, their nerves extend across the city so they will keep dreaming until the day the rest of humanity catches up to them.|$|R

5|$|There {{has been}} limited debate on {{the place of the}} Holocaust in Lithuanian {{national}} memory; historically Lithuanians have denied national participation in the Holocaust or labeled the Lithuanian participants in genocide as fringe extreme elements. <b>The</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> time and <b>the</b> discussion of those events in Jewish and Lithuanian historiographies are quite different, although Lithuanian historiography {{in the past two decades}} has improved, compared to the Soviet historiography, with the works of scholars such as Alfonsas Eidintas, Valentinas Brandišauskas and Arūnas Bubnys, among others, being positively reviewed by the Western and Jewish historians. The issue remains controversial to this day. According to Lithuanian historians, the contentious issues involve the role of the Lithuanian Activist Front, the Lithuanian Provisional Government and participation of Lithuanian civilians and volunteers in the Holocaust.|$|R

40|$|The {{intention}} of the contributions in this volume is to explore the parameters and paradigms of the contemporary museum—its spaces, practices and avowed purposes—in {{the light of the}} critical interrogations raised by postcolonial criticism and analyses. How are we to re-think museum studies, exhibitionary practices and archiving procedures within the radical revaluation of Occidental modernity? Such an investigation witnesses the latter’s historical and cultural premises being exposed to questions and possibilities it has rarely authorized. When the unsung bodies, cultures and histories of colonialism and Empire return to ghost the contemporary world—this, too, is “globalization”—then the manner of picturing and framing <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> past and present becomes a pressing and contested matter. Are we merely to adjust and enlarge an inherited frame of understanding to incorporate this critical encounter, or is something more required?

40|$|Within-subjects {{procedures}} with rats {{assessed the}} associative structures acquired during conditioning trials {{in which the}} interval between the stimuli and food was either short or long (i. e., A– 10 s→food and B– 40 s→food). In Experiments 1 and 2, after these conditioning trials, A and B served as second-order reinforcers for 2 further stimuli (i. e., X→A and Y→B); whereas Experiment 3 used a sensory preconditioning procedure in which X→A and Y→B trials occurred before the conditioning trials, and rats were finally tested with X and Y. In each experiment, Y elicited greater responding at test than did X. This finding supports the contention that the long-lived trace of B (associated with food on B– 40 s→food trials) is more similar to <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> B <b>that</b> was associatively provoked by Y, than is the short-lived trace of A (associated with food on A– 10 s→food trials) to <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> A <b>that</b> was associatively provoked by X.
