5|$|On 13 January 1964, a B-52D {{carrying}} two nuclear bombs suffered a structural failure in flight {{that caused the}} tail section <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> off. Four crewmen ejected successfully before the aircraft crashed near Cumberland, Maryland.

5|$|Moving {{along the}} {{southern}} edge of the ridge, Roy accelerated again as it headed towards the Philippines. On January 14, the storm crossed 135°E, prompting the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration to issue advisories on Roy, assigning it with the local name Asiang. As it neared the country, wind shear began to increase, resulting in further weakening. On January 16, Roy made landfall in the Bicol Region as a minimal typhoon before succumbing <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> and increased friction with the mountains of the Philippines. Later that day, the system weakened to a tropical storm before entering the South China Sea. The JTWC downgraded Roy to a tropical depression during the afternoon of January 17 and ceased issuing advisories early the next day. However, the JMA continued to monitor Roy as a tropical storm until the morning of January 18 and declared the system dissipated early on January 19, at which time the depression was situated roughly 700km (435mi) east-northeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|Like other ceratopsids, {{the jaws}} of Centrosaurus were adapted <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> through tough plant material.

25|$|Fatigue {{is defined}} as failure of a {{material}} due to repeated/cyclic loading or unloading (tensile or compressive stresses). It {{is also an important}} parameter for biomaterial because cyclic load is applied during their serving life. In this cyclic loading condition, micro crack/flaws may be generated at the interface of the matrix and the filler. This micro crack can initiate permanent plastic deformation which results in large crack propagation or failure. During the cyclic load several factor also contribute to microcrack generation such as frictional sliding of the mating surface, progressive wear, residual stresses at grain boundaries, stress due <b>to</b> <b>shear.</b>|$|E

25|$|A scar is {{the product}} of the body's repair {{mechanism}} after tissue injury. If a wound heals quickly within two weeks with new formation of skin, minimal collagen will be deposited and no scar will form. Generally, if a wound takes longer than three to four weeks to become covered, a scar will form. Small full thickness wounds under 2mm reepithilize fast and heal scar free. Deep second-degree burns heal with scarring and hair loss. Sweat glands do not form in scar tissue, which impairs the regulation of body temperature. Elastic fibers are generally not detected in scar tissue younger than 3 months old. In scars rete pegs are lost; through a lack of rete pegs scars tend <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> easier than normal tissue.|$|E

30|$|Figure  6 {{shows an}} optical {{photograph}} of the 30  % PF resin-impregnated wood specimen stuck onto the metal tool surface after the μ measurement at 160  °C. The result indicates that when the specimen was moved by stem, shearing fracture was generated inside the specimen where {{it was not yet}} hardened, because the resistance on the contact surface was sufficiently large to prevent slip between the metal tool and the wood specimen at 160  °C, at which temperature the specimen was cured. It is known that shearing stress at an interface cannot exceed shearing strength of a material [15]. When the shearing stress at the interface becomes equal <b>to</b> the <b>shearing</b> strength of the material, the slippage at the interface is stopped and shearing fracture is generated inside the material (sticking friction). In this case of sticking friction, the friction force is due not <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> at the interface, but <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> fracture [16]. It seems that the variation of μ at 160  °C for 30  % PF resin (Fig.  5) is attributed <b>to</b> repeated <b>shearing</b> fracture of the specimens and rubbing on the fractured surfaces.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of stretching, shearing and spin of material line {{elements in a}} continuous medium. It is shown how to determine all pairs of material line elements at a point x, at time t, which instantaneously are not subject <b>to</b> <b>shearing.</b> For a given pair not subject <b>to</b> <b>shearing,</b> a formula is presented for the determination of a third material line element such that all three form a triad not subject <b>to</b> <b>shearing,</b> instantaneously. It is seen {{that there is an}} infinity of such triads not subject <b>to</b> <b>shearing.</b> A new decomposition of the velocity gradient L is introduced. In place of the classical decomposition of Cauchy and Stokes, L = d + w, where d is the stretching tensor and w is the spin tensor, the new decomposition is L = P +M, where P, called the "modified" stretching tensor, is not symmetric, and M, called the "modified" spin tensor, is skew-symmetric - the tensor P being chosen so that it has three linearly independent real right (and left) eigenvectors. The physical interpretation of this decomposition is that the material line elements along the three linearly independent right eigenvectors of P instantaneously form a triad not subject <b>to</b> <b>shearing.</b> They spin as a rigid body with angular velocity n (say) associated with M. Also, for each decomposition L = P + M, there is a decomposition L = 3 T +M̃, where M is also skewsymmetric. The triad of material line elements along the right eigenvectors of PT (the set reciprocal to the right eigenvectors of P) is also instantaneously not subject <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> and rotates with angular velocity μ̃ (say) associated with M̃. It is seen that the vorticity vector w is the mean of the two angular velocities μ and μ̃, ω = (μ + μ̃) / 2. For irrotational motion, w = 0, so that n = -μ̃, any triad of material line elements suffering no shearing rotates with angular velocity equal and opposite to that of the reciprocal triad of material line elements. It is proved that provided d is not spherical, there is an infinity of choices for P and M in the decomposition L = P+M. Two special types of decompositions are introduced. The first type is called "CCS-decomposition" (where CCS is an abbreviation for Central Circular Section). It is associated with the infinite family of triads (not subject <b>to</b> <b>shearing)</b> with a common edge along the normal to one plane of central circular section of an ellipsoid D associated with the stretching tensor, and the two other edges arbitrary in the other plane of central circular section of D. There are two such CCS-decompositions. The second type is called "triangular decomposition", because, in a rectangular cartesian coordinate system, P has three off-diagonal zero elements. There are six such decompositions. © Springer-Verlag 2002. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
