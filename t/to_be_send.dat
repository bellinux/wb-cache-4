40|$|The {{enormous}} {{world wide}} web and its application of sending data have caused a tremendous increase in stolen or attach the false data with the original data while sending from one node to another node through the intermediate nodes for {{that we have to}} securely send the data from source to destination. Virtual energy based encryption and keying has introduced an effective {{solution to the problem of}} detection of false data over the network. In the virtual energy based encryption and keying technique we introduced an concept is one time dynamic key (i. e.). The data which is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>send</b> from source to destination is encrypted using the secret key and the encryption algorithm. The secret key is generated, one time dynamic key is employed for one packet only and different keys are used for the successive packets. Virtual energy based encryption and keying is a secure communication framework the data <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>send</b> is encrypted using the AES algorithm. The intermediate nodes are verified the incoming packets if the incoming packet is false packet injected in the network by the malicious outsiders those packets are detected and dropped otherwise the packet is forwarded to the next node. In the virtual energy based encryption and keying there are two modes of operations they are virtual energy based encryption and keying-I and virtual energy based encryption and keying- II. In the virtual energy based encryption and keying-I each node monitors their neighbor node and in the virtual energy based encryption and keying-II each nodes randomly choose the node...|$|E

The {{information}} which has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>send</b> in secured manner is embedded into the encrypted image using Least significant bit algorithm. The uncompressed image is encrypted using as key and data is embedded into a encrypted image using different key. To improve the security image protection is included. In the receiver side if the encryption key is alone known the image can be extracted which is similar to the original image. If the data hiding key is alone known only the data hidden can be extracted. Only both image and data hidden can be extracted if both the key is known.

40|$|Given {{a network}} with known link {{capacities}} and traffic demands, one can compute the paths {{to be used}} {{and the amount of}} traffic <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>send</b> through each path by solving a classical multi-flow problem. However, more quality of service constraints such as delay constraints, may be imposed and the routing problem becomes difficult to solve. We assume that the delay on each link depends on both its capacity and the total flow on it. We show that satisfying the delay constraints and the capacity constraints is an NP-complete problem. We give a convex relaxation of the delay constrained routing problem and present some ways to get upper and lower bounds on the problem. Key words: routing problems in telecommunications, convex programming, delay. 1...|$|E
