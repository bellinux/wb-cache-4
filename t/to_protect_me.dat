"Any change {{makes me}} apprehensive, {{even if it}} offers the {{greatest}} promise of improving my condition, and I am persuaded by this natural instinct of mine that I must take heed if I wish that the threads which the Fates spin so thin and weak in my case to be spun to any length. My great thanks, to my well-wishers and friends, who think so kindly of me as to undertake my welfare, {{but at the same}} time a most humble request <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>me</b> in my current condition from any disturbance." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 19, 1992, a Mafia bomb killed Borsellino, {{less than}} two months after his {{colleague}} Giovanni Falcone had been killed. Italy was in shock. Rita wrote in her diary: [...] "You have died for what you believed in, but without you, I too am dead." [...] A week later Rita locked herself into the apartment and wrote a note, which said: [...] "I am devastated by the killing of Judge Borsellino. Now there's no one <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>me,</b> I'm scared and I can't take it any more." [...] Then she threw herself out of the window.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{description}} above is accurate then the prayer would {{date from the}} 5th century – the time of Saint Patrick. However, it has been dated as from the 8th century by modern experts. Although Christian in content, it shows pre-Christian influence in that it calls for Christ's protection using {{the form of a}} pagan invocation of the gods or lorica (shield or breastplate). Because of this it is also known as the [...] "Lorica of St. Patrick" [...] or as [...] "St. Patrick's Breastplate". On the other hand, this may be a Scripture reference, specifically: [...] ("God's shield <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>me</b> ... from snares of devils"). This prayer outlines Patrick's spirituality and his keen awareness and perception of the battle between good and evil and thus the importance of praying for protection on a daily basis.|$|E

6000|$|... "The laws of my country, which ought <b>to</b> have <b>protected</b> <b>me</b> as {{an honest}} woman, left me helpless. In {{place of the}} laws I had no friend near to open my heart to.

5000|$|O'Reilly {{was known}} for being a tough player, racking up over 200 penalty minutes in five {{consecutive}} seasons, and earning for himself the nickname [...] "Bloody O'Reilly" [...] in the press. His teammate, Phil Esposito, dubbed O'Reilly [...] "Taz" [...] {{in reference to the}} Tasmanian Devil cartoon character for O'Reilly's reckless, hard driving style of play.

"You were wrong, Captain," [...] she said, sweetly; [...] "fortunately, Mr. Guest--whom I see {{you have}} {{forgotten}} in your absence--was with me, and I think {{would have felt}} it his duty <b>to</b> have <b>protected</b> <b>me.</b> But I thank you all the same, and I think even Mr. Guest will not allow his envy of your good fortune in coming so gallantly to my rescue to prevent his appreciating its full value.

25|$|Allied pilots {{soon found}} that the only {{reliable}} way to destroy the jets, as with the even faster Me 163 Komet rocket fighters, was to attack {{them on the ground}} or during takeoff or landing. Luftwaffe airfields identified as jet bases were frequently bombed by medium bombers, and Allied fighters patrolled over the fields to attack jets trying to land. The Luftwaffe countered by installing extensive flak alleys of anti-aircraft guns along the approach lines <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the <b>Me</b> 262s from the ground—and by providing top cover during the jets' takeoff and landing with the most advanced Luftwaffe single-engined fighters, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190D and (just becoming available in 1945) Focke-Wulf Ta 152H. Nevertheless, in March–April 1945, Allied fighter patrol patterns over Me 262 airfields resulted in numerous jet losses.|$|R

60|$|Then Dr. Ivor knew I had come. He knew I {{was going}} to Palmyra to find him.

Did he think I'd come out, not to track him down, but to look for him? Strange, horrible questions! My heart stood still within me at this {{extraordinary}} revelation.

When I ask that question the spirit that hovers round my desk <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> Tommy from <b>me</b> rocks her arms mournfully, as if she did not know the answer; it is only when I seem to see her as she so often was in life, before she got that wound and after, bending over some little child and looking up radiant, that I think I suddenly know why she always loved Tommy. It was because he had such need of her.|$|R
