5|$|On August 24 Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller {{announced}} that her government would provide JA$225million (US$3.2million) in emergency {{assistance to the}} country's agriculture sector. This aid was targeted at the country's hardest-hit parishes. She also announced a JA$500million (US$7.1million) programme to provide grants and low-interest loans for emergency housing repairs. Temporary <b>tarpaulins</b> were also provided to patch roofs at no cost.|$|E
5|$|After 9 days, {{approximately}} 3,000 buildings (out of a {{total of}} 127,947 initially damaged) were still waiting for assistance and temporary fixes to shattered roofs and windows, while a similar number still required assistance a further week later (as a number of <b>tarpaulins</b> became detached or otherwise ineffective). One month after the disaster, the main priority of the emergency services was ensuring that temporary fixes remained in place, as Sydney suffered further adverse weather in the period immediately following the storm.|$|E
5|$|Cleanup efforts {{after the}} storm were hastened as Hurricane Gonzalo {{approached}} from the south, amid concerns that strewn debris from Fay could become airborne and exacerbate future destruction. The unanticipated heavy damage from Fay prompted residents to prepare more thoroughly for Gonzalo, as evidenced by stores reporting an influx of customers purchasing emergency supplies. Two hundred Bermuda Regiment soldiers helped clear debris and began repairing structural damage. On October 13, crews of soldiers put <b>tarpaulins</b> on 30 homes with roof damage, as well as distributing another 150 tarps to homeowners.|$|E
50|$|Some hammocks are {{designed}} with a dedicated <b>tarpaulin.</b> Others come without a <b>tarpaulin</b> with the understanding the user will want to select the size and style of <b>tarpaulin</b> which best fits their needs. There are many {{different ways in which}} hammock campers generally hang their <b>tarpaulin.</b> In some, the <b>tarpaulin</b> is connected to the hammock's suspension line using a system of mitten hooks and plastic connectors. In others the <b>tarpaulin</b> is hung separately using either the hammocks integrated ridge line, or a separate ridge line placed under or even over the <b>tarpaulin.</b>|$|R

5|$|Kinkaid next became Executive Officer of , {{one of the}} navy's newest battleships, in February 1933. By {{coincidence}} {{the ship}} was at anchor in Long Beach, California when the 1933 Long Beach earthquake struck. Over {{the next few days}} thousands of sailors and marines participated in relief activities. Kinkaid convinced the captain to allow homeless families of crew members to stay on the ship, and erected <b>tarpaulins</b> on the quayside to create family areas. He sent medical and relief supplies ashore from Colorado.|$|E
5|$|On August 24 Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller {{announced}} that her government would provide JA$225million in emergency {{assistance to the}} country's agriculture sector, especially the parishes of Portland, Clarendon, St. Thomas, Manchester, St. Catherine and St. Elizabeth. JA$100million was immediately allocated to the purchase of fertilizers, JA$25million to the Blue Mountain coffee farmers, and the Agriculture Ministry's JA$50million fruit tree programme was accelerated. She also {{announced that}} the National Housing Trust had established a JA$500million programme to provide loans at 6% per annum for emergency repairs. The National Housing Trust also made JA$200million available to the Hurricane Relief Fund. The government provided <b>tarpaulins,</b> 10,000 of which were shipped in after the storm, free of charge to patch houses with damaged roofs.|$|E
5|$|By October26, the Government of the Union of Myanmar {{had begun}} distributing 60,000 zinc roof sheets and the Ministry of Forestry {{provided}} 200tonnes (220tons) of timber. Through {{the end of}} October, six non-governmental organizations in Myanmar planned to distribute emergency food supplies, such rice, oil, salt and pulses, to 5,000 residents in Kyaukpyu and Myebon. Health supplies were also being distributed at relief camps by UNICEF in the hardest-hit areas. About 500 family kits containing non-food items, such as <b>tarpaulins</b> and mosquito nets, had been distributed by the Myanmar Red Cross Society and another 1,200 were {{being sent to the}} area. By the start of November, the government of Myanmar requested medial aid from the United Nations as a cholera outbreak began to unfold. Additional post-storm diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, eye infections and skin diseases became prevalent as well. According to locals, at least six people {{died as a result of}} cholera. At least 200 people were infected with dysentery and four were killed by the disease in the towns of Kyaukphyu, Minbya and Myebon. The cause of the outbreak was linked to a lack of clean water.|$|E
60|$|Then {{everybody}} realised that a {{new method}} was to be tried. A number of willing hands seized upon the Oxford gentleman's <b>tarpaulin.</b> The others stood away with approving noises. The <b>tarpaulin</b> was held over the burning bicycle like a canopy, and then smothered down upon it.|$|R
60|$|Next Wade {{unrolled}} his bed {{under the}} spruce, with {{one end of}} the <b>tarpaulin</b> resting on the soft mat of needles. On top of that came the two woolly sheepskins, which he used to lie upon, then his blankets, and over all {{the other end of the}} <b>tarpaulin.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some tarps have an {{asymmetrical}} pattern which {{matches the}} shape of the hammock, but the majority of hammock campers use a hex-shaped <b>tarpaulin,</b> many of which have a catenary shape for strength against wind and reduction in size and weight. The diamond shape <b>tarpaulin</b> is also used by several hammock campers.|$|R
5|$|By {{about two}} days after the passage of Hurricane Wilma, 800residents on Grand Bahama {{remained}} in shelters, including 65 families who lost their homes and stayed in a hotel set up as a government shelter in Freeport. On Bimini, most residents who evacuated to shelters returned to their homes within two days of the hurricane. The Bahamian Red Cross quickly assessed the damage on Grand Bahama and Bimini, and successfully requested to be included under the federation's hurricane appeal for Central America. Local Red Cross chapters mobilized all available resources to assist the residents most affected. The Bahamian Red Cross began a three-month program to distribute food and other items to 1,000 of the 3,500affected families, primarily on Grand Bahama; the remaining 2,500families received assistance from the government and other organizations. Volunteers delivered building materials and provided water vouchers to those affected. In Nassau, the Red Cross disaster contingency stock sent a boat with food items, blankets, health kits, <b>tarpaulins</b> and water. About a week after the hurricane, the United States Agency for International Development began providing $50,000 (2005USD) to the Bahamian National Emergency Management Agency for the purchase and distribution of emergency supplies. The agency also provided $9,000 (2005USD) for locally contracted helicopter assessments in the affected areas. Red Cross agencies throughout the Caribbean Sea provided hygienic kits, plastic sheeting, blankets, and jerry cans.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, many colleges and school districts across Florida remained closed. President George W. Bush declared all of Florida a federal disaster area. Kennedy Space Center did not restore its complete work force until September 13 due to relief operations, as well as a lack of gasoline, ice, and water in the area. A total of 8000 members of the National Guard helped out with recovery efforts soon after the storm left the Florida peninsula. Residents in the areas of impact after the storm were under a boil water order, {{because of the lack of}} electricity to area water systems. Churches prepared meals for those without power and food themselves. Federal employees were granted excused absences if they helped with law enforcement and the cleanup. Thousands of portable generators were sent to the state by Home Depot and Lowe's home improvement stores. The United States Army Corps of Engineers installed blue <b>tarpaulins</b> on 41,556 damaged roofs statewide. Damage to the Florida citrus crop caused orange futures to rise four cents a pound due to Frances.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} cargo {{offloaded}} at Karachi, 8,700 bales of raw cotton were loaded, along with various quantities of fish manure, resin, rice, scrap iron, sulphur, and timber. Added to this were 1,000 barrels of lubricating oil. The ship's captain {{was concerned about}} having to take the flammable items but was told {{that they had to}} go. A proposal to add 750 drums of turpentine was refused. The ship's officers also expressed concerns over mixing the cargoes of cotton and the oil and explosives, but were unable to find paperwork that advised against this practice. In 1942, the United States Government had published a book which advised against the carriage of raw cotton. A common myth at the time was that wet cotton bales could spontaneously combust. This was not the case, although cotton soaked in oil would readily do so. Before the ship sailed, the crew discovered that the barrels of lubricating oil leaked. <b>Tarpaulins</b> were nailed over the lower hold covers and the firefighting equipment on board was thoroughly tested. Extra fire drills were scheduled during the voyage to Karachi. Fort Stikine sailed on 9 April to join Convoy PB74, which had departed from Bandar Abbas, Iran on 6 April. The unescorted convoy arrived at Bombay on 12 April.|$|E

5|$|With {{effect from}} June 12, {{a state of}} public {{emergency}} was declared {{for the whole of}} Tuvalu, by the then Governor-General of Tuvalu, Sir Tulaga Manuella. This was because there was only a limited amount of food available on Funafuti to cater for the whole of the island nation, while providing Niulakita with immediate relief supplies. This enabled the Tuvaluan embassy in Suva, Fiji to appeal to various overseas countries and organisations including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United Nations Development Programme to provide aid and assistance to the island nation. During June 14, the Royal New Zealand Air Force deployed a transport plane carrying some relief materials including <b>tarpaulins</b> and water from New Zealand. The plane subsequently stopped in Noumea, New Caledonia and Nadi, Fiji to pick up further relief supplies that had been donated by Australia, Fiji and France. The crew of the plane subsequently conducted an aerial assessment of the damage on Niulakita, and reported seeing widespread damage, before they arrived at Funafuti Airport during June 15.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a day of}} Cyclone Waka's {{passage in}} Tonga, the Government of New Zealand {{deployed}} an aircraft to survey the scale of damage and reestablish contact with the Tongan Islands. This aircraft was sent {{in accordance with the}} FRANZ Agreement, enacted in 1992, which states that assests from one country would be used in relief operations. On January2, the head of Tonga's Disaster Office announced that they would likely need international assistance to recover from the storm. Due to the substantial damage to agriculture, food shortages were expected to impact the region over the following months. By January7, the Red Cross began sending supplies to Tonga. Hundreds of tents and <b>tarpaulins</b> were brought in by an Australian AC-130 to help with the recovery process. On January12, a New Zealand Lockheed C-130 Hercules carrying US$700,000 worth of supplies flew to the area to deliver aid. An additional US$700,000 was given in relief funds to repair damage wrought by the storm. Of this, US$500,000 would be used to repair schools that were damaged or destroyed and the remaining US$200,000 would be used for emergency lighting, cooking and food supply recovery.|$|E
5|$|On November16, the {{government}} of Haiti issued {{an appeal to the}} international community for assistance. In response, agencies through the United Nations donated $735,000, including 20,000 water units and 3,000blankets. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs flew 30tons of supplies, financed by Italy and Luxembourg. The European Union donated about $3.8million to the country, and various countries sent about $1.8million in cash or the equivalent thereof in relief items. The Canadian government donated $485,000, and {{the government}} of Japan sent $400,000 in aid. The government of France provided blankets, clothing, and <b>tarpaulins,</b> and the United States sent 5,000blankets. In the days after the storm, the Haitian Army and international workers made emergency repairs to the road between Jacmel and Port-au-Prince, which was permanently reopened on November25. The Haitian government provided $3.2million to repair damage and assist those affected by the storm. The government sent about $112,000 to cities to provide for clearing roads, housing repairs, and for the funerals of storm victims. Workers from the United Nations set up relief work in Port-au-Prince. Assistance quickly reached the ravaged town of Jacmel, including 116tons of food, 9tons of medicine, and clothing. Six soldiers from the United States Special Forces rescued 35Haitians using an inflatable boat. About 100soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division assisted in relief operations in Jacmel, rescuing hundreds of people. About 12,000United States troops were already in the country when Gordon struck to restore democracy under ousted president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.|$|E

It was exactly like the opening of a mouth. It laughed with a gust of flames. They were reflected redly in the observant goggles of the gentleman who owned the <b>tarpaulin.</b> Everybody recoiled.|$|R

25|$|PVC {{has been}} used for a host of {{consumer}} products. One of its earliest mass-market consumer applications was vinyl record production.

25|$|The autobahns of East Germany (GDR) were {{neglected}} {{in comparison to}} those in West Germany after 1945. East German autobahns were used primarily for GDR military traffic and for state-owned farming or manufacturing vehicles. The speed limit on the GDR autobahns was 100km/h; however, lower speed limits were frequently encountered due to poor or quickly changing road conditions. The speed limits on the GDR autobahns were rigorously enforced by the Volkspolizei, whose patrol cars were frequently found hiding under camouflage <b>tarpaulins</b> waiting for speeders.|$|E
25|$|The {{first six}} boats were {{delivered}} in early 1939, immediately after which test trials were conducted off La Spezia. The MT explosive motorboat revealed some weaknesses. The deck {{was made of}} <b>tarpaulins,</b> which exposed the hull to leakage from splashing at high speed. The naval command demanded {{the addition of a}} solid wooden deck and a larger freeboard of 0.9m (later enlarged to 1.1m) and sent the boats and machine parts back to the manufacturer so that they could implement the requirements. In March 1939, the Navy Department ordered a further 12 explosive boats, increasing the total number to 18.|$|E
25|$|On July7, Bermuda {{residents}} began purchasing lamps, <b>tarpaulins</b> and flashlights {{in anticipation}} of Hurricane Bertha. In the sudden rush, some stores sold out of batteries. The Emergency Measures Organisation urged the public to monitor forecasts and remain away from beaches. The Bermuda Weather Service, meanwhile, hoisted tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the island upon its approach. On July10, the Department of Parks placed high surf warning signs along the South Shore beaches as Bertha sent strong waves ahead of its path. Barricades were erected {{at all of the}} island's beaches, which were closed to swimming and watersports.|$|E
