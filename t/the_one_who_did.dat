2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> {{the most}} to help Peirce in these desperate times was his old friend William James, {{dedicating}} his Will to Believe (1897) to Peirce, and arranging for Peirce {{to be paid to}} give two series of lectures at or near Harvard (1898 and 1903). Most important, each year from 1907 until James's death in 1910, James wrote to his friends in the Boston intelligentsia to request financial aid for Peirce; the fund continued even after James died. Peirce reciprocated by designating James's eldest son as his heir should Juliette predecease him. It has been believed that this was also why Peirce used [...] "Santiago" [...] ("St. James" [...] in English) as a middle name, but he appeared in print as early as 1890 as Charles Santiago Peirce. (See Charles Santiago Sanders Peirce for discussion and references).|$|E
2500|$|The {{naming of}} the plant itself {{has long been a}} subject of some confusion. Many sources state that the name [...] "Dahlia" [...] was {{bestowed}} by the pioneering Swedish botanist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus to honor his late student, Anders Dahl, author of Observationes Botanicae. However, Linnaeus died in 1778, more than eleven years before the plant was introduced into Europe in 1789, so while it is generally agreed that the plant was named in 1791 in honor of Dahl, who had died two years before, Linnaeus could not have been <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> so. It was probably Abbe Antonio Jose Cavanilles, Director of the Royal Gardens of Madrid, who should be credited with the attempt to scientifically define the genus, since he not only received the first specimens from Mexico in 1789, but named the first three species that flowered from the cuttings.|$|E
2500|$|Churchill {{was widely}} {{blamed for the}} fiasco. He was {{probably}} right in saying that had the naval attacks been pressed the Turks, short of ammunition and low in morale {{would have had to}} abandon the forts and the Fleet could have occupied the Sea of Marmora and with it Constantinople. But it is even more likely that had the Fleet been properly equipped with spotter planes and destroyer minesweepers, the attack on 18 March would have been successful. It is almost certain that a Fleet so equipped and supported by the four divisions made available in April would have cleared the Strait with almost no loss. As the minister responsible, Churchill was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not provide the resources needed. Clement Attlee, who served in the army at Gallipoli, described the campaign as [...] "an immortal gamble that did not come off... Sir Winston had the one strategic idea in the war. He did not believe in throwing away masses of people to be massacred".|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Shila of Nawha (a place east of Gadara in the Galilee) {{interpreted}} the word [...] "needy" [...] ( [...] , evyon) in [...] to teach {{that one should}} give to the poor person from one's wealth, for that wealth is the poor person's, given to you in trust. Rabbi Abin observed that when a poor person stands at one's door, God stands at the person's right, as [...] says: [...] "Because He stands at the right hand of the needy." [...] If one gives something to a poor person, one should reflect that the One who stands at the poor person's right will reward the giver. And if one does not give anything to a poor person, one should reflect that the One who stands at the poor person's right will punish <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not give, as [...] says: [...] "He stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that judge his soul." ...|$|E

Some said that Hasan did not commit the crime, {{but that it was}} committed by other US military personnel who then killed him and said that he was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> it. They are like those who said that the September 11 attacks were not committed by those who committed them, and that it too was a “conspiracy.” I am one of those whose ancestors came here hundreds of years ago. I am a black American, and I know that “denial” is the explanation of those who cannot explain what they see or hear, especially if they belong to a minority group and are not used to the US way of life. But we black Americans have passed these stages. We became involved in political action, and the President of the United States is now one of us. Perhaps I am saying what I am saying because I was a Christian, and became Muslim. But I believe that this issue is a temporary one, and we ask God to raise us from one stage to another." ...|$|E
2500|$|This calmed {{things down}} for a short while, until Wu-Tang member Inspectah Deck {{released}} a Joe Budden diss track entitled [...] "House Nigga", which {{was a response to}} Budden's remarks. A few days after releasing this track, on July 9, 2009, Deck went on stage at the Columbia, MD show of Rock the Bells, during Raekwon's set, and told the audience the reason for the diss track was because [...] "the nigga tried to diss my brother, he tried to shit on my nigga like my nigga ain't a made man ... fuck Joe Budden" [...] (referring to what Budden said about Method Man). Joe Budden did not retaliate with a diss track, but however, posted a five-minute video blog in which he said that he wanted to slap Deck and called Deck a coward. At the San Bernardino stop of Rock the Bells, Raekwon approached Budden with his Ice Water Inc. entourage, resulting in Budden getting punched in the right eye. Shortly after this occurred, Joe Budden posted yet another online video blog of him with an ice pack over his eye, with many speculating Raekwon as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> the assault.|$|E
