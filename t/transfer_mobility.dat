40|$|Abstract — Ground borne {{vibration}} {{in buildings}} due to railway traffic {{is a major}} concern in densely built up areas. In practice, railway induced vibration is often predicted by means of empirical methods such as the Detailed Vibration Assessment developed by the U. S. Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). The vibration velocity level in the free field is predicted based on a separate characterization of the source and the wave propagation. They are characterized by a force density and a line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility,</b> respectively. The line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> represents the energy transmitted through the soil due to a line source, such as a train on a track. The force density represents the power per unit length introduced into the soil by the source. While the force density is determined indirectly by subtracting the line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> from the vibration velocity due to a train passage, the line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> is determined directly based on wave propagation tests. In this paper, the determination of the line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> is investigated experimentally and numerically. The line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> depends on the dynamic track and soil characteristics, but is also influenced by the experimental setup used during the measurement. The location of the impact points, on the track or the soil, as well as the number of impact points and their spacing have an influence on the determination of the line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility.</b> First, the line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> is investigated experimentally. Results are obtained from a measurement campaign where transfer functions from the track to the free field have been measured for several impact points. Second, a numerical prediction model is used to simulate the transfer functions from the track to the free field and predict the line <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> numerically...|$|E

To trial four-week's {{physiotherapy}} targeting chair transfers {{for people}} with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) and explore the feasibility of reliance on remote outcome measurement to preserve blinding. Scope. We recruited 47 PwPD and randomised 24 to a focused home physiotherapy programme (exercise, movement strategies, and cueing) and 23 to a control group. We evaluated <b>transfers</b> (plus <b>mobility,</b> balance, posture, and quality of life) before and after treatment and at followup (weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12) from video produced by, and questionnaires distributed by, treating physiotherapists. Participants fed back via end-of-study questionnaires. Thirty-five participants (74 %) completed the trial. Excluding dropouts, 20 % of questionnaire data and 9 % of video data were missing or unusable; we had to evaluate balance in situ. We noted trends to improvement in <b>transfers,</b> <b>mobility,</b> and balance in the physiotherapy group not noted in the control group. Participant feedback was largely positive and assessor blinding was maintained in every case. Conclusions. Intense, focused physiotherapy at home appears acceptable and likely to bring positive change in those who can participate.

In practice, vibrations are often predicted using empirical methods such as the detailed vibration assessment procedure of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) of the U. S.

Ground vibrations are calculated based on force densities, measured when a vehicle is running over a track, and line source transfer mobilities, measured on site {{to account for the}} effect of the local geology on wave propagation. Compared to parametric models, the advantage of this approach is that it inherently takes into account all important parameters. It can only be used, however, when an appropriate estimation of the force density is available. In this paper, analytical expressions are derived for the force density and the line source <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> of the FRA procedure.

40|$|The {{reciprocity}} principle is well-known and has many applications in acoustics and vibro-acoustics. This paper discusses a reciprocity measurement method {{to determine the}} radiation efficiency of a vibrating structure. The method comprises two steps: (i) measurements of the acceleration response of the structure induced by a sound field in a reverberation chamber and (ii) measurements of the spatially-averaged squared <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> of the structure. The approach is more flexible than a direct method and has the advantage that no shaker is required to excite the structure in the acoustic measurements. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, experiments were conducted on rectangular flat plates, on two components of a railway track test-rig and on three different built-up structures. For the plates and the railway rig components, comparisons are also made with theoretical models. It is shown that the measured results for each arrangement obtained using this reciprocity method provide good agreement with conventional direct measurements and with theoretical modelling. However, {{in most of the}} examples presented, the direct method {{has been found to be}} less practical and sometimes even less accurate than the reciprocal one, mostly due to the structure-shaker connection and to the inherent uncertainty of acoustic intensity measurement...|$|E

A finite element programme for acoustics has been developed incorporating a variety of elements including porous material elements described by the Blot-theory and plate elements described by thick plate theory (Reissner-Mindlin). This paper makes up a part of an experimental verification of models incorporating these plate and porous material elements, models which may be used for the prediction of airborne and impact sound transmission in multilayer systems, of which sandwich constructions are an important type. Forced response measurements have been performed on sandwich beams, a 50 mm thick polyurethane foam core sandwiched between two aluminium plates, 2 - 3 mm thick. The measured input and <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> data as well as plate vibrational shape have been compared with both 2 - and 3 -dimensional models of the beam. Due to the complexity of the model description, in particular the porous material, a rather simple SD-model was used.

40|$|Background: Disability is {{not just}} a health problem or {{attribute}} of individuals, but it reflects the problems individuals experience in their interaction with society and physical movements. Disabled persons remain neglected part of society and they also experience various barriers due to restriction of participation. Objectives: The aim was to assess the quality of life (QOL) of physically disabled persons, the impact of physical disability on activities of daily living (ADL) and to study the awareness about laws and facilities available for disabled persons. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional community based study was conducted among 130 physical disabled persons who were selected using convenience sampling technique. The WHO BREF scale was used to assess QOL, while assessment of ADL was done using Barthel Index. Socio-demographic assessment was done using Udai Pareek scale. SPSS version 15. 0 was used to analyze data. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. As per guidelines physical, psychological, social, and environmental domain scores for WHO BREF scale were calculated. Results: Among the study participants, 36. 2 % had a disability from birth that is, congenital. The second common cause of disability was found to be postpolio residual paralysis as it was found among 26. 2 % respondents. Other causes found were stroke/paralysis and accidents, in 19. 2 % and 18. 5 % respondents, respectively.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{tyre-road noise}} prediction, a computationally efficient high frequency tyre model is needed. Such models {{are always a}} compromise between the desired accuracy {{and the need for}} simplicity. In addition the accuracy of models is often limited by the quality of the input data available. For passenger car or truck tyres, a complete set of input data can be obtained only from the tyre manufacturer. However, this may not always be possible and one has to rely instead on approximate material data obtained from the careful study of experiments conducted on tyres. Although much research is available for passenger car tyres, less attention is paid to truck tyres. The work described in this thesis has the goal to close this gap by an experimental investigation of the vibrational behaviour of a truck tyre exposed to external forces. Driving point mobility and <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> measurements are made to understand the behaviour of truck tyres, to gain insight into what may be the most suitable way to model truck tyres, and to extract material data for this modelling. A methodology was developed, which allows for the calculation of key tyre parameters, such as total bending stiffness and Youngs modulus from driving point mobility. These parameters are used in a 3 -D orthotropic double-plate model based on elastic field equations as developed for passenger tyres. A WFEM model is also used to understand the limitations of modelling a tyre as a structure with homogenous geometry (i. e. thickness and material properties identical over the whole cross section). Results from the 3 -D orthotropic double plate model are compared with measured tyre response functions. One can conclude from these results that the data obtained from measurements, as well as the model, can successfully be used later for simulation of contact forces in the tyre-road noise prediction models. </p...|$|E

Until now, picene is the only isomer of pentacene to be investigated for organic electronic applications, due to its greater stability (Eg = 4. 21 eV) and high-charge <b>transfer</b> <b>mobility</b> (3. 0 cm 2 V– 1 s– 1); even benefiting from oxygen doping. In the present study, a total of 12 fused-ring isomers (including pentacene, picene and ten other structures) of the formula C 22 H 14 were analyzed and investigated for their electronic and optical properties for worth in OTFT applications. We screened several pure and hybrid DFT functionals against the experimental frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of pentacene, then deployed Marcus Theory, Koopmans’ Theorem and Green’s function with the P 3 electron propagator variant, for the internal hole reorganization energy, the hole transfer integral (via the “splitting-in-dimer method” at d = 3. 0, 3. 5, and 4. 0 Å), the charge transfer rate constant, and vertical ionization energies. Using these as a basis, we studied pentacene’s isomers and found that the four nonplanar structures, namely, benzo[g]chrysene (3), naphtho[c]phenanthrene (7), benzo[c]chrysene (11) and dibenzo[c,c′]phenthrene (12), are (I) more stable than pentacene, by up to 2 eV, and (II) have relatively similar ionization energies (7. 5 – 7. 6 eV) to those of picene’s experimental value (7. 51 eV). The largest charge transfer rates at 3. 5 Å dimer separations were given by the isomers benzo[b]chrysene 4, naphtha[c]phenanthrene 7, dibenzo[a,c]anthracene 8 and benzo[a]tetracene 10 and found to be 2. 92, 1. 72, 1. 30, and 3. 09 × 1014 s– 1 respectively.

A model based on the infinite structure method and the energy flow analysis method was developed and used to predict the structural vibration response and the radiated sound power of the plate excited by turbulent boundary layer flows and separated-reattached flows. The predictions were compared to the measured data. ^ The model was then improved and applied to predict the responses of structures to more complex turbulent flows. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods were utilized to identify the flow Patterns and predict the mean flow properties of the flow field over the structures. Spectral features of wall pressure fluctuations were obtained from a pre-developed empirical database. The non-uniform loading on the structures was accounted for using the power density input method. The energy flow analysis method was used to predict panel vibration and acoustic radiation. The predictions using the model were verified experimentally for the case of a homogeneous panel downstream of two different three-dimensional wedges which were used as vortex generators. The measured panel vibration response, and the radiated acoustic pressure levels were found to agree reasonably well with the predicted results at frequencies where the modal density of the panel was sufficiently high. The results of this study suggest that the proposed approach, which combines computational fluid dynamic techniques, the infinite structure method, and the energy flow analysis method, will be a useful tool in predicting the behavior of complex flow-excited structures. ...|$|E

Bed <b>mobility,</b> <b>transfers,</b> wheelchair <b>mobility</b> skills, and performing other activities of daily living (ADLs) {{are just a few of}} the interventions that occupational therapists can help the patient with. A major problem for spinal cord injury patients is restricted range of motion. Massage therapy has been used to aid in range of motion rehabilitation. Literature has shown that participants with spinal cord injuries that had massage therapy added into their rehabilitation had significant improvement observed by physical therapist in functional living activities and limb range of motion. This could be due to the decrease in H-Reflex amplitudes measured by EMG that is critical for the comfort of spinal cord injury patients for reducing cramps and spasms.|$|R
