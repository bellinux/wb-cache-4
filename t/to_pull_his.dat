5|$|In December 2006, Aulie's {{father was}} using a tractor to clear snow off a frozen dugout in {{anticipation}} of an outdoor shinny game on New Year's Day. The ice could not support {{the weight of the}} tractor, and he fell through. Aulie was able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> father {{out of the water and}} get him to safety. The Canadian Red Cross honoured Aulie with their Rescuer Award for his act.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{worsening}} military situation {{on the evening of}} March 22, General Ngô Quang Trưởng authorised General Lâm Quang Thi <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> forces back to Da Nang. However, as the main roads were blocked by the North Vietnamese, General Thi's only option was to use a coastal corridor between Thuan An and Tu Hien, and board transport vessels belonging to the 106th Navy Squadron and head back to Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|As dusk {{approached}} and their ammunition ran dangerously low, Bouck feared {{they could be}} flanked at any time. He planned <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> men back just before dusk, when they would have enough light to escape through the woods. Bouck ordered his men to remove the distributor caps from their Jeeps and to prepare to evacuate to the rear. He dispatched Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston through the woods to locate Major Kriz at Regimental HQ and seek instructions or reinforcements.|$|E

50|$|This was {{the first}} Tour in which Manson began using stilts. The band also began their {{signature}} bizarre looks during this tour as well, by donning makeup and sexually suggestive clothes (with Manson wearing jock straps <b>to</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> pants down and with Twiggy beginning his traditional kinderwhore cross dressing gimmick).|$|R

5|$|By 1 March, the {{withdrawal}} was complete. His forces were mostly intact, but the fighting had been fierce: his Shield and Sword counter-attacks alone had cost him some 10,000–12,000 men. These counter-attacks usually failed to recover ground, {{but they kept}} the Red Army off-balance and won Model time <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> units back. They also allowed him to say to Hitler that he was pursuing an aggressive approach, even as the front moved steadily to the west.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Men on a Mission {{challenged}} The Quebecers for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Although The Quebecers attacked Men on a Mission before the bell, Mabel quickly recovered and clotheslined both Quebecers. The Quebecers used several double-team moves against their opponents, but Mabel reversed the momentum after Pierre missed a senton bomb. Mabel eventually missed an Avalanche, allowing The Quebecers to suplex him. The Quebecers performed an assisted senton on Mabel {{but did not}} get a pinfall. Men on a Mission regained the advantage, prompting The Quebecers' manager, Johnny Polo, <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> wrestlers out of the ring. Men on a Mission won the match by countout, but they did not win the belts.|$|E
5|$|Melissa calls Scully {{and tells}} her she is coming over. After {{receiving}} {{a call from}} someone who immediately hangs up, Scully leaves her apartment and tells Melissa that she'll head to her home instead. As she leaves, Skinner pulls up in his car, telling her they need to speak in private. Melissa shows up soon afterwards and is mistakenly shot by Luis Cardinal, who is hiding there with Alex Krycek. Realizing they shot the wrong person, the two flee. Meanwhile, after taking Skinner to Mulder's apartment, Scully holds him at gunpoint, believing he is the traitor the Well-Manicured Man spoke of. Skinner tells Scully {{that he is in}} possession of the digital tape. Just then, someone steps outside the door. This distracts Scully enough for Skinner <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> gun on her.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the first}} tour in which Manson began using stilts. The band also began their {{signature}} bizarre looks during these concerts as well, by shaving their eyebrows, and donning makeup and sexually suggestive clothes (with Manson wearing jock straps <b>to</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> pants down and tucking his penis between his legs, and with Ramirez beginning his traditional kinderwhore cross-dressing gimmick).|$|R

5|$|Wolfe, on {{surveying}} {{the town of}} Beauport, found that the houses there had been barricaded and organized to allow for musket fire from within; they were built in an unbroken line along the road, providing a formidable barrier. In addition, a screen of trees along the Montmorency River made an approach on that route dangerous. On 31 July, the first serious attempt by Wolfe's troops {{to land on the}} northern shore led to the Battle of Beauport, also known as the Battle of Montmorency. Approximately 3,500 troops, supported by a heavy bombardment, attempted to land, but were caught under fire in the river shallows. Members of the Louisbourg Grenadiers, who reached the beach, attempted a generally undisciplined charge on the French positions, but came under heavy fire; a thunderstorm ended the fight and allowed Wolfe <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> troops back after taking some 450 casualties to Montcalm's 60.|$|E
5|$|By mid-May, French morale was low. They had {{suffered}} terrible losses at Ostrach and Stockach, although these {{had been made}} up by reinforcements. Two senior officers of the Army of the Danube, Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen and Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul, were facing courts-martial on charges of misconduct, professed by their senior officer, Jourdan. Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte and Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr were sick, or claimed they were, and had left the army's encampments to recover their health. Masséna's force had been repelled by Hotze's army at Feldkirch, and forced to fall back, and LeCourbe's failure to push through against Bellegarde's Austrian force in the Tyrol, meant Masséna had <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> southern wing back {{as well as his}} center and northern wing, to maintain communication with the retreating armies on his flanks. At this point, also, the Swiss revolted again, this time against the French, and Zürich became the last defensible position Masséna could take.|$|E
5|$|Egypt's {{commitment}} to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the Six-Day War of June 1967, after which Nasser found {{it increasingly difficult to}} maintain his army's involvement and began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> forces out of Yemen. The surprising removal of Sallal on November 5 by Yemeni dissidents, supported by republican tribesmen, resulted in an internal shift of power in the capital, while the royalists approached it from the north. The new republic government was headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman, all of which shortly either resigned or fled the country, leaving the disarrayed capital under the control of Prime Minister Hassan Amri. The 1967 siege of Sana'a became the turning point of the war. The remaining republican Prime Minister succeeded in keeping control of Sana'a and by February 1968, the royalists lifted the siege. Clashes continued in parallel with peace talks until 1970, when Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic, and a ceasefire came into effect.|$|E

5|$|Michael {{tries to}} {{introduce}} another murder and other twists {{to the story}} <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> staff back into the party. This infuriates Jim to his breaking point, and they hold a private talk in Michael's office. Michael snaps at Jim and points out that he is doing this to keep the office calm. CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) finally returns the phone calls to Jim, and reveals that while nothing has been officially decided yet, Dunder Mifflin {{is expected to be}} insolvent by year-end. Jim hides the news from the staff and nudges them back into the party. Jim finally realizes that Michael was doing this to help his co-workers cope. At the end of the episode, Michael, Dwight, Andy, and Pam find themselves in a fake Mexican standoff lasting until 6:00 at night. Jim pulls Pam out so they can go home, and the others pretend to shoot each other to death.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Orsini was the Prince of Taranto and Ferdinand's fiercest rival. He had been, however, Alfonso's {{faithful}} {{ally and}} had developed an admiration for Skanderbeg and his campaigns in Albania. After Skanderbeg had sided with his rival, Orsini {{allied with the}} Angevins and refused to recognize Ferdinand as King of Naples. He then {{sent a letter to}} convince Skanderbeg <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> men out of Italy arguing that Ferdinand's fortunes were hopeless, that Skanderbeg's fame would die out after his supposed debacle, and that an alliance with René would be much more rewarding than an alliance with Ferdinand. Skanderbeg's letter in response, dated to 10 October 1460, stated that he was not a condottieri looking for fortune, but a mature man looking to help his ally. Furthermore, he sent another letter to Ferdinand assuring him his loyalty. Another letter was sent to Pius assuring him that the Albanians were fit for battle in Italy, something the Italian rulers did not believe. The letters elucidate Skanderbeg's political motives behind his Italian expedition, presenting himself as a noble ally, and also illustrate the influence of the Renaissance in Skanderbeg's court. They also served a psychological purpose to intimidate Ferdinand's rivals: Skanderbeg compared himself to Pyrrhus of Epirus of antiquity who marched into Italy to defend the Greek city-states from Roman expansion.|$|E
25|$|In August 1907, Wada {{took his}} money to Vancouver, British Columbia. The Vancouver Daily Province of August 7, 1907 {{reported}} that Wada {{was a fine}} storyteller, a favorite being {{the one about the}} time he trained two polar bear cubs <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> sled.|$|E
50|$|Witness 102 was a 27-year-old biracial male. He {{said he saw}} Wilson chase Brown until Brown {{abruptly}} turned around. Brown did not put {{his hands}} up in surrender but made some type of movement similar <b>to</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>his</b> pants up or a shoulder shrug and then made a full charge at Wilson. Witness 102 thought Wilson's life was threatened and he only fired shots when Brown was coming toward him.|$|R

25|$|Müller was {{assigned}} to Feldflieger Abteilung 1b on 2 August 1914. When the war broke out, Müller was flying with FA 1b as a reconnaissance pilot and carried out several missions. On 18 August 1914 however, he crashed taking off when his engine failed; both Müller's legs were broken. However, he overcame his injuries <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> unconscious observer from the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|On 25 January, Schulz {{requested}} {{that he be}} allowed to withdraw his 100,000 troops from the developing salient around Katowice/Kattowitz. This was refused, and he repeated the request on 26 January. Schoerner eventually permitted Schulz <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> forces back {{on the night of}} 27 January, while Konev – who had allowed just enough room for the 17th Army to withdraw without putting up serious resistance – secured the area undamaged.|$|E
25|$|That evening, as {{the extent}} of Thierry and Schustekh's {{disaster}} became known, Hiller resolved <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> three corps behind the Isar at Landshut. In this decision, he was also influenced by Masséna's move against his left rear and unfavorable reports from Archduke Louis. This crucial decision meant that the Austrian left wing would {{in the near future}} operate independently from Archduke Charles' main body. Hiller would only reunite with his army commander on 15 May north of Vienna.|$|E

25|$|On November 28, 2004, {{a private}} charter jet {{carrying}} Ebersol {{and two of}} his sons, Charlie and Teddy, crashed during an attempted takeoff from Montrose Regional Airport in Colorado. The jet's captain, Luis Polanco, flight attendant Warren T. Richardson III, and Teddy Ebersol were killed. Dick and his older son, Charlie, along with the first officer survived, though seriously injured. Charlie was thrown clear of the plane and rushed back inside and managed <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> father to safety.|$|E
25|$|After the Cripple Creek strike, Eben Smith slowly began <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> {{investments}} out mines. Returning to {{his interest}} in milling, he built a cyanide process mill near Florence in 1895. It was the largest cyanide process gold mill {{of its kind in}} the world at the time. Smith continued to extend the F railroad, and built an electric power plant at Goldfield. But Smith sold most of his investments, including interest in his many mines, throughout the 1890s. He re-invested some of the money in mines in Utah, Arizona and Oregon.|$|E
25|$|Another new England coach came on {{the scene}} in Glenn Hoddle and Ince kept his place for the next six internationals, which {{included}} five crucial qualifiers for the 1998 World Cup in France. England won four of them but lost 1–0 at home to Italy. During the first of these qualifiers against Moldova in Chişinău, a famous photograph of Ince was taken as he tried to climb a wall at the stadium, only for Gascoigne <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>his</b> tracksuit trousers down, revealing Ince's bare buttocks in front of an army of cameras.|$|E
