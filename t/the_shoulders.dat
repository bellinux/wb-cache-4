[...] The articulations between the bones of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> make up <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> joints. <b>The</b> <b>shoulder</b> joint also known as the glenohumeral joint, is the major joint of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> but can more broadly include the acromioclavicular joint. In human anatomy, <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> joint comprises <b>the</b> part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula, the head sitting in the glenoid cavity. <b>The</b> <b>shoulder</b> is <b>the</b> group of structures in the region of the joint.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an upper-limb {{exoskeleton}} with a tilted and {{vertically movable}} shoulder joint is proposed. By analyzing the biomechanics of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>the</b> upper limb for <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> and <b>the</b> elbow was approximated to five {{degrees of freedom}} (DOFs) by including the vertical translation of the glenohumeral joint of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder,</b> {{in addition to the}} 3 DOFs of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> and 1 DOF of the elbow, which are conventionally used to analyze the motion of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> <b>The</b> <b>shoulder</b> joint was tilted to avoid singularity problems in the workspace, i. e., by tilting <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> joint, <b>the</b> singularity position was placed outside of the normal range of motion. This configuration was analyzed using forward and inverse kinematics methods. Because <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> elevation affects all of the joint angles, the angles were calculated by applying an inverse kinematics method in an iterative manner. The performance of the proposed upper-limb exoskeleton and analysis methods was verified by simulations and experimentsclose 0...|$|R

50|$|Posterior {{shoulder}} in obstetrics refers to <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> of <b>the</b> fetus other than <b>the</b> anterior <b>shoulder.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> posterior <b>shoulder</b> faces <b>the</b> rectum {{of the mother}} during delivery.

It is known as <b>the</b> posterior <b>shoulder</b> as it faces the posterior of the mother.

50|$|There is {{currently}} {{a high number of}} shoulder injuries in volleyball and it is still unknown to how this number can be managed. Shoulder injuries are great in number because <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> is constantly placed under stress during the spiking movements and can often result in injuries to <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> <b>The</b> stress is caused by the rotating of the arm around <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> joint at a high velocity. There are however multiple spiking techniques, including traditional and alternative techniques, that have different risks to <b>the</b> <b>shoulder.</b> <b>The</b> alternative spiking method {{is said to be a}} possible prevention to some injuries that occur in <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> and also enhance an athletes performance.|$|R

This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a spear, and a diadem wrought of silk or linen (not to be confused with a crown) was bound around his forehead as a token of regal authority.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the differences of body compensation image on variations in <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> height and width of power shoulder raglan sleeve jacket. Nine samples were examined: 3 variations of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> height and 3 variations of <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> width. <b>The</b> data was evaluated by 123 fashion design majors. The results were as follows; as a result of analyzing the body compensation image according to changes in <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> height and width of power shoulder raglan sleeve jacket, five factors were selected; <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> compensation factor, <b>the</b> bust compensation factor, the waist compensation factor, the arm compensation factor and the neck compensation factor. Among these factors, <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> compensation factor is the most important factor. Examining the major effect of the body compensation image based on changes in <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> height and width of power shoulder raglan sleeve jacket, it had an independent influence on factors about waist, neck, shoulder and arm compensation except a factor about bust compensation, had an influence on interacting effect of factors about shoulder, bust, waist, arm compensation, and it had no influence on interacting effect of a factor about neck compensation. This shows that <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> height has larger effect on neck compensation image than <b>the</b> <b>shoulder</b> width in power shoulder raglan sleeve jacket...|$|R

5|$|The {{anatomy of}} pterosaurs was highly {{modified}} from their reptilian ancestors by the adaption to flight. Pterosaur bones were hollow and air-filled, like {{the bones of}} birds.
