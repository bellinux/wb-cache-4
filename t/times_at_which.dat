25|$|PERT and CPM {{are very}} similar in their {{approach}} but still present some differences. CPM is used for projects that assume deterministic activity times; the <b>times</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> each activity {{will be carried out}} are known. PERT, on the other hand, allows for stochastic activity times; the <b>times</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> each activity will be carried out are uncertain or varied. Because of this core difference, CPM and PERT are used in different contexts. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.|$|E

25|$|Tubing the Esopus {{above and}} below Phoenicia has long been popular, with about 15,000 people a year taking the float.

Some residents complaining about its local impact and its negative effect on fishing (Other anglers are not as bothered by tubers, pointing out most tubing takes place during daylight hours rather than the crepuscular <b>times</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> trout are most active).). The Shandaken Town Board proposed a law in 1983 that would have limited tubing to the lower stretch during prescribed hours, required bathroom facilities and levied a 10-cent surcharge on each rented tube to cover the expenses to the town. It was not adopted, but later the town required a special use permit under its zoning code. That requirement was dropped after one of the tube-rental businesses challenged it in court.|$|E

500|$|The weather {{data was}} at first less useful {{as a result of}} the {{different}} <b>times</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> weather observations were made. The first attempts at time standardization took hold in Great Britain by 1855. The entire United States did not finally come under the influence of time zones until 1905, when Detroit finally established standard time. Other countries followed the lead of the United States in taking simultaneous weather observations, starting in 1873. [...] Other countries then began preparing surface analyses. The use of frontal zones on weather maps did not appear until the introduction of the Norwegian cyclone model in the late 1910s, despite Loomis' earlier attempt at a similar notion in 1841. Since the leading edge of air mass changes bore resemblance to the military fronts of World War I, the term [...] "front" [...] came into use to represent these lines.|$|E
500|$|Bede, in his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, says of Penda {{that he was}} [...] "a most warlike man of {{the royal}} race of the Mercians" [...] and that, {{following}} Edwin of Northumbria's defeat in 633 (see below), he ruled the Mercians for 22 years with varying fortune. The noted 20th-century historian Frank Stenton was {{of the opinion that}} the language used by Bede [...] "leaves no doubt that ... Penda, though descended from the royal family of the Mercians, only became their king after Edwin's defeat". The Historia Brittonum accords Penda a reign of only ten years, perhaps dating it {{from the time of the}} Battle of Maserfield (see below) around 642, although according to the generally accepted chronology this would still be more than ten years. Given the apparent problems with the dates given by the Chronicle and the Historia, Bede's account of the length of Penda's reign is generally considered the most plausible by historians. Nicholas Brooks noted that, since these three accounts of the length of Penda's reign come from three different sources, and none of them are Mercian (they are West Saxon, Northumbrian, and Welsh), they may merely reflect the <b>times</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> their respective peoples first had military involvement with Penda.|$|E

2500|$|Overall, {{there were}} 240 reigns shared among 52 wrestlers, {{all of whom}} won in Canada, England, Germany, Scotland, and the United States. Raven has the most reigns as champion, with 27. Big Boss Man's fourth reign was the longest in the title's history, at 97 days. Steve Blackman ranks first in {{combined}} reigns by length, at 172 days in six reigns. Due to the [...] "24/7 rule" [...] numerous wrestlers held the title less than one day, and because the exact <b>times</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> each wrestler held the title is unknown, it impossible to determine who had the shortest reign.

2500|$|The graph {{shows the}} <b>times</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> unsuppressed {{responses}} to tones {{occurred when the}} volunteer moved. He showed many unsuppressed responses to tones (dubbed [...] "tone events" [...] on the graph) on average up until 1.8 seconds before movement onset, but {{a significant decrease in}} tone events immediately after that time. Presumably this is because the subject usually became aware of his intention to move at about −1.8 seconds, which is then labelled point T. Since most actions are vetoed if a tone occurs after point T, there are very few tone events represented during that range. Finally, there is a sudden {{increase in the number of}} tone events at 0.1 seconds, meaning this subject has passed point P. Matsuhashi and Hallet were thus able to establish an average time T (−1.8 seconds) without subjective report. This, they compared to ERP measurements of movement, which had detected movement beginning at about −2.8 seconds on average for this participant. Since T — like Libet's original W — was often found after movement genesis had already begun, the authors concluded that the generation of awareness occurred afterwards or in parallel to action, but most importantly, that it was probably not the cause of the movement.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{findings}} emerge when {{observed and}} self-report procrastination are compared. Steel et al. constructed their own scales based on Silver and Sabini’s [...] "irrational" [...] and [...] "postponement" [...] criteria. They {{also sought to}} measure this behavior objectively. During a course, students could complete exam practice computer exercises at their own pace, and during the supervised class time could also complete chapter quizzes. A weighted average of the <b>times</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> each quiz was finished formed the measure of observed procrastination, whilst observed irrationality was quantified {{with the number of}} practice exercises that were left uncompleted. Researchers found that there was only a moderate correlation between observed and self-reported procrastination (r = 0.35). There was a very strong inverse relationship between the number of exercises completed and the measure of postponement (r = −0.78). Observed procrastination was very strongly negatively correlated with course grade (r = −0.87), as was self-reported procrastination (though less so, r = −0.36). As such, self-reported measures of procrastination, on which the majority of the literature is based, {{may not be the most}} appropriate measure to use in all cases. It was also found that procrastination itself may not have contributed significantly to poorer grades.

2500|$|The saros, {{a period}} of 6585.3211 days (14 common years + 4 leap years + 11.321 days, or 13 common years + 5 leap years + 10.321 days), is useful for {{predicting}} the <b>times</b> <b>at</b> <b>which</b> nearly identical eclipses will occur. Three periodicities related to lunar orbit, the synodic month, the draconic month, and the anomalistic month coincide almost perfectly each saros cycle. For an eclipse to occur, either the Moon must be located between the Earth and Sun (for a solar eclipse) or the Earth must be located between the Sun and Moon (for a lunar eclipse). This can happen only when the Moon is new or full, respectively, and repeat occurrences of these lunar phases result from solar and lunar orbits producing the Moon's synodic period of 29.53059 days. During most full and new moons, however, {{the shadow of the}} Earth or Moon falls to the north or south of the other body. Eclipses occur when the three bodies form a nearly straight line. [...] Because the plane of the lunar orbit is inclined to that of the earth, this condition occurs only when a full or new Moon is near or in the ecliptic plane, that is when the moon is at one of the two nodes (the ascending or descending node). The period of time for two successive lunar passes through the ecliptic plane (returning to the same node) is termed the draconic month, a 27.21222 day period. [...] The three-dimensional geometry of an eclipse, when the new or full moon is near one of the nodes, occurs every 5 or 6 months when the Sun is in conjunction or opposition to the Moon and coincidentally also near a node of the Moon's orbit at that time, or twice per eclipse year. Two Saros eclipses have the same appearance and duration due to the distance between the Earth and Moon being nearly the same for each event because the Saros eclipse cycle is also an integer of the anomalistic month, the period of the eccentricity of lunar orbit, 27.5545 days.|$|E
