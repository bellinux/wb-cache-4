5|$|The Green was not {{maintained}} at first; after being cleared, it was unkempt and ragged, sloping sharply towards a swamp {{in the southwest}} corner. As early as 1807, the College was debating as {{to the future of}} the plot, considering using it for a variety of purposes. In 1828, the Board of Trustees finally voted <b>to</b> <b>plow,</b> seed, level, and fence the area. Lack of funding would delay this plan from being carried out immediately; the Green was leveled in 1831 and finally fenced in 1836. The main road from Hanover to the northward Lyme, New Hampshire had previously led diagonally across the Green, and due to the new fences, had to be diverted around it.|$|E
5|$|At 10:30 PM, all {{westbound}} Interstate 78 {{traffic is}} {{stopped at the}} Hamburg exit due to numerous disabled vehicles. At 10:40 PM, Governor Ed Rendell declared a disaster emergency. On the 15th at 3:54 AM, state troopers and emergency personnel began walking miles of Interstate 78, waking up truckers who have gone to sleep as traffic begins to move. At 5 PM on the 15th, the state orders Interstate 78 shut down in both directions from Interstate 81 in Lebanon County to Route 100 in Lehigh County. At 6 PM on the 15th, plowing begins and continued through the night. Additional snow removing equipment was brought in from {{the western part of}} the state to help with the clearing of the highway. Highway officials along with the National Guard and State Police worked to clear the stuck trucks and cars from the highway, therefore plowing and ice removal can get fully underway. On the 16th, the interstate remained closed throughout the day as crews continued <b>to</b> <b>plow</b> and remove ice. On the 17th at 4 PM, the interstate reopened.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} <b>to</b> <b>plow</b> snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E

25|$|With the {{delivery}} of the Class SS starting 1914, the older Class S trains became less popular due to their limit size and comfort. However, they were still technically suited for service. Nos. 48, 49 and 66 were converted to trailers in 1916, being renumbered 247–249. By 1918 the class was removed from regular service. That year no. 57 collided and KSS decided to rebuild it. The body was removed and the undercarriage and motors were used to construct a snowplow unit. The plow itself {{came out on the}} side and could be maneuvered from within. This allowed it <b>to</b> <b>plow</b> the tracks and the section from the tracks to the sidewalk. It remained in operation until 1950.|$|E

Despite this setback, the task force assaulted the PAVN in and around Lat Sen three times during October. As this task force {{was the only one}} enjoying any success, its operation was stoked with reinforcements from the reserves and from stalemated columns. GM 32 took 220 dead, 270 wounded, and at least 53 missing; it was left unfit for further combat and withdrawn from the operation. Two Thai battalions were also decimated. GM 30 was defeated and sapped by desertions. GM 15 went on one last offensive, only <b>to</b> <b>plow</b> head-on into the earliest PAVN dry season offensive of the war.|$|E
25|$|Many {{school districts}} {{affected}} by the blizzard closed schools for the week. The amount of snow accumulating on the roads forced some snowplows <b>to</b> <b>plow</b> the snow into parking lots, further contributing to school closures. Many schools announced during the storm that their facilities would be closed {{for the duration of}} the week following the storm. The University System of Maryland announced on Sunday, February 16 that their campuses would not reopen until Monday, February 24. The extended closure of school districts due to this storm exacerbated the task of scheduling make-up days for the affected students, as most of these districts had already used all of their previously allocated days on storms earlier in the winter. Some districts in New Jersey ended the school year as late as June 30, 2003.|$|E

25|$|In 1907, African-American Pink Franklin {{was working}} as a {{contract}} farm laborer on the farm of Jake Thomas. Thomas had given Franklin some of his wages in advance, but Franklin was unhappy with his contract and left the farm. Thomas asked the local police to intervene, and on July 29, 1907, at 3:00 AM, Constable Henry H. Valentine and Constable Carter came to Franklin's house. A neighbor of Franklin's, Charles Spires, sometimes worked with Thomas and was on hand. Upon the Constables' instruction, Spires asked Franklin <b>to</b> <b>plow</b> his field, possibly through a closed front door. Franklin said that he would not, and that he might later in the day. Valentine broke into the house and was shot and killed by Franklin. Franklin, his wife, Patsy, and Constable Carter were also shot in the melee, all surviving. Franklin's young son was also home.|$|E
25|$|Only 27 intrepid French {{settlers}} {{were able}} to make the final leg of the trip from the farm designated as a resting place to their new Texan utopia, a site located in today's Denton County in Texas (northwest of Dallas). The small group arrived June 2, 1848, and immediately began a frenzied effort to construct dwellings in order to stake their land claims, attempting at the same time <b>to</b> <b>plow</b> and farm the prairie. Virtually no time remained to meet the terms of the land concession. The hot summer sun began to bake the ground. Poorly fed, poorly housed, overworked and exhausted, the Icarian colonists next fell victim to an outbreaks of cholera and malaria, illnesses which killed four and sickened the rest. Making a bad situation still worse, the one medical doctor in the company broke down into a state of insanity and deserted his fellows.|$|E
25|$|Sixteen of 25 {{towns in}} Erie County, {{as well as}} the City of Buffalo, {{declared}} states of emergency and banned all nonessential traffic at some time during the storm. The USACE normal work force, plus personnel from other USACE installations, resulted in a total of 353 USACE personnel working on the recovery effort. The USACE Buffalo District overall effort (including both western and northern New York) reported $6.8million used in paying 216 private contractors <b>to</b> <b>plow</b> 3,186miles of road in 9 counties using about 1,000 pieces of equipment and US$700,000 of in-house costs. Other military assistance included 500 National Guard troops, 320 U. S. Army Airborne troops, the 20th Engineer Brigade from Fort Bragg, 65–70 U.S. Marines, as well as assistance from the U.S. Air Force. The National Guard operation was entitled Task Force Western, with headquarters at the Connecticut Street Armory in Buffalo, and included providing 9–10 Army-type ambulances along with operators for use in the City of Buffalo when almost no normal ambulances were able to operate.|$|E

25|$|SEPTA {{regional}} {{rail lines}} ran on weekend schedules through Tuesday the 18th. About 400,000 tons of snow were {{dumped into the}} Schuylkill River. The city estimated snow removal cost about 8 million dollars. It took until the 18th <b>to</b> <b>plow</b> side streets. The worst accident of the storm occurred early on the 16th as six vehicles collided near Academy Road on Interstate 95. In Delaware County, all trolley and bus routes were closed through the 18th as were schools and county offices. Snowmobiles were used to rescue trapped motorists. In Chester County, a major accident during the early afternoon of the 16th closed the eastbound lanes of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Morgantown and Downingtown for three hours. In Montgomery County, in Conshohocken, two {{people were killed in}} an early morning fire on the 17th. Firefighters were hampered by the ongoing storm. Lengthy delays occurred on the 16th on U.S. Route 422, the Pennsylvania Turnpike and the Northeast Extension to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. A string of porch collapses occurred on the 19th in Norristown.|$|E
25|$|Bells were vitally {{important}} to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, {{to call the}} Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bells. The daily routine began with sunrise Mass and morning prayers, followed by instruction of the natives in {{the teachings of the}} Roman Catholic faith. After a generous (by era standards) breakfast of atole, the able-bodied men and women were assigned their tasks for the day. The women were committed to dressmaking, knitting, weaving, embroidering, laundering, and cooking, while some of the stronger girls ground flour or carried adobe bricks (weighing 55 lb, or 25kg each) to the men engaged in building. The men worked a variety of jobs, having learned from the missionaries how <b>to</b> <b>plow,</b> sow, irrigate, cultivate, reap, thresh, and glean. In addition, they were taught to build adobe houses, tan leather hides, shear sheep, weave rugs and clothing from wool, make ropes, soap, paint, and other useful duties.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this is the disease environment. Places with {{different}} mortality rates had different populations and productivity levels around the world. For example, in Africa, the Tsetse fly which is harmful to humans and livestock reduced the ability of the Africans <b>to</b> <b>plow</b> the land. This made Africa less settled. As a consequence, political power was less concentrated. This also affected the colonial institutions that where set in place by the European countries in Africa. If the colonial settlers could live or not in a place made them develop different institutions which led to different economic and social paths. This also affected the distribution of power and the collective actions people could take. As a result, some African countries ended up having democracies and others autocracies. Another example of geographical determinants for democracy is having access to coastal areas and rivers. This natural endowment has a positive relation with economic development thanks to the benefits of trade. Trade brought economic development, which in turn, broaden the power. If the ruler wanted to increase his revenues, he had to protect property rights to create incentives for people to invest. As more people had more power, more concessions had to be made by the ruler and in many places this process lead to democracy. These determinants defined the structur of the society moving the balance of political power.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether cultural norms arising from traditional agricultural practices affect {{the formation of}} gender-specific skills. We hypothesize that a culturally induced division of labor along gender lines generates gender-specific skills. As opposed to the traditional measurement of skills, which measures skill levels based {{on the type of}} tasks or abilities observed in certain occupations, we measure skills directly using a controlled field experiment in rural Ethiopia. Comparing women with exposure <b>to</b> the <b>plow</b> culture with women without exposure to such cultural norms, and with men in general, we find a clear division of labor along gender lines between domestic and non-domestic work. We show that women exposed <b>to</b> the <b>plow</b> culture are particularly skilled in exercising a light manual task resembling everyday work in the domestic sphere. Drawing on secondary data on the time-use of Ethiopian adults, we find supporting evidence that women with exposure <b>to</b> the <b>plow</b> culture specialize in tasks from the domestic sphere. Thus, culturally-induced skill differences arguably are a neglected explanation for gender disparities in labor income...|$|R
