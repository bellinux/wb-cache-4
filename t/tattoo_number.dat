50|$|The monkeys are {{currently}} {{managed by the}} Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society (GONHS), and veterinarian expertise {{is provided by the}} Gibraltar Veterinary Clinic. The macaques receive a daily supply of fresh water and vegetables, fruit and seeds as supplement to natural food resources (leaves, olives, roots, seeds and flowers). The animals are caught on a regular basis to check their health status. Additionally, body size, weight and several other measurements are taken. Finally, the animals are given a <b>tattoo</b> <b>number</b> and a microchip as a means of identification. But tattoos are not the only way to recognise individual macaques; many of them have particular marks, scars or spots which can be used as distinguishing features. All monkeys are photographed and the pictures and individual characteristics are catalogued. Cataloguing work is carried out by the GONHS. The GONHS also does collaborative studies with the Scientific Institute of Rabat-Agdal University (Morocco), the University of Notre Dame (Indiana, United States), the University of Vienna (Austria), the German Primate Centre (Germany) and the University of Zurich (Switzerland).|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} program was developed at Utah State University (USU) {{to aid in}} obtaining a more complete individual performance record keeping system for beef cattle in Utah. Some {{computer program}}s for beef cattle records presently exist but a program was needed that was readily available to the USU animal science extension and resident staff. The program was written in FORTRAN for use on the Burrogh 6700 computer located at the Utah State University Computer Center. It was designed to read input data for individual animals, perform various calculations (i. e. days of age, adjusted weaning weight and weaning weight ratio), print out the input data and results of the calculations for each animal {{as well as the}} average adjusted weight for each sex group (heifer, bull, steer). The computer program will manipulate weights in either the English or metric system and will convert weights from the English to metric system if desired. A unique feature of the program is the ranking of animals from highest to lowest based on the weaning weight ratio with accompanying animal number. The records can be evaluated to identify potential animals to use as replacements and those to be culled. The input data are collected on the ranch by a cooperative arrangement between the ranch operator and the USU Extension Staff. The ranch operator collects the preliminary data such as: birth date, tag number, <b>tattoo</b> <b>number,</b> dam, age of dam, and sire, and records it on the beef cattle performance input record. The extension specialist weights, gives a conformation score and records the information for each calf on the input record. The beef cattle performance input record is arranged in the same order as the data card is key punched thus facilitating the punching of the data cards. The staff can change from using the desk calculator {{to the use of the}} computer to improve efficiency and flexibility output as well as having more time available to spend with the public teaching that maintaining accurate records can help improve their herds for production and for inventory control. This can help the beef cattle industry to improve quality and type of beef animal produced in Utah and should improve the potential efficiency and profit. The rancher can transfer his records, with minor modifications, to one of the existing national computer programming organizations if desired. This computer program with or without modification has application for current research and university teaching. The computer program was designated for use with beef cattle, but could be modified to use for any class of livestock. This program is not an end in itself but is a foundation from which to build an improved record keeping system in Utah which could improve the production and quality of the beef cattle industry...|$|E

50|$|It is not {{customary}} to have {{a cemetery}} next to a synagogue, {{and the establishment of}} the 3,000 m2 cemetery was only the result of historical circumstances. In 1944, {{as a part of the}} Eichmann-plan, 70,000 Jews were relocated to the Ghetto of Pest. Until January 18, 1945, when the Russians liberated the ghetto, around 8,000 to 10,000 people had died, although, one part of the deceased were transferred to the Kozma Street Cemetery, but 2,000 people were buried in the makeshift cemetery. In memory of those who had died, there is a memorial by the sculptor, Imre Varga, depicting a weeping willow with the names and <b>tattoo</b> <b>numbers</b> of the dead and disappeared just behind the Synagogue, in the Raoul Wallenberg Holocaust Memorial Park.|$|R

In a cross-sectional study in Brazil, we studied 182 individuals with tattoos and assessed the odds of testing positive for a TTD according to <b>tattoo</b> type, <b>number,</b> design and performance conditions. Major findings were significant associations between an increasing <b>number</b> of <b>tattoos</b> and HBV infection (odds ratio (OR) of 2. 04 for two tattoos and 3. 48 for > or = 3 tattoos), having a non-professional tattoo and testing positive for at least one TTD (OR = 3. 25), and having > or = 3 tattoos and testing positive for at least one TTD (OR = 2. 98). We suggest that non-professional <b>tattoos</b> and <b>number</b> of <b>tattoos</b> should be assessed as potential deferral criteria in screening blood donors...|$|R
5000|$|... "Close Every Door" [...] is a {{song from}} the musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is the {{penultimate}} song of the first act of the musical, sung by Joseph while imprisoned for his supposed relationship with Potiphar's wife. Along with [...] "Any Dream Will Do", {{it is one of}} the most popular songs from the musical. In addition to voicing Joseph's despair at being jailed for a crime he did not commit, the song appears to contain oblique references to the Jewish Holocaust of World War II. Lyrics such as [...] "Just give me a number/Instead of my name ... Destroy me completely/Then throw me away" [...] reflect the well-documented Nazi practices of <b>tattooing</b> <b>numbers</b> on imprisoned Jews and working them to death (or gassing them) in concentration camps, then burning the bodies or burying them in mass graves. The lyrics have even been incorporated into a Seder service for educators in New South Wales.|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{published}} {{results are}} inconsistent, {{it has been}} suggested that tattooing and piercing are risk factors for HBV and HCV infections. To examine whether tattooing and piercing do indeed increase the risk of infection, we conducted a study among people with multiple tattoos and/or piercings in the Netherlands who acquired their tattoos and piercings in the Netherlands and/or abroad. Methods: Tattoo artists, piercers, and people with multiple tattoos and/or piercings were recruited at tattoo conventions, shops (N = 182), and a biannual survey at our STI-outpatient clinic (N = 252) in Amsterdam. Participants were interviewed and tested for anti-HBc and anti-HCV. Determinants of HBV and HCV infections were analysed using logistic regression analysis. Results: The median <b>number</b> of <b>tattoos</b> and piercings was 5 (IQR 2 ‚Äì 10) and 2 (IQR 2 ‚Äì 4), respectively. Almost 40 % acquired their tattoo of piercing abroad. In total, 18 / 434 (4. 2 %, 95 %CI: 2. 64 %‚Äì 6. 46 %) participants were anti-HBc positive and 1 was anti-HCV positive (0. 2 %, 95 %CI: 0. 01 %‚Äì 1. 29 %). Being anti-HBc positive was independently associated with older age (OR 1. 68, 95 %CI: 1. 03 ‚Äì 2. 75 per 10 years older) and being born in an HBV-endemic country (OR 7. 39, 95 %CI: 2. 77 ‚Äì 19. 7).
