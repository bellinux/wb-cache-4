Of these, 310,600 were in Australia, 224,000 were serving in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) and 20,100 were in Britain {{and other parts of}} the world. The only personnel to be discharged during August and September were former prisoners of war and those with a long period of service, however, as general demobilisation did not begin until 1October 1945. During the intervening months dispersal centres were established in each state and territory's capital city. These centres were to provide information on employment, land settlement, housing, training, loans, tools for trades and other benefits for service personnel as their discharges were processed. Lieutenant-General Stanley Savige was appointed <b>the</b> <b>Coordinator</b> of Demobilisation and Dispersal in September.|$|E

The latter measure, and Disney's sometimes high-handed and insensitive manner of dealing with staff, led to a 1941 animators' strike which lasted five weeks. While a federal mediator from the National Labor Relations Board negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an offer from the Office of <b>the</b> <b>Coordinator</b> of Inter-American Affairs to make a goodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolution he knew would be unfavorable to the studio.

The strike temporarily interrupted the studio's next production, Dumbo (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and inexpensive manner; the film received a positive reaction from audiences and critics alike.|$|E

The questionnaire consisted of thirty-eight tasks and three categories of task areas: (a) Knowledge Area; (b) Interpersonal Skills and Attitudes; and (c) Administrative and Organizational Activities.
