5|$|During the 19th century, Bond Street {{became less}} {{known for its}} social {{atmosphere}} but increased its reputation as a street for luxury shopping. <b>The</b> <b>auctioneer</b> Phillips was established in 1796 at No.101 Bond Street, specialising in stringed instruments and sheet music. The jewellers Asprey originally opened in 1830 at Nos.165–169 New Bond Street. The Jewish practice of Kabbalah {{has been associated with}} the street after former East End trader Sarah Levenson opened a shop on No.50 New Bond Street in 1856 which immediately became profitable, albeit through exaggerated and questionable product claims. Levenson was twice taken to court and prosecuted for fraud; each prosecution resulted in a five-year prison sentence. She died midway through the second. Nevertheless, the practice regained popularity and a Kabbalah Centre remains on the street.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} episode, an amnesic Kay {{is accused of}} murdering defense {{attorney}} Tsubasa Kagome. Edgeworth is brought up before the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, which threatens to take his badge if he becomes involved with Kay's case; Edgeworth voluntarily gives up his badge and continues to investigate with help from prosecutor Franziska von Karma. He discovers that someone has been auctioning off evidence from legal cases, and finds a recording indicating that Kagome's murderer had a burn mark on their chin. When Edgeworth is called to defend himself against the committee, Mikagami reveals Bansai Ichiyanagi, {{the head of the}} investigation committee and Yumihiko's father, as <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer</b> and the one responsible for legal corruption in his former position as chief prosecutor. Edgeworth tricks him into revealing his burn mark, identifying him as Kagome's murderer. Kay then remembers being attacked by someone and Shelly de Killer reveals the concept of the mastermind to Edgeworth and Kay.|$|E

50|$|During {{the year}} 2013 Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of the Slovak Republic {{concluded}} a CCA electronic auction for spectrum licences from the 800 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2600 MHz frequency bands. These frequencies {{are reserved for}} operation of 4G networks (especially LTE technology).The auction was accompanied by strict information embargo. Neither the public nor <b>the</b> <b>auctioneers</b> did not know who are <b>the</b> <b>auctioneers</b> nor how many <b>auctioneers</b> participates in <b>the</b> auction.

25|$|Walrasi{{an auction}} or Walrasian tâtonnement is an auction in which <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer</b> takes bids from both {{buyers and sellers}} in a market of {{multiple}} goods. <b>The</b> <b>auctioneer</b> progressively either raises or drops the current proposed price depending on the bids of both buyers and sellers, the auction concluding when supply and demand exactly balance. As a high price tends to dampen demand while a low price tends to increase demand, in theory there is a particular price {{somewhere in the middle}} where supply and demand will match.|$|E
25|$|The minimum bid {{differs from}} a reserve price (see definition), in that <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer</b> sets the minimum bid, while the seller sets the reserve price (if desired).|$|E

25|$|Another {{approach}} to choosing an SOB: <b>The</b> <b>auctioneer</b> may achieve good success {{by asking the}} expected final sales price for the item, as this method suggests to the potential buyers the item's particular value. For instance, say an auctioneer is about to sell a $1,000 car at a sale. Instead of asking $100, hoping to entice wide interest (for who wouldn't want a $1,000 car for $100?), <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer</b> may suggest an opening bid of $1,000; although the first bidder may begin bidding at a mere $100, the final bid may more likely approach $1,000.|$|E

25|$|Auctioneers {{may or may}} not (depending on {{the laws}} of the {{jurisdiction}} and/or the policies of the auction house) bid for their own account, or if they do must disclose this to bidders at the auction; similar rules may apply for employees of <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer</b> or the auction house.|$|E

25|$|Reserve auction is {{an auction}} where the item for sale {{may not be}} sold if the final bid is not high enough to satisfy the seller; that is, the seller {{reserves}} the right to accept or reject the highest bid. In these cases a set 'reserve' price known to <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer,</b> but not necessarily to the bidders, may have been set, below which the item may not be sold. The reserve price may be fixed or discretionary. In the latter case, the decision to accept a bid is deferred to <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer,</b> who may accept a bid that is marginally below it. A reserve auction is safer for the seller than a no-reserve auction as they {{are not required to}} accept a low bid, but this could result in a lower final price if less interest is generated in the sale.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, a dummy bid (shill, schill) is a {{criminal}} offence, but a vendor bid or a co-owner bid below the reserve price is permitted, if clearly declared as such by <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer.</b> These are all official legal terms in Australia, but may have other meanings elsewhere. A co-owner {{is one of two}} or several owners (who disagree among themselves).|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, auctions {{have a long}} history, {{having been}} {{recorded}} as early as 500 B.C. According to Herodotus, in Babylon auctions of women for marriage were held annually.

25|$|In an English auction, a dummy bid is a bid {{made by a}} dummy bidder {{acting in}} {{collusion}} with <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer</b> or vendor, designed to deceive genuine bidders into paying more. In a first-price auction, a dummy bid is an unfavourable bid designed {{so as not to}} become the winning bid. (The bidder does not want to win this auction, but he or she wants to make sure to be invited to the next auction).|$|E
25|$|As {{electrification}} progressed, the old {{rolling stock}} was advertised for sale. An attempt {{to sell the}} 18 locomotives and 96 carriages by auction in June 1903 proved completely unsuccessful – <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer</b> had to remind the bidders {{that he was not}} selling scrap. It was September before the first locomotive was sold; it would take another two years to sell all-bar-one of the locomotives. The last locomotive — which had been retained for working permanent way trains — was sold in January 1908.|$|E
25|$|English auction, {{also known}} as an open {{ascending}} price auction. This type of auction {{is arguably the most}} common form of auction in use today. Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid required to be higher than the previous bid. An auctioneer may announce prices, bidders may call out their bids themselves (or have a proxy call out a bid on their behalf), or bids may be submitted electronically with the highest current bid publicly displayed. In some cases a maximum bid might be left with <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer,</b> who may bid on behalf of the bidder according to the bidder's instructions. The auction ends when no participant is willing to bid further, at which point the highest bidder pays their bid. Alternatively, if the seller has set a minimum sale price in advance (the 'reserve' price) and the final bid does not reach that price the item remains unsold. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer</b> sets a minimum amount by which the next bid must exceed the current highest bid. The most significant distinguishing factor of this auction type is that the current highest bid is always available to potential bidders. The English auction is commonly used for selling goods, most prominently antiques and artwork, but also secondhand goods and real estate.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with setting a predetermined number of bid levels in a Dutch auction to maximize <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer's</b> expected revenue. As {{a departure from the}} traditional methods used by applied economists and game-theorists, a novel approach is taken in this study to tackle the problem by formulating the auctioning process as a constrained nonlinear program and applying standard optimization techniques to solve it. Aside from proposing respective closed-form formulae for computing the optimal bid levels and <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer's</b> maximum expected revenue, we also show that the bid decrements should be increasing if there are two or more bidders in the Dutch auction. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer's</b> maximum expected revenue increases with the number of bidders as well as the number of bid levels. Finally, managerial implications of the key findings as well as limitations of this research work are discussed.

25|$|There {{will usually}} be an {{estimate}} of what price the lot will fetch. In an ascending open auction it is considered important {{to get at least}} a 50-percent increase in the bids from start to finish. To accomplish this, <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer</b> must start the auction by announcing a suggested opening bid (SOB) that is low enough to be immediately accepted by one of the bidders. Once there is an opening bid, there will quickly be several other, higher bids submitted. Experienced auctioneers will often select an SOB that is about 45 percent of the (lowest) estimate. Thus there is a certain margin of safety to ensure that there will indeed be a lively auction with many bids submitted. Several observations indicate that the lower the SOB, the higher the final winning bid. This is due to {{the increase in the number}} of bidders attracted by the low SOB.|$|E
25|$|On November 7, 2011, {{following}} a foreclosure auction with no active bidders, Workforce Housing Advisors {{were able to}} take title of 1520 Sedgwick Avenue.

John Crotty of Workforce Housing Advisors told the New York Times that his group intends to renovate the distressed building and work with tenants to recognize its importance. The group’s investors are more interested in steady, secure returns than in making money quickly. Some money for renovations will be provided by New York City’s department of Housing Preservation and Development, and the Housing Development Corporation. The new owner intends to pursue a listing for on the National Register of Historic Places, for which the building was deemed eligible in 2007 but Karasick declined to accept.|$|E
25|$|An auction is {{a process}} of buying and selling goods or {{services}} by offering them up for bid, taking bids, and then selling the item to the highest bidder. The open ascending price auction is arguably {{the most common form of}} auction in use today. Participants bid openly against one another, with each subsequent bid required to be higher than the previous bid. An auctioneer may announce prices, bidders may call out their bids themselves (or have a proxy call out a bid on their behalf), or bids may be submitted electronically with the highest current bid publicly displayed. In a Dutch auction, <b>the</b> <b>auctioneer</b> begins with a high asking price for some quantity of like items; the price is lowered until a participant is willing to accept the auctioneer's price for some quantity of the goods in the lot or until the seller's reserve price is met. While auctions are most associated in the public imagination with the sale of antiques, paintings, rare collectibles and expensive wines, auctions are also used for commodities, livestock, radio spectrum and used cars. In economic theory, an auction may refer to any mechanism or set of trading rules for exchange.|$|E
