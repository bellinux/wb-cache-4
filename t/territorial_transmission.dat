40|$|AbstractPrevalence of {{transmitted}} {{drug resistance}} (pTDR) to antiretroviral drugs in Spain (2007 – 2012) was estimated using the CoRIS cohort, adjusting its <b>territorial</b> distribution and <b>transmission</b> {{route to the}} reference population from the Spanish Information System on New human immunodeficiency virus diagnoses. A total of 2702 patients from ten autonomous communities and with naive FASTA sequence within 6 months of human immunodeficiency virus diagnosis were selected. Weighted pTDR, estimated using the inverse probability of selection in the sample by autonomous communities and transmission group, was 8. 12 % (95 % CI 6. 44 – 9. 80), {{not significantly different from}} unweighted pTDR. We illustrate how proportional weighting can maximize representativeness of cohort-based data, and its value to monitor pTDR at country level...|$|R
