5|$|In 1959, Fox {{cast her}} in two {{independent}} gangster films filmed in the United Kingdom: The Challenge and <b>Too</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>to</b> Handle. Both films were low-budget, and their American releases were delayed. <b>Too</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>to</b> Handle was not {{released in the}} United States until 1961 (as Playgirl After Dark), and The Challenge in 1963 (as It Takes a Thief). In the United States, censors objected to a scene in <b>Too</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>to</b> Handle where Mansfield, wearing silver netting with sequins painted over her nipples, appeared nearly nude.|$|E
5|$|After Mansfield's death, the {{documentary}} The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield (1968) included nude {{scenes from the}} film and pages from the Playboy pictorial, along with scenes from her other films including <b>Too</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>to</b> Handle (1960), The Loves of Hercules (1960) and L'Amore Primitivo (1964). Promises! Promises! was presented {{for the first time}} on television in its uncut form in 1984 on the Playboy Channel. A VHS release soon followed but was only briefly in print. On February 14, 2006, VCI Video released the film on DVD with extras such as original trailers and a gallery of stills from the Playboy issue along with never before released lobby cards.|$|E
5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling {{was essential to}} the process of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E

5000|$|A study {{published}} in the journal Science found that during the Great Extinction the oceans' surface temperatures reached , which explains why recovery took so long: it was simply <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> for life <b>to</b> survive. [...] Of course, not all of the Earth's surface was 40°, and if it was simply <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> for life <b>to</b> survive then nothing would have survived. Perhaps anoxia provides another aspect of what delayed the recovery.|$|R

5|$|Although Mansfield's film {{career was}} short-lived, she had several box-office successes {{and won a}} Theatre World Award and a Golden Globe. She enjoyed success {{in the role of}} fictional actress Rita Marlowe, both in the 1955–1956 Broadway version and the 1957 Hollywood film version of Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?. Her other major movie {{performances}} were for The Girl Can't Help It (1956), The Wayward Bus (1957), and <b>Too</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>to</b> Handle (1960). In the sexploitation film Promises! Promises! (1963), she became the first major American actress to have a nude starring role in a Hollywood motion picture. Mansfield took her professional name from her first husband, public relations professional Paul Mansfield. Mansfield's career came to an end when she was killed in a 1967 car accident at the age of 34.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker was {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape in hardback format on 5 April 1955 with a cover designed by Kenneth Lewis, following Fleming's suggestions of using a stylised flame motif; the first impression was of 9,900 copies. The US publication was by Macmillan on 20 September that year. In October 1956 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 43,000 copies {{before the end of the}} year. In December that year the US paperback {{was published}} under the title <b>Too</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>to</b> Handle by Permabooks. This edition was rewritten to Americanise the British idioms used, and Fleming provided a number of explanatory footnotes such as the value of English currency against the dollar. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.|$|E

25|$|On 26 August 1940, {{a bombing}} raid {{destroyed}} a goods shed at Bordesley, West Midlands. During the raid Peter Smout, an 18-year-old engine cleaner who was {{acting as the}} fireman on a shunter, volunteered to drive No. 7758 to pull wagons out of the blazing goods shed. He made three more trips. He was assisted by Frederick Blake, a wagon examiner and a navy veteran from World War I, who operated the points levers. When they finished, the right hand side of the footplate was <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> touch, and Blake had to use his hat to work the points as the levers were also <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> touch. Both men were awarded the George Medal for their courage.|$|E

The company immediately displayed recall notices upon learning of the dangerous product.|$|E
25|$|The fashion {{influences}} between colonials and natives was {{a reciprocal}} phenomenon. Just as the Europeans influences the natives, the natives too influenced the European colonials. For example, the thick European fabrics was considered <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> wear in tropical climate. Thus, the light clothing of thin kebaya fabrics and the comfortable {{and easy to}} wear batik sarong are considered quite suitable for everyday clothing in hot and humid climate of the East Indies.|$|E

25|$|In 1948 Athalie Range became President of the Parent Teacher Association at her children's school, Liberty City Elementary. The {{school had}} 1200 students, and {{consisted}} of all portable classrooms, with no permanent buildings. There were only some twelve toilets each for boys and for girls. The only drinking fountains were outside, fed by pipes laid on top of ground, so that the water was usually <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> drink. There were no trees or grassy areas on the school grounds, and no lunch room. Liberty City Elementary {{was one of the}} few schools in the (county-wide) school district holding two half-day sessions.Robinson.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 Landfield {{presided over}} two public panel discussions at the New York Studio School and the Tenri Institute both in Manhattan called Cool and Collected or <b>Too</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>to</b> Handle. In 1995 he curated Seven Painters at the Nicholas/Alexander Gallery in SoHo, an {{exhibition}} that featured seven important abstract painters whose careers {{began in the}} mid to late 1960s, some of whom hadn't been shown for many years. In 1996 Landfield had a solo exhibition in Sapporo, Japan and lectured there on American art. In 1997 he aided colleague Ronald Davis's creation of an educational website highlighting abstract art from the 1960s. He was represented by the Salander/O'Reilly Gallery in New York from 1997 until 2007. In October 2005 he had a solo exhibition of his paintings accompanied by a solo show of sculpture by Peter Reginato at the Heidi Cho Gallery in Chelsea.|$|E
25|$|St Sylvesters {{were the}} first team to qualify for the second round as Erins Hope failed to field a team for the game. Defending champions UCD began their title race with a one-sided victory over Garda. St Judes beat Ballymun Kickhams convincingly and went on to the second round. Naomh Maur {{defeated}} O'Tooles sending them straight to the backdoor round and Naomh Mearnóg defeated their Fingal rivals Fingallians with Cillian O'Driscoll scoring a total of five frees for Mearnóg. Ballyboden will hope to do better than their fourth round appearance in 2006 as they cruised past Trinity Gaels. Raheny defeated Parnells despite a late attempt by the opposition. St Marys beat Whitehall Colmcille with a late goal by substitute Kenneth Kelly. Former Sligo forward T Brennan impressed with seven points in Lucan Sarsfields four point win over St Annes. Na Fianna had a comfortable five point win over St Marks and St Brigids crushed a lacklustre Round Towers. Kilmacud Crokes beat St Vincents by two goals in what proved to be a disappointing game between two of Dublins highest rated teams. Plunkett's forward line proved <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> handle for a gutsy Olaf's with solid performances from Alan Brogan and Jason Sherlock. Last years Intermediate champions St Peregrines lost their first senior game to Naomh Barróg. Ballinteer St Johns cruised into the second tound with a victory over Clontarf. Thomas Davis went on to play in the backdoor round against St Vincents as they lost to Erins Isle who progress to the next stage.|$|E
50|$|This {{endangered}} plant {{grows in}} mid-Appalachian shale barrens, an eroding shale scree of Devonian origin. This habitat occurs in Virginia pine woodlands and {{is made up}} of unstable rock and thin soils which are largely weathered fragments of shale known as channery. Most populations of the plant have a few individuals. The rocky soils receive direct sunlight that makes them <b>too</b> <b>hot</b> (up <b>to</b> 63°C) to support many plant species.|$|R

25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} two weeks later. It is midday, {{and the sun}} is scorching. <b>Too</b> <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> work, the mechanics, wearing {{sleeveless}} tank tops or stripped to their waists, laze around the garage and flirt with their girlfriends. Luca has taken Angelo under his wing and is teaching him how to fight. Unfortunately, Angelo shows little skill and continues to be the subject of the other mechanics' ridicule. Dino arrives, looking rather silly in a straw hat, Hawaiian shirt, Bermudas, and socks and sandals. Taking his briefcase, he leaves for a trip. Luca begins flirting with Lana, who is kneading dough for bread, and mutual seduction ensues. The mechanics and their partners also begin behaving lustily with increasing intensity. Lana leads Luca into her apartment with Dino above Dino's office. They make love, and Luca subsequently emerges dressed only in his underwear and an unbuttoned shirt, smoking a cigarette. He then re-enters the apartment and returns to Lana. Other couples lounge around the garage floor, apparently in post-coital bliss. Dino returns from his trip, and chases his workers and their friends away. He sees Lana through the apartment window and thinks she is waving at him, not realizing she is again making love to Luca with her hand pressed to the window. Dino ascends the metal staircase leading to the apartment, but trips and makes a clattering noise. Lana and Luca realize that Dino has returned. Just as Dino enters the apartment, Luca leaves by throwing his clothes out of another window and climbing down a fire escape. He dresses, but discovers that one of his boots is missing. Fortunately, Lana tosses the boot out of the window. Luca puts it on and walks away quickly. Angelo observes and follows him. Next, we see a car in the garage shaking as two people engage in sexual intercourse within. Luca emerges, buttoning his trousers, followed – unexpectedly – by Angelo. The expression on Angelo's face indicates he has fallen in love with Luca, and in parallel solos, both Lana and Angelo express joyous ecstasy at having encountered Luca that night.|$|E

She set up a milk station where clean milk was given out. Commercial milk at that time was often contaminated, or mixed with chalky water to improve colour and {{maximize}} profit. Baker also invented an infant formula made out of water, calcium carbonate, lactose, and cow milk. This enabled mothers to go to work so they could support their families.|$|R
