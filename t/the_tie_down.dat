50|$|Loop straps, {{like their}} name implies, are {{a single piece}} of webbing that is looped around the item to be {{protected}} and the two endpoints are brought together at <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> fastener for fastening and providing tension.|$|E
50|$|Tie down straps (also called ratchet straps, lashing straps or tie downs) are {{fasteners}} used to {{hold down}} cargo or equipment during transport. Tie down straps are essentially webbing that is outfitted with tie down hardware. This hardware allows <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> strap to attach to the area surrounding the cargo or equipment, loop over the cargo or equipment, and/or attach to the cargo or equipment. It usually also includes a method of tensioning the strap, such as a ratchet.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of buckles found in tie down straps. The two most common are {{threaded}} buckles and snap buckles. Threaded buckles work like those found on backpacks and duffel bags {{for the purpose of}} adjusting the length of <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> strap. Snap buckles are also commonly found on backpacks and duffel bags to allow fastening of the strap. These two components are often used in conjunction with the threading buckle providing tension and the snap buckle providing fastening. While threading buckles come in metal varieties for use with tensioning fasteners like over-center and ratchet fasteners, snap buckles are often plastic and are not designed to withstand a great deal of tension.|$|E

5000|$|Monterey Bay Academy Airport [...] {{is a small}} daytime only {{airfield}} {{located near}} the city of Watsonville in Santa Cruz County, California, USA. This former strictly private use airport (now open to the public), is owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and is located on the campus of Monterey Bay Academy, previously the military installation Camp McQuaide. Since May 2013 the airstrip is operated by Ocean Shore Aviation, LLC, a volunteer aviation group. The group restored the worn out dirt strip, converting it from dirt into a grass runway. In addition to fixing the runway, the group has secured a parking/tie-down area (paved with concrete), and has added a picnic area situated within walking distance to the parking/tie-down area overlooking the Pacific Ocean. A webcam is in operation and shows <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> area.|$|E
50|$|Toyota also {{introduced}} an X-Runner trim, which replaces the slow selling S-Runner trim {{from the previous}} generation. The X-Runner features the 1GR-FE paired to a six-speed manual transmission, 18 in alloy wheels, lowered two inches from the factory and included an X-Brace suspension package. Toyota also included a Down-Hill Assist Control (DAC) and Hill-Start Assist Control (HAC), with models that were equipped with the optional Toyota Racing Development (TRD) Off-Road package. DAC automatically applies braking during downhill descents while HAC prevents the vehicle from rolling backwards on hills. A rear locking differential, or limited-slip differential were also some optional features. Every Tacoma was manufactured with a composite inner bed that includes a deck rail system with four tie down cleats, hook-pins, storage boxes. TRD package equipped Tacomas also feature an in-bed 115V/400W AC power outlet. <b>The</b> <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> cleats are rated to hold up to 220 lb.|$|E
50|$|Standing martingale: A {{design with}} one strap {{that runs from}} the girth or the chest and {{attaches}} to the noseband of the bridle. The standing martingale acts on the horse's nose and creates an absolute limit to how high a horse can raise its head. The term used in western riding for this piece of equipment is <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>down.</b> Standard adjustment of a standing martingale allows enough slack to bring the strap to the horse's throatlatch when the animal has its head in a relaxed, natural position. However, it is sometimes adjusted shorter. Unlike the running martingale, it limits {{the freedom of the}} horse's head, no matter how long or short the reins may be. While standing martingales are common in show hunter and equitation classes, the limits placed on the horse's movement are dangerous for cross-country riding or show jumping. Therefore, in these disciplines, a running martingale is necessary for safety reasons, if a martingale is used at all.|$|E

40|$|From {{the failure}} pattern, it appears most {{probable}} {{that the main}} fitting subassembly of the main landing gear has fractured during a heavy landing. Multiple fatigue cracks were observed at the crack initiation region. These cracks were very shallow having depth of about 0. 6 mm. The fatigue cracks {{do not appear to}} be the primary reason for the failure in the present case. However, this needs to be examined by assessing the intensity of the impact forces in the last landing. No mechanical and/or metallurgical abnormalities were responsible for the fatigue crack initiation and fatigue appears to be stress related. The region below <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> shackle support lug on the AFT is vulnerable for fatigue crack initiation and the crack initiation is accelerated if the aircraft goes through a series of heavy landings...|$|E
40|$|Question: How {{does one}} tie down {{items that are}} put into the bed {{of a pickup truck}} without causing damage to the body of the truck and have the ring {{disappear}} as well as be flush with the body? Rationale: With the increase of pickup trucks on the road, {{there is a need to}} tie items down securely in the bed to keep the public safe while the vehicle is in motion, as well as when parked. In most pickup trucks there are post/pole holes built into the bed that allows the users to put in either tie down anchors or pole/post made from wood. The problem with <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> anchors is that they either fold/slide to attach items to the truck, but they all sit on top of the body. This doesn’t allow the driver to place items on top of the trucks bed, give the driver the option to put the ring away, and have weight restrictions; thus requiring a device for these tasks. Over the past year a device has been proposed, designed, and built to do these tasks, as well as offer features that other tie down anchors do not have. The results have shown that this device is able to do the task it is required to do; thus allowing this device to compete with the current benchmarks out in the market...|$|E
40|$|On July 18, 1996, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) resumed {{shipping}} {{spent fuel}} in interstate commerce after a 10 year suspension of this activity. This shipment was conducted using a Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensed spent fuel transport package purchased from General Electric Company by ORNL {{for the purpose}} of moving High Flux Isotope Reactor spent fuel to the Savannah River Site. The trailer, fabricated to the ANSI N 14. 30, Semi-Trailers Employed in the Highway Transport of Weight Concentrated Radioactive Loads Design, Fabrication, and Maintenance, has recently undergone its first scheduled in-service inspection. This paper presents the experience gained from interpretation and application of the ANSI N 14. 30 standard focusing on the in-service inspection for the structure of the trailer. Initially, the term weight concentrated is illustrated giving detail to the location and center of gravity of the 33, 500 pound shipping container and forces induced by <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> system. Basic information about the design stresses and initial testing provided by the manufacturer are used as a lead-in to the requirements of the standard. The task of examining the trailer structure provided many lessons and required considerable effort. All of the support personnel were provided by ORNL; the garage mechanics and the certified inspection engineers had never been involved in applying ANSI N 14. 30. Other obstacles were the lack of existing inspection procedures for this particular activity and the lack of a previous experience interpreting the standard with regard to repair work. Some of these questions were resolved by clarification received from the writers of the standard, and others were resolved by the teamwork between the manufacturer and ORNL. This experience illustrated the importance of the trailer manufacturer as a participant in the decisions made concerning in-service inspection and maintenance...|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear {{coupling}} problems {{between the}} multiple bodies or between the mooring/riser and the offshore platform are {{incorporated in the}} CHARM 3 D-MultiBody, a fully coupled time domain analysis program for multiple bodies with moorings and risers. The nonlinear spring connection module and the three dimensional beam module are added to appropriately solve the structural connection problem. The nonlinear spring connection module includes the hydro-pneumatic tensioner module with the friction & stick/slip implementation, the tendon/mooring disconnection (breakage/unlatch) module with the tendon down-stroke check, and the contact spring with the initial gap with the friction force implemented. The nonlinear coupling may happen in many places for the offshore floating structures, such as hydro-pneumatic tensioner, tendon of TLP down stroke at the bottom joint, stick-slip phenomena at <b>the</b> <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> of the derrick {{and most of the}} fender-to-steel or steel-to-steel contact problem with initial gap during the installation. The mooring/tendon broken and unlatch can be a nonlinear connection problem once the transient mode is taken into account. Nonlinearity of the stiffness and friction characteristics of the tensioner combined with stick-slip behavior of riser keel joint is investigated. The relationship between tensions and strokes for hydro-pneumatic tensioner is based on the ideal gas equation where the isotropic gas constant can be varied to achieve an optimum stroke design based on tensioner stiffness. A transient effect of tendon down-stroke and disconnection on global performance of ETLP for harsh environmental condition is also investigated by incorporating the nonlinear boundary condition of the FE tendon model in CHARM 3 D. The program is made to be capable of modeling the tendon disconnection both at the top and the bottom connection as well as the down stroke behavior for the pinned bottom joint. The performance of the tie-down clamp of derrick is also investigated by using six degrees of freedom spring model and the three(3) dimensional FE beam model. The coupling of the TLP motion with the reaction force at the tie-down clamp is considered by using exact nonlinear dynamic equations of the motion with the reaction forces modeled with the spring or FE beam model. The method reduces too much conservatism when we design the tie-down system by the conventional method, in which all the environmental forces are combined without the phase lag effect between them. The FE beam model is also applied to the connectors between the semisubmersible and the truss for the pre-service and in-place conditions to be verified with the model test results, which shows good agreements...|$|E

40|$|The {{weakness}} of <b>the</b> <b>tying</b> <b>down</b> systems between <b>the</b> structural elements {{has been identified}} as the main cause of the failure of light roof structures due to uplifting pressure from the wind. These weaknesses have caused part of the roof structure being blown off during thunderstorms. This project report presents the results of a study carried out to evaluate the load carrying capacities of joints for zinc/asbestos sheeting to purlin, purlin to rafter and rafter to roof beam in the frame structure for light roof construction. The capacities of these joints were determined from laboratory tests on respective samples and also from previous related tests. Comparisons were made with the calculated pressures from the wind and hence the pulling out forces exerted on each type of joint on modeled buildings representing the low and high rise houses located areas similar to those which experienced failure. Details of the structural configuration and types of joints adopted were within the range found in actual construction. The result show that <b>the</b> number of <b>tying</b> <b>down</b> points between members within a specified area of roof and the depth of penetration of the nails at three points currently adopted are inadequate. They are only sufficient to sustain forces exerted by the wind speeds of up to wind speeds of up to 10 m/s and 50 m/s in low and high rises building respectively. It was also proposed that the pitches between purlin and also between rafters in the present construction be reduced in order to achieve more connection points...|$|R
