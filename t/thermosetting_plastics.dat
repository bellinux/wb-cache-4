500|$|Most polymers, {{sometimes}} referred to as resins, may be used, including all thermoplastics, some thermosets, and some elastomers. Since 1995, the total number of available materials for injection moulding has increased at a rate of 750 per year; there were approximately 18,000 materials available when that trend began. [...] Available materials include alloys or blends of previously developed materials, so product designers can choose the material with the best set of properties from a vast selection. [...] Major criteria for selection of a material are the strength and function required for the final part, as well as the cost, but also each [...] material has different parameters for moulding that must be taken into account. Common polymers like epoxy and phenolic are examples of <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastics</b> while nylon, polyethylene, and polystyrene are thermoplastic. Until comparatively recently, plastic springs were not possible, but advances in polymer properties make them now quite practical. Applications include buckles for anchoring and disconnecting the outdoor-equipment webbing.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{computer}} components can be reused in assembling {{new computer}} products, {{while others are}} reduced to metals that can be reused in applications as varied as construction, flatware, and jewelry. Substances found in large quantities include epoxy resins, fiberglass, PCBs, PVC (polyvinyl chlorides), <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastics,</b> lead, tin, copper, silicon, beryllium, carbon, iron, and aluminium. Elements found in small amounts include cadmium, mercury, and thallium.

50|$|Spin casting, {{also known}} as {{centrifugal}} rubber mold casting (CRMC), is a method of utilizing centrifugal force to produce castings from a rubber mold. Typically, a disc-shaped mold is spun along its central axis at a set speed. The casting material, usually molten metal or liquid <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic,</b> is then poured in through an opening at the top-center of the mold. The filled mold then continues to spin as the metal solidifies or the <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> sets.|$|R

5000|$|Duroplast is a {{composite}} <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastic,</b> a close relative of formica and bakelite. It is a resin plastic reinforced with fibers (either cotton or wool) making it a fiber-reinforced plastic similar to fiberglass.|$|R
5000|$|Synthetic resins are {{of several}} classes. Some are {{manufactured}} by esterification or soaping of organic compounds. Some are <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastics</b> {{in which the}} term [...] "resin" [...] is loosely applied to the reactant or product, or both. [...] "Resin" [...] may be applied {{to one of two}} monomers in a copolymer, the other being called a [...] "hardener", as in epoxy resins. For <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastics</b> that require only one monomer, the monomer compound is the [...] "resin". For example, liquid methyl methacrylate is often called the [...] "resin" [...] or [...] "casting resin" [...] while in the liquid state, before it polymerizes and [...] "sets". After setting, the resulting PMMA is often renamed acrylic glass, or [...] "acrylic". (This is the same material called Plexiglas and Lucite).|$|E
5000|$|In electronics, potting is {{a process}} of filling a {{complete}} electronic assembly with a solid or gelatinous compound for resistance to shock and vibration, and for exclusion of moisture and corrosive agents. <b>Thermosetting</b> <b>plastics</b> or silicone rubber gels are often used. Many sites recommend using silicone or epoxy to protect from impact and loose wires. [...] Araldite (a brand name) potting compound has been suggested for certain automotive applications.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thermosetting</b> <b>plastics</b> cure by a {{chemical}} reaction between two resins. The resins must be mixed immediately {{before they are}} injected into a mold. The mixing {{can be done by}} impingement mixing, where two streams to collide at high velocity in a mixing chamber. As soon as the mixing chamber is full, a piston immediately pushes the mixed resin into the mold, leaving very little mixed resin curing outside the mold.|$|E
5000|$|Ensure proper bonding to the resin matrix, thus {{allowing}} for transfer of shear loads {{from the glass}} fibers to the <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic.</b> Without this bonding, the fibers can 'slip' in the matrix, causing localized failure.|$|R
5000|$|CR-39, or allyl diglycol {{carbonate}} (ADC), is {{a plastic}} polymer {{commonly used in}} the manufacture of eyeglass lenses.

25|$|Thermoplastics can be {{remelted}} and reused, and <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastics</b> can {{be ground}} up {{and used as}} filler, although {{the purity of the}} material tends to degrade with each reuse cycle. There are methods by which plastics can be broken down to a feedstock state.|$|R
50|$|<b>Thermosetting</b> <b>plastics</b> are {{generally}} stronger than thermoplastic materials {{due to the}} three-dimensional network of bonds (crosslinking), and are also better suited to high-temperature applications up to the decomposition temperature since they keep their shape as strong covalent bonds between polymer chains cannot be easily broken. The higher the crosslink density and aromatic content of a thermoset polymer, the higher the resistance to heat degradation and chemical attack. Mechanical strength and hardness also improve with crosslink density, although {{at the expense of}} brittleness.|$|E
50|$|The PHT 1.6 has a {{yellowish}} color. It is {{resistant to}} solvents at pH > 3, but decomposes into monomers within a day in acidic solutions at pH < 2. This property is unusual for <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastics</b> and allows easy recycling. This PHT has a Young's modulus exceeding 10 GPa, which is among the highest for a thermosetting plastic; it can be further increased by ~50% by dispersing carbon nanotubes in the polymer. The PHT is brittle, and cracks when strained to 1%. Upon heating, it softens at a glass transition temperature of ~190 °C and decomposes at ~300 °C.|$|E
5000|$|A {{contactor}} {{has three}} components. The contacts are the current carrying {{part of the}} contactor. This includes power contacts, auxiliary contacts, and contact springs. The electromagnet (or [...] "coil") provides the driving force to close the contacts. The enclosure is a frame housing the contacts and the electromagnet. Enclosures are made of insulating materials such as Bakelite, Nylon 6, and <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastics</b> to protect and insulate the contacts and to provide some measure of protection against personnel touching the contacts. Open-frame contactors may have a further enclosure to protect against dust, oil, explosion hazards and weather.|$|E
50|$|A key {{step in the}} {{development}} of synthetic plastics was the introduction of a <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> known as Bakelite phenolic in 1910. Within two years, phenolic resin was applied to plywood as a coating varnish. In the early 1930s, phenolics gained importance as adhesive resins.|$|R

40|$|Improved {{joining method}} uses wave-soldering {{techniques}} developed for integrated-circuit-board assemblies. <b>Thermosetting</b> <b>plastic</b> {{is replaced by}} wave soldering, which applies a thin even coat of solder to mating copper surfaces. This is done after ink holes and channels have been protected by water-soluble, high-temperature solder mask which prevents wetting and clogging...|$|R
50|$|This type of {{deformation}} is irreversible. However, {{an object}} in the plastic deformation range will first have undergone elastic deformation, which is reversible, so the object will return part way to its original shape. Soft thermoplastics have a rather large plastic deformation range as do ductile metals such as copper, silver, and gold. Steel does, too, but not cast iron. Hard <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastics,</b> rubber, crystals, and ceramics have minimal plastic deformation ranges. An example of a material with a large plastic deformation range is wet chewing gum, which can be stretched dozens of times its original length.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electric}} arc {{over the surface}} of plastics causes their degradation. A conductive carbon-rich track tends to form in the arc path, negatively influencing their insulation properties. The arc susceptibility is tested according to ASTM D495, by point electrodes and continuous and intermittent arcs; it is measured in seconds required to form a track that is conductive under high-voltage low-current conditions. Some materials are less susceptible to degradation than others. For example, polytetrafluoroethylene has arc resistance of about 200 seconds (3.3 minutes). From <b>thermosetting</b> <b>plastics,</b> alkyds and melamine resins are better than phenolic resins. Polyethylenes have arc resistance of about 150 seconds; polystyrenes and polyvinyl chlorides have relatively low resistance of about 70 seconds. Plastics can be formulated to emit gases with arc-extinguishing properties; these are known as arc-extinguishing plastics.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thermoset</b> <b>plastic</b> {{polymers}} characterised by rigid, three-dimensional {{structures and}} high molecular weight, {{stay out of}} shape when deformed and undergo permanent or plastic deformation under load, and normally decompose before melting. Thermoset elastomers, which are soft and springy or rubbery and can be deformed and revert to their original shape on loading release, also decompose before melting. Conventional <b>thermoset</b> <b>plastics</b> or elastomers therefore cannot be melted and re-shaped after they are cured which implies that thermosets cannot be recycled for the same purpose, except as filler material. There are developments however involving thermoset epoxy resins which on controlled and contained heating form crosslinked networks that can be repeatedly reshaped like silica glass by reversible covalent bond exchange reactions on reheating above the glass transition temperature. There are also thermoset polyurethanes shown to have transient properties and which can thus be reprocessed or recycled.|$|R
