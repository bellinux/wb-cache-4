25|$|Diazepam {{can absorb}} into plastics, so liquid {{preparations}} {{should not be}} kept in plastic bottles or syringes, etc. As such, it can leach into the plastic bags and tubing used for intravenous infusions. Absorption appears to depend on several factors, such as temperature, concentration, flow rates, and <b>tube</b> <b>length.</b> Diazepam should not be administered if a precipitate has formed and does not dissolve.|$|E
25|$|Tube length: heat {{exchangers}} are usually cheaper {{when they have}} a smaller shell diameter and a long <b>tube</b> <b>length.</b> Thus, typically there is an aim to make the heat exchanger as long as physically possible whilst not exceeding production capabilities. However, there are many limitations for this, including space available at the installation site and the need to ensure tubes are available in lengths that are twice the required length (so they can be withdrawn and replaced). Also, long, thin tubes are difficult to take out and replace.|$|E
30|$|Step 3 : Try to {{determine}} {{the value of the}} connecting <b>tube’s</b> <b>length</b> l_c. Since the air in the connecting tube is considered as a lumped mass, the connecting <b>tube’s</b> <b>length</b> l_c is not {{more than half of the}} wavelength. Taking into account the influence of the tube wall, the connecting <b>tube’s</b> <b>length</b> l_c should not be significantly less than its diameter. So the connecting <b>tube’s</b> <b>length</b> l_c is recommended for r < l_c< 4 r.|$|R

25|$|The {{fundamental}} difference of these whistles from those described above {{is that there}} are now two sets of characteristic variables. For the driving source, the characteristic speed is U, and the characteristic dimension is L1. For the responding source, the characteristic speed is c0 and the characteristic dimension is L2, typically the corrected cavity depth or <b>tube</b> <b>length.</b> The non dimensional descriptors for each of these are the fluid mechanical Strouhal number and the acoustical Strouhal number. The tie between these two numbers is the commonality of the frequency.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> {{determines whether}} the tube {{acoustic}} pressure or velocity {{is the dominant}} influence on {{the frequency of the}} tube. Simple models of organ pipe resonance is based on open-open pipe resonance (λ=) but corrections must be made to take into account that one end of the pipe radiates into the surrounding medium and the other radiates through a slit with a jet flow. Boelkes and Hoffmann have made measurements of end correction for open-open tubes and derived the relation δ=0.33D. This cannot be exact since the driving end is not open.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the gauze was heated with a Bunsen burner; later, a wire grid was heated electrically. The heat {{transferred}} to {{the air in the}} tube sets it into near half-wave resonance if the gauze is placed below the midpoint of the tube as shown in the figure on the right. There is no theoretically optimum position, as the wave speed upward is c0+u, the convection speed, while the wave speed downward is c0−u. Without a convection flow, the midpoint and the lower tube end are the best locations for heat transfer. With convection, a compromise position halfway between the two points is normally chosen which depends on the amount of heat added. One characteristic length associated with frequency is <b>tube</b> <b>length</b> L.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} PipeProbe, {{a mobile}} sensor system {{for determining the}} spatial topology of hidden water pipelines behind walls. PipeProbe works by dropping a tiny wireless sensor capsule into {{the source of the}} water pipelines. As the PipeProbe capsule traverses the pipelines, it gathers and transmits pressure and angular velocity readings. Through spatio-temporal analysis on the sensor readings, our algorithm locates all turning points in the pipelines and maps their 3 D spatial topology.

40|$|In this {{preliminary}} effort, {{we use a}} commercially available and chemically modified tube to selectively capture circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from the blood stream by immobilizing human anti-EpCAM antibodies on the tube's interior surface. We describe the requisite and critical steps required to modify a tube into a cancer cell-capturing device. Using these sim-ple modifications, {{we were able to}} capture or entrap about 85 % of cancer cells from suspen-sion and 44 % of cancer cells from spiked whole blood. We also found that the percentage of cells captured was dependent on the <b>tube's</b> <b>length</b> and also the number of cancer cells pres-ent. It is our strong belief that with the utilization of appropriate <b>tube</b> <b>lengths</b> and procedures, we can ensure capture and removal of nearly the entire CTC population in whole blood. Importantly after a patient’s entire blood volume has circulated through the tube, the tube can then be trypsinized to release the captured live CTCs for further analysis and testing...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The {{influence}} of atmospheric humidity and free water on germination and germ tube growth of Botrytis cinerea Pers. ex Fr. was studied. Relative humidities (RH) were maintained inside insulated humidity chambers with sulfuric acid solutions {{of the appropriate}} concentrations. Insulation was necessary to {{reduce the incidence of}} condensation caused by temperature fluctuations. Any condensation occurring during incubation at humidities above 90 % RH was detected with ink dust on filter paper. Conidia were dusted on dialysis membranes and placed at humidities of 70, 90, 94, and 98 % RH. Samples removed after 12, 24, 36, and 60 hr were compared to controls that had been placed in distilled water (dH₂O). Conidia germinated in the control but not at any RH tested. Further studies were conducted {{to determine whether or not}} free water was necessary throughout the germination process.
