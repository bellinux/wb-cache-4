5|$|But strategically, Smith {{was most}} {{associated}} with his implementation of John McLendon's four corners offense, {{a strategy for}} stalling with a lead {{near the end of}} the game. Smith's teams executed <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>corners</b> set so effectively that in 1985 the NCAA instituted a shot clock to speed up play and minimize ball-control offense. Although fellow Kansas alum John McLendon actually invented <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>corners</b> offense, Smith got credit for utilizing it in games. Smith was also the author of Basketball: Multiple Offense and Defense, which is the best-selling technical basketball book in history.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, US163 was {{designated}} along SR464 in Arizona and SR47 in Utah {{as part of}} a re-alignment of U.S. highways in <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Corners</b> region. With the re-alignment, US160 was re-routed into Arizona instead of Utah. US163 also absorbed the former route of US160 to its former terminus at Interstate 70 at Crescent Junction. In 1981, AASHTO approved a new iteration of U.S. Route 191 that absorbed much of the alignment of US163. Utah truncated US163 at Bluff. The truncation was made without approval from AASHTO, as the AASHTO logs placed the northern terminus of US163 at I-70 at Crescent Junction.|$|E

This type of castle, {{with a central}} {{courtyard}} and buildings against the curtain wall, was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century.

There are circular towers at each of <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>corners,</b> with square central towers in the south, east, and west walls. The main entrance is a twin-towered gatehouse in the north face of the castle. There is a second entrance from the south; the postern gate is through a square tower {{in the middle of the}} south wall. The towers are three storeys high, taller than the curtain walls and the buildings in the castle which are two storeys high.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{deterioration}} of the wood of the exterior balconies over time, Queen RanavalonaII commissioned James Cameron to reinforce and encase the original structure in a stone shell in 1867. Cameron's exterior replaced the wooden balconies with stone walls three stories high. On each of the three floors, seven arched windows run the length of the two longer side walls while five windows illuminate the shorter front and back walls. A square tower stands at each of <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>corners</b> of the stone shell, extending above the level of the walls and forming their junction. A clock and bells were installed in the north-eastern tower.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} hours of February10, 2009, a strong, {{middle and upper}} storm system moved across <b>the</b> <b>Four</b> <b>Corners</b> region into the central and southern Great Plains. A moist, low-level air mass streamed northward across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased throughout {{the afternoon}} across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Cooling aloft, {{in conjunction with the}} approaching storm system, led to atmospheric instability, resulting in thunderstorms. A very strong wind field increased with height through the lower troposphere, resulting in a wind shear favorable for rotation in the thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth grew camellias {{in every}} one of her gardens, and before her flag-draped coffin was taken from Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an {{arrangement}} of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top.

Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard at <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>corners</b> of the catafalque.
