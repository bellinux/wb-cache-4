40|$|Background: Endometriosis is {{a complex}} disease that can result in {{substantial}} morbidity, including chronic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. There are contradictory reports regarding the connection between acute and chronic stress and magnesium levels in body fluids. Subjects and methods: A prospective study included 87 patients undergoing laparoscopy. The study group included 40 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometriosis and <b>the</b> control group consisted of 47 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> other causes of infertility. The levels of fright were determined using HAMA scale. The measurements of Mg levels were performed using biochemical analyzer “Monarch Plus”. Results: One day before the operation, HAMA score was 9. 54 ± 7. 34 in <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometriosis, and 6. 69 ± 5. 51 in <b>the</b> <b>women</b> without endometriosis. <b>The</b> morning before the operation, HAMA score was 8. 64 ± 8. 10 in <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometriosis, and 4. 29 ± 2. 29 in <b>the</b> <b>women</b> without endometriosis. <b>The</b> second postoperative day, HAMA score was 8. 96 ± 7. 60 in <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometriosis and 6. 92 ± 5. 16 in <b>the</b> <b>women</b> without endometriosis. Higher HAMA score in <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometriosis, {{in comparison with the}} control group, in all three time periods has been found, but the differences were not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). A negative correlation between the concentration of Mg in peritoneal fluid and HAMA score was found in the control group (p< 0. 01). Conclusions. In infertile women without endometriosis a correlation between Mg concentration in peritoneal fluid and HAMA score was found. No such correlation was found in <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> endometriosis, possibly due to a systemic disorder in endometriosis that might affect Mg transport through the cell membrane...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} if behavioural factors, other than sexual, differ between <b>women</b> <b>with</b> cervical human papillomavirus infection (CHPI) {{and those with}} genital warts (GW). DESIGN [...] A structured, personal in-depth interview which included details on sexual behaviour, hygiene, gynaecological complaints, and demographical characteristics and a gynaecological examination which included vaginal culture and human papillomavirus (HPV) typing with Southern blot. SUBJECTS [...] Women (n = 972) who had attended two family planning clinics and one youth clinic for contraceptive advice. RESULTS [...] Out of this female population 66 (6. 8 %) {{were found to have}} CHPI, 39 (4. 0 %) had genital warts (GW), and 30 (3. 1 %) women reported genital warts within the last two years. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> CHPI had had significantly less education, were more often immigrants, had a vaginal flora change more frequently and were more often smokers than <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> GW. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> GW reported lower abdominal pain significantly more often, had a leucocyte dominance in the vaginal secretion more often and favoured bathing in a bathtub more than <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> CHPI.

25|$|When {{compared}} to the results achieved with a silicone-gel breast implant, the saline implant can yield acceptable results, of increased breast-size, smoother hemisphere-contour, and realistic texture; yet, it is likelier to cause cosmetic problems, such as the rippling and the wrinkling of the breast-envelope skin, accelerated lower breast pole stretch, and technical problems, such {{as the presence of}} the implant being noticeable to the eye and to the touch. The occurrence of such cosmetic problems is likelier in the case of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> very little breast tissue, {{and in the case of}} the woman who requires post-mastectomy breast reconstruction; thus, the silicone-gel implant is the technically superior prosthetic device for breast augmentation, and for breast reconstruction.

40|$|Primary Sjögren´s {{syndrome}} (primary SS) is {{a systemic}} autoimmune rheumatic disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltrations in the exocrine glands leading to classic dryness complaints such as dry eyes and dry mouth. Non-exocrine complaints also occur, e. g. fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia, {{as well as}} disturbed mood. The overall purpose of this work was, from a physiotherapeutic perspective, to investigate {{the consequences of the}} disease on body function, activity and participation in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> primary SS, in order to obtain a knowledge base suitable for physiotherapeutic interventions. The purpose was also to evaluate the effect of an exercise programme. The first study included 43 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> primary SS and 44 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> fibromyalgia (FMS), who, {{with the exception of one}} <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> primary SS, also participated in the second study together <b>with</b> 59 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In these two studies musculoskeletal pain and learned helplessness (I) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (II) were evaluated. It was found that musculoskeletal pain was prevalent in most of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> primary SS and that the prevalence of FMS was increased in this group compared with the general population. Patients with primary SS, classified according to the American-European Consensus Criteria, had less pain than patients classified according to the Copenhagen criteria. Learned helplessness did not differ between <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> primary SS and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> FMS. HRQoL, according to SF- 36, was decreased in <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> primary SS, FMS or RA compared with normal data for Swedish <b>women.</b> <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> primary SS tended to score better on the physical scales and worse on the mental scales than <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> RA. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> FMS scored worse on all scales. Poor HRQoL was associated with a higher level of pain in <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> primary SS. <b>The</b> third study included 51 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> primary SS and 51 age- and gender- matched control subjects. Components of physical capacity, anxiety, depression and fatigue were investigated. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> primary SS had a slightly to moderately decreased physical capacity and a higher level of anxiety, depression and fatigue than the control subjects. Aerobic capacity was associated <b>with</b> fatigue in <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> primary SS as were also anxiety, depression and activity limitation according to HAQ. In the fourth study a fatigue questionnaire, the Profile of Fatigue (ProF), specifically designed for patients with primary SS, was translated from English to Swedish and evaluated regarding reliability and validity. Seventy patients with primary SS and 48 control subjects participated in the validation process. Two experienced rheumatologists judged the content of the questionnaire. The ProF was found to be sufficiently reliable and valid for the assessment of fatigue in primary SS. In the fifth study, 21 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> primary SS (one women also had mild systemic erythematosus) were allocated to either a 12 -week aerobic exercise programme or to a flexibility programme. Aerobic capacity, fatigue, anxiety, depression and HRQoL were evaluated. After 12 weeks, aerobic capacity, fatigue as measured with a visual analogue scale and depression were significantly improved in the aerobic exercise group compared with flexibility exercise group, while no differences were found in anxiety, HRQoL or fatigue as measured with the ProF. I found in these five studies that musculoskeletal pain was a common symptom in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> primary SS. HRQoL was reduced and was associated with pain intensity. Components of physical capacity were slightly to moderately decreased and associated with fatigue. Aerobic capacity, fatigue and depression were alleviated by an aerobic exercise programme. The ProF is reliable and valid for the measurement of fatigue in primary SS. The sensitivity to change and responsiveness are however unclear and further testing is required in this respect. From these findings I conclude that physiotherapeutic interventions such as methods for pain relief and aerobic exercise may be useful in the treatment of patients with primary SS...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. Pregestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (PGDM) represents glucose intolerance that begins before pregnancy and {{is followed by}} the increased risk of neonatal and maternal complications. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish neonatal outcome in pregnancies with pregestational {{diabetes mellitus}} and the factors that had influence on it. Methods. This study included 27 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>with</b> insulin-dependant PGDM hospitalized during 2004 in the Institute for Obstretics and Gynecology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade. The control group consisted of 2 292 healthy pregnant <b>women</b> presented to <b>the</b> Institute within 2004. Results. Twenty-three (85 %) infants of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> PGDM had complications in comparison with 356 (15. 5 %) infants of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> in <b>the</b> control group, that was statistically significant difference (p < 0. 001).

The aim of our study was to analyse a predictive role of IL- 1 α as an additional marker of pregnancy after {{in vitro fertilization}} (IVF). The study included 120 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> tubo-peritoneal infertility subjected to the IVF procedure. Retrospectively, two groups were formed of this cohort, dependent on efficiency of in vitro fertilization. Group I included 40 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> successful pregnancy whereas group II comprised 80 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> failed pregnancy. IL- 1 α concentrations in serum were detected by ELISA technique. A polymorphic rs 1800587 marker at 5 `UTR region has been amplified by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing.
