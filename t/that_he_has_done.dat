25|$|The {{plots and}} subplots of the episodes are {{established}} in an outline written by David, and the dialogue is largely improvised by the actors (a technique known as retroscripting). As with Seinfeld, which David co-created, {{the subject matter}} in Curb Your Enthusiasm often involves the minutiae of American daily social life, and plots often revolve around Larry David's many faux pas and his problems with certain social conventions and expectations, {{as well as his}} annoyance with other people's behavior. The character has a hard time letting such annoyances go unexpressed, which often leads him into awkward situations. He is also routinely the victim of elaborate misunderstandings wherein other characters believe <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> something morally terrible or disgusting.|$|E

25|$|Ardās is {{a unique}} prayer {{based on the fact}} that it is one of the few {{well-known}} prayers in the Sikh religion that was not written in its entirety by the Gurus. The Ardās cannot be found within the pages of the Guru Granth Sahib because it is a continually changing devotional text that has evolved over time in order for it to encompass the feats, accomplishments, and feelings of all generations of Sikhs within its lines. Taking the various derivation of the word Ardās into account, the basic purpose of this prayer is an appeal to Waheguru for his protection and care, as well as being a plea for the welfare and prosperity of all mankind, and a means for the Sikhs to thank Waheguru for all <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Jack's fiftieth {{birthday}} is approaching {{and he has}} received home movies {{of some of his}} earlier birthdays from his mother, Collen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). While watching the tapes, Jack discovers just how happy he was when he was younger, and is determined to reclaim that happiness and innocence. After examining a list he made while he was younger, he discovers <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> all of the things but one, befriending Batman. Thus, he arranges for actor Adam West, who played Batman, to come to his birthday party. At the party, however, West calls Jack by the wrong name, leading him to realize that he is in fact unhappy, despite his accomplishments. [...] In an effort to reclaim his happiness, Jack attempts to find the same toy that made him so happy on his tenth birthday, a model of an Apollo Lunar Module. He buys one from a vintage toy store, but still remains unhappy.|$|E
500|$|Homer's catchphrase, the annoyed grunt [...] "D'oh!", is {{typically}} uttered when he injures himself, realizes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> something stupid, or when something bad has happened or {{is about to}} happen to him. During the voice recording session for a Tracey Ullman Show short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an [...] "annoyed grunt". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out [...] "d'ooooooh". This was inspired by Jimmy Finlayson, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. Finlayson had used the term as a minced oath to stand in for the word [...] "Damn!" [...] Matt Groening felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered [...] "D'oh!" [...] The first intentional use of D'oh! occurred in the Ullman short [...] "The Krusty the Clown Show" [...] (1989), and its first usage in the series was in the series premiere, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire".|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} also been noted for its strong sexual themes. Opening with an image of conception, the film then portrays Henry Spencer as a {{character}} who is terrified of, but fascinated by, sex. The recurring images of sperm-like creatures, including the child, are a constant presence during the film's sex scenes; the apparent [...] "girl next door" [...] appeal of the Lady in the Radiator is abandoned during her musical number as she begins to violently smash Spencer's sperm creatures and aggressively meets his gaze. David J. Skal, in his book The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror, has described the film as [...] "depict human reproduction as a desolate freak show, an occupation fit only for the damned". Skal also posits a different characterization of the Lady in the Radiator, casting her as [...] "desperately eager for an unseen audience's approval". In his book David Lynch Decoded, Mark Allyn Stewart proposes that the Lady in the Radiator is in fact Spencer's subconscious, a manifestation of his own urge to kill his child, who embraces him after he does so, as if to reassure him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> right.|$|E
500|$|After The Grand Duke, the {{partners}} {{saw no reason}} to work together again. A last unpleasant misunderstanding occurred in 1898. At the premiere of Sullivan’s opera The Beauty Stone on 28 May, Gilbert arrived at the Savoy Theatre with friends, assuming that Sullivan had reserved some seats for him. Instead, he was informed that Sullivan objected to his presence. The composer later denied that this was true. The last time they met was at the Savoy Theatre on 17 November 1898 at the celebration of the 21st anniversary of the first performance of The Sorcerer. They did not speak to each other. Sullivan, by this time in exceedingly poor health, died in 1900, although to the end he continued to write new comic operas for the Savoy with other librettists, most successfully with Basil Hood in The Rose of Persia (1899). Gilbert also wrote several works, some with other collaborators, in the 1890s. By the time of Sullivan's death in 1900, Gilbert wrote that any memory of their rift had been [...] "completely bridged over," [...] and [...] "the most cordial relations existed between us." [...] He stated that [...] "Sullivan ... because he was a composer of the rarest genius, was as modest and as unassuming as a neophyte should be, but seldom is...I remember all <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> for me in allowing his genius to shed some of its lustre upon my humble name." ...|$|E
500|$|When the Persians arrived off {{the coast}} of Lade and learned the number of Ionian ships, they began to worry {{that they would not be}} able to defeat the Greeks, and feared Darius's wrath should they fail. The Ionian tyrants who had been {{expelled}} at the beginning of the revolt were present, and according to Herodotus, they were now given instructions by the Persians: [...] "Men of Ionia, let each one of you now show <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> good service to the king's house; let each one of you try to separate your own countrymen from the rest of the allied power. Set this promise before them: they will suffer no harm for their rebellion, neither their temples nor their houses will be burnt, nor will they in any way be treated more violently than before. But if they will not do so and are set on fighting, then utter a threat that will restrain them: if they are defeated in battle, they will be enslaved; we will make eunuchs of their boys, and carry their maidens captive to Bactra, and hand over their land to others." [...] The tyrants thus sent messages to their own kinsman, but the Ionians refused the offers. Critically, each group thought that only they had been approached—there does not seem to have been any discussion of this offer between the different contingents, and the possibility for treachery does not seem to have been realised.|$|E

It is Valentine's Day, although the TGS cast and crew still have to work all night. Frank reveals that he hates Jenna when he always chooses to [...] "kill" [...] Jenna {{in a game of}} [...] "Marry, Boff, Kill". Frank believes that Jenna is [...] "phony", and Jenna tries many times to redeem herself with Frank, with reasons such as her participation in Vagina Day: [...] "a charity event founded by a group of celebrities who have for whatever reason never been asked to participate in The Vagina Monologues". Eventually, in her final confrontation with Frank, she farts, but Frank is happy, telling her that that is the first real thing she has done, and the two reconcile. Another game of [...] "Marry, Boff, Kill" [...] leads some of the writers into believing that Cerie (who has been having problems with her fiance Aris) has feelings for Kenneth when she chooses to [...] "boff" [...] him. The writers send the pair off to get candy for the night. Kenneth and Cerie take a walk around Rockefeller Center, and Cerie reveals that she is not attracted to Kenneth but tells him that he can tell the others that the two made out.

500|$|On November 27, 2008, Blagojevich {{hinted that}} Davis {{might be his}} choice. On December 6, the Chicago Tribune {{reported}} that Jackson was among the minority of potential candidates {{who had not been}} granted a meeting with Blagojevich on the subject, but two days later Blagojevich granted Jackson a meeting. [...] On December 9, the day after a 90-minute meeting that Jackson described as his first meeting with Blagojevich in years, the Rod Blagojevich federal corruption scandal became public when the Governor was arrested. On December 10, Jackson was contacted by federal prosecutors for questioning with regard to the scandal involving Governor Blagojevich's search for a replacement. [...] The press speculated that Jackson was [...] "Senate Candidate #5", for whom it is alleged by Blagojevich that emissaries offered up to a million dollars in exchange for the appointment. [...] Jackson, however, denies any wrongdoing, and says that the U.S. Attorney's office assured him that he is not a target of the investigation. [...] In a press conference, his lawyer confirmed his belief that Jackson is candidate No. 5, but asserted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>done</b> nothing wrong. [...] Immediately thereafter, in his own news conference, Jackson confirmed that he is a subject and not a target of the investigation and emphatically stated his opposition to [...] "pay to play" [...] politics. [...] On December 16, a Jackson spokesperson confirmed special federal investigators have been questioning him since the summer. [...] Also WLS-TV reported December 15 that Jackson has notified investigators that Blagojevich refused to appoint Sandi Jackson, his wife, as state lottery director because Jackson refused to donate $25,000 to the governor's campaign fund. Jackson spokesman Kenneth Edmonds clarified that although Jackson had been a federal informant for over a decade, never did his cooperation concern the current investigation into the Senate seat.|$|E
