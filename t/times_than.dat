5|$|South Africa {{have played}} four {{different}} sides in women's Test cricket, with England their most frequent opponent, having faced them in six Tests. The only side that South Africa have beaten in Test cricket are the Netherlands, who South Africa have played once, in 2007. South Africa have similarly faced England more <b>times</b> <b>than</b> {{any other team}} in women's One Day International cricket, playing 33 matches. As such, England have recorded the most victories against South Africa, beating them 25 times. South Africa have beaten Pakistan more <b>times</b> <b>than</b> any other country, triumphing on twelve occasions against them. In women's T20Is, South Africa have as well played England the most, and lost to them on thirteen occasions. South Africa have recorded the most victories against Ireland, beating them in nine of their meetings.|$|E

Guy Carbonneau, Jere Lehtinen and Pavel Datsyuk are tied for the second-most wins, with three apiece.|$|E
5|$|Upon his retirement, O'Gara held {{a number}} of honours and {{achievements}} at both club and international level. At the time, he had played for Ireland more <b>times</b> <b>than</b> any other player in history and had won nine trophies with Munster.|$|E

5|$|Acqua & Sapone rider Dario Andriotto set {{the early}} time to beat. After a while, Yuriy Krivtsov bested his time. Several {{different}} riders in succession then posted successively (but, {{in the first}} few cases, marginally) better <b>times</b> <b>than</b> the best time that had come before them. Alessandro Bertolini, David Millar, Marco Pinotti, Giovanni Visconti, Bradley Wiggins, and Stefano Garzelli were all briefly the stage leader after they crossed the finish line. Bertolini in particular was stage leader for about three minutes, as Millar started just behind him and barely beat his time.|$|E
5|$|Argentinian {{artists have}} won the award more <b>times</b> <b>than</b> any other nationality. Colombian singer-songwriter Juanes has won the most awards in the category, with three wins {{out of the same}} number of nominations. Mexican {{performers}} Alejandra Guzmán and Julieta Venegas are the only female singers to be awarded. Fito Páez and Luis Alberto Spinetta are the most nominated performers, with four nominations each. Draco Rosa became the last recipient of the award in 2009, for the album Teatro.|$|E
5|$|Tubenoses have smaller egg {{clutches}} {{and much}} {{longer and more}} variable incubation and fledging <b>times</b> <b>than</b> passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling swifts in these developmental factors. Tubenoses and swifts have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. In the particular case of the storm petrel, it has a body temperature perhaps 3°C lower than other small birds, and this may {{also contribute to the}} lengthy incubation.|$|E

5|$|Wayne Gretzky won {{the award}} a record nine times during his career, eight consecutively. He {{has been named}} MVP more <b>times</b> <b>than</b> any other player {{in the history of}} the other three North American major {{professional}} leagues (Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association, and National Football League). Barry Bonds is second, having won the MVP award seven times in the MLB. Gretzky and his Edmonton Oilers teammate Mark Messier are the only players to win the Hart Trophy with more than one team.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which habitable planets are more likely at some <b>times</b> <b>than</b> at others. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.|$|E

5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 more <b>times</b> <b>than</b> {{any other}} number, {{it is not}} straightforward to quantify exactly how many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; {{no matter how many times}} it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; it is one of the axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E
5|$|An {{advantage}} held by Eurostar is {{the convenience}} {{and speed of}} the service: with shorter check-in <b>times</b> <b>than</b> at most airports and hence quicker boarding and less queueing and high punctuality, it takes less time to travel between central London and central Paris by high-speed rail than it does by air. Eurostar now has a dominant share of the combined rail–air market on its routes to Paris and Brussels. In 2004, it had a 66% share of the London–Paris market, and a 59% share of the London–Brussels market. In 2007, it achieved record market shares of 71% for London–Paris and 65% for London–Brussels routes.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira {{has been}} mistakenly called {{the founder of}} Jainism. Jains believe that there were 23 {{teachers}} before the Mahavira, and they believe that Jainism was founded in far more ancient <b>times</b> <b>than</b> that of the Mahavira, whom they revere as the 24th Tirthankara. The first 22 Tirthankaras are placed in mythical times. For example, the 22nd Tirthankara Arishtanemi is believed in the Jain tradition {{to have been born}} 84,000 years before the 23rd Tirthankara named Parshvanatha. Mahavira is sometimes placed within Parshvanatha lineage, but this is contradicted by all Jain texts, which state that Mahavira renounced the world alone.|$|E

5|$|Since {{they began}} playing {{football}} in 1995, the Panthers {{have been to}} four NFC Championship Games; they lost two (1996 and 2005) and won two (2003 and 2015). The Panthers have won six division championships: the NFC West championship in 1996 and the NFC South championship in 2003, 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2015. They are {{the first and only}} team to win the NFC South back to back and have won the NFC South more <b>times</b> <b>than</b> any other team in the division. They have finished as runners-up in their division six times, finishing second-place in the NFC West in 1997 and 1999 and finishing second-place in the NFC South in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2012. They have qualified for the playoffs 7 times, most recently in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Swifts as {{a family}} have smaller egg {{clutches}} and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging <b>times</b> <b>than</b> passerines with similarly sized eggs, resembling tubenoses in these developmental factors. Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents; they can cope with not being fed {{for long periods of}} time, and delay their feather growth when undernourished. Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. These adaptations mean that when conditions are good, the survival rate is very high. One large Yellow Sea colony had hatching success of 73.5%, with 63.6% of the chicks fledging. The average productivity was 1.24fledged young per pair per year.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens {{have won}} the Stanley Cup more <b>times</b> <b>than</b> any other franchise.

On a percentage basis, as of 2014, the franchise has won 25.3% of all Stanley Cup championships contested after the Challenge Cup era, making it the second most successful professional sports team of the traditional four major sports of Canada and the United States, behind only the Boston Celtics.|$|E

Mexican ensembles have received the award more <b>times</b> <b>than</b> any other nationality, though award-winning albums have also been performed by musicians originating from Chile, Colombia and Panama. Molotov and La Ley has won the most awards in the category, with two wins each. Natalia y La Forquetina, the short-lived band of Mexican singer-songwriter Natalia Lafourcade, is the only band led by a woman to be awarded. Spanish band Jarabe de Palo is the most nominated ensemble without a win, with three unsuccessful attempts.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{has been}} in use for many years but, {{given the number of}} people buried in such a small area, the bodies are no longer decomposing properly. They have begun to overflow and fall into the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning fresh produce rotten in far shorter <b>times</b> <b>than</b> natural and tainting the breath of those who live there. Baratte finds that he has both friends and enemies in the area – the cemetery is both loved and hated by the people of the district. He finds resistance from all sides, notably Ziguette who strikes Baratte during his sleep in opposition to his work. He befriends the church's flamboyant organist named Armand, recruits his old colleague Lecoeur to assist with the excavation, is monitored by the infamous Guillotin and falls in love with Heloïse, widely known in the area as a whore.|$|E
5|$|The free {{element is}} {{remarkable}} for its robustness, especially {{the fact that}} it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered, melting at 3422°C (6192°F, 3695K). It also has the second highest boiling point, at 5930°C (10706°F, 6203K). Its density is 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 <b>times)</b> <b>than</b> that of lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.|$|E
