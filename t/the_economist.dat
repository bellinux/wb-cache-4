5|$|The {{balanced}} growth theory {{is an economic}} theory pioneered by <b>the</b> <b>economist</b> Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959).

5|$|According to <b>The</b> <b>Economist,</b> Apollo {{succeeded in}} {{accomplishing}} President Kennedy's goal {{of taking on}} the Soviet Union in the Space Race, and beat it by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement, and thereby showcased {{the superiority of the}} capitalistic, free-market system as represented by the US. The publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal, the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast, centralized government bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>economist</b> Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles were {{generally}} euphoric {{about the end}} of the era of communist rule and Soviet domination.

5|$|British {{forces in}} Haifa redeployed on 21 April 1948, {{withdrawing}} {{from most of}} the city while still maintaining control over the port facilities. Two days later the downtown, controlled by a combination of local and foreign (ALA) Arab irregulars was assaulted by Jewish forces in Operation Bi'ur Hametz, by the Carmeli Brigade of the Haganah, commanded by Moshe Carmel.

40|$|Authorities in {{a number}} of countries, {{including}} Australia, have become increasingly concerned about the serious threats to {{public health and the environment}} arising from exposure to hazardous wastes. While economists can provide essential information to policymakers regarding the lifesaving benefits of regulatory controls of toxins, certain problems arise from using <b>the</b> <b>economist’s</b> preferred method as a basis for policy assessment. One problem concerns the appropriate measure of risk to use in estimating the benefits of reducing environmental risks. Another concerns the possibility that use of <b>the</b> <b>economist’s</b> technique of benefit assessment may result in policies which do not maximise the number of lives saved. This paper attempts to clarify the issues and to defend <b>the</b> <b>economist’s</b> approach from ill-informed criticism. ...|$|R
