5|$|By 1944 it {{was fairly}} routine {{practice}} for Stavka to assign its operating fronts new and more ambitious missions while the Soviet Armed Forces were conducting major offensive operations. The rationale was that relentless pressure might trigger a German collapse. For the 1943/1944 winter campaign, Stalin ordered the Red Army to conduct major offensives along the entire Soviet-German front in {{a continuation of the}} 'Broad Front' strategy he had pursued {{since the beginning of the}} war. This was applied in consonance with his long-standing rationale that, if the Red Army applied pressure along the entire front, German defences were likely to break in at least one section. The Soviet winter campaign included major assaults across the entire expanse the front in <b>the</b> <b>Ukraine,</b> Belorussia and against the German Panther Line in the region of the Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|In South Asia {{the golden}} jackal inhabits Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In Central Asia it inhabits Tadjikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

In Southwestern Asia it inhabits Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. In Europe it inhabits Albania, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, the Baltic states, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Turkey, and <b>the</b> <b>Ukraine.</b> It has been sighted in Belarus, the Czech Republic, and Germany.

On 18 June, the Geschwaderstab relocated to Hostynne, from where on 22 June 1941, Lützow led JG3 in combat against the Soviet Union. At {{the start of the}} campaign, JG3 was subordinated to the V. Fliegerkorps (5th Air Corps), under command of General der Flieger Robert Ritter von Greim, which was part of Luftflotte 4 (4th Air Fleet), under command of Generaloberst Alexander Löhr.

5|$|In the men's events, the Korean team shot 12 maximum {{scores of}} 10 {{to win the}} gold medal against Chinese Taipei 251-245. Losing by two points, the United States failed to fend of <b>the</b> <b>Ukraine</b> team to capture the bronze. The event causing the most upset however was the men's individual, the only event that the Korean team has never won and yet again failed to clinch. Defending {{champion}} Simon Fairweather was ousted from the competition in a first round loss due to blustery weather conditions. The wind caused some archers like Fairweather to make one-point shots, and its strength even caused others to miss their targets completely. The final matches of this event also saw competitors coming close in score, with Italian Marco Galiazzo beating the Japanese Hiroshi Yamamoto by only two points to win gold. Even closer still was the bronze medal match, in which Britain's Laurence Godfrey was outshot 112-113 by seventeen-year-old Australian Tim Cuddihy, who himself only managed {{to get into the}} semifinals by one point.|$|E
