40|$|Hemorrhoidal {{disease is}} a very common and {{widespread}} disease, and {{it is estimated that}} about one subject out of three may suffer from this pathology. Hemorrhoids generally cause symptoms when enlarged, inflamed, <b>thrombosed,</b> or prolapsed. <b>Internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> arise above the dentate line (in comparison to external hemorrhoids - perianal phlebothrombosis) and are covered by transitional or columnar epithelium.

40|$|Hemorrhoids {{are normal}} {{vascular}} structures underlying the distal rectal mucosa and anoderm. Symptomatic hemorrhoidal tissues located above the dentate line {{are referred to}} as <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> and produce bleeding and prolapse. Thrombosis in external hemorrhoids results in painful swelling. Symptomatic <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> that fail bowel management programs may be amenable to in-office treatment with rubber band ligation or infrared coagulation. <b>Internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> that fail to respond to these measures or complex internal and external hemorrhoidal disease may require a surgical hemorrhoidectomy, either open or closed. A stapled hemorrhoidopexy treats symptomatic <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> and should be employed with care and only after thorough training of the surgeon because of the risk of rare, severe complications. The choice of procedure should be based on the patient's symptoms, the extent of the hemorrhoidal disease, and the experience of the surgeon...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{retrospectively}} studied 43 patients {{suspected of}} having <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> at double-contrast barium enema examination. At endoscopy, 24 patients (56 %) had <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids,</b> four (9 %) had other pathologic lesions in the rectum without evidence of hemorrhoids, and 15 (35 %) had no reported abnormalities in the rectum. <b>Internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> were found at endoscopy in 10 of 20 patients (50 %) with lobulated folds extending 3 cm or less from the anorectal junction and 10 of 13 patients (77 %) with multiple submucosal nodules.

50|$|Hemorrhoids are {{typically}} diagnosed by physical examination. A visual {{examination of the}} anus and surrounding area may diagnose external or prolapsed hemorrhoids. A rectal exam may be performed to detect possible rectal tumors, polyps, an enlarged prostate, or abscesses. This examination {{may not be possible}} without appropriate sedation because of pain, although most <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> are not associated with pain. Visual confirmation of <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> may require anoscopy, insertion of a hollow tube device with a light attached at one end. The two types of hemorrhoids are external and internal. These are differentiated by their position with respect to the dentate line. Some persons may concurrently have symptomatic versions of both. If pain is present, the condition {{is more likely to be}} an anal fissure or an external hemorrhoid rather than an <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoid.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> usually {{present with}} painless, bright red rectal {{bleeding}} during or following a bowel movement. The blood typically covers the stool (a condition known as hematochezia), {{is on the}} toilet paper, or drips into the toilet bowl. The stool itself is usually normally coloured. Other symptoms may include mucous discharge, a perianal mass if they prolapse through the anus, itchiness, and fecal incontinence. <b>Internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> are usually only painful if they become thrombosed or necrotic.|$|R
50|$|Hemorrhoids are fed by {{arteries and}} drained by veins. The {{arterial}} blood supply {{is based on}} the superior rectal (hemorrhoidal) artery. Just as veins in the leg weaken and become prominent, hemorrhoidal veins also may become varicose, resulting in <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> or “piles”. <b>Internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> are divided into four grades. Grade I hemorrhoids are composed of prominent vessels, without protrusion. Grade II hemorrhoids demonstrate prolapse upon straining, with spontaneous reduction.

40|$|Background and objectives: Bleeding from {{hemorrhoids}} is the commonest {{cause of}} rectal bleeding in adults. Injection sclerotherapy of <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> {{is one of}} the non-surgical treatments, and is simple, safe and feasible. Conventionally sclerotherapy is performed with rigid proctoscope which has limitations of maneuverability, narrower field of vision and documentation compared to flexible videoendoscope. Therefore, we assessed the efficacy and safety of video-colonoscopic sclerotherapy for bleeding internal hemorrhides. Methods: Seventy-nine patients of bleeding <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> were subjected to colonoscopic sclerotherapy using 1. 5 % polidocanol in retroflexed or forward viewing positions. Success of treatment was defined as cessation of bleeding for six weeks. Patients were observed for complications and were followed up regularly for 3 months. Results: A total of 79 evaluable patients, 61 had grade II and 18 had grade III hemorrhoids. There was no statistically significant differences in achieving excellent or good results for control of bleeding between patients with grade II and grade III hemorrhoids (100 % vs 94, 5 %; p> 0. 05). The number of sessions of sclerotherapy required were significantly more in grade II than grade III hemorrhoids (1. 1 ± 0. 3 vs 1. 3 ± 0. 7; p = 0. 04). No significant complications were noted except for bloating in ten patients (12. 6 %) and rectal pain in 6 (7. 6 %) patients. Median time taken for the procedure was 30 minutes.

40|$|Injection {{therapy has}} a long history of being used for the treat-ment of hemorrhoids. However, the {{previous}} results on injec-tion therapy for its complication rates and severity were not promising [1]. In this respect, aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) therapy could be a new promising option for the treatment of <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> [2]. However, some complications have been reported for ALTA therapy [3]. Thus, the learning of a precise surgical procedure and careful selec-tion of the patients are vital. In addition, over-dosage and injec-tion at an inappropriate location or depth frequently lead to se-rious complications. Application of ALTA therapy for the treat-ment of <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids</b> may be a good choice, but still its efficacy for the treatment of external hemorrhoids and skin tags is limited. Thus, the surgeon should consider combined therapy (a hemorrhoidectomy and ALTA therapy) for the treat-ment of mixed hemorrhoids. Even though ALTA therapy has better treatment results than PAO therapy, well-controlled sur-gery and patient selection are still needed.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{long-term}} outcome of endoscopic hemorrhoid ligation (EHL) {{for the treatment}} of symptomatic <b>internal</b> <b>hemorrhoids.</b> METHODS: A total of 759 consecutive patients (415 males and 344 females) were enrolled. Clinical presentations were rectal bleeding (593 patients) and mucosal prolapse (166 patients). All patients received EHL at outpatient clinics. Hemorrhoid severity was classified by Goligher&#x 2019;s grading. The mean follow-up period was 55. 4 mo (range, 45 - 92 mo). RESULTS: The number of band ligations averaged 2. 35 in the first session for bleeding and 2. 69 for prolapsed patients. Bleeding was controlled in 587 (98. 0 %) patients, while prolapse was reduced in 137 (82. 5 %) patients. After treatment, 93 patients experienced anal pain and 48 patients had mild bleeding. Patient subjective satisfaction was 93. 6 %. Repeat treatment or surgery was performed if symptoms were not relieved in the first session. In the bleeding group, the recurrence rate was 3. 7 % (22 patients) at 1 year, and 6. 6 % and 13. 0 % at 2 and 5 years. In the prolapsed group, the recurrence rate was 3. 0 %, 9. 6 % and 16. 9 % at 1, 2 and 5 years, respectively.

This method has been carried out prospectively in which 50 patients who were treated with rubber band ligation and 50 patients with Ultroid were compared according to the incidence of complications, post-operative pain and treatment response. According to this study complete success rate with Ultroid was 82 % and partial success rate was 10 % and no response to treatment was seen in 8 %. In Rubber Band method the complete response rate was 94 % (P= 0. 2). With Ultroid, 74 % of patient reported no postoperative pain, 24 % reported mild and moderate pain and 2 % of patients complained of severe pain.
