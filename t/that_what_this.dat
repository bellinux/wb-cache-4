500|$|Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV deemed [...] "Funk" [...] {{a bridge}} between [...] "Theatricality" [...] and the season finale, writing: [...] "It feels like the episode got itself in a funk, and when things get close to being awesome, it pulls back."

60|$|What these {{opinions}} came to, roughly speaking, {{was something}} to this effect: That the power alike of statesmen and of publicists {{over the course of}} affairs is strictly limited; that institutions and movements are not capable of immediate or indefinite modification by any amount of mere will; that political truths are always relative, and never absolute; that the test of practical, political, and social proposals is not their conformity to abstract ideals, but to convenience, utility, expediency, and occasion; that for the reformer, considerations of time and place may be paramount; and finally, as Mill himself has put it, that government is always either in the hands, or passing into the hands, of whatever is the strongest power in society, and <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> power is, and shall be, depends less on institutions than institutions depend upon it. If I were pressed for an illustration of these principles at work, inspiring the minds and guiding the practice of responsible statesmen in great transactions of our own day and generation, I should point to the sage, the patient, the triumphant action of Abraham Lincoln in the emancipation of the negro slaves. However that may be, contrast a creed of this kind with the abstract, absolute, geometric, unhistoric, peremptory notions and reasonings that formed the stock in trade of most, though not quite all, of the French revolutionists, alike in action and in thought. It is plain that they are the direct opposite and contradictory of one another.|$|E
6000|$|They, {{who have}} best succeeded on the stage, [...] Have still {{conformed}} their genius to their age. [...] Thus Jonson did mechanic humour show, [...] When men were dull, and conversation low. [...] Then comedy was faultless, but 'twas coarse: [...] Cobb's tankard was a jest, and Otter's horse[1]. [...] And, as their comedy, their love was mean; [...] Except, by chance, in some one laboured scene, [...] Which must atone for an ill-written play. [...] They rose, but at their height could seldom stay. [...] Fame then was cheap, {{and the first}} comer sped; [...] And they have kept it since, by being dead. [...] But, were they now to write, when critics weigh [...] Each line, and every word, throughout a play, [...] None of them, no not Jonson in his height, [...] Could pass, without allowing grains for weight. [...] Think it not envy, that these truths are told; [...] Our poet's not malicious, though he's bold. [...] 'Tis not to brand them, that their faults are shown, [...] But, by their errors, to excuse his own. [...] If love and honour now are higher raised, [...] 'Tis not the poet, but the age is praised. [...] Wit's now arrived to a more high degree; [...] Our native language more refined and free. [...] Our ladies and our men now speak more wit [...] In conversation, than those poets writ. [...] Then, one of these is, consequently, true; [...] <b>That</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> poet writes comes short of you, [...] And imitates you ill (which most he fears), [...] Or else his writing is not worse than theirs.

6000|$|If I am asked, what {{system of}} {{political}} philosophy I substituted for that which, as a philosophy, I had abandoned, I answer, No system: only {{a conviction that}} the true system was something much more complex and many-sided than I had previously had any idea of, and that its office was to supply, not a set of model institutions, but principles from which the institutions suitable to any given circumstances might be deduced. The influences of European, that is to say, Continental, thought, and especially those of {{the reaction of the}} nineteenth century against the eighteenth, were now streaming in upon me. They came from various quarters: from the writings of Coleridge, which I had begun to read with interest even before the change in my opinions; from the Coleridgians with whom I was in personal intercourse; from what I had read of Goethe; from Carlyle's early articles in the Edinburgh and Foreign Reviews, though for a long time I saw nothing in these (as my father saw nothing in them to the last) but insane rhapsody. From these sources, and from the acquaintance I kept up with the French literature of the time, I derived, among other ideas which the general turning upside down of the opinions of European thinkers had brought uppermost, these in particular: That the human mind has a certain order of possible progress, in which some things must precede others, an order which governments and public instructors can modify to some, but not to an unlimited extent: that all questions of political institutions are relative, not absolute, and that different stages of human progress not only will have, but ought to have, different institutions: that government is always either in the hands, or passing into the hands, of whatever is the strongest power in society, and <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> power is, does not depend on institutions, but institutions on it: that any general theory or philosophy of politics supposes a previous theory of human progress, and that this is the same thing with a philosophy of history. These opinions, true in the main, were held in an exaggerated and violent manner by the thinkers with whom I was now most accustomed to compare notes, and who, as usual with a reaction, ignored that half of the truth which the thinkers of the eighteenth century saw. But though, at one period of my progress, I for some time undervalued that great century, I never joined in the reaction against it, but kept as firm hold of one side of the truth as I took of the other. The fight between the nineteenth century and the eighteenth always reminded me of the battle about the shield, one side of which was white and the other black. I marvelled at the blind rage with which the combatants rushed against one another. I applied to them, and to Coleridge himself, many of Coleridge's sayings about half truths; and Goethe's device, [...] "many-sidedness," [...] was one which I would most willingly, at this period, have taken for mine.|$|E

6000|$|Oh what a {{crossing}} for the straighteners {{and the old}} brown dress--which latter appurtenance {{the child}} saw thriftily revived for the possible disasters of travel! The wind {{got up in the}} night and from her little room at the inn Maisie could hear the noise of the sea. The next day it was raining and everything different: this was the case even with Susan Ash, who positively crowed over the bad weather, partly, it seemed, for relish of the time their visitor would have in the boat, and partly to point the moral of the folly of coming to such holes. In the wet, with Sir Claude, Maisie went to the Folkestone packet, on the arrival of which, with many signs of the fray, he made her wait under an umbrella by the quay; whence almost ere the vessel touched, he was to be descried, in quest of their friend, wriggling--that had been his word--through the invalids massed upon the deck. It was long till he reappeared--it was not indeed till every one had landed; when he presented the object of his benevolence in a light that Maisie scarce knew whether to suppose the depth of prostration or the flush of triumph. The lady on his arm, still bent beneath her late ordeal, was muffled in such draperies as had never before offered so much support to so much woe. At the hotel, an hour later, this ambiguity dropped: assisting Mrs. Wix in private to refresh and reinvest herself, Maisie heard from her in detail how little she could have achieved if Sir Claude hadn't put it in her power. It was a phrase that in her room she repeated in connexions indescribable: he had put it in her power to have [...] "changes," [...] as she said, of the most intimate order, adapted to climates and occasions so various as to foreshadow in themselves the stages of a vast itinerary. Cheap weeks would of course be in their place after so much money spent on a governess; sums not grudged, however, by this lady's pupil, even on her feeling her own appearance give rise, through the straighteners, to an attention perceptibly mystified. Sir Claude in truth had had less time to devote to it than to Mrs. Wix's; and moreover she would rather be in her own shoes than in her friend's creaking new ones {{in the event of an}} encounter with Mrs. Beale. Maisie was too lost in the idea of Mrs. Beale's judgement of so much newness to pass any judgement herself. Besides, after much luncheon and many endearments, the question took quite another turn, to say nothing of the pleasure of the child's quick view that there were other eyes than Susan Ash's to open to what she could show. She couldn't show much, alas, till it stopped raining, which it declined to do that day; but this had only the effect of leaving more time for Mrs. Wix's own demonstration. It came as they sat in the little white and gold salon which Maisie thought the loveliest place she had ever seen except perhaps the apartment of the Countess; it came while the hard summer storm lashed the windows and blew in such a chill that Sir Claude, with his hands in his pockets and cigarettes in his teeth, fidgeting, frowning, looking out and turning back, ended by causing a smoky little fire to be made in the dressy little chimney. It came in spite of something that could only be named his air of wishing to put it off; an air that had served him--oh as all his airs served him!--to the extent of his having for a couple of hours confined the conversation to gratuitous jokes and generalities, kept it on the level of the little empty coffee-cups and petits verres (Mrs. Wix had two of each!) that struck Maisie, through the fumes of the French fire and the English tobacco, as a token more than ever that they were launched. She felt now, in close quarters and as clearly as if Mrs. Wix had told her, <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> lady had come over for was not merely to be chaffed and to hear her pupil chaffed; not even to hear Sir Claude, who knew French in perfection, imitate the strange sounds emitted by the English folk at the hotel. It was perhaps half an effect of her present renovations, as if her clothes had been somebody's else: she had at any rate never produced such an impression of high colour, of a redness associated in Maisie's mind at THAT pitch either with measles or with [...] "habits." [...] Her heart was not at all in the gossip about Boulogne; and if her complexion was partly the result of the déjeuner and the petits verres it was also the brave signal of what she was there to say. Maisie knew when this did come how anxiously it had been awaited by the youngest member of the party. [...] "Her ladyship packed me off--she almost put me into the cab!" [...] That was what Mrs. Wix at last brought out.|$|E
