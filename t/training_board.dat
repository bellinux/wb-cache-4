[...] On the other hand, the Mountain Leader <b>Training</b> <b>Board,</b> composed of educators, was in favour on grounds of safety and teaching environmental awareness. Eventually a compromise was reached with the two bodies combining and a Mountain Leadership Certificate becoming required for educational expeditions.|$|E
