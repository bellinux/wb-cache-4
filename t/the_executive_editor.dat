25|$|For many years, {{he wrote}} a monthly column for the {{bodybuilding}} magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 {{a year to the}} Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California. Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>editor</b> role in 2005.

500|$|Radical Middle Newsletter proved controversial. [...] Many responded {{positively}} to Satin's new direction. [...] A professor of management, for example, wrote that unlike Satin's former newsletter, Radical Middle spoke about [...] "reality". [...] Scholarly books began citing the newsletter. [...] In {{a book on}} globalization, Walter Truett Anderson said Radical Middle [...] "carries the encouraging news of an emerging group with a different voice, one that is 'nuanced, hopeful, adult'.... It is essentially a willingness to listen to {{both sides of the}} argument." [...] But three objections were often heard. [...] Some critics accused Satin of misguided policy proposals, as when peace studies scholar Michael N. Nagler wrote that the article [...] "praising humanitarian military intervention as the 'peace movement' of our time, is nothing short of an insult... to the real peace movement" [...] [...] Other critics accused Satin of abandoning his old constituency, as when author and former New Options advisor David Korten chided him for consciously choosing pragmatism over idealism. [...] There were also accusations of elitism, as when <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>editor</b> of Yes! [...] magazine said Satin favored globalization because it appealed to his interests and those of his [...] "law school buddies".|$|E
500|$|Tropic Thunder was {{the first}} major studio {{production}} on Kaua'i in five years. After filming was completed, it was deemed the largest production filmed on the island to date, and contributed more than $60 million to the local economy. Tim Ryan, <b>the</b> <b>executive</b> <b>editor</b> of Hawaii Film & Video Magazine, commented on the filming on the island: [...] "I think Tropic Thunder will give Kaua'i much needed and long idled publicity in the production arena ...It should put Kaua'i back on the production consideration radar." [...] Preliminary production crews were on the island starting in December 2006 and principal photography began in July 2007, with filming lasting thirteenweeks over sevenseparate locations on the island. Much of the filming took place on private land as well as conservation status designated areas. Casting calls on the island sought 500 residents to portray the villagers in the film. Two units shot simultaneously on the island from the ground, and an aerial unit shot from helicopters. Many of the sets and the bridge used for one of the final scenes were built in three months. The island's erratic weather hampered filming with rain and lighting issues. The crew also faced complications in moving the equipment and cast due to the difficult terrain.|$|E
