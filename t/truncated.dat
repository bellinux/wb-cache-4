5|$|By January2017, NY220 was <b>truncated</b> {{from the}} home to the {{junction}} with NY12 in Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Further {{stations}} have <b>truncated</b> platforms, usually with access {{only to the}} leading car to facilitate accessibility.|$|E
5|$|The International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy {{maintains}} a standard global field model called the International Geomagnetic Reference Field. It is updated every 5 years. The 11th-generation model, IGRF11, was developed {{using data from}} satellites (Ørsted, CHAMP and SAC-C) and a world network of geomagnetic observatories. The spherical harmonic expansion was <b>truncated</b> at degree 10, with 120 coefficients, until 2000. Subsequent models are <b>truncated</b> at degree 13 (195 coefficients).|$|E
5|$|Topologically, the Pythagorean tiling has {{the same}} {{structure}} as the <b>truncated</b> square tiling by squares and regular octagons. The smaller squares in the Pythagorean tiling are adjacent to four larger tiles, as are the squares in the <b>truncated</b> square tiling, while the larger squares in the Pythagorean tiling are adjacent to eight neighbors that alternate between large and small, just as the octagons in the <b>truncated</b> square tiling. However, the two tilings have different sets of symmetries, because the <b>truncated</b> square tiling is symmetric under mirror reflections whereas the Pythagorean tiling isn't. Mathematically, this {{can be explained by}} saying that the <b>truncated</b> square tiling has dihedral symmetry around the center of each tile, while the Pythagorean tiling has a smaller cyclic set of symmetries around the corresponding points, giving it p4 symmetry. It is a chiral pattern, meaning {{that it is impossible to}} superpose it on top of its mirror image using only translations and rotations.|$|E
5|$|A former SH-8A {{connected}} {{the highway to}} the town of Geronimo. When SH-8 was <b>truncated</b> to Cyril in 1966, it became SH-281A.|$|E
5|$|Four {{other state}} routes once entered Hamilton County, {{but no longer}} do. Two of these routes—NY80 and NY365—were simply <b>truncated</b> out of the county, while two others—NY10A and NY54—no longer exist.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{the highway}} was <b>truncated</b> as the {{terminus}} was scaled back to M-125 in Monroe. Finally on October 4, 2006, {{the section of}} M-50 between M-125 and US24 was also removed, shortening the highway by about a mile (1.9km).|$|E
5|$|In the process, Highway62 was <b>truncated</b> {{at the new}} bypass; the removed {{section was}} redesignated Highway148, giving it the same number as the route in Quebec that it served {{to connect with the}} Trans-Canada Highway.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{overlaps}} {{were eliminated}} {{as time went}} on. In the early 1940s, NY32A was reassigned to another highway in the Catskill Mountains while NY32B was <b>truncated</b> to end in Hudson Falls. The former routing of NY32A became a realignment of NY32, creating an uninterrupted overlap between US4 and NY32 from Waterford to Northumberland. In the mid-1950s, work began on a project to upgrade a pre-existing riverside highway between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville. The project was completed by 1958, at which time the roadway became part of a realigned US4. The overlap with NY40 was eliminated in the late 1950s when NY40 was <b>truncated</b> to begin at the junction of US4 and Winter Street.|$|E
5|$|NY 8's {{southern}} terminus {{has been}} <b>truncated</b> to {{end at the}} northern terminus of its overlap with NY 10 by 2017.|$|E
5|$|NY178 was <b>truncated</b> eastward in {{the late}} 1960s to begin at NY3 west of Henderson. It was <b>truncated</b> westward to US11 in Adams on August1, 1979, after {{ownership}} and maintenance of NY178 between US11 and NY177 was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Jefferson County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The former routing of NY178 between Snowshoe Road and NY3 in the town of Henderson is now maintained by Jefferson County as CR178 while the section of old NY178 from US11 to NY177 is designated as CR189.|$|E
5|$|NY227 was {{extended}} north to Trumansburg {{in the early}} 1940s, replacing NY79, which was <b>truncated</b> south to its junction with NY227 in Perry City. NY79 was rerouted west of Mecklenburg in the early 1960s to end at NY414 near Watkins Glen. The realignment supplanted NY227 from Watkins Glen to Reynoldsville and utilized the old Route46 corridor from there to Mecklenburg. NY227 was <b>truncated</b> to its junction with NY79 south of Reynoldsville at this time.|$|E
5|$|On January1, 1949, NY31 was rerouted between Middleport and Medina to use NY31A {{between the}} two locations. NY31A was <b>truncated</b> to its current western {{terminus}} in Medina as a result. It was substantially extended , however, to a new eastern terminus in Brockport. The highway was rerouted east of Millville to follow a series of previously unnumbered roads through Barre and Clarendon to Monroe County, where it supplanted NY31D from the county line eastward. NY31A was <b>truncated</b> slightly to its current eastern terminus in the early 1980s after NY31 was rerouted to bypass Brockport {{to the west and}} south on NY31A and Redman Road.|$|E
5|$|On October 2, 2011, {{the entire}} cast of Arrested Development reunited for a panel at The New Yorker Festival in New York. At the panel, Hurwitz {{declared}} his intention {{of producing a}} <b>truncated</b> fourth season as a lead-in to a film adaptation.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, 1966, after {{over twenty}} years of cosignage, SH-32 was <b>truncated</b> to its current western {{terminus}} in Ryan. Everything west of Waurika was now solely US-70. After the truncation of 1966, SH-32 had the same route that it does today.|$|E
5|$|The (<b>truncated)</b> series {{can be used}} {{to compute}} {{function}} values numerically, (often by recasting the polynomial into the Chebyshev form and evaluating it with the Clenshaw algorithm).|$|E
5|$|The {{financial}} institution or processor that <b>truncated</b> the original check must follow ASCX9.100-140 {{standards in the}} capture of check images and MICR data when it produces the substitute check.|$|E
5|$|After US12 {{replaced}} US112, the Bus. US12 routes were renumbered as Business Loop I-94, {{and the two}} Bus. US112s were renumbered to Bus. US12. In 1966, {{the state}} <b>truncated</b> M-60 and removed it as a concurrent designation along US12 between New Buffalo and Niles.|$|E
5|$|As a state highway, M-44 {{dates back}} to around July 1, 1919, and it was routed along a section of its modern route at that time. The eastern end was altered in the late 1920s, and the western end was {{extended}} to the Grand Rapids area in the 1970s. For over 20years, M-44 was <b>truncated</b> to remove the M-37 concurrency. Since 2003 though, the highway has terminated at the intersection with 28th Street.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 1964 {{state highway}} renumbering, US6 was <b>truncated</b> at Bishop. The portion of US6 from Inyokern to Los Angeles was {{designated}} State Route 14. Previously the Route 14 designation was used for Artesia Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue, in the Los Angeles area, a portion of modern State Route 91.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1937, {{however, the}} highway's {{southern}} terminus had changed once again. On 1937-10-19, SH-8 had been <b>truncated</b> to Anadarko. However, on 1938-10-18, the route was extended back to the former southern terminus at Randlett; this change did not appear on the state map until the April 1941 edition. On 1941-04-14, the route was realigned to run through Cyril once again.|$|E
5|$|Dürer's {{well-known}} engraving Melencolia I {{depicts a}} frustrated thinker sitting by a <b>truncated</b> triangular trapezohedron and a magic square. These two objects, and the engraving as a whole, {{have been the}} subject of more modern interpretation than the contents of almost any other print, including a two-volume book by Peter-Klaus Schuster, and an influential discussion in Erwin Panofsky's monograph of Dürer.|$|E
5|$|His work {{features}} mathematical {{objects and}} operations including impossible objects, explorations of infinity, reflection, symmetry, perspective, <b>truncated</b> and stellated polyhedra, hyperbolic geometry, and tessellations. Although Escher {{believed he had}} no mathematical ability, he interacted with the mathematicians George Pólya, Roger Penrose, Harold Coxeter and crystallographer Friedrich Haag, and conducted his own research into tessellation.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{recession}} of the mid-1990s resulted in Highway 407 being <b>truncated</b> in Markham temporarily. Slightly revised plans for the links appeared on the June 2007 Technically Recommended Route Report for the extension of Highway407 to Highway35/115, which was submitted {{as part of the}} environmental assessment (EA) for the extension, but had been announced earlier that year on March7 by the Government of Canada, as part of an investment in Greater Toronto Area infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{the highway}} {{that is now}} M-99 was first signed as M-64 from the Ohio state line to Hillsdale and as M-34 from Hillsdale to the Litchfield area. In 1924, the western {{terminus}} of M-34 was extended to Homer where it terminated at M-60. Just a few years later, in 1926, the western terminus was <b>truncated,</b> to end at Hillsdale, with the remainder to Jonesville becoming {{an extension of the}} M-64.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{the state}} highway {{department}} completed {{enough of the}} Grand Rapids beltline to reroute M-21 to it. The former routing of M-21 was then redesignated Bus. M-21. With the completion of I-196 from Holland to Grand Rapids in 1974, the highway was <b>truncated</b> to its current format and renamed BS I-196.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, SH-19 was {{established}} through southern Caddo County, {{taking over the}} east–west section of SH-58. Thus, SH-58 was <b>truncated</b> to where it intersected with SH-19 (the present day western end of their concurrency). SH-58 was extended to its present terminus north of Hydro the next year. The highway was further extended in 1964, bringing the southern terminus to its present location near Medicine Park. No further routing changes have occurred since then.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{the section}} of M-69 east of Randville was decommissioned, and the {{concurrency}} with M-95 was removed. This <b>truncated</b> the highway to , approximately one-fifth of its previous length. The transfer to county control {{was part of a}} program to reduce the total state highway mileage in the state. After October 5, 1970, this section was renamed G-30 with the beginning of the County-Designated Highway program in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, {{when the}} I-96/US16/M-50 freeway was {{extended}} to the northwest in Grand Rapids, the old M-50 routing around the city became M-11 and M-50 was returned to its former alignment along Lake Michigan Drive and Fulton Street, supplanting Bus. M-50. In 1964, {{the western end of}} M-50 was <b>truncated</b> from its junction with US31 back to I-96 south of Lowell at exit52. The former alignment from exit40 to Agnew was given the M-45 designation.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, {{the section}} south of 11Mile Road near Royal Oak {{was removed from}} M-150; {{sections}} were rebuilt as part of I-75 and the rest {{was turned over to}} local control. The northern extension from the 1930s was removed in 1965 when the trunkline was shortened to end {{on the north side of}} Rochester at Tienken Road. The southern section was later <b>truncated</b> back to the current southern terminus at M-59 in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} NY210 between NY210 and the Rockland County line was transferred {{from the state of}} New York to Orange County. Two years later, all of NY210 in Rockland County was given to the county. NY210 was <b>truncated</b> to its current northern terminus in Greenwood Lake following the latter swap, eliminating the overlap with NY17A.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 renumbering, NY30 {{was largely}} {{assigned}} {{to its current}} alignment between the Hancock hamlet of East Branch and Wells, where it terminated at NY8. Past Wells, the modern alignment of NY30 was designated as NY8 to Spectator and as NY10 north to the Canada–US border. NY10 was <b>truncated</b> southward to NY8 in Arietta , at which time NY30 was extended north to Quebec along the former alignment of NY10.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the route was <b>truncated</b> to consist {{only of the}} portion east of the Hudson River. NY43's former routing west to Schoharie was redesignated NY443 as a result. NY43 was realigned {{slightly}} in the late 1990s to serve the new exit8 on I-90. Its former routing into Rensselaer on 3rd Avenue is now partly NY151 and unsigned NY915E.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, with ongoing {{construction}} and {{completion of the}} I-35W freeway in Minnesota, US8 was routed along I-35W; US8 was <b>truncated</b> again by 1981 to its current terminus in Forest Lake. The section in New Brighton is currently known as Old Highway 8.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1940s, US9 was rerouted {{to follow}} its modern {{alignment}} through Champlain, creating a lengthy overlap between NY348 and US9 from Chazy hamlet to Champlain village. The overlaps with both US9 and US11 were eliminated {{in the early}} 1960s after NY348 was <b>truncated</b> on its northern end to its junction with US9 in Chazy.|$|E
5|$|Judd makes {{a second}} visit to Cortez, {{indicating}} that {{he wishes to}} join the Palladists. In conversation, Judd unintentionally reveals that Jacqueline is staying with Mary at the rooming house. This makes the audience aware that the Palladists were able to trace Jacqueline to Mary's room to kidnap her. In the <b>truncated</b> theatrical print, how the Palladists found Jacqueline is left unclear.|$|E
