5|$|As the queen's son Radama grew to adulthood, {{he became}} {{increasingly}} disillusioned {{by the high}} death toll of his mother's military campaigns and traditional measures of justice, and was frustrated by her unilateral rejection of European influence. The young prince developed sympathetic relationships with the handful of Europeans permitted by Ranavalona to frequent her court, namely Jean Laborde and Joseph-Fran√ßois Lambert, with whom he privately concluded the lucrative Lambert Charter. The charter, which would come into effect upon Radama's accession to the throne, granted Lambert large tracts of land and exclusive rights to road construction, mineral extraction, <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> and other activities on the island. In May 1857, when Rainilaiarivony was 29 years old, Lambert consequently invited Prince Radama, Rainivoninahitriniony, Rainilaiarivony {{and a number of}} other officers to conspire with him in a plot to overthrow Ranavalona.|$|E

Most biological variables did not vary systematically with either <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> or downstream location. Dissolved organic carbon did not vary with <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> or downstream location, but correlated positively with salmonid abundance.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Japan is {{the biggest}} {{importer}} of tropical logs in the world, {{and most of them}} are from Southeast Asia. It is also a major offerer of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to this area. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the relationship between Japanese bilateral ODA to three Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia) and tropical <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> levels in these countries. Two different methods are applied: econometric timber market model analysis and the Granger causality test. Timber market model analysis shows a significant correlation between Japanese bilateral ODA and <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> levels in Indonesia and in Malaysia. It also shows a significant correlation between <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> levels in Malaysia and the number of new housing construction starts in Japan. There is no significant relationship for the Philippines. The Granger causality test shows clear evidence of causality from Japanese housing construction to <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> levels in Indonesia, and also to Japanese bilateral ODA to Indonesia. It shows evidence of causality from <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> levels in Malaysia to Japanese bilateral ODA to Malaysia, too. There are no causal effects among <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> levels in the Philippines, Japanese bilateral ODA to the Philippines, and Japanese housing construction. All of the results can be explained in a reasonable manner by considering political, economic, and forestry situations of the three Southeast Asian countries and Japan...|$|R

Relationships between regional <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> and forest products industry employment are identified, which are of some use in predicting employment changes due to changes in <b>timber</b> <b>harvest,</b> when harvest rather than the market is limiting industry production.
