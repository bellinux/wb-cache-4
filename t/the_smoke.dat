5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} fat content and storage {{temperature}} on the biochemical and organoleptic alterations taking place during storage of smoked sardine fillets (made from sardines which were stored {{for three and}} six months at − 18 °C prior to being <b>smoked</b> and <b>the</b> influence of such alterations on product storage life were studied). During storage at 1 °C, softening was the factor most affecting storage life in <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> batches made from sardine frozen for three months prior to smoking or from sardine with higher fat content. In contrast, rancidity was the primary factor limiting storage life in <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> batches made from sardine with lower lipid content and in the batches stored at − 18 °C. In <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> batches made from sardines with lower fat content frozen for six months prior to smoking, the level of oxidation in the raw material was the main factor limiting the storage life of <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> fillets; organoleptic rancidity was more perceptible in <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> fillets stored at − 18 °C on account of {{a sharp drop in}} smoked flavour.

40|$|The {{research}} was aimed {{to determine the}} effect of addition of kecombrang (Nicolaiaspeciosa Horan) extract at varied concentration on the quality of <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> catfish selais (Crytopterusbicirchis). The {{research was}} used experimental method and composed as randomized block design (RBD). The treatment was addition of kecombrangextract into the fish meat at different concentration, consisting of 4 levels, namely: catfish selais without the addition of kecombrang extracts (K₀), catfish selais with addition of kecombrang extracts 3 % (K 3), catfish selais with addition of kecombrang extracts 6 % (K 6) and catfish selais with addition of kecombrang extracts of 9 % (K 9). <b>The</b> <b>smoked</b> catfish products then were stored for 0 days, 15 days, 30 days and 45 days at room temperature. The results showed that the different concentrations of the kecombrang extract solution highly significantly affected to the organoleptic value (appearance, taste, aroma and texture), moisture content, total phenol, total acid, pH, antioxidant activity of <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> catfish produced, but significantly affected to the value of TBA.

40|$|The {{animation}} {{of volcanic}} smoke {{is useful for}} natural disaster simulations, entertainments, etc. In this paper, we propose a model to generate realistic animations of <b>the</b> volcanic <b>smoke.</b> <b>The</b> model is designed by taking the eruption magnitude decided by the eruption velocity and <b>the</b> initial volcanic <b>smoke</b> density, <b>the</b> buoyancy generated by the difference between <b>the</b> volcanic <b>smoke</b> density and <b>the</b> atmospheric density, and the decreasing of <b>the</b> volcanic <b>smoke</b> density due {{to the loss of}} the pyroclasts (fragments of magma); i. e., this model is based on the physical dynamics of <b>the</b> volcanic <b>smoke.</b> In this model, the Navier-Stokes equations are used, and we solve the equations by using the method of the Coupled Map Lattice (CML) that is an efficient solver. Hence, in our system, the behavior of <b>the</b> volcanic <b>smoke</b> can be calculated in practical calculation time, and various shapes of <b>the</b> volcanic <b>smoke</b> can be generated by only changing some parameters. Therefore, realistic volcanic smoke animations can be created by our approach efficiently. ...|$|R

5|$|The DNC {{objected to}} the loss of the {{mainmast}} as he believed that it was needed to support a boat-handling derrick, but was overruled by the Admiralty, which preferred to position the tripod foremast behind the forward funnel with the tripod legs facing forward to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable. The short height of the funnel also bedevilled the bridge with smoke until it was raised in 1912, although this exacerbated the problem for the spotting top. The decision to space the wing turrets more closely together also made <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> problem worse; because it reduced the space available to the aft boiler room which meant that the forward funnel had to accommodate the exhausts of a dozen boilers compared to the aft funnel's six, further increasing <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> from the forward funnel.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of the present study}} was to {{characterize}} the functional parameters of smoked soft cheese, with the emphasis on the behavior of water and milk fat, as analyzed by DSC, which was used to directly measure the melting/freezing phase transitions in the cheese. This study was complemented by NMR measurements of the organization and distribution of the aqueous phase within the emulsions constituting <b>the</b> cheese. <b>The</b> <b>smoked</b> and unsmoked cheeses were characterized by similar compositions in terms of protein (19. 08 - 19. 12 g∙ 100 g- 1), fat (18. 86 - 19. 02 g∙ 100 g- 1), and water content (59. 86 - 60. 27 g∙ 100 g- 1). The water activity was higher in the unsmoked cheese (aw = 0. 9736) than in <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> cheese (aw = 0. 9615). This result was confirmed by DSC (higher ice melting enthalpy) and NMR (higher T 1 value) measurements. The smoking process led to differences in the distribution and binding of water to the lipid-protein matrix of the cheese. There was more non-freezed bound water in <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> cheese which resulted in a more fragile and loosened structure in <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> cheese than <b>the</b> unsmoked, which manifested in lower values of stretching and meltability.

5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle.

5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> {{the commanders}} {{of the second}} line of Polish {{outposts}} {{could not see the}} approaching Russians and did not open fire. Contrary to the battle plan, the second line did not send reinforcements to the first.

The most important positions in the suburb of Wola received only token reinforcements from the main reserve and were forced to fight in isolation.|$|E
5|$|Despite its ferocity, {{the fire}} was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often {{overshot}} the infantry front lines—in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation—and <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly {{to create the illusion}} that they were being destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still blinded by <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment.
