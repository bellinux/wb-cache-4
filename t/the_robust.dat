5|$|A 2017 study {{indicates}} that juveniles were born with a robust build similar to the adults. Comparison of the bones of juvenile S. fatalis specimens from La Brea {{with those of the}} contemporaneous American lion revealed that the two cats shared a similar growth curve. Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards <b>the</b> <b>robust</b> direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} support <b>the</b> <b>robust</b> head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent scars. These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and flexion {{of the head and}} neck. Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all appeared to have been large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle scars), and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles of the head and neck. Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania probably would not have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{zoologist}} John Veron and {{his co-workers}} analyzed ribosomal RNA in 1996 to obtain similar results to Romano and Palumbi, again concluding that the traditional families were plausible but that the suborders were incorrect.

Veron suggested that both morphological and molecular systems be used in future classification schemes.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs of Patagosaurus {{are only}} based on three bones from the {{juvenile}} specimen, and no manual elements are preserved. The humeri are slender and elongate, lacking great proximal and distal expansions. The incomplete deltoid crest, only {{shows that it}} was wide, and likely had a projection below and behind. Like the humeri, the radius is slender, and lacks large expansions on either end. On the edge closest to the ulna, the radius possesses a ridge along its edge, which corresponds to where radioulnar ligaments would have attached. The ulna is complete, although sediment-filled breaks might have altered its original shape. The forelimb of Patagosaurus is much more gracile and different from <b>the</b> <b>robust</b> later sauropods like Camarasaurus, and Apatosaurus, and instead resembles more Diplodocus.|$|E

Moreover, in <b>the</b> standard <b>robust</b> optimality, <b>the</b> measure P̂ is chosen to be static and does not change with time. As a result, not all available information is taken into consideration, as shown for the Merton problem with logarithmic utility in Section 5.|$|R

5|$|Vanbrugh planned The Relapse, too, round these limited casting {{resources}} and minor talents, which Peter Holland has argued explains <b>the</b> <b>robust,</b> farcical {{character of the}} play; Vanbrugh's second comedy, The Provoked Wife (1697), written for the better actors of the cooperative company, is a much subtler piece.

It is known from Cibber's autobiography that Vanbrugh had a decisive say in the ongoing casting changes made during these seven months; it is not known whether he altered his text to accommodate them.|$|E
5|$|Like all azhdarchid pterosaurs, Hatzegopteryx was {{probably}} a terrestrially foraging generalist predator. It is significantly larger than any other terrestrial predator from Maastrichtian Europe; due to its large size in an environment otherwise dominated by island dwarf dinosaurs, with no large hypercarnivorous theropods in the region, {{it has been suggested}} that Hatzegopteryx played the role of an apex predator in the Haţeg Island ecosystem. <b>The</b> <b>robust</b> anatomy of Hatzegopteryx suggests that it may have tackled larger prey than other azhdarchids, including animals too large to swallow whole; similarly, some modern storks (particularly the marabou stork and the jabiru) are known to attack and kill large prey such as flamingoes, and occasionally children, with their beaks. Meanwhile, other giant azhdarchids like Arambourgiania would probably have instead fed on small prey (up to the size of a human), including hatchling or small dinosaurs and eggs. Another pterosaur, Thalassodromeus, has similarly been suggested to be raptorial.|$|E

5|$|Majungasaurus was {{the largest}} {{predator}} in its environment, while the only known large herbivores {{at the time were}} sauropods like Rapetosaurus. Scientists have suggested that Majungasaurus, and perhaps other abelisaurids, specialized on hunting sauropods. Adaptations to strengthen the head and neck for a bite-and-hold type of attack might have been very useful against sauropods, which would have been tremendously powerful animals. This hypothesis may also be supported by the hindlegs of Majungasaurus, which were short and stocky, as opposed to the longer and more slender legs of most other theropods. While Majungasaurus would not have moved as fast as other similar-sized theropods, it would have had no trouble keeping up with slow-moving sauropods. <b>The</b> <b>robust</b> hindlimb bones suggest very powerful legs, and their shorter length would have lowered the animal's center of gravity. Thus Majungasaurus may have sacrificed speed for power. Majungasaurus tooth marks on Rapetosaurus bones confirm that it at least fed on these sauropods, whether or not it actually killed them.|$|E
5|$|The {{blunt and}} short claws of Deinocheirus {{are similar to}} those of the therizinosaur Alxasaurus, which {{indicates}} the long arms and claws were used for digging and gathering plants. The blunt claws of the feet could have helped the animal from sinking into substrate when wading. <b>The</b> <b>robust</b> hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly. The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as Tarbosaurus, but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs. The long neural spines and possible tail fan may have been used for display behaviour. Deinocheirus was likely diurnal (active during the day), since the sclerotic rings of the eyes were relatively small in comparison with its skull length. The hand had good mobility relative to the lower arm, but was capable of only a limited flexing motion, unable to close in grasping.|$|E
5|$|Tracking west-northwestward {{and then}} westward along the {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Mekkhala was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC early on January 15, due to its slightly improved structure. Mekkhala quickly intensified {{on the next day}} due to improved conditions; the wind shear became in-phase with the storm's motion while <b>the</b> <b>robust</b> divergent outflow persisted. Therefore, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm at 06:00UTC on January16, and later that day the JTWC upgraded it to a typhoon, when a central dense overcast has significantly deepened and totally obscured the LLCC. Later, a microwave imagery revealed that Mekkhala formed a ragged eyewall structure. The system reached peak intensity at 00:00UTC on January 17 with ten-minute maximum sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph), although operationally the JMA estimated typhoon-force winds of 130km/h (80mph).|$|E
