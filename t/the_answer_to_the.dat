5|$|Faulkner's Dublin Journal, a {{newspaper}} established in 1725, featured many articles written by Swift or inspired by writings of Swift. Between 1727 and 1730, Faulkner published many works attributed to Swift, but many were actually written by others. After 1730, {{only one of}} those works printed by Faulkner under Swift's name {{turned out to be}} written by someone besides Swift, which suggests to some critics that Swift was working with Faulkner to ensure that only authentic works were printed under Swift's name. He was the first to publish <b>The</b> <b>Answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Craftsman, Swift's final defense of the Irish economy from England's policies. Faulkner was also the first to publish the collected Drapier's Letters as Fraud Detected on 2 October 1725. Faulkner also helped edit An Epistle upon an Epistle around December 1729.|$|E

Addison finds a glass box housing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he can't read his own number, and he cuts the skin from his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a hacksaw, killing him.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first {{question}} is provided by introducing the Zariski topology, a topology on An whose closed sets are the algebraic sets, and which directly reflects the algebraic structure of k. Then U = V(I(U)) {{if and only if}} U is an algebraic set or equivalently a Zariski-closed set. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second question is given by Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. In one of its forms, it says that I(V(S)) is the radical of the ideal generated by S. In more abstract language, there is a Galois connection, giving rise to two closure operators; they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory; the example is elaborated at Galois connection.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{difficulties}} in the sources, the last years and the day of Ardashir's death are not very clear. His son, Shapur probably ascended as a royal partner in April 12, 240. The time is found from the Pirchavush inscriptions in Salmas, Northwestern Iran that show Shapur's royal participation. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> question if Shapur was crowned as a shah without a partner during Ardashir's life depends on the interpretation {{a special kind of}} coin. On those coins, the faces of Ardashir and Shapur are carved together. Adding Shapur to his royal position was probably Ardashir's plan to solve the succession problem without any troubles; the reason was that Ardashir had other sons and feared that they might have craved the throne like himself.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> appellant's action {{lay in the}} navy's {{offer of}} an {{alternative}} post to the appellant immediately prior to his resignation. Given {{the background of the}} appellant's case, the Navy could not be faulted for not returning the appellant to his original post. In the particular circumstances, however, the law clearly placed a duty on the employer to consult fully with the employee affected and to share information to enable him to make informed decisions. The navy, noted Cameron, had not fulfilled that responsibility: Explaining the job offer was anything but superfluous, since it was an entirely new position, and in addition the appellant's subjective condition of suspicion, demoralisation and depression, which was evident to those dealing with him, was materially relevant to how the navy was required by fairness to deal with him. His condition meant that an unexplained offer of a new post was likely to be rejected. The lack of explanation, follow-up and elucidation did not constitute fair dealing. The navy had breached its common-law duty to treat Murray fairly, thus rendering his resignation a constructive dismissal.|$|E
