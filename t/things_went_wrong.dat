5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when <b>things</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
25|$|Work on the jet-powered {{propeller}} proved {{frustrating for}} Wittgenstein, who {{had very little}} experience working with machinery. Jim Bamber, a British engineer who was his friend and classmate at the time, reported that “when <b>things</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong,</b> which often occurred, he would throw his arms around, stomp about, and swear volubly in German.” According to William Eccles, another friend from that period, Wittgenstein then turned to more theoretical work, focusing {{on the design of}} the propeller — a problem that required relatively sophisticated mathematics.|$|E
25|$|The {{soldier was}} able to fight off the three men and his shouts alerted the British {{soldiers}} in the guardroom near the main entrance. It was through the main gate that the raiders had planned to use to flee if <b>things</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong.</b> With their escape route blocked, the soldiers now shooting from the guardroom, Boyce and his men retreated back the way they came over the wall and escaped into the surrounding marshes. The 20 other raiders outside the main entrance were left standing outside the main gate.|$|E

However, <b>things</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong.</b> Houghton's column became lost and entered the Suwaikiya marsh. Attempts by Delamain to warn him of this failed and Column B spending an hour retracing its steps before getting back on track. Delamain's Column A reached its position on time, but then had to wait, {{in the hopes that}} Houghton's force would reach their jumping off point soon.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>things</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> {{with the}} {{operation}} {{that came to}} light afterwards, such as the RMPs only having 50 rounds each, when the minimum should have been 150. In the post-invasion time, it wasn't only their ammunition that had been de-scaled; the RMPs had no morphine and no smoke grenades either. A smoke grenade may have alerted the passing helicopters to their position. They {{did not have an}} Iridium satellite phone to call out of the area and {{because of a lack of}} intelligence and information sharing, the Paratroopers and the RMPs were unaware of each others location. Accusations that the Paras had left the RMPs behind were denied in the press by senior commanders just days after the event.|$|E
25|$|The attack {{started on}} the night of 30 August, taking {{advantage}} of a full moon. From the start, <b>things</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> for Rommel; the RAF spotted the Axis vehicle concentrations and unleashed several air attacks on them. Fairey Albacores of the Royal Navy dropped flares to illuminate targets for Vickers Wellington medium bombers and for the artillery; also, the minefields that were thought to be thin turned out to be deep. The British units covering the minefields were the two brigades of the 7th Armoured Division (7th Motor and 4th Armoured), whose orders were to inflict maximum casualties before retiring. This they did, and the Axis losses began to rise. They included General Walther Nehring, the Afrika Korps commander, wounded in an air raid, and General Georg von Bismarck, commander of the 21st Panzer Division, killed by a mine explosion.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{pilot-operated}} relief valve indicator light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply connected in parallel with the valve solenoid, thus implying that the pilot-operated relief valve was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. When everything was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to rely on it. However, when <b>things</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> and the main relief valve stuck open, the unlighted lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the primary circuit, so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving {{as they would have}} if the pilot-operated relief valve were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.|$|E

500|$|James' date {{of death}} is unknown, but Bede implies {{that he was still}} alive during Bede's lifetime, which presumably means that he died after Bede's birth, {{sometime}} around 671 or 672. This would mean that he was at least 70 years old at his death. It has been suggested that James was Bede's informant for the life of Edwin, the works of Paulinus, and perhaps for the Synod of Whitby. The historian Frank Stenton calls James [...] "the one heroic figure in the Roman mission". This reflects {{the fact that many of}} the Gregorian missionaries had a habit of fleeing when <b>things</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E

Although the 100,000-strong population of Sunderland was already served by two weekly newspapers—The Sunderland Times and The Sunderland Herald—neither reflected the radical views held by Storey and his partners and there were no daily papers in the town. Storey promised readers in the first edition that, if <b>things</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong,</b> [...] "the Echo would try its best to put them right".

500|$|All of the {{location}} shots for Chalk were filmed {{at the beginning of}} the production block. Acland Burghley School, in the [...] Tufnell Park area of Camden, London, provided the exterior of the fictional Galfast High. The cast recall that it was difficult to perform comedy on location without a studio audience to gauge the reception and success of the jokes. Another school near Wembley was used for large interior shots, such as the school hall featured in the episode [...] "The Inspection". Rehearsals took place in BBC premises in Acton, west London, colloquially known by those in the industry as the [...] "Acton Hilton". David Bamber, his colleagues note, knew the script at the beginning of rehearsals and never dropped a line. The cast recall that director Juliet May provided a calm working environment; rather than losing her temper when <b>things</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong,</b> she instead focussed everyone's mind on how to solve the problem.|$|E
500|$|Live Undead is {{the first}} live album by American thrash metal band Slayer. It was {{released}} through Metal Blade Records and recorded in New York City {{in front of a}} room of people. It has been questioned by both critics and authors that the audience sound {{may or may not be}} faked. However, in 1984, WBAB Fingers Metal Shop, a radio station, held a contest to meet and hang out with Slayer during a live recording. The album was recorded at Tiki Recording Studios in Glen Cove, NY in front of around a dozen people. The album was originally intended to be recorded in front of a live audience, but <b>things</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong.</b> Nevertheless, when asked if they were fake, producer Bill Metoyer said, [...] "I don't know if I should tell you." [...] The album begins with an extended introduction of [...] "Black Magic", followed by a small speech. The remaining tracks include both those of 1983's Show No Mercy and 1984's Haunting the Chapel. Ned Raggett of AllMusic gave the album two and a half out of five stars, and noted that it [...] "isn't really necessary except for the hardest of hardcore fans.|$|E

I helped them get to the playoffs two years in a row, and obviously we won the World Series last year."

2500|$|Many reviewers criticized Mass Effect: Andromeda for its {{technical}} issues. Writing for Electronic Gaming Monthly, Ray Carsillo {{described the}} game as [...] "broken" [...] and recalled instances where {{it came to a}} halt, particularly during driving sequences. Character facial animations were often referenced as part of the problem, with Game Revolutions Aron Garst reflecting, [...] "Andromeda is full of bugs and technical oddities. From the freaky facial animations to the entire screen turning a lime shade of green for a few minutes, many <b>things</b> <b>went</b> <b>wrong</b> during my playthrough. In an otherwise positive review, Game Informer noted that technical glitches were plentiful, which hindered the game's playability. Some outlets felt that animation glitches, model issues, and poor graphical fidelity were most apparent during the game's cinematic romance scenes in particular.|$|E
