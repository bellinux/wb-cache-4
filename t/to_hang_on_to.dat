5|$|At {{the end of}} 1969 Torrijos went to Mexico on holiday. A coup was {{launched}} in his absence, in which Noriega's loyalty allowed Torrijos <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> power, greatly enhancing Torrijos's image. Torrijos promoted Noriega {{to the position of}} lieutenant colonel and appointed him chief of military intelligence in August 1970: Noriega had gone from being a captain to a lieutenant colonel in just a year and a half, and according to Dinges, had left his undisciplined past behind him. Torrijos retained power as a military ruler until 1981: during this time he negotiated the Torrijos–Carter Treaties with U.S. President Jimmy Carter, which ensured that control over the Panama Canal would pass to Panama in 1999. These treaties, as well as a new labor code that included maternity leave, collective bargaining rights, and bonus pay, made Torrijos popular in Panama despite the absence of democratic elections. Galván writes that Torrijos's relationship with Noriega was symbiotic; Torrijos provided the political acumen, while Noriega enforced his unpopular decisions with force, when necessary. Noriega would provide intelligence, and carry out covert operations, that were critical to Torrijos successfully negotiating the release of the Panama Canal from the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In 1714, {{with the}} {{accession}} of George I, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Hanover both {{came to be}} ruled in personal union by the House of Hanover. Early Hanoverian monarchs were careful to keep the heirlooms of the two realms separate. George III gave half the British heirlooms to his bride, Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, as a wedding present. In her will, Charlotte left the jewels to the 'House of Hanover'. The Kingdom of Hanover followed the Salic Law, whereby the line of succession went through male heirs. Thus, when Queen Victoria acceded to the throne of the United Kingdom, her uncle Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale became King of Hanover. King Ernest demanded {{a portion of the}} jewellery, not only as the monarch of Hanover but also as the son of Queen Charlotte. Victoria flatly declined to hand over any of the jewels, claiming they had been bought with British money. Ernest's son, George V of Hanover, continued to press the claim. Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, suggested that she make a financial settlement with the Hanoverian monarch to keep the jewels, but Parliament informed the Queen they would neither purchase the jewels nor loan funds for the purpose. A parliamentary commission was set up to investigate the matter and in 1857 they found in favour of the House of Hanover. On 28 January 1858, 10 years after Ernest's death, the jewels were handed to the Hanoverian Ambassador, Count Kielmansegg. Victoria did manage <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> one of her favourite pieces of jewellery: a fine rope of pearls.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} {{problems in the}} 1970s, {{in the wake of}} the 1973 oil crisis marked a difficult period for Bordeaux. A series of scandals coincided with a commercial crisis in Bordeaux. The vintage of 1972 had been overpriced as was 1973 and 1974. And when the market crashed the négociants were stuck with overpriced wine that they could not sell. The early 1980s saw a new trend. Inheritance taxes were doubled in 1981 and on top of the crisis in the 1970s, many families found it increasingly difficult <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> their châteaux. Enter domestic and foreign insurance companies, banks and other corporate giants. Some of these companies were looking for a quick profit, others were in it as a long-term investment. But the 1980s decade wasn't all bad. It also saw more great vintages in a single decade than ever before and a new era in other respects. First, wine critics (rather than just official classifications) started to have an influence on demand and prices. Wine critic Robert M. Parker, Jr. reviewed the 1982 Bordeaux vintage as the most sumptuous vintage in decades. Not only was this a turning point for Bordeaux wine economically, it also represented the beginning of an American domination of the reviewing of wine, especially Bordeaux. The result was a broader appeal of Bordeaux wine where the presence of fruit became a much more important factor than previously.|$|E

The Parent-Teacher Association described the movie as [...] "a hackneyed, blown-up tale with cheap human values." [...] The New York Times criticized Guy Trosper for writing a screenplay where the secondary characters whom Mickey Shaughnessey and Judy Tyler acted out were [...] "forced <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the hero's flying mane and ego for the entire picture."

60|$|The {{proceedings}} of Nehow, however, seemed little short of miraculous.

Contemporary chronicler George Pachymeres accuses Maria of [...] "ignoring the moral duty to her late husband" [...] but in fact her decision was driven by her hatred towards her uncle Michael VIII, whom she considered a heretic, as well as by her desire <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> power.

When the Soviets eventually pull out of Afghanistan, and when the Eastern Bloc begins to collapse in 1989, both the Islamists and the neoconservatives believe they are the primary architects of the [...] "Evil Empire's" [...] defeat. Curtis argues that the Soviet Union {{was on the verge}} of collapsing anyway. However, the Islamists see it quite differently. In their triumph, they believe they have the power to create 'pure' Islamic states in Egypt and Algeria. Attempts to create such Islamic states are blocked by force. The Islamists then try to foment revolutions in Egypt and Algeria by using terrorism to scare the people into rising up against their leaders. But the people are terrified by the violence, and the Algerian government exploits that fear as a way <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> power. In the end, the Islamists declare the entire populations of the countries to be thoroughly contaminated by western values. Finally, in Algeria, they begin to turn on each other, each believing that members of other terrorist groups are not true Muslims.|$|E

[...] Music writer Richard Goldstein relates his impression of Wilson based on a meeting in 1967: [...] "He came across as ... deeply insecure about his creative instincts, terrified that the songs he was working on were too arty to sell." [...] Ultimately, Wilson put an end to the Smile project once he felt he did not have a [...] "commercial feeling about some of these songs ... Maybe some people like <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves.

500|$|After {{months of}} {{recording}} and media hype, the original Smile project was shelved due to corporate pressures, technical problems, internal power struggles, and legal stalling. Business partner David Anderle attempted to form Brother Records, an independent label, {{with the intention}} of giving [...] "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." [...] A March 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. Dennis Wilson explained that the group had become [...] "very paranoid about the possibility of losing our public.... Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically." [...] Brian said that Smile leftovers like [...] "Surf's Up" [...] were left unreleased because he lacked a [...] "commercial feeling" [...] for those songs, surmising that [...] "Maybe some people like <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves.
