In the paper described the manoeuvring problem for approaching during emergency STS <b>transfer</b> <b>operation</b> with oil spill. The approach manoeuvre is considered as a sequence of navigation manoeuvres in specific navigational environment with environmental and operational constraints as well as ship dynamic performance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effect of transfer of genes for bacterial evolutionary algorithm. The bacterial operation in the Pseudo-Bacterial Genetic Algorithm (PBGA) is efficient in improving local portions of chromosomes. In the experiments presented in this paper a gene <b>transfer</b> <b>operation</b> is introduced in the place of the crossover operation in the PBGA. The gene <b>transfer</b> <b>operation</b> allows the chromosomes to directly transfer information to the other counterparts in the population. The gene transfer is inspired by the phenomenon of transfer of strands of genes between bacteria that occurs in nature. By means of this mechanism, one bacterium can rapidly spread its genetic information to other cells. Numerical experiments were performed to show the effectiveness of the PBGA with the gene <b>transfer</b> <b>operation.</b> The obtained results show the benefits that can be obtained with the newly introduced operation. 1. Introduction Genetic Algorithms (GA) represent a class of optimization te [...] ...|$|R

It is required for successive sequence of data transfer. After performing the data transfer process, the control comes to the DM. The DM constantly monitors the Reset signal and depending on the status of the Reset signal, it decides whether the control will go to the IM for performing the next data <b>transfer</b> <b>operation</b> or it will go to the CINM for initialization of the card.|$|R

30|$|Consider a {{processor}} organization {{consisting of a}} number of client modules and server modules (jointly called devices), like memory units and arithmetic-logic processing units. Suppose that these devices are interconnected with a bus which is segmented {{in such a way that}} devices connected to a particular segment can communicate in parallel to the data <b>transfer</b> <b>operations</b> going on in the other segments. This is achieved by a control logic which is able to reserve a continuous subsequence of the segments necessary to establish a path from the source to the target device. Given the frequency of data <b>transfer</b> <b>operations</b> between the devices, our task is to determine an efficient segmentation and segment-to-device assignment of this on-chip architecture. This task is formulated as an optimization problem which considers the amount of data <b>transfer</b> <b>operations</b> performed via the bus segments. The problem turns out to be NP hard but we propose efficient local search-based heuristics for it. The heuristics are applied to sample cases, and the outcome is an improved performance in terms of a shorter execution time.|$|R
