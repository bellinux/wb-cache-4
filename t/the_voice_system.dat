An inactive or active root that takes on a transitive suffix is grammatically transitive and takes an object. The transitive suffix is the base for an object or passive person suffix. Two of the most commonly used transitive suffixes distinguish actions performed with limited control or accidentally from those performed with full control or purposely.|$|E

Our acquisition results favor the analysis of the promoted argument as an A'-element.

40|$|This study {{examined}} destination entry while driving with four commercially available route guidance systems. Three {{of the systems}} involved various visual-manual demands while the fourth involved voice input and output. Cellular phone dialing and radio tuning were included as comparison tasks. Test participants drove an instrumented passenger car, accompanied by an experimenter, on a 7. 5 mile multilane test track with light traffic. Results indicated that, on average, all three systems with visual-manual methods of destination entry were associated with lengthier completion times, longer eyes-off-road-ahead times, longer and more frequent glances to the device, and greater numbers of lane exceedences than <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>system.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>system</b> was associated with substantially longer and more frequent glances away from the road scene to a containing destination information.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{quantitative}} study of <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>system</b> in Malagasy (W. Austronesian; Madagascar). We show that non-active verbs in Malagasy {{have a very}} different distribution in texts than non-active verbs in English, German and Dutch: they occur far more frequently and they typically present Agent phrases. This we claim reflects the very different role of the voicing system in the grammars of W. Austronesian and W. European languages. Our presentation is organized as follows: Part I reviews <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>system</b> of Malagasy, classifying the various voice forms into Active vs non-Active; the latter divided in Passive, and Circumstantial. Part II presents the results of our text study and Part III draws some conclusions regarding the nature of the voicing system in Malagasy. 1. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>system</b> of Malagasy We first exemplify the Malagasy voice forms. Examples are given in the standard orthography, augmented when helpful by '+ ' to indicate morpheme boundaries, ' to mark main stress, and block parentheses to indicate constituency.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} a study of Information Structure (IS) in Northern Amis and its {{interaction}} with <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>system.</b> These two domains are distinct, but interact­ ing: <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>system</b> obeys semantic and syntactic constraints, while IS and its related discourse categories (topics, foci) follows discourse parameters. A morphosyntactic analysis of the distinctive features of topics and focusing devices is conducted, showing how pragmatics maps onto syntax. Among focusing devices are evidential in situ foci, which recruit two evidential forms, han(=tu) and sa(=tu), and cleft narrow foci (informative or restrictive). Evi­ dential foci also express stance and do not trigger any syntactic restructuring, in contrast with extracted cleft foci. As in other Formosan languages, a cleft core argument must be the syntactic pivot of the clause containing the presup­ position, {{while there is no}} such constraint for cleft peripheral arguments and for adjuncts, which trigger a complement clause...|$|E
