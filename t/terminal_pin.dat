40|$|Previous {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} structure of the protein PhoH 2 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium smegmatis and Thermobispora bispora have been unsuccessful producing diffraction data to low resolution. The thermophilic organism Caldalkibacillus thermarum was thought to be an advantageous option from which to clone, express and purify PhoH 2 from for the purpose of structure determination. PhoH 2 consists of two domains, an N <b>terminal</b> <b>PIN</b> domain, known for its toxic properties as part of many toxin-antitoxin systems present in M. tuberculosis, and a C-terminal PhoH domain, an RNA helicase suspected to be involved in phosphate starvation responses. The cloning and expression of three variations of recombinant C. thermarum PhoH 2 was successful in Escherichia coli. However the purification of PhoH 2 continues to yield insoluble protein, despite the range of purification buffer conditions screened, thus preventing downstream biochemical characterisation and structural investigations. Multiple options exist to overcome this insolubility problem; including alternate plasmids for protein expression and purification that alter the tag location and type such as C-terminal His-tags and alternative fusion tags...|$|E

40|$|As {{the clock}} {{frequencies}} {{used in industry}} increase, the timing requirements on high-speed boards become very tight. Since wire length is directly proportional to wire delay of the buses that connect each chip on high-speed boards, each wire in the bus has to be tightly bounded by the maximum and minimum lengths during routing. These rigid requirements cause challenges for automatic routing. Therefore, more aggressive routing algorithms are required for current industrial circuits. This thesis intends to improve Ozdal and Wong's previous work, which is an algorithmic study of single-layer bus routing on high-speed boards. Their routing algorithm assumes {{that there are no}} boundaries in the grid during routing, and the maximum-length bound for each net is always met. This thesis modifies their code so that it does not make those assumptions. As a result, the program can now handle boundaries with wire snaking to meet the minimum-length bound and use diagonal wires if the Manhattan distance between the two <b>terminal</b> <b>pins</b> cannot satisfy the maximum-length bound...|$|R

Many older Sennheiser and Schoeps microphones use this powering method, although newer recorders and mixers are phasing out this option. Adapter barrels, and dedicated power supplies, are made to accommodate T powered microphones.

The MCCB is consisted of the actuator lever, actuator mechanism, bimetallic strip, contacts, up and down operator, arc divider or extinguisher, metal operation <b>pin,</b> <b>terminal</b> part, etc. When the actuator lever of the MCCB is at the top or the internal metal operation pin is in contact with the front part, the MCCB is turned on or off. It means trip state if the actuator lever or the internal metal operation pin moves to back side. In the UL 94 vertical combustion test, white smoke occurred from the MCCB when an average of 17 ~ 24 seconds elapsed after the MCCB was ignited and black smoke occurred when an average of 45 ~ 50 seconds elapsed. It took 5 ~ 6 minutes for the MCCB surface to be half burnt and took an average of 8 ~ 9 minutes for the MCCB surface to be entirely burnt. In the UL 94 test, the MCCB trip device operated when an average 7 ~ 8 minutes elapsed. If the MCCB trip has occurred, it may have been caused by an electrical problem such as a short-circuit, overcurrent, etc., as well as fire heat.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a new wide-range digital speed measurement method with jitter removal technique {{and using the}} direct memory access (DMA) terminal count register (TCR). Our work also supports a multi node interfacing from different measure ends. The multiple measure ends are interfaced with DMA channels through pipelines to improve hit ratio. Here hit ratio indicates the exact identification of encoder pulses without any fail or miss. But the conventional pipeline system is facing problems due to improper synchronization of clock pulses. This is a universal problem in all the digital systems mostly called jitter or skew. Here a new system is implemented {{in the path of}} the clock to remove or reduce the clock skew. The jitter is also introduced in the pipeline due to different clock paths to the parallel pipelines. While one pipeline access the encoder pulses the remaining pipelines remain in idle state as single clock pulse is used to fed encoder pulses. And it creates a big challenge if multiple clock pulses are given to individual pipeline systems. This can be overcome using parallel ports as clock signals. The DMA method is based on both pulses counting in the constant sampling time at <b>terminal</b> count stop <b>pin</b> of a DMA controller. The hardware configuration and algorithms for a microcontroller implementation are also presented. The proposed method is suitable in systems using microcontrollers with DMA controller and timers.

40|$|Recently, {{a western}} white pine protein, Pin m III, {{was shown to}} be {{associated}} with overwintering and frost hardi-ness of western white pine foliage. To examine whether Pin m III is directly involved in frost hardiness by functioning as an antifreeze protein, work is underway to clone the gene encoding this protein and to assess the function of this gene in freezing tolerance by incorporating the gene in a test plant, such as tobacco. Here, we examined in more detail, by SDS-PAGE and also by two dimensional gel elec-trophoresis, the seasonal variation of additional proteins in western pine foliage. SDS-PAGE analysis of three seedlots showed that different proteins reached a maximum level in different months, although most proteins (5 to 11) reached a maximum level in winter months (December, January and February). The 2 -D gel analysis of foliage sampled on three harvest dates (October, January and April) of one seedlot revealed a seasonal variation of a large number pro-teins (76 to 184). Of the seasonally varied proteins, the amino terminal sequence of several proteins including Pin m III was determined. One of the sequences was identified by homology to that of the small subunit of ribulose bi-phosphate carboxylase, whose level increased substantially from fall to spring. The amino <b>terminal</b> sequence of <b>Pin</b> m III had 89 % homology to a sugar pine protein, Pin 11.
