The joint {{business}} prospered, becoming Newcastle's leading engraving service with an enviable reputation for high quality work and good service. In September 1776 he went to London for eight months, finding the city rude, deceitful and cruel, and much disliking <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> of extreme wealth and poverty side by side. He returned to his beloved Newcastle {{as soon as he}} could, but his time in the capital gave him a wider reputation, business experience, and an awareness of new movements in art.|$|E

25|$|The local Church {{officials}} on Corfu (as {{well as on}} the other Ionian Islands) maintained a deliberate neutrality during the anti-semitic events and did not support the government's efforts to reestablish order, unlike the high echelons of the Church, who took measures to limit the anti-Semitic mood.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{proposes that}} {{fairness}} in wireless networks should be measured {{using one of}} the following new measures: <b>the</b> deterministic <b>unfairness</b> bound called <b>the</b> wireless absolute fairness bound (WAFB) or <b>the</b> statistical <b>unfairness</b> bound called <b>the</b> 99 -percentile wireless absolute fairness bound (WAFB 99). Compared with previous fairness definitions, the new fairness measures are better suited for measuring fairness of scheduling disciplines that exploit multiuser diversity. A new scheduling discipline called opportunistic proportional fair scheduling is defined. Numerical results show that the new scheduling discipline has slightly higher throughput and slightly better fairness than proportional fair scheduling...|$|R
25|$|The {{second reason}} {{has to do}} with precedent. In the 1920s, the Supreme Court upheld the {{constitutionality}} and validity of several land laws. Invalidating the California Alien Land Law would have required overturning these decisions – something that the Court is typically loath to do, especially so shortly after the decision dates. In this case, the Court was able to address <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> of the application of the law by focusing on the petitioners’ first contention, and effectively ignore the broader implications.|$|E
25|$|Chen became {{involved}} in politics in 1980 when he defended the participants of the Kaohsiung Incident in a military court. While his client Huang Hsin-chieh, the leading opposition dissident, and seven co-defendants, including his future Vice President Annette Lu, were found guilty, Chen {{came to be known}} for his forceful and colorful arguments.

25|$|In 2007 the United States Sentencing Commission {{amended the}} Federal Sentencing Guidelines {{to lessen the}} {{disparity}} between the penalties for the possession and trafficking of powder cocaine and crack cocaine, citing racial disparity and <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> of the 100-1 crack-powder penalty threshold ratio. The Commission instead implemented an 18-1 ratio. Michael Mukasey, in the Attorney General's capacity, vehemently opposed and testified against this change, warning that thousands of violent criminals may be released under the guidelines and endanger the community. Mukasey's move was criticized by advocates of elimination of crack-powder disparity.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concludes with}} {{suggestions}} {{as to how}} <b>the</b> potential <b>unfairness</b> caused by interviewer variability could be solved. Over the last two decades, {{research has suggested that}} candidates’ test performances and scores are collaboratively achieved through interviewing/ scoring processes and there could be unfair situations caused by the interinterviewer variation. To investigate a precise picture of the impact of interinterviewer variation, this research examines the variability of interviewer behaviour, its influence on a candidate’s performance and raters’ consequent perceptions of the candidate’s ability on analytical rating scales (for example, pronunciation, grammar, fluency). This paper concludes with suggestions as to how <b>the</b> potential <b>unfairness</b> caused by interviewer variability could be solved...|$|R
40|$|Presumption of Equality {{requires}} that individuals be treated equally {{in the absence}} of relevant information that would discriminate between them. Our objective is to make this principle more precise, if viewed as a principle of fairness, and to determine why and under what conditions it should be obeyed. Presumption norms are procedural constraints, but their justification can be sought in the possible or expected outcomes of the procedures they regulate. This is the avenue pursued here. The suggestion is that {{in the absence of}} information that would discriminate between the individuals, equal treatment minimizes <b>the</b> expected <b>unfairness</b> of <b>the</b> outcome. A related suggestion is that equal treatment under these circumstances also minimizes <b>the</b> maximal possible <b>unfairness</b> of <b>the</b> outcome. Whether these suggestions are correct or not depends on the properties of <b>the</b> underlying <b>unfairness</b> measure. <b>The</b> required properties are specified. The essay also considers the normative status of equal lotteries on unequal treatments...|$|R

25|$|In 1884, a {{sub-committee}} of the regatta’s Committee of Management discussed {{options for}} reducing <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> of the course. Their recommendation {{was to move}} the finish line downstream to Poplar Point (thus avoiding the bend) and the start {{to the bottom of}} Temple Island. This was not popular with spectators as it made previous viewing points obsolete. The sub-committee also recommending reducing the racing lanes from three to two and extending racing from two days to three. The Committee gained support from the Captains of competing Clubs and the changes were introduced for the 1886 Regatta.|$|E
25|$|The New Course started just {{downstream}} of Temple Island, on the Buckinghamshire {{side and}} finished opposite the upstream end of Phyllis Court, {{very close to}} the current finish line. There were two slight bends (at Remenham and just after Fawley) and a staggered start to compensate for them. The course was also piled for the first time, although not boomed. Unfortunately, it became apparent that in trying to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> of the Old Course, a new problem had been introduced. Downstream of Fawley, bushes grew alongside the Buckinghamshire bank and provided shelter from the prevailing wind. The course now ran close to this bank and crew on the Buckinghamshire station gained the advantage of shelter whenever a ‘Bushes Wind’ was blowing. From 1886 to 1905, Bucks took 59% of wins against 41% on Berks.|$|E
25|$|Tara held great {{significance}} to the Irish population {{as it was the}} historic seat of the High Kings of Ireland. Clontarf was symbolic because of its association with the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, when the Irish King Brian Boru defeated his rival Maelmordha, although Brian himself died during the battle. Despite appeals from his supporters, O'Connell refused to defy the authorities and he called off the meeting, as he was unwilling to risk bloodshed and had no others. He was arrested, charged with conspiracy and sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of £2,000, although he was released after three months by the House of Lords, which quashed the conviction and severely criticised <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> of the trial. Having deprived himself of his most potent weapon, the monster meeting, O'Connell with his health failing had no plan and dissension broke out in the Repeal Association.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown how venting one’s feelings can reduce the negative emotions of a consumption experience. This study proposes a general process of how consumers with feelings of unfairness due to a negative consumption experience can achieve emotional disclosure and reduced unfairness by posting online reviews. By using an experimental design with scenarios, this study tests how <b>the</b> perceived <b>unfairness</b> in this process {{is affected by the}} party encouraging the consumer to post an online review and the consumer’s public commitment. A student sample was divided into four groups and <b>the</b> perception of <b>unfairness</b> was compared between the groups depending on whether the party encouraging the feedback was a company perceived to be responsible for <b>the</b> sense of <b>unfairness</b> or an independent party and whether when the consumer was identifiable or anonymous to see if public commitment had an effect. Results showed that emotional disclosure was found to reduce <b>the</b> perceived <b>unfairness</b> in all groups. There {{was no significant difference between}} being encouraged by the company or independent party. Furthermore, no public commitment was in effect, even when participants’ answers were thought to become known to others. The results indicate that companies may prefer to encourage consumers to provide feedback themselves rather than using a third party and that posting online reviews will not make the consumer committed to their feeling of unfairness...|$|R

25|$|After the war Johnston {{struggled}} {{to make a living}} for himself and his wife, who was ailing. He became president of a small railroad, the Alabama and Tennessee River Rail Road Company, which during his tenure of May 1866 to November 1867, was renamed the Selma, Rome and Dalton Railroad. Johnston was bored with the position and the company failed for lack of capital. He established in 1868 an insurance company in Savannah, Georgia, acting as an agent for the Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company, and within four years had a network of more than 120 agents across the deep South. The income from this venture allowed him to devote time to his great postwar activity, writing his memoirs. His Narrative of Military Operations, published in 1874, was highly critical of Davis and many of his fellow generals, continuing his grievance about <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> of his ranking as a general and attempting to justify his career as a cautious campaigner. The book sold poorly and its publisher failed to make a profit.|$|E
25|$|In early 1945 Powers was {{directed}} to a race relations meeting in Chicago with the new American Council on Race Relations and began an endeavor of learning himself and then promulgating race relations issues across police departments. The first major project started in Richmond, California with Davis McEntire. Initial efforts were aimed at training the police in human relations including trying to eliminate prejudice and present <b>the</b> <b>unfairness</b> of segregation and discrimination based on race - factors later observed to be widespread needs. The work brought together leaders of the California Department of Corrections, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Japanese American Citizens League, and a Nisei, second-generation American of Japanese descent, US Marine. Together the social norms and prejudices of the day were vented, discussed, and broken down across a week of open-ended discussions. Following the training incendiary incidents arose {{in the community and}} the police took novel actions ensuring fairness and peace was retained. The Saturday Evening Post covered it in Cops don't have to be brutal, Dec 28, 1946. Following this numerous police departments even outside California were informed of the training and a booklet A Guide to Race Relations for Peace Officers was created and distributed, (including excerpts in the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper.) There was a prospective project by the young American Council on Race Relations using it and on making a training film with Powers writing the script, working with Edwin Embree. Out of this Powers was on a short list of leaders in the field though more recent scholarship critiqued the program for not including the local minority leadership of the time.|$|E
