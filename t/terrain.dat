5|$|The {{observed}} {{surface of}} Ariel {{can be divided}} into three <b>terrain</b> types: cratered <b>terrain,</b> ridged <b>terrain,</b> and plains. The main surface features are impact craters, canyons, fault scarps, ridges, and troughs.|$|E
5|$|Cross-country {{skiing is}} a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own {{locomotion}} to move across snow-covered <b>terrain,</b> rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of <b>terrain</b> which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous <b>terrain</b> to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{during three}} flybys by Cassini on February 17, March 9, and July 14, 2005, {{revealed}} Enceladus' surface features in much greater detail than the Voyager 2 observations. The smooth plains, which Voyager 2 had observed, resolved into relatively crater-free regions filled with numerous small ridges and scarps. Numerous fractures were {{found within the}} older, cratered <b>terrain,</b> suggesting that the surface {{has been subjected to}} extensive deformation since the craters were formed. Some areas contain no craters, indicating major resurfacing events in the geologically recent past. There are fissures, plains, corrugated <b>terrain</b> and other crustal deformations. Several additional regions of young <b>terrain</b> were discovered in areas not well-imaged by either Voyager spacecraft, such as the bizarre <b>terrain</b> near the south pole. All of this indicates that Enceladus's interior may be liquid today, even though it should have been frozen long ago.|$|E
40|$|Troubling <b>Terrains</b> {{engages with}} the idea of {{educational}} research as locations, as places, as sites, as spaces as <b>terrains.</b> It explores multiple ways in which these <b>terrains</b> may be contentious, contested and controversial and shows how such <b>terrains</b> may be troubling. This book pursues one of the ambivalences of educational research. Does educational research help to replicate existing sociocultural privilege? Or does it work to disrupt that privilege and to construct alternative understandings of current issues? In this process, the book presents tactics for traversing and transforming the troubling and sometimes troubled <b>terrains</b> of contemporary educational research. ...|$|R

50|$|UHP <b>terrains</b> {{vary greatly}} in size, from the >30,000 km2 giant UHP <b>terrains</b> in Norway and China, to small kilometer-scale bodies. The giant UHP <b>terrains</b> have a {{metamorphic}} history spanning {{tens of millions}} of years, whereas the small UHP <b>terrains</b> have a metamorphic history spanning millions of years. All are dominated by quartzofeldspathic gneiss with a few percent mafic rock (eclogite) or ultramafic rock (garnet-bearing peridotite). Some include sedimentary or rift-volcanic sequences that have been interpreted as passive margins prior to metamorphism.|$|R
5|$|Pitted <b>terrain</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia. The formation of the pitted <b>terrain</b> is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted <b>terrain,</b> curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted <b>terrain,</b> and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by {{the heat of the}} impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was deposited on the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.|$|E

5|$|The second main <b>terrain</b> type—ridged terrain—comprises {{bands of}} ridges and troughs {{hundreds}} of kilometers in extent. It bounds the cratered <b>terrain</b> and cuts it into polygons.

The bands of ridged <b>terrain</b> often form continuations of canyons, suggesting {{that they may be}} a modified form of the graben or the result of a different reaction of the crust to the same extensional stresses, such as brittle failure.|$|E

40|$|A {{realistic}} input {{model for}} polyhedral <b>terrains</b> {{was introduced in}} [16].

In this paper, we perform experiments with realworld data to determine how realistic the assumptions of that input model are, by examining what the values of the model parameters are in practice. We consider the results of these experiments as evidence that the assumptions of the model are probably realistic: they are all satisfied by the <b>terrains</b> that we generated from GIS data. Moreover, we evaluate the complexity of the visibility map in these <b>terrains</b> by counting vertices of the visibility maps for different viewpoints...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the effect of}} base map scale on the accuracy of floodplain zoning using hydraulic simulation and GIS. The study area was the Bahookalat River located in the southeast of Sistan and Baluchistan Province. The river has a mild sloping and stretches over mountainous and plain <b>terrains.</b> The errors due to map scales are determined through floodplain zoning over various return periods using base maps with scales of 1 / 1000 (field surveying) and 1 / 25000 (topographic). In the present study, the Arcview environment was used for GIS analyses and the HEC-RAS software was used for hydraulic simulation. Hydrometric data and water level values were used to calibrate the hydraulic simulation model and the accurate Manning coefficient was estimated. The floodplain zone for various return periods and {{on the basis of}} the above base maps for different <b>terrains</b> have been determined. The analysis of the results was accomplished using relative error index and normalized floodplain zone. Comparison of overall and average relative errors for mountainous and plain <b>terrains</b> showed that the errors in these <b>terrains</b> were almost the same as those in the Bahookalatr River ranging over 19 to 35 % for different return periods. The relative error showed a higher sensitivity within the dominant discharge but in mountainous <b>terrains</b> it showed a declining trend for floods with return periods of more than 10 years. In the case of return periods of more than 100 years, the relative error was lower for mountainous <b>terrains</b> than that for plain <b>terrains...</b>|$|R
