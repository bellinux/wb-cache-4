They have adhesive glands with which they can anchor <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> substrate and cilia with which they move around. They feed on detritus, sucking up organic particles with their muscular pharynx. They are hermaphrodites, the marine species producing eggs which develop directly into miniature adults. The freshwater species are parthenogenetic, producing unfertilised eggs, {{and at least one}} species is viviparous. Gastrotrichs mature with great rapidity and have lifespans of only a few days.|$|E

The Gepids restricted <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{eastern part of the}} Pannonian Basin; this was to form the core of Thurisind's dominions, just as it had under the previous Gepid kings. By the early 6th century, the Gepid nobility converted to Arian Christianity, while most of the Gepids remained pagans.|$|E

5|$|Red {{parasitic}} mites sometimes attach <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dorsal {{region of}} crickets and may greatly affect them. The horsehair worm Paragordius varius is an internal parasite and {{can control the}} behaviour of its cricket host and cause it to enter water, where the parasite continues its lifecycle and the cricket likely drowns. The larvae of the sarcophagid fly Sarcophaga kellyi develop inside the body cavity of field crickets. Female parasitic wasps of Rhopalosoma lay their eggs on crickets, and their developing larvae gradually devour their hosts. Other wasps in the family Scelionidae are egg parasitoids, seeking out batches of eggs laid by crickets in plant tissues in which to insert their eggs.|$|E

They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E
