5|$|In 2004 Thorkildsen faced {{competition}} from Ronny Nilsen, who threw 84.73metres in May. Although Thorkildsen did not retake the national number one spot right away, he did display increasing {{form in the}} preparations for the Olympic Games. He qualified for the Olympics with an 84.12m <b>throw</b> <b>at</b> the Bergen Bislett Games, an event which was won by Breaux Greer with a North American record and world leading throw of 87.39metres. On 27 July Thorkildsen took his first victory in an IAAF Grand Prix meet, beating Breaux Greer by a comfortable margin at the DN Galan meet in Stockholm. Three days later he improved his season best to 84.45metres at the London Grand Prix at Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 2016, Nova officially {{signed a}} three-year, $26 million {{contract}} with the Pirates. Nova won the National League's Pitcher of the Month Award for April 2017, after he led the league with an 0.75 WHIP, was second with 36 innings pitched and a 1.50 ERA, and threw two complete games (one shutout). After throwing six shutout innings against the Miami Marlins on June 11, Nova became the first Pirate to <b>throw</b> <b>at</b> least six innings in his first thirteen starts to begin a season since Eddie Solomon in 1981, who did it seventeen times. Nova's streak {{came to an end}} at fifteen starts, after pitching five innings of two run ball in a 6-2 win over the Rays in his sixteenth start of the year. By the All-Star break Nova was 9-6 with a 3.21 ERA in 120⅔ innings, with a WHIP of 1.09.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the French {{team were}} {{scheduled}} to play a team from the United States, but the latter withdrew from the competition as three of their team were {{taking place in the}} hammer <b>throw</b> <b>at</b> the same time. The Scandinavians were accepted as late entrants by the organisers, and their team was composed primarily of athletes who were competing in other events, though it also included a journalist, Edgar Aabye, to make up the numbers. The mixed team won each of the first two pulls against the French in a best-of-three contest to win the gold medal. Due to a second, unofficial, match subsequently taking place between the United States and the Scandinavians, some records have erroneously listed the United States as gold medalists.|$|E

However, he neglected to fill in a channel as he advanced, and when the Mexicans counter-attacked, Cortés was wounded and almost captured. Cristóbal de Olea and Cristóbal de Guzmán gave their lives for Cortés, and sixty-five Spanish soldiers were captured alive. Guatemoc then had five of their heads <b>thrown</b> <b>at</b> Alvarado's camp, four <b>thrown</b> <b>at</b> Cortés' camp, six <b>thrown</b> <b>at</b> Sandoval's camp, while ten more were sacrificed to the Huichilobos and Texcatlipoca idols.|$|R

5|$|In {{the next}} match against Oxford University, Loxton {{came in at}} 4/206 and {{anchored}} the innings, remaining unbeaten on 79 as Australia were bowled out for 431. He featured in partnerships with Colin McCool and Doug Ring, who both made fifties. He then took the new ball in both innings, taking 1/14 and 1/16 from five and eight overs respectively in another innings victory. When Oxford batted, Philip Whitcombe struck a delivery from Ernie Toshack to Loxton, and {{took a few steps}} out of his crease. Loxton prepared to <b>throw</b> <b>at</b> the Whitcombe's stumps in a run out attempt, but did not release, while Whitcombe stood his ground outside the crease. In those days, the fielding standards were lower, with weaker and less accurate throws and Whitcombe was only a metre or two outside his crease, while Loxton was around thirty away. The next delivery from Toshack was again hit to Loxton, and Whitcombe again wandered outside his crease. This time Loxton threw the ball and hit the stumps directly, running out the batsman, who was unable to comprehend what had happened and shook his head.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{include a}} variety of {{anthropomorphic}} vegetable enemies, such as potatoes and squash, each with different movement patterns and attacks. Levels can also include hazards, such as water or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Unlike the previous game, Keen can not shoot enemies with a raygun; instead he collects small pellets throughout the levels called flower power to <b>throw</b> <b>at</b> enemies. If an enemy is hit, they transform into a passive, intangible flower for a limited time, while pellets that do not hit an enemy can be retrieved by the player. The player can also find food items {{in the form of}} sweets throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded if the player earns enough points, as well as figures of Keen that grant an extra life. Placed throughout the levels are collectible bombs, which the player must use at least twelve of in order to defeat the final boss of the game.|$|E
5|$|López served four stints with Boston in 2006. In 2007, he {{had three}} {{different}} stints but appeared in 61 games, posting a 3.10 earned run average (ERA). He posted a 15.43 ERA in the playoffs but won his first World Series ring as the Red Sox defeated Colorado in four games. In 2008, he spent the entire season on a major league roster {{for the first time}} since 2003. He posted a 9.26 ERA in his first 14 games of 2009 before getting sent to the minors for the rest of the season. In 2010, he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates but was traded to the San Francisco Giants during the season. He had his lowest ERA that year (2.34) and won another World Series as the Giants defeated the Texas Rangers to win their first World Series since 1954. In 2011, López was one of two major league relief pitchers to <b>throw</b> <b>at</b> least 50 innings without giving up a home run. He won his third World Series in 2012 as the Giants defeated the Detroit Tigers in four games. In 2013, López posted a career-best 1.83 ERA. He won his fourth World Series in 2014 as the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals in seven games. López announced his retirement on February 8, 2017.|$|E

5|$|Six {{teams from}} North America and six teams {{representing}} {{the rest of}} the World play a series of games against each other in order to win points. The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup. Teams compete in four formats: team games, mixed doubles games, singles competitions, and skins games. Team games are regular curling games, with two teams of four playing against each other. Mixed doubles games involve two teams, each consisting of one male and one female, playing against each other. Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end, one of which is positioned {{prior to the start of}} the end. This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games. The singles competition involves two teams playing against each other. There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions. Each curler from each team is assigned to <b>throw</b> <b>at</b> least one type of shot. Points are given based on how well the shot is made. After all of the shots have been thrown, the team with the most points wins the competition. Skins games involve two teams playing against each other, where the objective is to win skins by scoring two or more points with the hammer or stealing points without the hammer. The points for the skins games, which go toward the total points for the cup, are distributed throughout the game, and the teams earn these points by winning skins.|$|E
5|$|When the Persians {{arrived at}} Thermopylae in mid-August, they {{initially}} waited {{for three days}} for the Allies to disperse. When Xerxes was eventually persuaded that the Allies intended to contest the pass, he sent his troops to attack. However, the Greek position was ideally suited to hoplite warfare, the Persian contingents being forced to attack the phalanx head on. The Allies thus withstood two full days of battle and everything Xerxes could <b>throw</b> <b>at</b> them. However, {{at the end of}} the second day, they were betrayed by a local resident named Ephialtes who revealed to Xerxes a mountain path that led behind the Allied lines. Xerxes then sent his elite guards, the Immortals on a night march to outflank the Allied. When he was made aware of this maneuver (while the Immortals were still en route), Leonidas dismissed the bulk of the Allied army, remaining to guard the rear with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebians and perhaps a few hundred others. On the third day of the battle, the remaining Allies sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians and slaughter as many as they could. Ultimately, however, the Allied rearguard was annihilated, and the pass of Thermopylae opened to the Persians.|$|E

25|$|Dreyer won {{his first}} {{national}} title in 1934, winning the 35lb weight <b>throw</b> <b>at</b> that year's AAU indoor championships with a throw of 53ft8in (16.35m). Representing the Rhode Island State College, he also won the 1934 indoor IC4A weight throw title, throwing 55ftin (16.82m), a world record. At that summer's NCAA championships he won the hammer throw, throwing 169ftin (51.73m) and defeating 1932 Olympic bronze medalist Pete Zaremba; only Fred Tootell, the 1924 Olympic champion and Dreyer's own coach, had ever thrown further at the NCAA meet.|$|E

25|$|During Alexander III's reign, the monarchy's opponents quickly {{disappeared}} underground. A {{group of}} students had been planning to assassinate Alexander III on the sixth anniversary of his father's death at the Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg.

However, the Russian secret police uncovered the plot before it could be carried out. Five students were hanged in 1887; amongst them was Aleksandr Ulyanov, older brother of Vladimir Lenin.|$|E

But Sandel had played against Robinson, also a Californian, in baseball games {{on the west coast}} and harbored no ill feelings toward him. After the first several pitches were thrown and the count ran to 2-1, Dick Bouknight, the Giants catcher, walked to the mound and demanded to know if Sandell was going to <b>throw</b> <b>at</b> Robinson. Sandel refused. After running up a 3-2 count, Robinson ground out harmlessly to the shortstop.|$|E
