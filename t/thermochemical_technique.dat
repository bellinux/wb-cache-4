40|$|In this work, an {{electrochemical}} method {{was developed to}} destroy liquid chlorinated solvents, and a <b>thermochemical</b> <b>technique</b> was invented to reduce gas-phase chlorinated solvents to hydrocarbons. The developed {{electrochemical method}} belongs to the most potential technique for wastewater treatment [...] only electrochemical method is possible to simultaneously destroy all water contaminants; the invented thermochemical method is {{the fastest way to}} destroy chlorinated solvents. In {{the first part of this}} work, the anodic oxidation of trichloroethylene (TCE) on an Ebonex ceramic electrode was investigated. TCE could be oxidized to CO₂, CO, Cl⁻, and ClO₃⁻. The disappearance of TCE was first-order, independent of pH, and initial TCE concentrations. TCE oxidation occurred only on the anodic surface and was limited by mass transport at Ea > 4. 3 V vs SSCE (i > 5 mA cm⁻²). Hydroxyl radicals generated on anode surface were detected using a spin trap. A kinetic model was successfully correlated with experimental results. In the second part of this work, TCE and CF were rapidly dechlorinated to hydrocarbons on the Ebonex ceramic cathode using Pt or Pd as catalyst. Pt was found to possess great resistance to sulfur and chlorine poisoning. Pd was quickly deactivated in sulfate solution. TCE and CF cathodic transformation were strongly dependent of pH. The reaction rate was limited by mass transport at Ec 5 mA cm⁻²). The mass transfer to cathode surface was found to be three times faster than to anode surface. The main products of TCE reduction were ethane, ethylene, and chloride, and for CF were methane and chloride. The proposed reaction mechanism and kinetic model were consistent with experimental results. In the third part of this work, a new hydrodechlorination method was invented for gas-phase chlorinated solvent destruction. Gas-phase chlorinated solvents, such as PCE, TCE, 1, 1 -DCE, VC, and CF were rapidly reduced to ethane, ethylene, and methane in a continuous-flow column reactor at ambient temperature and pressure. This is the fastest way to destroy chlorinated solvents. The catalyst could be easily regenerated and had a long-life time (over one and half year). The reaction mechanism and kinetics were studied. In the forth part of this work, the first three parts of work were combined together to invent a new destruction method for chlorinated solvents in real wastewater. Ebonex ceramic materials served as electrodes and Pt was plated on cathode used as catalyst in the electrolytic cell. The headspace of the electrolytic cell was connected to the Pd/Ni catalyst column. Liquid chlorinated solvents were destroyed on electrode surface, and gas-phase chlorinated solvents were reduced to hydrocarbons in the Pd/Ni catalyst surface in the presence of hydrogen. Water scale or other deposited materials on Pt coated Ebonex cathode could be removed, and the catalyst could be regenerated by reversing electrode polarity...|$|E

Palm oil shell wastes are one of the main agriculture waste in Malaysia. Pyrolysis {{is one of the most}} promising <b>thermochemical</b> <b>techniques</b> for recovering energy from biomass. Pyrolysis of oil-palm shell waste was first carried out using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effects of heating rate on the pyrolytic properties were investigated. The kinetic parameters have also been determined using integral method. This paper also describes the experimental results from a bench-scale circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) test rig, installed at SIRIM Berhad, Shah Alam, suitable for gasification and combustion experiments using different biomass materials. The purpose of the tests was to investigate the suitability of the selected fuels for energy production using Circulating Fluidised Bed Combustor (CFBC) while taking care of the flue gas emissions. Operating parameters (such as temperature, type of biomass, feeding rate, heating rate, pressure, primary air and reactor configuration) are believed to influence significantly the pyrolysis of a biomass. Temperature is one of the most important operating variants so the experimental studies were done to investigate the influence of temperature on pyrolysis. the concentrations of CO, NOx and CO 2 in the flue gas were measured. The combustion performances were evaluated by varying the primary gas flow through the CFBC tubular furnace. the emission of NOx ranged from 38 â€“ 75 ppm while the CO emissions were high for higher primary air flow rates. ...|$|R

Separation of manure solids provides an avenue of their utility via <b>thermochemical</b> conversion <b>techniques.</b> Therefore, the goal of this paper was to assess the physical and thermal properties of solid separated swine manure obtained from two different farms, i. e., farrowing, and growing-finishing, and to determine their pyrolysis kinetic parameters. Swine manure solids were dried and milled prior to assessing their properties. Differential and integral isoconversional me-thods (Friedman, and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa) were used to determine the apparent activation energy {{as a function of the}} conversion ratio. Significant differences were observed in the proximate, ulti-mate composition between both manure types. The higher heating value (HHV) for the manure solids from farrowing, and growing-finishing farms reached 16. 6 MJ/kg and 19. 4 MJ/kg, respec-tively. The apparent activation energy computed using Friedman and FWO methods increased with the increase in the degree of conversion.

In this study, thermal decomposition and thermal activities of miscanthus and wheat straw during the torrefaction at 200 ℃, 275 ℃, and 300 ℃ in a nitrogen environment for 45 minutes of residence time are analyzed in a simultaneous thermogravimetric analyzer (micro TGA) with a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and a macro-TGA. The output of the micro TGA is fed into the Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) and qualitative analysis of the gaseous product is carried out. The composition of different gas products during the torrefaction of biomass are compared critically and kinetics were analyzed.

However, the main drawback is the increased level of Particulate Matter (PM) emissions, which {{is associated with the}} adverse effects on human health and the environment. GDI engine’s fuel economy can further be enhanced by exhaust gas fuel reforming, a <b>thermochemical</b> recovery <b>technique,</b> which utilizes the engine exhaust gas heat, CO 2 and H 2 O to produce a hydrogen-rich gas named reformate. Furthermore, additional benefits in gaseous emissions can be achieved through the combustion of reformate. In this investigation, a prototype on-board fuel reformer has been employed in a GDI engine to study the effects of reformate combustion as a supplementary fuel to gasoline on PM and gaseous emissions. Between 5 % and 6 % reduction in the engine fuel consumption was achieved by using the fuel reformer. The different effects (i. e. dilution, thermal, chemical, etc.) of the reformate combustion on the PM nature and gaseous emissions has been identified. It was found that the reformate combustion can decrease notably the engine PM emissions, however, the reduction is dependent on the PM nature. Reformate combustion was found to remove soot cores more efficiently than the volatile PM. The study has shown that the three-way catalytic converter (TWC) can reduce PM emissions.

It is desired to have monodisperse and atomically precise gold nanoparticles to have better control and effective utilization of that nanoparticle. The nanoparticles that are less than 2 nm in size with precise number of atoms and ligands (± 0 atoms) which exhibit unique physical, chemical and optoelectronic properties are called as gold nanomolecules. This thesis presents the synthetic methodology and isolation of various monodisperse atomically precise nanomolecules and their characterization. UV-vis spectroscopy, Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS), Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS), Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV), and Single Crystal - X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) are the commonly used characterization techniques for the analysis of nanomolecules. In this work, UV-vis spectroscopy, ESI-MS and MALDI-MS are the ones extensively used for the characterization. Thermochemical treatment of nanomolecules is a well-known technique for narrowing down the size distribution of a polydisperse crude mixture to obtain the most stable species. Au 133 (SPh-tBu) 52 an ultra-stable nanomolecule was synthesized using the <b>thermochemical</b> treatment <b>technique</b> via core size conversion.

40|$|Bio-signatures play {{a central}} role in {{determining}} whether life existed on early Mars. Using a terrestrial basalt as a compositional analog for the martian surface, we applied a combination of experimental microbiology and <b>thermochemical</b> modeling <b>techniques</b> to identify potential geochemical bio-signatures for life on early Mars. Laboratory experiments were used to determine the short-term effects of biota on the dissolution of terrestrial basalt, and the formation of secondary alteration minerals. The chemoorganoheterotrophic bacterium, Burkholderia sp. strain B_ 33, was grown in a minimal growth medium with and without terrestrial basalt as the sole nutrient source. No growth was detected in the absence of the basalt. In the presence of basalt, during exponential growth, the pH decreased rapidly from pH 7. 0 to 3. 6 and then gradually increased to a steady-state of equilibrium of between 6. 8 and 7. 1. Microbial growth coincided with an increase in key elements in the growth medium (Si, K, Ca, Mg, and Fe). Experimental results were compared with theoretical thermochemical modeling to predict growth of secondary alteration minerals, which can be used as bio-signatures, over a geological timescale. We thermochemically modeled the dissolution of the basalt (in the absence of biota) in very dilute brine at 25 °C, 1 bar; the pH was buffered by the mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions. Preliminary results suggested that at the water to rock ratio of 1 × 107, zeolite, hematite, chlorite, kaolinite, and apatite formed abiotically. The biotic weathering processes were modeled by varying the pH conditions within the model to adjust for biologic influence. The results suggested that, for a basaltic system, the microbially-mediated dissolution of basalt would result in “simpler” secondary alteration, consisting of Fe-hydroxide and kaolinite, under conditions where the abiotic system would also form chlorite. The results from this study demonstrate that, by using laboratory-based experiments and thermochemical modeling, it is possible to identify secondary alteration minerals that could potentially be used to distinguish between abiotic and biotic weathering processes on early Mars. This work will contribute to the interpretation of data from past, present, and future life detection missions to Mars...|$|R
40|$|Torrefaction is a {{treatment}} which serves {{to improve the}} properties of biomass in relation to <b>thermochemical</b> processing <b>techniques</b> for energy generation; for example, combustion, co-combustion with coal or gasification. The topic has gathered interest {{in the past two}} decades but further understanding is required for optimisation of the process thus enhancing economic efficiency, which is crucial to the success of the treatment commercially and within industry. In particular there is a noticeable gap in current literature regarding the combustion properties of torrefied biomass. This study examines torrefaction in nitrogen of two energy crops, reed canary grass and short rotation willow coppice (SRC), and a residue, wheat straw. Product evolution and mass and energy losses during torrefaction are measured using a range of laboratory scale methods. Experiments at different torrefaction conditions were undertaken to examine optimization of the process for the three fuels. Progress of torrefaction was also followed by chemical analysis (C, H, N, O, ash), and it was seen that the characters of the biomass fuels begin to resemble those of low rank coals in terms of the van Krevelen coal rank parameter. In addition, the results indicate that the volatile component of biomass is both reduced and altered producing a more thermally stable product, but also one that produces greater heats of reaction during combustion. The difference between the mass and energy yield was shown to improve for the higher torrefaction temperatures investigated. The combustion behaviour of raw and torrefied fuels was studied further by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and also, for willow, by suspending individual particles in a methane–air flame and following the progress of combustion by high-speed video. It is shown that both volatile and char combustion of the torrefied sample become more exothermic compared to the raw fuels, and that depending on the severity of the torrefaction conditions, the torrefied fuel can contain up to 96 % of the original energy content on a mass basis. Upon exposure to a methane-air flame, torrefied willow ignites more quickly, presumably because its low moisture content means that it heats faster. Torrefied particles also begin char combustion quicker than the raw SRC particles, although char combustion is slower for the torrefied fuel...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of lignocellulosic biomass into renewable fuels and other commodities has provided an appealing alternative towards supplanting global dependence on fossil fuels. The suitability of multitudes of plants for deconstruction to useful precursor molecules and products {{is currently being}} evaluated. These studies have probed a variety of phenotypic traits, including cellulose, non-cellulosic polysaccharide, lignin, and lignin monomer composition, glucose and xylose production following enzymatic hydrolysis, and an assessment of lignin-carbohydrate and lignin-lignin linkages, to name a few. These quintessential traits can provide an assessment of biomass recalcitrance, enabling researchers to devise appropriate deconstruction strategies. Plants with high polysaccharide and lower lignin contents {{have been shown to}} breakdown to monomeric sugars more readily. Not all plants contain ideal proportions of the various cell wall constituents, however. The capabilities of biotechnology can alleviate this conundrum by tailoring the chemical composition of plants to be more favorable for conversion to sugars, fuels, etc. Increases in the total biomass yield, cellulose content, or conversion efficiency through, for example, a reduction in lignin content, are pathways being evaluated to genetically improve plants for use in manufacturing biofuels and bio-based chemicals. Although plants have been previously domesticated for food and fiber production, the collection of phenotypic traits prerequisite for biofuel production may necessitate new genetic breeding schemes. Given the plethora of potential plants available for exploration, rapid analytical methods are needed to more efficiently screen through the bulk of samples to hone in on which feedstocks contain the desired chemistry for subsequent conversion to valuable, renewable commodities. The standard methods for analyzing biomass and related intermediates and finished products are laborious, potentially toxic, and/or destructive. They may also necessitate a complex data analysis, significantly increasing the experimental time and add unwanted delays in process monitoring, where delays can incur in significant costs. Advances in <b>thermochemical</b> and spectroscopic <b>techniques</b> have enabled the screening of thousands of plants for different phenotypes, such as cell-wall cellulose, non-cellulosic polysaccharide, and lignin composition, lignin monomer composition, or monomeric sugar release. Some instrumental methods have been coupled with multivariate analysis, providing elegant chemometric predictive models enabling the accelerated identification of potential feedstocks. In addition to the use of high-throughput analytical methods for the characterization of feedstocks based on phenotypic metrics, rapid instrumental techniques have been developed for the real-time monitoring of diverse processes, such as the efficacy of a specific pretreatment strategy, or the formation of end products, such as biofuels and biomaterials. Real-time process monitoring techniques are needed for all stages of the feedstocks-to-biofuels conversion process in order to maximize efficiency and lower costs by monitoring and optimizing performance. These approaches allow researchers to adjust experimental conditions during, rather than at the conclusion, of a process, thereby decreasing overhead expenses. This Frontiers Research Topic explores options for the modification of biomass composition and the {{conversion of}} these feedstocks into to biofuels or biomaterials and the related innovations in methods for the analysis of the composition of plant biomass, and advances in assessing up- and downstream processes in real-time.
