25|$|The taxicabs of the United States make up {{a mature}} system; most U.S. cities have a {{licensing}} scheme which restricts the number of taxicabs allowed.

25|$|The {{player can}} partake {{in a variety}} of {{optional}} side missions that can boost their character's attributes or provide another source of income.

New additions include burglary missions, pimping missions, truck and train driving missions requiring players to make deliveries on time, and driving/flying/boating/biking schools, which help players learn skills and techniques to use in their corresponding vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Pedicabs are {{a common}} form of {{transport}} for weekend revellers, with the number operating in Edinburgh growing from only 2 in 2000 to 60 by 2008. This {{has led to a}} growing number of complaints from <b>taxi</b> <b>cab</b> drivers, who resent the competition. In one dispute, a pedicab cyclist was reported to have been attacked by a group of three taxi drivers, who kicked and headbutted him. In other cases, taxi drivers have thrown cigarette butts at pedicab cyclists, and in one case, threatened a cyclist with a Taser stun gun (possession of such a device is illegal in Scotland).|$|E
25|$|On July 11, 1947, a {{group of}} Irgun men {{retrieved}} weapons, chloroform, cloths and ropes from a hidden cache. After the recent failures, the Irgun militants in Netanya were skeptical regarding the chances of this kidnapping attempt. Because of this they {{did not go to}} any great lengths to cover their tracks, considering the complicated operation they were planning: they did not steal or borrow a vehicle or bring in non-local members who {{were less likely to be}} recognized. Furthermore, Yosef Meller, a longtime Netanya resident and newly recruited Irgun member, volunteered to use his black <b>taxi</b> <b>cab,</b> which was well known around town, for the kidnapping. The abduction operation was led by Benjamin Kaplan, who had been freed in the Acre Prison break. At nightfall one basic precaution was taken; the taxi's license plates were changed in an attempt to prevent it being recognized in the course of the abduction.|$|E
25|$|This {{meant that}} a group of car valeters, {{although}} described in their contracts as being self-employed, with a right to substitute another person to do their work, and professed to have no obligation to undertake work, were entitled to a minimum wage and paid leave. The contract terms could be disregarded because they did not represent the reality of the situation. In addition, a ‘worker’ is defined in ERA 1996 section 230 as someone with a contract of employment or who personally performs work and is not a client or a customer. This concept has greater scope, and protects more people, than does the term ‘employee’. This class of person is entitled to a safe system of work, a minimum wage and limits on working time, as well as discrimination and trade union rights, but not job security, child care and retirement rights. This concept thus reaches up to protect people who are quasi-self-employed professionals, such as partners of a law firm. People will also be workers but not employees when they are not so vulnerable, and relatively independent from their employers, such as home cleaners, music teachers who visit a student home, or independent <b>taxi</b> <b>cab</b> drivers. However, if they are employed through an agency, they will be employees in relation to the agency. Though not entitled to employee rights, these workers may form trade unions and take collective action under UK, EU and international law, to protect their interests.|$|E

500|$|Other critics, however, likened Grand Theft Auto III to The Legend of Zelda and Metroid, {{as well as}} Shenmue in particular, {{and noted}} how GTA III had {{combined}} elements from previous games and fused them together into a new immersive experience. For instance, radio stations had been implemented earlier in games such as Sega's Out Run (1986) and Maxis' SimCopter (1996), open-ended missions based on operating a <b>taxi</b> <b>cab</b> in a sandbox environment were the basis for Sega's Crazy Taxi (1999), the ability to kill non-player characters dated back to action role-playing games like [...] (1985), and Final Fantasy Adventure (1991), {{and the way in}} which players run over pedestrians and get chased by police has been compared to Pac-Man (1980).|$|E
