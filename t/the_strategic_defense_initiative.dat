5|$|Hansell lectured on {{the theory}} of {{precision}} air attack throughout his life, particularly at the United States Air Force Academy and the Air War College. He authored three books on air strategy: The Air War Plan That Defeated Hitler (1972), The Strategic Air War Against Japan (1980), and Strategic Air War Against Germany and Japan: A Memoir (1986). Hansell continued to study modern weapons systems, becoming an advocate of <b>the</b> <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative</b> and the B-2 Spirit bomber. However his main focus was in promoting technical advances in precision guided weapons to make precision bombing more practical and therefore more desirable as a military strategy.|$|E
5|$|In all, Ferraro served three two-year terms, being re-elected in 1980 and 1982. Her vote shares {{increased}} to 58percent and then 73percent {{and much of}} her funding came from political action committees. While Ferraro's pro-choice views conflicted with those of many of her constituents {{as well as the}} Catholic Church to which she belonged, her positions on other social and foreign policy issues were in alignment with the district. She broke with her party in favoring an anti-busing amendment to the Constitution. She supported deployment of the PershingII missile and the Trident submarine, although she opposed funding for the MX missile, the B-1B bomber, and <b>the</b> <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{influence was}} the speech made by President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983 announcing <b>the</b> <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative</b> (SDI) which, using ground-based and space-based systems, proposed protecting the United States from attack by nuclear missiles. One of {{the supporters of}} SDI was one-time US presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche, on whom Kennedy Martin based the character of Jerry Grogan, owner of the Fusion Corporation of Kansas. Kennedy Martin was also influenced by the culture of secrecy surrounding the UK's policy regarding nuclear power {{in light of the}} inquiry into the construction of the Sizewell B nuclear power station and the concerns about the safety record of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant; this led him to conceive International Irradiated Fuels and its chief executive Robert Bennett.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and <b>the</b> <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative.</b> Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Strategic</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Initiative</b> (SDI) was a {{proposed}} {{missile defense system}} intended to protect the United States from attack by ballistic strategic nuclear weapons (intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles).

Its beam can be seen for very long distances and seems to interfere with the mechanical minds of Stalkers. Only Shrike's Old-Tech Stalker brain has the mettle to withstand this, although he goes into a fit-like state and it is hinted he is saved by Dr Oenone Zero. Anna Fang is unaffected.
