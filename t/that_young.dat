5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not want}} the character to be <b>that</b> <b>young.</b>|$|E
5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests <b>that</b> <b>young</b> {{people were being}} let down by the education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds. The government were hopeful that the changes would {{have an effect on}} preventing the increase in crime levels, as figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning to a life of crime, with many being unable to find suitable work due to lack of skills and qualifications.|$|E

40|$|Are young {{consumers}} {{easier to}} attract? We {{shed some light}} on the presumption <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> consumers are less loyal to brands and more willing than older consumers to try new brands. Analysis of 230 brands from 12 categories revealed a tendency for new and growing brands to skew towards younger consumers. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> consumers are slightly easier for brands to attract. The most plausible explanation is <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> consumers {{are more likely to be}} new buyers of the category. We therefore caution that our results do not support a marketing strategy strongly targeting younger consumers. If a brand grows, then it is likely to attract a slightly disproportionate number of younger consumers. However, it does not follow that, if it seeks largely to attract younger consumers, it will grow. ...|$|R
5|$|At {{the age of}} 10 Władysław {{received}} his own prince court. Władysław formed a friendship with Adam Kazanowski and his brother, Stanisław. It is reported <b>that</b> <b>young</b> Władysław was interested in arts; later this led to him becoming an important patron of arts. He spoke and wrote in German, Italian and Latin. Władysław was liked by the szlachta (Polish nobility), but his father's plans to secure him the throne of Poland (vivente rege) were unpopular and eventually crushed in the Zebrzydowski Rebellion (rokosz).|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of words <b>that</b> <b>young</b> children {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E
5|$|Ferb {{was given}} a simplistic {{structure}} so <b>that</b> <b>young</b> audiences {{would be able to}} draw him easily. As with the other characters of Phineas and Ferb, Ferb's design is constructed of geometric shapes in homage to animator Tex Avery. Ferb's head is based on a rectangle with a wider top than bottom. A square is used for his nose, and an egg-shaped oval is used for his eyes. The eye furthest from the screen is always drawn larger than the other. Povenmire uses a nine-step process to draw Ferb, starting with his head and ending with touch ups.|$|E

5|$|Figures were {{published}} in June 2006 showing that 76.2% of all young people aged 16–18 are already in further education or training, meaning that the rise might only affect around 25% {{of young people who}} may have otherwise sought employment immediately upon finishing compulsory education. This did not specifically state <b>that</b> <b>young</b> people would remain in secondary school, but rather by law be required to continue their education full or part-time, whether that be in sixth form, college or work based training.|$|E
5|$|Further, young giraffes {{are much}} more {{vulnerable}} to predation than adults: between 60% and 75% of calves die within a year. Mothers hide their calves, which spend {{much of the time}} lying down in cover. Since the presence of a mother does not affect survival, Mitchell suggests <b>that</b> <b>young</b> giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged. This is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited. Conversely, far from hiding, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves even from lions.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, David O. Selznick's Vanguard Films {{produced}} a short film, Reward Unlimited, {{to promote the}} Cadet Nurse Corps. Starring Dorothy McGuire {{in one of her}} first films, and directed by Jacques Tourneur, the 10-minute film was exhibited in theaters and at Cadet Nurse Corps recruitment events in 1944 and 1945. The story, by Mary C. McCall, Jr., dramatizes the choice <b>that</b> <b>young</b> Peggy Adams makes to become a nurse, her training, and her volunteering for military nursing service. The cast includes Aline MacMahon, James Brown, Spring Byington and Tom Tully.|$|E

5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, it has been said <b>that</b> <b>Young</b> was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out <b>that</b> <b>Young</b> described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the February 2016 New Hampshire Democratic primary, Ratajkowski {{spoke at}} a Bernie Sanders rally in New Hampshire to endorse his campaign.

30|$|The {{study also}} showed <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> patients’ ages are {{associated}} with higher risk of developing vasospasm following aSAH.

Moreover, they recommended aggressive triple H-therapy in this group of patients immediately after the sealing of the aneurysm.|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{rate and}} gene age are interrelated when {{the age of}} a gene is {{assessed}} by the taxonomic distribution in the gene family.

In fact, we observe <b>that</b> <b>younger</b> proteins tend to evolve faster than older ones.

5|$|Recordings {{with the}} Parental Advisory label are often {{released}} alongside censored versions that {{reduce or eliminate}} the questionable material. Several retailers will distribute all varieties of the product, occasionally with an increased price for censored versions, while some sellers offer the amended pressings as their main options and choose not to distribute the explicit counterparts. However, the label has been questioned for its perceived ineffectiveness in limiting the amount of inappropriate material <b>that</b> <b>young</b> audiences are exposed to.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of bold skin markings {{does not in}} itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage, as that depends on its behaviour. For example, although giraffes have a high contrast pattern that could be disruptive coloration, the adults are extremely conspicuous when in the open. Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at even a few metres' distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage. A different explanation is implied by the fact <b>that</b> <b>young</b> giraffes are far more vulnerable to predation than adults: {{more than half of}} all giraffe calves die within a year, and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their mothers are away feeding. Since the {{presence of}} a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued <b>that</b> <b>young</b> giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged; this is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited.|$|E
5|$|The {{progressive}} {{movement in}} the United States was at its height during the early 20th century.
