5|$|Although not {{the pilot}} in command, {{according}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> voice recorder transcript, {{the first officer}} was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident. In the National Transportation Safety Board report on the crash, investigators concluded that the likely cause of the crash was pilot error.|$|E
5|$|The cannon is in a {{compartment}} {{beneath the}} cockpit, {{mounted on a}} load-bearing beam attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> floor and the forward fuselage support structure. The nose is fitted with distinctive twin pitot probes and hinges up for service access.|$|E
50|$|Modifications {{were later}} made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> of both LLRV’s <b>to</b> better {{simulate}} <b>the</b> actual Lunar Module. These included {{the addition of}} the LM’s three-axis hand controller and throttle. A Styrofoam cockpit enclosure was also added <b>to</b> simulate <b>the</b> pilot’s restricted view in the LM.|$|R
2500|$|The initial MD-90s feature an EFIS <b>cockpit</b> similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MD-88's <b>cockpit.</b> [...] <b>The</b> 29 MD-90s {{delivered}} to Saudi Arabian Airlines feature a full glass cockpit with avionics and an overhead display panel similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> MD-11's <b>cockpit</b> for easy transition for the airline's pilots of the MD-11, also {{operated by the}} airline.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> plane began <b>to</b> flood. <b>The</b> tugboat's captain {{then broke}} <b>the</b> aircraft's {{windshield}} <b>to</b> tie a cable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit's</b> control wheel and proceeded <b>to</b> tow <b>the</b> craft <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river bank. During the tow all passengers remained on board. Passengers and crew then evacuated the cabin via an access hatch on the plane's roof.|$|R
5|$|In 2016, Cathay Pacific, Dragonair's Parent Company, {{announced}} {{that they would be}} re-branding Dragonair to Cathay Dragon. For this change, a new livery has been adopted. The new livery is similar to Cathay Pacific's new livery in the tail logo and font. The major difference is instead of the Cathay Pacific green theme, it has a light maroon theme. The titles say Cathay Dragon along with Chinese lettering reading the name. Dragonair's Dragon logo has been retained and appears next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> windows. Airbus A330-300, B-HYQ, was the first aircraft to wear the new livery.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistani negotiators {{inadvertently}} {{reveal the}} name of radio engineer Ali, whom the hijackers bring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> to use the radio for negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on, the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|E
5|$|According {{to flight}} attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong, who {{contacted}} American Airlines during the hijacking, the hijackers had stabbed flight attendants Karen Martin and Barbara Arestegui and slashed {{the throat of}} passenger Daniel Lewin. Lewin, an American-Israeli Internet entrepreneur who understood Arabic, had served as {{an officer in the}} elite Sayeret Matkal special operations unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B. The 9/11 Commission suggested that Suqami may have stabbed and killed Lewin after he attempted to stop the hijacking. Lewin {{is believed to be the}} first fatality in the 9/11 attacks. During a four-minute call to the American Airlines operations center, Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack of access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> and passenger injuries. She provided the seat locations of the hijackers, which later helped investigators to determine their identities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{ambient light}} of cockpit is usually under mesopic vision, and it’s mainly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit’s</b> interior. In this paper, a SB model is come up <b>to</b> simplify <b>the</b> {{relationship}} between the mesopic luminous efficiency and the different photometric and colorimetric variables in <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network is demonstrated classifying and selecting samples. A Back-Propagation (BP) network can automatically learn the relationship between material characteristics and mesopic luminous efficiency. Comparing with the MOVE model, SB model can quickly calculate the mesopic luminous efficiency with certain accuracy...|$|R
5|$|On 2 May 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{issued a}} Safety Recommendation {{document}} that included an interim {{summary of the}} investigation to date, {{as well as some}} immediate safety recommendations that the NTSB believes should be implemented by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to enhance flight safety. The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) outage, unknown to its flight crew prior to the collision, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cockpit</b> Voice Recorder (CVR):Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the collision avoidance system in the Legacy airplane was not functioning {{at the time of the}} accident, thereby disabling the system's ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR data indicate that the flight crew was unaware that the collision avoidance system was not functioning until after the accident.|$|E
5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the circuit. The report also made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that {{it would not have been}} possible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> design. The report also revealed that the fail-safe for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.|$|E
5|$|Two {{parallel}} investigations were undertaken, one by HSL {{and one by}} Namdal Police District. The latter criticized the former because there were not given access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> voice recorder (CVR). Since 1989 both {{the police and the}} prosecuting authority had not been represented in the accident investigations. HSL emphasized that they had no legal obligation to submit the tapes to the police, that the police had not asked for the tapes after Widerøe Flight 839 in 1990 and that the Ministry of Transport and Communications supported this line. The reason for the rules was that the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want the records from the CVR to be used in criminal cases against pilots. The investigation board stated that they would forward any information which supported criminal violations, while Namdal Police District stated that it was necessary for an independent police investigation to identify any criminal violations. The Norwegian Data Inspectorate's director Georg Apenes supported the police in their request for the tapes.|$|E
25|$|Direction {{relative}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{aircraft and}} <b>cockpit.</b> A beam aimed directly at an incoming aircraft gives <b>the</b> greatest risk <b>to</b> pilots. One aimed across the aircraft's travel gives less risk, partially because the light enters {{through the side}} windows, and partially because it is harder <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> beam aimed exactly at <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> area. A beam aimed straight up gives the least risk, although {{it is still possible}} for <b>the</b> beam <b>to</b> illuminate <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> during a banking turn.|$|R

5|$|The {{flight data}} {{recorder}} stopped recording at 22:25:40 AT (01:25:40 UTC), followed one second later by the cockpit voice recorder. The aircraft briefly appeared again on radar screens from 22:25:50 AT (01:25:50 UTC) to 22:26:04 AT (01:26:04 UTC). The last altitude recorded was 9,700 feet. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> voice recorder, shortly after the first emergency declaration, the captain left his seat to fight the fire that was spreading {{to the rear of}} the cockpit; the Swissair volume of checklists was later found fused together in the wreckage, indicating that the captain may have attempted to use them to fan back the flames. The captain did not return to his seat; whether he was killed by the fire, asphyxiated by the smoke, or killed in the crash is not known. Flight data recording shows that engine two was shut down due to an engine fire approximately one minute before impact, implying that the first officer was still alive and continued trying to fly the aircraft until the final moments of the flight. At 22:31:18 AT (01:31:18 UTC), the aircraft struck the ocean at an estimated speed of 345mph (555km/h, 154m/s, or 299 knots) and with a force of the order of 350g, causing the aircraft to disintegrate instantly. The crash location was approximately , +/-300meters.|$|E

25|$|The Dr.I {{suffered}} other deficiencies. The pilot's {{view was}} poor during takeoff and landing. The cockpit was cramped and furnished with materials of inferior quality. Furthermore, {{the proximity of}} the gun butts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> combined with inadequate crash padding, left the pilot vulnerable to serious head injury {{in the event of a}} crash landing.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the main}} changes made from the {{preceding}} Moth series was necessitated {{by a desire to}} improve access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front <b>cockpit,</b> since <b>the</b> training requirement specified that the front seat occupant {{had to be able to}} escape easily, especially when wearing a parachute. Access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front <b>cockpit</b> of <b>the</b> Moth predecessors was restricted by the proximity of the aircraft's fuel tank directly above <b>the</b> front <b>cockpit</b> and <b>the</b> rear cabane struts for the upper wing. The solution adopted was <b>to</b> shift <b>the</b> upper wing forward but sweep <b>the</b> wings back <b>to</b> maintain <b>the</b> centre of lift. Other changes included a strengthened structure, fold-down doors on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> and a revised exhaust system.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, in <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> <b>the</b> pilots work <b>to</b> {{overcome}} a developing mechanical problem that endangers the aircraft. They realize they must make {{an emergency landing}} as they pass over the orange-producing town of Finleyville, California. Unbeknownst <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pilots, the arachnids have escaped and begin <b>to</b> swarm <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> attacking <b>the</b> pilots. The plane crash-lands near Finleyville.|$|R
50|$|Passengers on {{the plane}} heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes, and {{organized}} a brief assault <b>to</b> retake <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> <b>The</b> hijackers crashed the plane into the Pennsylvanian countryside rather than cede control of the plane. All aboard died.|$|R
25|$|As {{the seat}} moved further {{up and out}} of the {{aircraft}} a lanyard attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> floor fired a steel rod, known as the drogue gun, this extracted two small parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. The occupant then released themselves from the seat harness and operated the main parachute manually by pulling a ripcord.|$|E
25|$|Other Anderson shows {{influenced}} the Space: 1999 spacecraft and elements. The cockpit of the Eagle has a slight resemblance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> {{of an earlier}} Anderson Supermarionation series, Fireball XL5. Thruster and engine sounds {{were similar to those}} previously used in Fireball XL5, Thunderbirds, and Captain Scarlet. Lighting effects for Moonbase Alpha were comparable to those from UFO, as well as the concept of the elevating spacecraft launch pad.|$|E
25|$|It was {{proposed}} that a He 111 bomber would carry either {{one or two}} Reichenbergs beneath its wings, releasing them close to the target. The pilots would then steer their aircraft towards the target, jettisoning the cockpit canopy shortly before impact and bailing out. It was estimated that {{the chances of a}} pilot surviving such a bailout were less than 1% due to the proximity of the pulsejet's intake <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b>|$|E

50|$|The shuttle stops {{unexpectedly}} mid-route, and {{the pilot}} reassures everyone that they are fine. The Doctor uses his psychic paper to get himself into <b>the</b> <b>cockpit,</b> where <b>the</b> driver and mechanic report that <b>the</b> engines seem <b>to</b> be operating normally {{but they are not}} moving. The Doctor encourages them <b>to</b> open <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> shields <b>to</b> see out, and before the radiation forces them <b>to</b> close <b>the</b> shields the mechanic swears that he saw something moving towards them. The driver sends out a distress call and a rescue shuttle is dispatched but will take some time to arrive. Soon, a rhythmic knocking starts on the hull of the shuttle. <b>The</b> knocking seems <b>to</b> be mimicking <b>the</b> sounds the passengers make on the walls. The knocking moves around <b>the</b> hull <b>to</b> where a passenger named Sky is cowering, then the shuttle is rocked and the lights fail. The hostess opens <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> doors only <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> has been torn off the shuttle.|$|R
25|$|Flight 130 was a {{domestic}} scheduled service from Torslanda Airport in Gothenburg to Stockholm Arlanda Airport. On board were {{a crew of}} 4 and 86 passengers. A few minutes after the aircraft departed at 16:30, two of the hijackers made their way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit.</b> They pointed their guns at a flight attendant and demanded that the aircraft divert to Bulltofta Airport in Malmö. The pilots followed the orders. The pilot released the hijacking alert at 16:51 and the aircraft landed at Bulltofta at 17:10.|$|E
25|$|The {{most serious}} {{handicap}} was the low production {{rate of the}} type. According to some reports, in excess of 22,000 hours in production time was attributed {{to the use of}} antiquated construction technology. A lack of official directives regarding standardisation was also viewed as having negatively impacted mass production efforts, particularly in light of the lack of key resources available in Italy during the era. In order to improve the rate of output, the C.200 remained almost unchanged throughout its production life, save for adjustments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> in response to pilot feedback.|$|E
25|$|As {{the seat}} moves further {{up and out}} of the {{aircraft}} the rocket pack is fired by a lanyard attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> floor. A steel rod, known as the drogue gun, is fired and extracts two small parachutes to stabilise the seat's descent path. A barostatic mechanism prevents the main parachute from opening above an altitude of 10,000ft (3,000m) A time delay mechanism operates the main parachute below this altitude in conjunction with another device to prevent the parachute opening at high speed. The seat then separates from the occupant for a normal parachute descent, a manual separation handle is provided should the automatic system fail.|$|E

50|$|By 2000s railway standards, E.636s {{were old}} and uncomfortable. The {{original}} design of <b>the</b> <b>cockpits</b> proved absolutely unfit to modern safety standards: this {{was shown in}} an accident in 1996 at Sulmona, where the engine driver died despite the low speed, without being able <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>cockpit</b> in time. 200 units were therefore rebuilt and stripped of all asbestos.|$|R
