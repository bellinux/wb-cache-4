50|$|The Arrowbile first flew on 21 February 1937, {{making it}} a close {{contemporary}} of the Gwinn Aircar, and a second prototype {{with a number of}} minor modifications followed. Studebaker were interested in the Arrowbile because of the use of their engine and ordered five. The third Arrowbile was the first of this order. However there was little market response and the line was halted in 1938, with no more production aircraft completed. The production aircraft had several changes, some of which aimed to emphasise the similarities with cars; there was a radiator grille with a single headlight centrally above it and also car <b>type</b> doors and <b>petrol</b> filler cap.|$|R
5000|$|Ireland ordered {{its first}} 2 Landsverk L180s in 1937 and where {{delivered}} the following year. 6 more were then ordered {{and they were}} delivered in 1939. A further 5 were ordered but could not be delivered because of {{the outbreak of the}} world war. These 5 were used instead by the Swedish army under the designation Pbil m/41. Irish Landsverk L180s where armed with a Madsen 20mm Cannon and 2 Madsen [...]303 Machine Guns. The Madsen machine guns where replaced with [...]30 Browning machine guns in the 1950s and the 20mm cannon was replaced in the 1970s with Hispano-Suiza 20mm cannons take from former Irish Air Corps De Havilland Vampire jets. In the 1950s the Landsverks engines were replaced with 5,195cc Ford V8 <b>type</b> 317 <b>petrol</b> developing 155 hp at 3,200rpm. All Irish Landsverks belonged to the 1st Armoured Squadron and used alongside the Irish built Leyland and Dodge Armoured Cars until they re-equip with Panhard AML armoured cars in 1972. The Landsverks were then transferred to the reserve FCA units, five going to the 11th Motor Squadron and three to the 3rd Motor Squadron until they were all retired in the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The Suburban {{was offered}} {{with the choice}} of either a 5.7-liter Vortec V8, {{producing}} [...] and 447 Nm of torque, or a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8 outputting [...] and 583 Nm. The former choice was designated the [...] "1500" [...] name, while the turbodiesel saw the [...] "2500" [...] identify. The 5.7-liter petrol engine is LPG-compatible, and such systems can be retrofitted if desired. Regardless of the engine specified, the car was equipped with a four-speed automatic transmission. However, what differed was the <b>type</b> of transmission. <b>Petrol</b> motors were fitted with the GM 4L60-E transmission, with the GM 4L80-E reserved for the diesel. A dashboard switch allows the vehicle to power all four wheels simultaneously, or just the rear wheels, and even allows for the low range gearing to instigate.|$|R
50|$|Initially the Fortuner {{was sold}} with 4 {{different}} <b>types</b> of 2 <b>petrol</b> engines and 2 diesel engines. All variants were offered in RWD or 4WD configuration, with 5-speed manual transmission and a 4 or 5-speed automatic transmission. Its high body {{model has been}} criticized as unstable, and not aerodynamic when running at higher speeds. In August 2012, the 2.5 L common-rail turbodiesel 2KD-FTV and the 3.0 L common-rail turbodiesel 1KD-FTV engine was upgraded to include a variable nozzle turbocharger (VNT) to increase power and torque about 60%, also reducing fuel consumption up to 30%. With this VNT equipment, now Fortuner can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) in about 11 seconds (less than 10 seconds for 3.0 L engine). It was launched to commemorate Pertamina's successful expedition from Jakarta, Indonesia to Venice, Italy (a distance of roughly 20,000 kilometers) using a group of Fortuners.|$|R
5000|$|Scheidt & Bachmann {{was founded}} in 1872 as a {{manufacturer}} of textile machinery and small steam-driven engines for industrial use. Its earliest diversification was into railway signal control systems, which became its main area of business until 1932. At that time, the company developed and began to manufacture a new <b>type</b> of hand-operated <b>petrol</b> pump. Further diversification occurred in the 1960s, when Scheidt & Bachmann developed control, access and management systems for public car parks and, subsequently, public leisure facilities such as swimming pools and council-owned leisure centres. [...] The company's first entry into the ticket issuing and fare collection systems market came in 1978. The technology was initially derived from car park control systems, and was later developed further and refined.

40|$|Total {{petroleum}} hydrocarbons (TPH) are important environmental contaminants which are toxic to human and environmental receptors. Several analytical {{methods have been}} used to quantify TPH levels in contaminated soils, specifically through infrared spectrometry (IR) and gas chromatography (GC). Despite being two of the most used techniques, some issues remain that have been inadequately studied: a) applicability of both techniques to soils contaminated with two distinct <b>types</b> of fuel (<b>petrol</b> and diesel), b) influence of the soil natural organic matter content on the results achieved by various analytical methods, and c) evaluation of the performance of both techniques in analyses of soils with different levels of contamination (presumably non-contaminated and potentially contaminated). The main objectives of this work were to answer these questions and to provide more complete information about the potentials and limitations of GC and IR techniques. The results led us to the following conclusions: a) IR analysis of soils contaminated with petrol is not suitable due to volatilisation losses, b) there is a significant influence of organic matter in IR analysis, and c) both techniques demonstrated the capacity to accurately quantify TPH in soils, irrespective of their contamination levels...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has described the}} restructuring of particles upon exposure to organic vapours; however, as yet hypotheses able to explain this phenomenon are limited. In this study, a range of experiments were performed to explore different hypotheses related to carbonaceous particle restructuring upon exposure to organic and water vapours, such as: the effect of surface tension, the role of organics in flocculating primary particles, {{as well as the}} ability of vapours to “wet” the particle surface. The change in mobility diameter (dm) was investigated for a range carbonaceous particle <b>types</b> (diesel exhaust, <b>petrol</b> exhaust, cigarette smoke, candle smoke, particles generated in a heptane/toluene flame, and wood smoke particles) exposed to different organic (heptane, ethanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide/water (1 : 1 vol%) mixture) and water vapours. Particles were first size-selected and then bubbled through an impinger (bubbler) containing either an organic solvent or water, where particles trapped inside rising bubbles were exposed to saturated vapours of the solvent in the impinger. The size distribution of particles was simultaneously measured upstream and downstream from the impinger. A size-dependent reduction in dm was observed when bubbling diesel exhaust, particles generated in a heptane/toluene flame, and candle smoke particles through heptane, ethanol and a dimethyl sulfoxide/water (1 : 1 vol %) mixture. In addition, the size distributions of particles bubbled through an impinger were broader. Moreover, an increase of the geometric standard deviation (σ) of the size distributions of particles bubbled through an impinger was also found to be size-dependent. Size-dependent reduction in dm and an increase of σ indicate that particles undergo restructuring to a more compact form, which was confirmed by TEM analysis. However, bubbling of these particles through water did not result in a size-dependent reduction in dm, nor in an increase of σ. Cigarette smoke, petrol exhaust, and wood smoke particles did not result in any substantial change in dm, or σ, when bubbled through organic solvents or water. Therefore, size-dependent reduction in the dm upon bubbling through organic solvents was observed only for particles that had a fractal-like structure, whilst particles that were liquid or were assumed to be spherical did not exhibit any reduction in dm. Compaction of fractal-like particles was attributed to the ability of condensing vapours to efficiently wet the particles. Our results also show that the presence of an organic layer on the surface of fractal-like particles, or the surface tension of the condensed liquid do not influence the extent of compaction...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{health hazards}} {{associated}} with air pollution from motor exhaust have received increasing attention. Lung {{cancer and heart}} disease have been linked to air pollution exposure. However, the knowledge concerning exposure levels, is insufficient, but is essential for risk assessment. This thesis is aimed at improving our knowledge about exposure to motor exhaust related air pollutants, particularly in the Stockholm region. In paper I, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) levels were measured at 42 different sites in the Stockholm area. NO 2 concentrations were measured with passive dosimeters during four two-week periods per observation site. Similar measurements were performed in Munich, Germany and in the Netherlands. Season-adjusted mean values varied from 11 to 29 mug/m 3 at the different types of sites in Sweden. In the other countries the levels were higher, although street levels in central parts of the cities were similar. Upon comparison, the passive dosimeter method underestimated the levels in Sweden compared to the reference method, chemiluminescence, for annual mean values, although there was a wide variance for individual measurement periods. Papers II, III and IV investigate occupational exposure to motor exhaust. Paper II is a comparative study of 121 taxi, bus and lorry drivers in the Stockholm region. NO 2 was measured using portable passive dosimeters, and particle concentration within the size range 0. 1 10 mum was measured with a real-time monitoring light scattering instrument. For both particles and NO 2, taxi drivers had the lowest exposure, the lorry drivers the highest and the bus drivers exposure were in between the others. The group mean exposure concentration varied between 48 and 68 mug/m 3 for NO 2 and between 26 and 57 mug/m 3 for particles. The number of occupations included as well as the measured indicator substances was expanded in study III. In all 71 subjects were included, divided into 7 groups depending on place of work (indoor, outdoor, vehicle driver) and <b>type</b> of fuel (<b>petrol</b> or diesel). In addition to the indicators used in paper II, particles were measured in the size ranges PM 1 (aerodynamic diameter < 1. 0 mum), PM 2. 5 (aerodynamic diameter < 2. 5 mum). A chemical analysis was performed in order to ascertain levels of elementary carbon, EC, and total carbon, TC. Exposure to NO 2 and all particle fractions was considerably higher for the group construction workers in road tunnels than for any other group. Many of the other groups showed surprisingly similar exposure levels for both NO 2 and particles. Outdoor workers experienced the lowest exposure to NO 2 while the driver groups were exposed to the lowest levels of some of the particle fractions. Drivers and outdoor workers were exposed to similar levels of EC, 4 8 mug/m 3, indoor workers 11 12 mug/m 3, with tunnel workers exposed to 87 mug/m 3. All of the observed groups of workers were exposed to higher levels of NO 2 than urban background levels in Stockholm. In conclusion, the work in my thesis demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} quantify geographical differences in the concentration of NO 2 with a simple method at different types of sites in metropolitan areas. In Stockholm County NO 2 levels were three times as high in City streets compared with suburban Järfälla. Our knowledge of occupational exposure to NO 2 and particles has been improved through the use of portable measurement equipment by approximately 200 subjects. When subjects working in tunnels were compared with a group of outdoor workers the exposure to NO 2 was about 10 times higher while exposure to EC, the fraction that most closely reflects diesel exhausts, was about 20 times higher...|$|R
