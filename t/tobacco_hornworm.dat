With dogs this can lead, in extremely rare cases, to the birth of puppies with green fur; however, the green colour fades out soon after birth. In the garfish (Belone belone) and related species, the bones are bright green because of biliverdin.|$|E
25|$|Further, Nathanson fed <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworm</b> larvae {{with leaves}} sprayed with such psychoactive drugs as caffeine, {{formamidine}} pesticide didemethylchlordimeform (DDCDM), IBMX or theophylline. He observed a similar effect, namely inhibition of feeding followed by death. Nathanson concluded that caffeine and related methylxanthines could be natural pesticides developed by plants as protection against worms: Caffeine {{is found in}} many plant species, with high levels in seedlings that are still developing foliage, but are lacking mechanical protection; caffeine paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding upon the plant. High caffeine levels have also {{been found in the}} soil surrounding coffee bean seedlings. It is therefore understood that caffeine has a natural function, both as a natural pesticide and as an inhibitor of seed germination of other nearby coffee seedlings, thus giving it a better chance of survival.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Nathanson {{reported}} {{an effect of}} methylxanthines on larvae of the <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworm.</b> He administered solutions of finely powdered tea leaves or coffee beans to the larvae and observed, at concentrations between 0.3 and 10% for coffee and 0.1 to 3% for tea, inhibition of feeding, associated with hyperactivity and tremor. At higher concentrations, larvae were killed within 24 hours. He repeated the experiments with purified caffeine {{and concluded that the}} drug was responsible for the effect, and the concentration differences between coffee beans and tea leaves originated from 2â€“3 times higher caffeine content in the latter. Similar action was observed for IBMX on mosquito larvae, mealworm larvae, butterfly larvae and milkweed bug nymphs, that is, inhibition of feeding and death at higher doses. Flour beetles were unaffected by IBMX up to 3% concentrations, but long-term experiments revealed suppression of reproductive activity.|$|E

50|$|Herbivores {{generate}} {{enzymes that}} counter {{and reduce the}} effectiveness of numerous toxic secondary metabolic products produced by plants. One such enzyme group, mixed function oxidases (MFOs), detoxify harmful plant compounds by catalyzing oxidative reactions. Cytochrome P450 oxidases (or P-450), a specific class of MFO, have been specifically connected to detoxification of plant secondary metabolic products. One group linked herbivore feeding on plant material protected by chemical defenses with P-450 detoxification in larval <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworms.</b> The induction of P-450 after initial nicotine ingestion allowed the larval <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworms</b> to increase feeding on the toxic plant tissues.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tobacco</b> <b>hornworms</b> are facultative specialists; {{the larvae}} can grow and develop on any host plants. However, the larvae prefer solanaceous plants, such as tobacco and tomato plants. On {{these types of}} plants, larvae grow and develop faster. The lateral and medial sensilla styloconia, which are sensory receptors, on their {{mouthparts}} help them to identify solanaceous plants by recognizing indioside D, a steroidal glycoside found in those particular plants (del Campo et al., 2001). <b>Tobacco</b> <b>hornworms</b> are considered pests because they feed on the upper leaves of tobacco plants and leave green or black droppings on the plants. As adults, they do not damage plants since they feed on nectar.|$|R
2500|$|Some caterpillars, like early instars of {{the tomato}} hornworm and <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworm,</b> have long [...] "whip-like" [...] organs {{attached}} {{to the ends of}} their body. The caterpillar wiggles these organs to frighten away flies and predatory wasps. Some caterpillars can evade predators by using a silk line and dropping off from branches when disturbed. Many species thrash about violently when disturbed to scare away potential predators. One species (Amorpha juglandis) even makes high pitched whistles that can scare away birds.|$|E
2500|$|Caterpillars {{have been}} called [...] "eating machines", and eat leaves voraciously. Most species shed their skin {{four or five times}} as their bodies grow, and they {{eventually}} enter a pupal stage before becoming adults. Caterpillars grow very quickly; for instance, a <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworm</b> will increase its weight ten-thousandfold in less than twenty days. An adaptation that enables them to eat so much is a mechanism in a specialized midgut that quickly transports ions to the lumen (midgut cavity), to keep the potassium level higher in the midgut cavity than in the hemolymph.|$|E

40|$|Octopamine- 2 receptors, {{associated}} with activation of adenylate cyclase, mediate {{a number of}} the important hormonal and neurotransmitter functions of octopamine in invertebrates. By utilizing the highly enriched octopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase present in the firefly light organ, it has been possible to pharmacologically characterize octopamine- 2 receptors and to define a new class of highly potent and selective octopamine- 2 agonists. At low concentrations, these substituted phenyliminoimidazolidines stimulate light emission when injected into fireflies. At somewhat higher concentrations, these compounds, when ingested by <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworms,</b> cause disruption of motor and feeding behavior, leading to insect death. The effects of these compounds are markedly potentiated by phosphodiesterase inhibitors and mimicked by other activators of octopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase, including octopamine itself. Because octopamine- 2 receptors appear to be present primarily in invertebrates, these findings, together with other data, raise the possibility that potent and selective octopamine agonists could be useful as insect toxins with low toxicity in vertebrates...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) {{associated with the}} salivary glands of <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworms,</b> Manduca sexta. This enzyme is able to hydrolyze arachidonic acid from the sn- 2 position of PLs. Addition of the calcium chelator, EGTA, or calcium, to the Tris reaction buffer impaired the PLA 2 activity, from which we infer the enzyme requires very low concentrations of calcium or perhaps other ions for optimal activity. PLA 2 activity was sensitive to protein concentration (highest activity at 25 Î¼g protein per Î¼l), reaction time (optimal at 30 min), buffer pH (optimal at pH 8 â€“ 10), and reaction temperature (optimal range 18 â€“ 38 Â°C). The salivary gland PLA 2 was sensitive to the site-specific inhibitor, oleyloxyethylphosphorylcholine and stable to freezing at â€“ 80 Â°C, but not â€“ 20 Â°C. The biological significance of this enzyme may relate to hydrolysis of fatty acid moieties from dietary PLs for absorption by midgut epithelia.

40|$|Injection of L-canavanine, a {{naturally}} occurring arginine analogue, {{and of its}} metabolic derivative, L-canaline, induced almost continuous motor activity in adult <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworms,</b> Manduca sexta (L.). Initially the moths flew normally, but after a time interval that depended both on the amino acid and on the dose (1 - 45 /miol/g fresh weight) the moths became dis-orientated and muscle activity was less patterned. Canaline produced its initial effects 12 - 30 min after injection, whereas activity in response to canavanine began after a delay of i-z h. Canaline (derived from canavanine by an arginase-mediated hydrolytic cleavage) is probably the biologically active factor. Canaline did not affect axonal conduction of action potentials nor the activity of mechanoreceptors on the forewing. Canaline (22 /miol/g fresh weight) prolonged the postsynaptic potential of flight muscle fibres, but after 20 - 40 min. the electrical activity of muscle fibres was normal.

40|$|ABSTRACT Larvae of <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworms</b> offer unique {{opportunities}} {{to relate the}} electrophysiological output of identified chemosensory neurons to specific behavioral responses. Larvae can discriminate among three preferred plants with only eight functioning gustatory receptors. They can be induced to prefer {{any one of the}} plants, and these preferences can be reversed. All eight neurons respond to each plant sap. Two fire too infrequently to permit detailed analysis. Analyses ofthe remaining six show that all electrophysiological responses consist ofphasic and tonic components. Only the "salt best " cell fires during the phasic period. Temporal analysis of the spike train during this period shows that tomato and tobacco could be distinguished from Jerusalem cherry but not from each other by a rate code. Measurements of behavioral response times together with the nonspecificity of this with respect to food plants, unacceptable plants, and sodium chloride eliminate a phasic period rate code as a probable mechanism for complex discrimination. Events occurring in the tonic period, when all cells are firing, suggest a major role for this period. Analyses of variance in th...|$|R

40|$|The midgut {{contents}} of lepidopteran larvae are often several pH units more basic than the haemolymph (Berenbaum, 1980). One species, Manduca sexta, maintains a luminal pH of 11. 3 (Dow, 1984) while the haemolymph has a pH of 6. 7 - 6. 8 (Dow, 1984; Dow et al. 1984). The midgut of M. sexta {{is divided into}} three morphologically distinct regions (Cioffi, 1979), and Dow (1984) has shown that the luminal pH is greatest in the anterior and middle sections of the midgut. The posterior midgut lumen, while still more basic than the haemolymph, has a pH lower than the middle and anterior sections. Whereas these results suggest that alkaline secretion may differ {{along the length of the}} midgut, no direct measure-ments of alkaline secretion have been made.

40|$|Genes {{containing}} the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter fused to open reading frames coding for tomato proteinase inhibitor I, tomato inhibitor II, and potato inhibitor II were expressed in transgenic tobacco plants. Inhibitor I and II proteins {{were identified by}} immunoblotting and quantified by immunoradial diffusion. Both inhibitors exhibited the molecular weights found for the native proteins in their natural environments. Extracts of leaves from transformed plants contained inhibitory activities against trypsin and chymotrypsin that reflected the levels of inhibitor I or II protein present. The results demonstrate that in tobacco leaves the introns of both inhibitor I and inhibitor II genes were excised correctly and that pre and prepro inhibitor I and II proteins were correctly processed. Growth of Manduca sexta larvae (<b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworms)</b> feeding on leaves of transgenic plants containing inhibitor II, a powerful inhibitor of both trypsin and chymotrypsin, was significantly retarded, compared to growth of larvae fed untransformed leaves. Levels of inhibitor II protein as low as 50 micrograms/g of tissue moderately affected larval growth, whereas levels above 100 micrograms/g severely reduced growth. The presence of tomato inhibitor I protein, a potent inhibitor of chymotrypsin but a weak inhibitor of trypsin, in transgenic tobacco leaves {{had little effect on}} the growth of the larvae. These experiments indicated that trypsin inhibitory activity, but not chymotrypsin inhibitory activity, was mainly responsible for the inhibition of larval growth...|$|R
40|$|Within 4 hr after {{wounding}} {{the lower}} leaves of young potato and tomato plants, a rapid and remarkable change is induced in {{the cells of}} upper undamaged leaves that results in extensive lysis of protoplasts during their isolation. Protoplast yields from unwounded upper leaves, 4 hr after wounding a lower leaf by crushing with a hemostat, decreased 25 % below yields from leaves of unwounded plants. From 8 to > 20 hr after wounding, protoplast yields were {{less than half of}} those from control plants. Multiple woundings decreased yields even further, as did chewing of the lower leaves by <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworms</b> {{over a period of several}} minutes. In addition, within 4 hr of excising young tomato plants at their base with a razor blade, a 90 % decrease in leaf protoplast yields was recorded. The major loss of protoplasts induced by wounding was primarily due to an increased cell lysis during protoplast isolation. Cell lysis was apparently due to a weakened cell membrane, because newly recovered protoplasts released from leaves of wounded plants were extremely fragile and exhibited 70 % lysis during low speed centrifugation, compared to 20 % lysis of protoplasts recovered from control plants. We conclude that a signal is released by wounding that is rapidly transmitted or transported through the plants to induce a profound change in the leaf cell membranes that renders them fragile during protoplast isolation. It is proposed that this signal may play a role in inducing cellular changes in the plant cells as part of their responses to environmental stress such as pest attacks...|$|R

40|$|Nodulation is the {{predominant}} cellular defense reaction to bacterial infections in insects. Gram-negative bacteria, and the lipopolysaccharide components (LPS) purified from them, stimulate defense reactions in mammals and insects. The cellular reactions to LPS {{formed the basis}} of three hypotheses, all tested in this dissertation. First, insect cellular reactions to LPS depend on eicosanoid biosynthesis. Second, insect hemocytes discriminate in their reactions to LPS from different biological sources. Third, cellular defense reactions to bacterial infections are mediated by eicosanoids in a social insect, the honeybee, Apis mellifera. ^ On the first, purified LPS stimulated microaggregation reactions in a dose-dependent manner in larvae of the beetle, Zophobas atratus. Treatments with eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitors prior to LPS injections reduced the responses. ^ On the second hypothesis, I report on the influence of an LPS-like molecule (aLPS) from the pathogenic alga, Prototheca (Strain 289) on insect and murine innate immune reactions. I recorded nodulation reactions to aLPS in <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworms,</b> Manduca sexta. Contrarily, murine macrophages reacted to challenge with Escherichia coli LPS, but did not react to aLPS. Moreover, hornworms treated with LPS purified from E. coli produced over 200 nodules/hornworm. Insects treated with LPS prepared from other bacterial species yielded significantly fewer nodules, about 85 /hornworm for Providencia rettgeri, 30 /hornworm for Klebsiella aerogenes, and 15 /homworm for Halomonas elongata. The lipid A component of LPS is essential for the insect nodulation reaction.

40|$|Allelo{{chemicals}} (plant chemicals {{not involved}} in growth/development) play {{an essential role in}} aiding insects that store these chemicals in their ability to thwart predators and parasitoids. Relatively little research has addressed the ability of polyphagous (feeding on several different food types) herbivorous insects to self-medicate by selecting diets that moderate infection intensity (self-medication). In the specific case of Manduca exta [Tobacco Hornworm] (Sphingidae), ingestion of the alkaloid nicotine hinders the success of the parasitoid Cotesia congregata (Braconidae), yet whether <b>tobacco</b> <b>hornworms</b> witch to a diet of high nicotine concentration when infected is unclear. In this study, the ability of M. sexta to discern between diets and to choose a high-nicotine diet to battle infection, and thus self-medicate, was analyzed. The relationship between nicotine in the diet and the insectâ€™s encapsulation response (immune response against invading bodies) was also studied. I predicted that M. sexta would exhibit behavioral plasticity and choose diets of higher nicotine concentration as a response to infection, and that higher nicotine concentrations would be correlated with a greater ncapsulation response. 5 th instar (the final molting stage before pupation) M. sexta were injected with glass silica beads and subjected to a series of dietary choice tests. They were subsequently dissected to retrieve beads and rate of melanization was determined for each caterpillar. While injected M. sexta differ in their dietary choices compared to healthy larvae, nicotine does not drive a trend in dietary choice. No relationship between nicotine concentration and melanization was found, although healthy caterpillars did consume significantly more food than those that were injected.
