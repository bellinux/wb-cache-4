25|$|A <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> is {{information}} that is intentionally kept confidential and that provides a competitive advantage to its possessor. Trade secrets are protected by non-disclosure agreement and labour law, each of which prevents information leaks such as breaches of confidentiality and industrial espionage. Compared to patents, the advantages of trade secrets are {{that the value of}} a <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> continues until it is made public, whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention; does not require payment of fees to governmental agencies or filing paperwork; has an immediate effect; and does not require any disclosure of information to the public. The key disadvantage of a <b>trade</b> <b>secret</b> is its vulnerability to reverse engineering.|$|E

40|$|This paper, using Japanese firm-level data, {{presents}} {{findings about}} innovative {{activities in the}} service sector and the role of patents and <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> on innovation.

Second, service firms have a low propensity for holding patents, but their holding of <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> is comparable to that of the manufacturing firms. Third, patents and <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> have positive relationships with product innovations, and the effects are quantitatively similar in magnitude in both the manufacturing and the service sectors. On the other hand, a positive relationship between <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> and process innovations is found only in the manufacturing sector.

40|$|In {{the year}} of 2010 the Government of Indonesia started the {{discussion}} {{on the use of}} the Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) certificates as collateral by SMEs. The forms of IPRs discussed were: patents, copyrights, trademarks and lay out of integrated circuit designs. Nevertheless, actually there is one more IPRs form which is recognized by other countries, which can be used as collateral also, that is <b>trade</b> <b>secrets.</b> This work will examine three matters, why <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> were excluded from the plan; how should the Government of Indonesia change the laws to classify <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> to be used collateral and what the contents of regulations which should be amended and established to qualify <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> can be used as collateral for MSMEs. This study applied the framework of documentary research in the style of comparative legal research. Regulations which are used to make comparison with the Indonesian’s regulations are regulations related to collateralization on <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> in Australia, the USA, Thailand and the PRC. In order to get insightful from the Indonesian authorities’ perspective, the writer conducted consultations with officers of the Ministry of Cooperation and SMEs and Directorate General of IP Office of Indonesia. The finding of this study shows that, <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> were excluded from the plan to use IPRs certificates as collateral because the officer did not mention <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> explicitly like the other forms of IPRs. In order to qualify <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> as collateral, the procedures to change the law should be conducted based on the Law Number 12 Year 2011 regarding the Establishment of Regulations. There are some regulations which should be amended, The Law Number 30 Year 2000 regarding <b>Trade</b> <b>Secrets,</b> The Law Number 42 Year 1999 regarding Fiduciary matters, The Law Number 37 Year 2004 regarding Bankruptcy and Suspension of Payment and a Ministry Regulation. In addition there are some technical regulations need to be established. The finding of this study is significant for knowledge and hopefully can give contribution to the Government of Indonesia to not be reluctant to establish policies or regulation to include <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> in the plan to use certificates of IPRs as collateral. Furthermore, this study proposes recommendations on what regulations which should be amended and established to qualify <b>trade</b> <b>secrets</b> as collateral and matters which should be stated in those regulations...|$|R
25|$|Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated {{soft drink}} {{produced}} by The Coca-Cola Company. Originally intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th century by John Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century.

In the German state of Saxony, the search concluded in 1708 when Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus produced a hard, white, translucent type of porcelain specimen with a combination of ingredients, including kaolin and alabaster, mined from a Saxon mine in Colditz.
