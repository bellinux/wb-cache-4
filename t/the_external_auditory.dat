2500|$|A bone {{anchored}} {{hearing aid}} (BAHA) is an auditory prosthetic based on bone conduction {{which can be}} surgically implanted. It is an option for patients without external ear canals, when conventional hearing aids with a mould in the ear cannot be used. The BAHA uses the skull as a pathway for sound {{to travel to the}} inner ear. [...] For people with conductive hearing loss, the BAHA bypasses <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> canal and middle ear, stimulating the functioning cochlea. [...] For people with unilateral hearing loss, the BAHA uses the skull to conduct the sound from the deaf side to the side with the functioning cochlea.|$|E
2500|$|Barotrauma {{can affect}} the external, middle, or inner ear. [...] Middle ear {{barotrauma}} (MEBT) {{is the most common}} being experienced by between 10% and 30% of divers and is due to insufficient equilibration of the middle ear. [...] External ear barotrauma may occur on ascent if high pressure air is trapped in <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> canal either by tight fitting diving equipment or ear wax. [...] Inner ear barotrauma (IEBT), though much less common than MEBT, shares a similar mechanism. [...] Mechanical trauma to the inner ear can lead to varying degrees of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss as well as vertigo. It is also common for conditions affecting the inner ear to result in auditory hypersensitivity.|$|E
2500|$|This type of {{fractured}} mandible {{can involve}} one condyle (unilateral) or both (bilateral). Unilateral condylar fracture may cause restricted and painful jaw movement. There may be swelling over the temporomandibular joint region and {{bleeding from the}} ear because of lacerations to <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> meatus. [...] The hematoma may spread downwards and backwards behind the ear, which may be confused with Battle's sign (a sign of a base of skull fracture), although this is an uncommon finding so if present, intra-cranial injury must be ruled out. If the bones fracture and overlie each other there may be shortening of {{the height of the}} ramus. This results in gagging of the teeth on the fractured side (the teeth meet too soon on the fractured side, and not on the non fractured side, i.e. [...] "open bite" [...] that becomes progressively worse to the unaffected side). [...] When the mouth is opened, there may be deviation of the mandible towards the fractured side. [...] Bilateral condylar fractures may cause the above signs and symptoms, but on both sides. Malocclusion and restricted jaw movement are usually more severe. Bilateral body or parasymphysis fractures are sometimes termed [...] "flail mandible", and can cause involuntary posterior movement of the tongue with subsequent obstruction of the upper airway. Displacement of the condyle through the roof of glenoid fossa and into the middle cranial fossa is rare. Bilateral condylar fractures combined with a symphyseal fracture is sometimes termed a guardsman's fracture. The name comes from this injury occurring in soldiers who faint on parade grounds and strike the floor with their chin.|$|E

40|$|Virtual {{auditory}} space (VAS) {{refers to the}} synthesis and simulation of spatial hearing using earphones or a speaker system. High-fidelity VAS {{requires the use of}} individualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) which describe the acoutic filtering properties of <b>the</b> listener’s <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> periphery. Because HRTFs are unique for each individual (“the auditory thumbprint”), a primary hurdle in establishing high-fidelity VAS for multimedia systems requires finding a technology that can reliably generate HRTFs matched to an individual listener in an economical fashion. In this work, a generative statistical model of HRTFs for a population of 36 people was employed in a psychoacoustical experiment to examine the sensitivity of human sound localization performance (a measure of VAS fidelity), to individual differences in HRTFs. Additionally, the relationship within the population between an individual's HRTF and the morphology of <b>the</b> individual's <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> periphery was examined using methods of statistical analysis. The results indicate that the subjects were sensitive to approximately 60 % of the individual variations in the population HRTFs and that their localization performance was remarkably accurate even when accounting for only 30 % of individual variations. It is also shown that a functional model relating morphological measurements (of <b>the</b> <b>external</b> ear and head) to HRTFs is capable of reliably producing high-fidelity spatial hearing in VAS. 1...|$|R

50|$|Ceruminous glands are {{specialized}} sudoriferous glands (sweat glands) located subcutaneously in <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> canal, in {{the outer}} 1/3. Ceruminous glands are simple, coiled, tubular glands made up of an inner secretory layer of cells and an outer myoepithelial layer of cells. They are classed as apocrine glands. The glands drain into larger ducts, which then drain into the guard hairs that reside in <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> canal. Here they produce cerumen, or earwax, by mixing their secretion with sebum and dead epidermal cells. Cerumen keeps the eardrum pliable, lubricates and cleans <b>the</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditory</b> canal, waterproofs the canal, kills bacteria, {{and serves as a}} barrier to trap foreign particles (dust, fungal spores, etc.) by coating the guard hairs of the ear, making them sticky.|$|E
