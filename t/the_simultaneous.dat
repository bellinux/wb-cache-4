5|$|<b>The</b> <b>simultaneous</b> {{occurrence}} of a transit of Mercury and a transit of Venus does occur, but extremely infrequently. Such an event last occurred on 22 September 373,173 BC and will next occur on 26 July 69,163, {{and again on}} 29 March 224,508. <b>The</b> <b>simultaneous</b> {{occurrence of}} a solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is currently possible, but very rare. The next solar eclipse occurring during a transit of Venus will be on 5 April 15,232. The last time a solar eclipse occurred during a transit of Venus was on 1 November 15,607 BC. The day after the Venerean transit of 3 June 1769 there was a total solar eclipse, which was visible in Northern America, Europe and Northern Asia.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} of quantum {{mechanics}} is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which forbids <b>the</b> <b>simultaneous</b> measurement of the position and momentum of a particle along the same direction.

5|$|According to top Marine officials, the {{elections}} {{were designed to}} help enfranchise the Iraqi government by including Iraqi citizens in its formation. Only 3,775 voters (2 percent of the eligible population) cast ballots in Anbar Province due to a Sunni boycott. <b>The</b> <b>simultaneous</b> elections for the provincial council were won by the Iraqi Islamic Party, which suffered from a perceived lack of legitimacy but nevertheless would dominate the Anbar legislature until 2009.|$|E

Eventually, though, the division was committed to combat in conjunction with other North Korean units. <b>The</b> <b>simultaneous</b> attacks were hoped to overwhelm UN lines.|$|E

5|$|Famously, {{the much}} smaller Greek army held the pass of Thermopylae against the Persians {{for three days}} before being outflanked by a {{mountain}} path. Much of the Greek army retreated, before the Spartans and Thespians who had continued to block the pass were surrounded and killed. <b>The</b> <b>simultaneous</b> Battle of Artemisium was {{up to that point}} a stalemate; however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, the Allied fleet also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point.|$|E

5|$|As {{the size}} of train increased, so did the locomotives. The 4-6-0 wheel {{arrangement}} became popular for passenger and mixed traffic work with the D3 and A2 classes, and the 2-8-0 arrangement on goods with the K, J and C classes lasting into the 1960s. These were then followed by the 4-6-2 S class Pacifics for the Spirit of Progress express, and the single 4-8-4 H class locomotive H220, the biggest Victorian Railways steam locomotive. The final steam locomotives built for the Victorian Railways were the 4-6-4 R class and 2-8-0 J classes.

5|$|Bond and Amasova examine Stromberg's {{underwater}} Atlantis {{base from}} an American submarine, and confirm {{that he is}} operating the stolen tracking system. The Liparus captures the submarine. Stromberg sets his plan in motion: <b>the</b> <b>simultaneous</b> launching of nuclear missiles from British and Soviet submarines to destroy Moscow and New York City. This would trigger a global nuclear war, which Stromberg would survive in Atlantis, and subsequently a new civilisation would be established underwater. He leaves for Atlantis with Amasova. Bond escapes and frees the captured British, Russian and American sailors and they battle the Liparuss crew. Bond reprograms the submarines to fire missiles at each other, saving Moscow and New York City. The victorious submariners escape the sinking Liparus on the American submarine.|$|E
