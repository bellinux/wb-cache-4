60|$|Ned looked uncommonly knowing at this point, and {{admitted}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> rather <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could--a dozen of them, if necessary.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bragg complied, naming {{quite the}} number of persons he had mentioned, with a {{readiness}} <b>that</b> proved <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was advancing testimony of weight.|$|R
5|$|The Poor People's Campaign was {{controversial}} {{even within}} the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that {{the goals of the}} campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that these campaigns would accelerate the backlash and repression on the poor and the black.|$|E
5|$|Brocius waived the {{preliminary}} hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon {{the next day to}} Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius' pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{had said}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of King Kong {{after he had}} a dream that a giant gorilla was terrorizing New York City. When he woke, he {{recorded}} the idea and used it for the film. He {{was going to have}} a giant gorilla fight a Komodo dragon or other animal, but found that the technique of interlacing that he wanted to use would not provide realistic results.|$|E
60|$|Lance laughed. The bare idea of {{betrayal}} seemed so absurd, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> scarcely <b>thought</b> it worth removing.|$|R
60|$|Sam made no reply. He was {{literally}} dazed with fear, and just at <b>that</b> moment <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{the life of}} a detective very disagreeable.|$|R

5|$|In 1975, Wilder's agent {{sent him}} a script for a film called Super Chief. Wilder accepted, but told the film's {{producers}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{the only person who}} could keep the film from being offensive was Richard Pryor. Pryor accepted the role in the film, which had been renamed Silver Streak, the first film to team Wilder and Pryor. They became Hollywood's first successful interracial movie comedy duo.|$|E
5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – a figure <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{as good as}} his sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E
5|$|It is poetic {{justice that}} a {{helicopter}} {{is now at}} the heart of the Government's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many people}} of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President John F. Kennedy, even though he {{disagreed}} {{with the president on}} issues such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the growing involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{he was going to die}} that night. It was the only time she ever saw Ochs cry.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{included}} {{the scene in}} which Logan attacks Piz on his list of highlights from the third season. When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible groan when she saw Logan walking through the cafeteria towards Piz, anticipating the fight {{that was about to}} come. Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly and without a second unit. However, he was pleased with the final cut, stating that there was only one punch <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> looked fake.|$|E
5|$|The Cowboys {{were about}} a block {{and a half}} from the West End Corral at 2nd Street and Fremont, where Ike and Tom's wagon and team were stabled. Virgil Earp later testified <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> Ike and Tom were stabled at the O.K. Corral on Allen between 3rd and 4th, from which he thought they would be departing if they were leaving town.|$|E

5|$|When Feynman {{was nearing}} death, he asked Danny Hillis {{why he was}} so sad. Hillis replied <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> Feynman was going to die soon. Feynman said that that {{sometimes}} bothered him, too, adding, when you get to be as old as he was, and have told so many stories to so many people, even when he was dead he would not be completely gone.|$|E
5|$|Whoever had joy or gladness, Troilus {{suffered}} affliction and grief. That was for {{the daughter}} of Calchas, for he loved her deeply. He had set his whole heart on her; so mightily was he possessed by his love <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> only of her. She had given herself to him, both her body and her love. Most men knew of that.|$|E
5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E

5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|As the war {{wound down}} with Germany's {{surrender}} in mid-1945, Rymkus {{decided to join}} the new Cleveland Browns of the fledgling All-America Football Conference. Paul Brown, {{the coach of the}} new team, had met Rymkus at Great Lakes, where he coached the training station's military football squad. Brown offered Rymkus a $4,000 salary ($ today), double what he made with the Redskins. George Preston Marshall, the owner of the Redskins, declined to match the offer and questioned the wisdom of joining a league <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> had little chance of success competing against the more established NFL. Rymkus left his wife Betty in Nappanee, Indiana and hitchhiked to the Browns' training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio.|$|E

50|$|The 1949 Army Cadets {{football}} team represented the United States Military Academy in the 1949 college football season. The Cadets scored 354 points, while the defense allowed only 68 points.
