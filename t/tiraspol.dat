25|$|On September 2, 1990, <b>Tiraspol</b> was {{proclaimed the}} capital of the new Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. The new {{republic}} was not officially recognized by Soviet authorities; however, it received support from some important Soviet leaders, such as Anatoly Lukyanov. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the territory east of the Dniester River declared independence as the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR), with <b>Tiraspol</b> as its capital. It was not recognized by the international community.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, {{following}} the secret {{provisions of the}} Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the USSR forced Romania to cede Bessarabia. It integrated <b>Tiraspol,</b> until then part of the Ukrainian SSR, into the newly formed Moldavian SSR. On August 7, 1941, {{following the}} Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, the city {{was taken over by}} Romanian troops. During the occupation, <b>Tiraspol</b> was under Romanian administration. During that period almost all of its Jewish population died: they were slain in situ or deported to German Nazi death camps, where they were murdered.|$|E
25|$|Many {{that were}} to become active in the strike {{campaign}} had been suspicious of the language legislation from the beginning—they suspected {{this to be the}} first step towards “nationalization” of the republic at the expense of “their country,” the Soviet Union. However, on 10 August 1989 I. M. Zaslavskii, a deputy to the Moldavian Supreme Soviet and resident of the Transnistrian city of <b>Tiraspol,</b> leaked a new draft of the law to the factory newspaper of the “Tochlitmash” <b>Tiraspol</b> Machine-Building Factory im. Kirova. Seeing that the new version would establish Moldovan as the only official language of the MSSR, activists from a number of <b>Tiraspol</b> factories came together to create the United Work Collective Council (Ob"edinnennyi Sovet trudovykh kollektivov, OSTK) and called an immediate strike that eventually led to the shutdown of most major industrial activity (concentrated in the Transnistrian region) throughout the SSR.|$|E
25|$|The Transnistrian Ruble is {{generally}} not accepted as currency outside of Transnistria, though some bus companies with connections to <b>Tiraspol</b> accept Transnistrian rubles at the Chișinău bus station {{as well as local}} shops in Varnița.|$|E
25|$|For Transnistria {{there was}} then no other {{solution}} but to strike future coins themselves. Thus on 18 November 2005 the <b>Tiraspol</b> Mint (Тираспольский монетный двор) was {{opened in the}} presence of President Igor Smirnov.|$|E
25|$|The modern city of <b>Tiraspol</b> {{was founded}} by the Russian generalissimo Alexander Suvorov in 1792, {{although}} the area had been inhabited {{for thousands of years}} by varying ethnic groups. The city celebrates its anniversary every year on October 14.|$|E
25|$|Anatolii Ivanovich Bol’shakov: (b. 1930) general {{director}} of the <b>Tiraspol</b> ‘Tochlitmash’ Factory; Hero of Socialist Labor; deputy to the MSSR Supreme Soviet (recurrently); organizer of Interdvizhenie; deputy to the OSTK from the 'Tochlitmash' factory STK from August 1989.|$|E
25|$|Ukrainians {{were the}} third {{numerous}} ethnic group, representing a 45.41% relative {{majority in the}} northern Rîbnița District, a 42.55% minority in Camenca, a 32.97% minority in <b>Tiraspol,</b> a 28.29% minority in Dubăsari, a 23.42% minority in Slobozia, and a 17.36% minority in Grigoriopol.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Soviet of <b>Tiraspol</b> votes {{unanimously}} a solicitation to the State Duma, the Federation Council and President Vladimir Putin {{to recognize}} Transnistrian independence and annexation to Russia. Romanian Foreign Minister condemns vigorously this action, cataloging it as a defiance to Moldova's territorial integrity.|$|E
25|$|The Latin Catholic {{minority}} {{was served}} {{by its own}} Roman Catholic Diocese of <b>Tiraspol</b> (originally called Cherson), which at times also covered part of neighbouring Romania and Russia, until its 2002 suppression and merger into the Russian Diocese of Saint Clement at Saratov.|$|E
25|$|On {{the west}} bank, in Bessarabia, {{the city of}} Bender and four communes (containing six villages) to its east, south-east, and south, on the {{opposite}} {{bank of the river}} Dniester from the city of <b>Tiraspol</b> (Proteagailovca, Gîsca, Chițcani, and Cremenciug) are controlled by the PMR.|$|E
25|$|Oxana Ionova (born 1966 in <b>Tiraspol)</b> was {{the head}} of the state tax service of Transnistria and {{director}} of Transnistria's central bank from 2008 to 2011, subsequently charged with embezzlement of Russian humanitarian aid and state property, illegal business practices, abuse of power and forgery.|$|E
25|$|Russians {{were the}} second {{numerous}} ethnic group, representing a 41.64% relative {{majority in the}} city of <b>Tiraspol,</b> a 24.07% minority in Slobozia, a 19.03% minority in Dubăsari, a 17.22% minority in Râbnița, a 15.28% minority in Grigoriopol, and a 6.89% minority in Camenca.|$|E
25|$|All UN {{member states}} {{consider}} Transnistria a legal {{part of the}} Republic of Moldova. Only the partially recognised states of South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Abkhazia have recognised Transnistria as a sovereign entity after it declared independence from Moldova in 1990 with <b>Tiraspol</b> as its declared capital.|$|E
25|$|Such ancient archeological remains are scanty, as {{the city}} site was built over by the great medieval {{fortress}} of Monocastro or Akkerman. During the Middle Ages, the area around <b>Tiraspol</b> was a buffer zone between the Tatars and the Moldavians, and inhabited by both ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|The 3rd Ukrainian Front was {{to attack}} {{out of its}} {{bridgehead}} across the Dniester near <b>Tiraspol,</b> and then release mobile formations to head north and meet the mobile formations of the 2nd Ukrainian Front. This {{would lead to the}} encirclement of the German forces near Chișinău.|$|E
25|$|In 1941 {{before the}} occupation, the {{newspaper}} Dnestrovskaya Pravda {{was founded by}} the <b>Tiraspol</b> City Council of popular deputies. This is the oldest periodical publication in the region. On April 12, 1944, the city was retaken by the Red Army and became again part of Moldavian SSR.|$|E
25|$|When {{the strike}} campaign, from August 16 to September 22, 1989, {{failed to produce}} much of an effect in Chişinău, the OSTK re-examined its tactics. Smirnov and others saw the {{upcoming}} Moldovan elections {{as an opportunity to}} effect change through different means. Smirnov won two seats in the elections of February 1990, the 32nd district seat for the city soviet (municipal government) of <b>Tiraspol</b> and the 125th district seat for the Supreme Soviet of MSSR (republican government) in 1990 Moldovan parliamentary election. Once in the city soviet, Smirnov ran for chairmanship of that body. In a dramatic demonstration of how much the Communist Party's power had waned, Smirnov beat his challenger, the First Secretary of the city's Party Committee, Leonid Tsurkan, by a 2-to-1 margin. From this time forward, <b>Tiraspol</b> was an OSTK-controlled city.|$|E
25|$|The loyalist raion soviets {{expressed}} their opposition by flying the Moldovan flag, {{and refusing to}} accept the jurisdiction of <b>Tiraspol.</b> On 17 September the Moldovan government held a working session in Dubăsari {{in the building of}} the raion soviet which was loyal to the central authorities in Chişinău.|$|E
25|$|In 1828 the Russian {{government}} {{established a}} customs house in <b>Tiraspol</b> {{to try to}} suppress smuggling. The customs house was subordinated to {{the chief of the}} Odessa customs region. It began operations with 14 employees. They inspected shipments of bread, paper, oil, wine, sugar, fruits and other goods.|$|E
25|$|The Romanian-administered {{territory}} – {{called the}} Transnistria Governorate – with {{an area of}} 44,000km2 and a population of 2.3 million inhabitants, was divided into 13 counties: Ananiev, Balta, Berzovca, Dubasari, Golta, Jugastru, Movilau, Oceacov, Odessa, Ovidiopol, Rîbnița, <b>Tiraspol</b> and Tulcin. This enlarged Transnistria was home to nearly 200,000 Romanian/Moldovan-speaking residents.|$|E
25|$|After the Russian Revolution, the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic {{was created}} in Ukraine in 1924, with Balta as its capital. The {{republic}} had Romanian, Ukrainian and Russian as its official languages. Its capital was moved in 1929 to <b>Tiraspol,</b> which remained {{the capital of the}} Moldavian ASSR until 1940.|$|E
25|$|On January 27, 1990, the {{citizens}} in <b>Tiraspol</b> passed a referendum declaring {{the city as}} an independent territory. The nearby city of Bendery also declared its independence from Moldova. As the Russian-speaking independence movement gained momentum, some local governments banded together to resist pressure from the Moldovan government for nationalization.|$|E
25|$|Once the PMSSR {{had been}} created, the {{incipient}} government in <b>Tiraspol</b> fought an increasingly violent struggle for sovereignty with the Moldovan government in Chişinău. Throughout late 1991 and into early 1992, workers’ battalions, increasingly {{the beneficiaries of}} weaponry from sympathetic Red Army officers and defections from among the local military personnel, grew better prepared than the loyalist Moldovan police in Transnistria. Police stations were captured, policemen were evicted, and in extreme cases workers’ battalions and police traded fire. Skirmishes in November 1990, and September and December 1991 witnessed continued Moldovan inability to reassert sovereignty in the region. Throughout {{the first half of}} 1992 the violence continued to escalate and culminated in a short, but bloody, war in late June 1992. The war left the separatists in <b>Tiraspol</b> with de facto control over most of Transnistria and the west-bank city of Bendery.|$|E
