5|$|On 2 August 1990, British Airways Flight 149 {{landed at}} Kuwait International Airport four hours after <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> The aircraft, a Boeing 747-100 G-AWND, was destroyed, and all {{passengers}} and crew were captured. Two of the landing gears were salvaged, and are on display in Waterside, BA Headquarters in London.|$|E
5|$|No {{military}} operations {{were conducted by}} NATO during the Cold War. Following {{the end of the}} Cold War, the first operations, Anchor Guard in 1990 and Ace Guard in 1991, were prompted by <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey, and later a quick-reaction force was deployed to the area.|$|E
5|$|RAF Uxbridge {{also became}} {{involved}} in Operation Granby following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in August 1990. Personnel at Uxbridge were prepared for service in the Gulf at that time, and deployed that year in December. During the aerial assault on Iraq in January 1991, support group meetings began at the station {{for the families of}} service personnel serving during the Gulf War. Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, visited one of these groups in February 1991.|$|E

50|$|In 1980, {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran, {{oil production}} in Iran nearly stopped, and Iraq's oil production was severely cut as well.|$|R
5|$|The brigade {{was called}} to support the {{multinational}} response to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> on 2 August 1990. The brigade grew to a 7,700 soldier force composed of three groups, ten battalions, four separate companies, and eight detachments in support of XVIII Airborne Corps during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The brigade completed 1,500 combat heavy battalions equivalent days of work constructing roads, airfields, heliports, ammunition/fuel/water storage points, life support areas and forward landing strips, distributed over ten million maps, trained over 5,000 coalition engineers, and supported the French attack on Assalman airfield. During follow-on missions the brigade destroyed over 6,000 enemy bunkers and one million tons of munitions.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in August 1990, No.86 Wing {{prepared}} to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia {{in the event}} that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat, Oman, from January 1991, and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.|$|E
25|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990, Saudi Arabia {{joined the}} anti-Iraq Coalition. King Fahd, fearing an attack from Iraq, invited American and Coalition {{soldiers}} to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. Saudi troops and aircraft {{took part in}} the subsequent military operations.|$|E

50|$|The airbase {{was bombed}} in Operation Kaman 99 {{on the second}} day of the Iran-Iraq war, just after <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran, and was {{completely}} destroyed according to Iranian reports.|$|R
50|$|Talil Air Base was an Iraqi Air Force base. The airbase {{was bombed}} in Operation Kaman 99 {{on the second}} day of the Iran-Iraq war, just after <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran.|$|R
25|$|As of 1983 {{the branch}} {{was led by}} Faisal al-Sani. The Kuwaiti Ba'ath Party branch {{collapsed}} during Gulf War because of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Saleh al-Mutlaq, {{the leader of the}} Iraqi National Dialogue Front, has been accused of trying to rebuild the party.|$|E
25|$|Less than a {{year after}} the 37th TFW saw combat in Panama, in {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> on 2 August 1990, the 415th TFS of the 37th TFW was deployed to King Khalid International Airport, Saudi Arabia on 19 August to provide air defense over the Saudi capital of Riyadh.|$|E
25|$|One of Brandt's last public {{appearances}} was in flying to Baghdad, Iraq, to free Western hostages held by Saddam Hussein, following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990. Brandt secured {{the release of}} a large number of them, and on 9 November 1990, his airplane landed with 174 freed hostages on board at the Frankfurt Airport.|$|E
50|$|Muthenna {{was among}} the airbases bombed during Operation Kaman 99, which was {{launched}} by Iranian air force the day after <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran and <b>the</b> beginning of the Iran-Iraq war of 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The airbase {{was bombed}} in Operation Kaman 99 {{on the second}} day of the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, just after <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran, and was not {{operable}} for 69 days, according to Iranian reports.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran was {{launched}} on 22 September and lasted until 7 December 1980. Finally, Iranian resistance led to stall <b>of</b> Iraq's <b>invasion.</b> However, Iraq could capture more than 15000 Km2 of Iran's territory. Iraq took a defensive position since then. This invasion led {{to eight years}} war between Iran and Iraq.|$|R
25|$|Following the Soviet Union's {{withdrawal}} from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in August 1990 {{had put the}} Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.|$|E
25|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> on August 2, 1990 an Iraqi Air Force Sukhoi Su-22 {{from the}} No.109 Squadron (based at as-Shoibiyah AB) fired a single Kh-25MP anti-radar variant against a Kuwaiti MIM-23B I-HAWK SAM site at Bubiyan Island that had earlier downed another Su-22 {{from the same}} unit and a MiG-23BN from the 49th Squadron. This forced a radar {{shutdown}} on the HAWK. The HAWK battery (which was operated by some American contractors) was later captured by Iraqi special forces and found out to be in automatic mode of operation, after the contractors fled.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia spent $25 {{billion in}} support of Saddam Hussein in the Iran–Iraq War. However, Saudi Arabia {{condemned}} <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990 and asked the US to intervene. King Fahd allowed American and coalition troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. He invited the Kuwaiti government {{and many of its}} citizens to stay in Saudi Arabia, but expelled citizens of Yemen and Jordan because of their governments' support of Iraq. In 1991, Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait.|$|E
25|$|Khuzestan is ethnically diverse, {{home to many}} {{different}} ethnic groups. This has a bearing on Khuzestan's electoral politics, with ethnic minority rights playing {{a significant role in}} the province's political culture. The province's geographical location bordering Iraq and its oil resources also make it a politically sensitive region, particularly given its history of foreign intervention, notably <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> 1980.|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} closed during <b>the</b> 1990-91 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait {{and for two}} months during the 2003 Iraq War..|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was bombed}} by {{a flight of}} four Mk.82-equipped F-4 Phantom IIs {{as part of the}} Operation Revenge launched by Iranian Air Force two hours after <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran. According to Iranian sources, the MiG-25s and some MiG-23 were stationed in this airbase. The airbase was again bombed in the large-scale Operation Kaman 99 {{on the second day of}} the war.|$|R
25|$|Ze'evi later {{advocated}} the population transfer by agreement of 3.3 million {{residents of the}} West Bank and Gaza to Arab nations. He believed this could be accomplished by making life difficult, so they would relocate on their own, through {{use of military force}} during wartime, or by agreement with Arab nations. In July 1987, Ze'evi presented his ideas at a forum in Tel Aviv, describing the plan as a voluntary transfer {{and the only way to}} make peace with the Arabs. After <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990, Ze'evi proposed transferring Palestinians to the east side of the Jordan River to serve as a buffer zone against any Iraqi attempt to attack Israel.|$|E
25|$|A {{detachment}} of three Nimrod MR2s was deployed to Seeb in Oman in August 1990 {{as a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> carrying out patrols over the Gulf of Oman and Persian Gulf. Due to the level of threats present in the Gulf theatre, operational Nimrods were quickly retrofitted with a Marconi-towed active decoy. Once hostilities commenced, the Nimrod detachment, by now increased to five aircraft, concentrated on night patrols, with daylight patrols carried out by US Navy Lockheed P-3 Orions. Nimrods were used to guide Westland Lynx helicopters and Grumman A-6 Intruder attack aircraft against Iraqi patrol vessels, being credited with assisting in sinking or damaging 16 Iraqi vessels.|$|E
25|$|In August 1990, Commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet was {{deployed}} to Bahrain {{in order to}} serve as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (ComUSNAVCENT) following <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Since ComUSNAVCENT operated from onboard ship, he established NAVCENT-Riyadh as a staff organization to provide continuous Navy representation at United States Central Command headquarters. This mission was assigned initially to Commander, Carrier Group Three. During succeeding months, the NAVCENT-Riyadh staff was augmented substantially but remained small, relative to the United States Army Central and CENTAF staffs. In November, the NAVCENT-Riyadh command was transferred from COMCARGRU 3 to Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 5. This change resulted in the Navy flag officer at NAVCENT Riyadh's remaining relatively junior to other Service representatives, particularly the Air Force.|$|E
50|$|The few {{remaining}} local residents are mostly those Failakawans {{who lived with}} their families on the island prior to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> 1990. Most Failakawans have their own boats and some are involved in tourism, but many are reticent about letting tourism detract from the quiet island life. Some Failakawan families, although now living in mainland Kuwait, regularly go to the island on weekends.|$|R
5000|$|The {{refinery}} {{was largely}} destroyed in September 1980 by Iraq {{during the initial}} stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran's Khuzestan province, triggering the Iraq-Iran war. It had a capacity of 635,000 b/d in 1980 and formed a refinery complex with important petrochemical plants. Its capacity has been increased steadily since the war ended in 1988 and is now listed as [...] of crude oil.|$|R
50|$|As one of {{the three}} most oil-rich {{countries}} in the world, Iraq has the resources for complete energy independence. By world standards, production costs for Iraqi oil are relatively low. Three wars (Iraq-Iran War from 1980-1988, Gulf War 1991 and <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> 2003) in addition to the UN sanctions - which lasted for twelve years from 1991 to 2003, left the industry’s infrastructure in poor condition.|$|R
25|$|The 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) {{added to}} its combat history during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In August 1990 {{the group was}} called upon to conduct {{operations}} in Southwest Asia in response to <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> During this crisis the Army's First Special Operations Task Force consisting of elements of the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), comprising 106 special operations teams, performed {{a wide variety of}} missions. These spanned a wide scope of operations, including support to coalition warfare; conducting foreign internal defense missions with the Saudi Arabian Army; performing special reconnaissance, border surveillance, direct action, combat search and rescue missions; and advising and assisting a pan-Arab equivalent force larger than six U.S. divisions; as well as conducting civil-military operations training and liaison with the Kuwaitis. The border surveillance mission assigned the 5th Special Forces was key to providing actionable intelligence to the US and Pan-Arab Forces. New military relationships were forged between the US and the Arab dictatorships.|$|E
25|$|The first Gulf War {{triggered}} by <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> on August 2, 1990, sent fuel prices skyrocketing, which severely depressed global economic activity. This in turn caused a sharp contraction of worldwide air travel demand, plunging once profitable operations, including Pan Am's prime transatlantic routes, into steep losses. These unforeseen events constituted a further major blow to Pan Am, {{which was still}} reeling from the 1988 Lockerbie disaster. To shore up its finances, Pan Am sold most of its routes serving London Heathrow – arguably Pan Am's most important international destination – to United Airlines. This left Pan Am with only two daily London flights, serving Detroit and Miami, which used Gatwick as their London terminal {{from the start of the}} 1990/91 winter timetable. Further asset disposals included Pan Am's sale of its IGS routes to Berlin to Lufthansa for $150million, which became effective at the same time and brought the total value of asset disposals to $1.2billion. These measures were accompanied by the elimination of 2,500 jobs (8.6% of its work force). These cutbacks had already been announced by the airline in September 1990.|$|E
25|$|The First Intifada (1987–93) {{would prove}} another {{watershed}} in Palestinian nationalism, as it brought the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza {{to the forefront}} of the struggle. The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) (al-Qiyada al Muwhhada) mobilised grassroots support for the uprising. In 1987 The Intifada caught the (PLO) by surprise, the leadership abroad could only indirectly influence the events., A new local leadership emerged; the UNLU comprising many leading Palestinian factions. The disturbances initially spontaneous soon came under local leadership from groups and organizations loyal to the PLO that operated within the Occupied Territories; Fatah, the Popular Front, the Democratic Front and the Palestine Communist Party. The UNLU was the focus of the social cohesion that sustained the persistent disturbances. After King Hussein of Jordan proclaimed the administrative and legal separation of the West Bank from Jordan in 1988, the UNLU organised to fill the political vacuum. During the intifada Hamas replaced the monopoly of the PLO as sole representative of the Palestinian people. Some Israelis had become tired of the constant violence of the First Intifada, and many were willing to take risks for peace. Some wanted to realize the economic benefits in the new global economy. The Gulf War (1990–1991) did much to persuade Israelis that the defensive value of territory had been overstated, and that <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Kuwait</b> psychologically reduced their sense of security.|$|E
25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War, Khuzestan was <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran, {{leading to}} the flight of {{thousands}} of the province's residents. As a result, Khuzestan suffered the heaviest damage of all Iranian provinces during the war. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein felt confident that the Arab population of the Khuzestan would react enthusiastically to the prospect of union with Iraq. However, resistance to the invasion was fierce, stalling <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> military's advance, and ultimately opening {{a window of opportunity}} for an Iranian counter-offensive.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran {{occurred}} {{less than}} a year after the embassy employees were taken hostage. The journalist Stephen Kinzer argues that the dramatic change in American-Iranian relations, from allies to enemies, helped embolden <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> leader, Saddam Hussein, and that the United States’ anger with Iran led it to aid <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> after <b>the</b> war turned against them. The United States supplied Iraq with, among other things, “helicopters and satellite intelligence that was used in selecting bombing targets.” This assistance “deepened and widened anti-American feeling in Iran.” ...|$|R
25|$|Between {{the autumn}} of 1980 and the summer of 1990, the number of {{aircraft}} in the IQAF went from 332 to over 1000. Before <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Iran, <b>the</b> IQAF had expected 16 modern Dassault Mirage F.1EQs from France and were also {{in the middle of}} receiving a total of 240 new aircraft and helicopters from their Eastern European allies. When Iraq invaded Iran in late September 1980, the Soviets and the French stopped delivery of additional aircraft to Iraq but resumed deliveries a few months later.|$|R
