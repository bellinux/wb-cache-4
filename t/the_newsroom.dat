40|$|Although {{valuable}} {{empirical research}} {{had been done}} on individual journalists, aspects {{of some of the}} results in international surveys remain puzzling at times.

5|$|In 1948 Kathleen married Frank Cole, a World War II veteran, {{and moved}} the family to Virginia.

40|$|Abstract This is {{the first}} study of its kind about {{newsroom}} convergence and multi-skilled journalists in Saudi newspaper organisations and aimed {{to fill a gap}} in the literature about this particular issue in the Saudi context. The study investigated transformations, implications and consequences of technological convergence at four Saudi traditional newspaper organisations; Al-Madina, Alriyadh, Alyaum, and Alwatan. This thesis has explored the particular impacts of online journalistic production in traditional newspaper organisations to identify changes and perhaps challenges occurring in newspaper <b>newsrooms.</b> <b>The</b> study used the observation method in <b>the</b> four <b>newsrooms</b> and in-depth interviews with open ended questions with 60 professionals. The findings confirmed that there are ongoing transformations in <b>the</b> <b>newsrooms.</b> Yet, these transformations are challenged by regulatory, business, and cultural forces. Alyaum was <b>the</b> only <b>newsroom</b> to introduce new integrated newsroom. Journalists are observing and using new communication technologies in the workplace. However, there are difficulties in this process such as tensions in <b>the</b> <b>newsrooms</b> and shortage of qualified and trained journalists in the Saudi media market especially, multiskilled journalists. Despite embracing online and digital technology in news production and disruption, the four Saudi newspapers are still prioritising the traditional print side as it is generating more than 95...|$|R

25|$|Not {{only did}} <b>the</b> Vancouver <b>newsroom</b> receive less airtime overall; {{it was also}} unable to cover local news effectively. <b>The</b> Vancouver <b>newsroom</b> had been heavily {{dependent}} on Global BC for local news footages, and prior to the changeover, it routinely taped footages off Global BC’s 18:00 newscast to air on its own bulletin.
