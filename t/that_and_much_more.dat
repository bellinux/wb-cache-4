And it is a hard and cruel thing thus in early youth to taste beforehand the pangs which should be reserved for the stout time of manhood, when the gristle has become bone, and we stand up and fight out our lives, as a thing tried before and foreseen; for then we are veterans used to sieges and battles, and not green recruits, recoiling at the first shock of the encounter.|$|E

60|$|I {{was filled}} with the {{greatest}} exultation by the knowledge which I had gained through the deserter from the pirates, for not only had I discovered the whereabouts of the one man in all of the world whom I felt well convinced had knowledge of the Rose of Paradise, but that man no longer had a crew of wicked and bloody wretches back of him, but stood, like me, upon his own footing. Therefore I determined that I would by some means or other either regain the treasure or perish in the attempt, for I would rather die than live a life of dishonor such as now seemed to lie before me. However, I plainly perceived that if I would recover the treasure I would have to escape from the ship by some means or other whilst we were upon our passage and near the isle of Mauritius, for if I lost time by going home and standing my examination, many things might occur which would lose the chance to me forever: England might quit the Mauritius, or gather together another crew of pirates upon his own account, for with such a treasure as the Rose of Paradise he had it clearly in his power to do <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>much</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E

5|$|Architectural {{historians have}} grouped the Precious Blood-related churches of far western Ohio into four {{different}} generations: the first, composed primarily of small log buildings {{from the first}} years of settlement until 1865; the second, composed of moderately sized brick churches built between 1865 and 1885; the third, composed mostly of large High Gothic Revival churches with massive towers constructed from 1885 to 1905; and the fourth, composed of churches built between 1905 and 1925 {{in a wide range of}} styles.

5000|$|The {{film was}} not a success at the box office, despite a strong {{reception}} at first, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. (It earned £1,817 in its first four days at the Sydney Capitol.) Director Ken G. Hall claims {{it was the only}} one of his films not to go straight into profit, blaming the poor script and Roy Rene's awkwardness in front of the camera as opposed to a live audience:Rene himself was in some trouble right from the beginning. In a film studio with no audience, he was something of a fish out of water. No performer I've ever known had the ability to 'work' an audience as Mo could. He'd come on centre stage with no support and just leer at the audience without saying a word for minutes on end and have them rocking with laughter. And when the laughs began to die, he'd lisp in his inimitable way a completely trite line like, 'Will you be quiet, pleath!' - and that would send them off for minutes more. An established comic, a really funny man to the audience, can get laughs by appearing to do nothing at all. Actually he is 'working' all the time - with a look, a raised eyebrow, a sly, suggestive wink, a haughty smile. Mo was a past-master of all <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> of course. But he did need an audience. In rehearsal of a funny scene the crew would laugh the first time they saw and heard it. But on the next rehearsal and the next and the next ... nothing. It depressed Mo tremendously. I had seen him rehearsing in the theatre a few times and he just casually walked through, usually waiting for the matinee with a live audience to get the feel of what he was doing. There were some very funny scenes in Strike Me Lucky, but we did not get the best out of Mo overall, mainly because the material was not there - and he was rather at sea himself. This problem characterised many prominent vaudeville comedians transferring to film or television ...He also felt that Rene was too adult in his humor. [...] "He was a very funny man, wonderfully talented", said Hall later. [...] "But he wasn't a 'family' comic. You didn't take the kids." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the leadership journey of Kathryn, an educational leader, in relation to current research on women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences as educational leaders. This life history was developed as a grounded theory (Glaser 2 ̆ 6 Strauss, 1967) study. Conducted over a two-year period, the semi-structured interviews used {{to conduct the study}} were influenced by Van Manen 2 ̆ 7 s (1992) work on life history interviews as a means of studying individuals 2 ̆ 7 lived experiences. The interviews were triangulated through field note observations and document analysis. In addition to exemplifying life history as a research method, a framework for studying leadership development emerged based on the themes: commitment, personal competence, sense of self-esteem, reflection, appreciation of others, open communication, problem-solving, power sharing, collaboration, shared decision-making, and sense of visioning. The themes were explored in relation to the early years, the early career, and the leadersh ip career of Kathryn as a principal. The findings remind us that many of the qualities closely linked with transformational leadership begin during family and early school life. Introduction When Kathryn chose her career, her ambitions were to become the best possible reading teacher and to provide children with positive learning experiences.

40|$|After {{reading the}} {{introduction}} to this book, I expected a quaint family history joined with some attempt at relating {{the specifics of the}} author 2 ̆ 7 s family and personal experience to the larger context of Kansas and US history. I found <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>much</b> <b>more.</b> The first chapters set up a good model for family history-much better than most local histories or genealogies prepared by enthusiastic amateurs. But then James Dickenson is an accomplished journalist with over thirty years of journalistic experience including staffing the Washington Post; what should I have expected? By the half-way point, I realized {{that this is a very}} well written narrative, cultural history. By the end, I was inserting the bibliographic information into the 2 ̆ 2 required texts 2 ̆ 2 section of next semester 2 ̆ 7 s undergraduate American West syllabus. This book not only lived up to Jim Lehrer 2 ̆ 7 s and Gary Wills 2 ̆ 7 glowing back cover praises, but exceeded them. As Dickenson aptly recounts, 2 ̆ 2 This book is about life in a rural, wheat farming community in Western Kansas, a way of life that is gradually disappearing as the country becomes industrialized and urbanized. 2 ̆ 2 In fact, it seemed an apt depiction of High Plains culture generally during the period between 1888 and the present. I grew up on a Texas Southern Plains cotton farm a generation or two after the author. Yet, in McDonald, Kansas, I heard Dickensen 2 ̆ 7 s maternal grandmother recounting stories very similar to those of my own grandmother. My little town possessed counterparts to the farmers, townsmen, agricultural practices, and youthful shenanigans of Dickenson 2 ̆ 7 s, and I suspect so do the farm towns that dot the Great Plains from Texas to Saskatchewan and, judging from my father-in-law 2 ̆ 7 s regaling, as far east as the corn fields of southeastern Iowa. Dickenson does a wonderful job capturing those elements of rural culture in its High Plains setting, which, as he warns throughout the book, may be disappearing as increased agricultural industrialization leads to declining demand for farm labor. This in turn decreases the need for community service sectors, both exacerbating the Plains population hemorrhage into either the urban islands of the West or the humid cities east of the 98 th meridian. Home on the Range has some faults. It relies too heavily on Walter Prescott Webb 2 ̆ 7 s barbed wire, six shooter, windmill matrix to explain Anglo-American settlement. It discusses in an unsophisticated manner the role that evangelicalism played in shaping the rural Plains world view. The last several chapters adopt a tone reminiscent of Washington Post feature stories-good journalism, but lacking the luster of the earlier material. Finally, despite the apparent craftsmanship of the whole narrative, the conclusion is abrupt and disappointingly anti-climactic. Still, this is a book well worth reading...|$|E
