5|$|Early on 10 April, the Großdeutschland Division, {{consisting}} of approximately 160 tanks, including 40 Panthers and 40 Tigers, attacked westward {{along the road}} from Podu Iloaiei to Târgu Frumos in two columns deployed {{north and south of}} the road. Following a heavy bombardment, the Germans broke into the town and engaged the Soviet troops which had taken cover in houses and other buildings. The German <b>thrust</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> a number of Soviet units from their main force and reached the high ground west of the town by launching a concerted counterattack just as the 206th Rifle, 3rd Guards Airborne and 93rd Guards Rifle Divisions were preparing to resume their assault southwards, at a time when only their rear guards and logistical subunits remained behind to defend the Târgu Frumos region. Meanwhile, the Romanian 1st Guard and 7th Infantry Division advanced from the south, pressing the Soviets back to the north. Trapped between the German armour racing into Târgu Frumos from the east and the Romanian infantry counterattacking from the south, the three divisions of 35th Guards Rifle Corps {{had no choice but to}} retreat. At about 2200 hours, 48 hours after getting their original order, the German grenadiers had secured Târgu Frumos and the regions west and north of the town.|$|E
50|$|The Confederates regrouped {{for another}} attack but Hampton waited {{almost an hour}} for reinforcements. Then, he {{attacked}} without them around 5 p.m. Forces under Colonel Davis and Colonel William Stokes, who succeeded Dunovant {{in command of the}} brigade, attacked the Union position three times but were repulsed by the heavy Union fire, including three artillery pieces. Just before nightfall, Hampton sent Brigadier General Pierce Young's men to attack Davies's from the other flank. Young's initial <b>thrust</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> Company C of the 1st New Jersey Volunteer Cavalry Regiment led by Lieutenant William Hughes. Hughes decided to cut {{his way back to the}} main Union force by attacking Young's men from the rear. The Confederates were surprised and retreated from what they thought must be a superior force. General Young, who was out ahead of his men scouting, was nearly taken prisoner. When Young regrouped and attacked again, he faced a force which Davies had removed to higher ground near the McDowell house. Union General Gregg had reinforced the position with additional cavalry and artillery. This force easily turned back the charge of Young's men, who had lost the element of surprise against a weaker part of the Union line, which had been withdrawn and strengthened during the delay in the attack.|$|E
50|$|In {{the vanguard}} of Trofimenko's 27th Army, Lieutenant-General S. G. Goriachev's 35th Guards Rifle Corps resumed its advance southward from the Hârlǎu region towards Târgu Frumos during the morning on 9 April, with two rifle {{divisions}} deployed {{from left to right}} in his first echelon. Soviet riflemen quickly defeated the Romanian troops defending the town and most of the surrounding region, being reinforced by the Corps' second echelon consisting of one airborne and one rifle divisions before any enemy reaction. Meanwhile, the 42nd Guards Rifle Division captured the town of Pașcani, situated 14 mi west of Târgu Frumos and defended by the Romanian 6th Infantry Division. At the same time, forward detachments of Bogdanov's 2nd Tank Army advancing east of the town attempted to reinforce Trofimenko's infantry fighting in the Târgu Frumos region, but were unable to do so due to German defenders. The German Eighth Army reacted promptly realizing the danger to its main defenses west of Iași, by moving Hasso von Manteuffel's Panzergrenadier Division Großdeutschland towards Târgu Frumos. Elements of the division were ordered to launch a counterattack from the south of the town as soon as possible. Attacking {{during the rest of the}} day, that small German force managed to seize and hold only a foothold in the southern part of the town. However, by this time two divisions of Goriachev's 35th Guards Rifle Corps reached the region and added their weight to Trofimenko's southward thrust. By nightfall, three divisions leading 35th Corps advance passed Târgu Frumos and established a salient 3 mi to 7 mi deep within the Romanian defense line south and southeast of the town.Early on 10 April, the Großdeutschland Division, consisting of approximately 160 tanks, including 40 Panthers and 40 Tigers, attacked westward along the road from Podu Iloaiei to Târgu Frumos in two columns deployed north and south of the road.

5|$|After {{the capture}} of Sevastopol, Hitler felt Manstein was the right man to command the forces at Leningrad, which had been under siege since September 1941. With {{elements}} of the 11th Army, Manstein {{was transferred to the}} Leningrad front, arriving on 27 August 1942. Manstein again lacked the proper forces to storm the city, so he planned Operation Nordlicht, a bold plan for a <b>thrust</b> to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> Leningrad's supply line at Lake Ladoga.|$|R
50|$|Guidance of an ICBM {{is based}} {{not only on}} the {{direction}} the missile is travelling, but the precise instant that <b>thrust</b> is <b>cut</b> <b>off.</b> Too much <b>thrust</b> and the warhead will overshoot its target, too little and it will fall short. Solids are normally very hard to predict in terms of burning time and their instantaneous thrust during the burn, which made them questionable for the sort of accuracy required to hit a target at intercontinental range. This appeared at first to be an insurmountable problem, but in the end was solved in almost trivial fashion. A series of ports were added inside the rocket nozzle that were opened when the guidance systems called for engine cut-off. The reduction in pressure was so abrupt that the last burning fuel ejected itself and the flame was snuffed out.|$|R
25|$|The Winter Line {{proved a}} major {{obstacle}} to the Allies {{at the end of}} 1943, halting the Fifth Army's advance on the western side of Italy. Although the Gustav Line was penetrated on the Eighth Army's Adriatic front, and Ortona captured, blizzards, drifting snow and zero visibility at the end of December caused the advance to grind to a halt. The Allies' focus then turned to the western front, where an attack through the Liri valley was considered to have the best chance of a breakthrough towards the Italian capital. Landings at Anzio during Operation Shingle, advocated by the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, behind the line were intended to destabilise the German Gustav line defences, but the early <b>thrust</b> inland to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the German defences did not occur, thanks to the indecisiveness of the American commander (Major General John P. Lucas), and the Anzio forces became bottled up in their beachhead. Lucas was replaced by Major General Lucian Truscott.|$|R

In this contribution, the rheological behaviour of a gel propellant consisting of nitromethane as fuel and nanoparticles of silicium dioxide as gelling agent was examined. The experiments were conducted under steady state shear flow. The nitromethane/silicium dioxide-gels exhibit non-Newtonian flow behaviour over the whole concentration range examined. No dependence of the rheological behaviour on the temperature could be found...|$|E

2500|$|On 25 October, Souham {{advanced}} on Wellington's {{center and}} left flank which were posted along the Pisuerga and Carrión Rivers {{with his right}} flank at Valladolid. A French probe of his center was repulsed by the 5th Division, but on the left a Spanish division was driven from Palencia on the east bank of the Carrión. The Spanish were pursued so closely that the French got across the Carrión bridge {{before it could be}} blown up and General of Division Maximilien Sebastien Foy's division secured a bridgehead. General of Division Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune's division crossed the Carrión farther south at Villamuriel de Cerrato. Since, Foy's and Maucune's <b>thrusts</b> threatened to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> a portion of his army, Wellington committed four brigades to drive Maucune back. After a tough fight the French were ejected from Villamuriel. In these operations, the French inflicted 800 casualties on the Allies while losing only 350 men. With his river defenses outflanked by Foy, Wellington ingeniously shifted his army to the east bank of the Pisuerga. While on the 23rd he held {{the west bank of the}} Pisuerga, on the 25th he defended the east bank. Planting his left flank (formerly his right) at Valladolid and securing his right flank on a tributary river [...] upstream, the British army commander held a strong position.

Computational solutions of the energy principle for the Ritz method in a plate having arbitrary shape of typical <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions under biaxial compressive loads are obtained. Some numerical results for the pure global buckling load prediction due to its reduced flexural stiffness for the circular <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions and elliptical <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions are presented.
