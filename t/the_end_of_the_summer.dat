5|$|Haystacks is {{the common}} English title {{for a series of}} impressionist {{paintings}} by Claude Monet. The principle subject of each painting in the series is stacks of harvested wheat (or possibly barley or oats: the original French title, Les Meules à Giverny, simply means The Stacks at Giverny). The title refers primarily to a twenty-five canvas series (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1266-1290) which Monet began near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> of 1890 and continued through the following spring though Monet also produced earlier paintings using this same stack subject.|$|E
5|$|Prince Louis {{intended}} {{to land in}} the south of England in May 1216, and John assembled a naval force to intercept him. Unfortunately for John, his fleet was dispersed by bad storms and Louis landed unopposed in Kent. John hesitated and decided not to attack Louis immediately, either due to the risks of open battle or over concerns about the loyalty of his own men. Louis and the rebel barons advanced west and John retreated, spending the summer reorganising his defences across the rest of the kingdom. John saw several of his military household desert to the rebels, including his half-brother, William Longespée. By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> the rebels had regained the south-east of England and parts of the north.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais was {{the only}} bishop who did not {{actively}} aid the king; the rebelling magnates included Roger de Montgomery Earl of Shrewsbury, Robert de Mowbray Earl of Northumbria, and Odo's brother Robert Count of Mortain.

When the king's army arrived, St-Calais agreed to come out, but only after receiving a safe conduct {{that would allow him}} to attend a trial while his men continued to hold the castle. St-Calais's actions suggest that he did rebel, whatever his claims to the contrary and affirmations of his innocence in northern chronicles.|$|E
