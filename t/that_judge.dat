5|$|Judge Kaul {{issued a}} dissenting opinion in both cases. In these {{opinions}} {{he asserted that}} he continues {{to believe that the}} ICC lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae over the situation in Kenya. His assertion was that the although crimes were committed they were not of a nature which constitute crimes against humanity within the jurisdiction of the ICC. This was the third time <b>that</b> <b>Judge</b> Kaul wrote a similar dissent opposing the prosecutions.|$|E
5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support <b>that</b> <b>Judge</b> Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E
5|$|The {{court can}} appoint retired judges, lawyers, and other judges to serve {{temporarily}} as judges {{at any level}} in Oregon. They can also appoint senior judges to serve on any state court at or below {{the highest level of}} court <b>that</b> <b>judge</b> had served on before retirement or resignation. The state supreme court is responsible for admitting new lawyers to practice in Oregon, disciplining attorneys, and appointing members to the Board of Bar Examiners. This board of a minimum of fourteen members is responsible for administering the bar exam and screening prospective lawyers before admitting applicants to practice law in Oregon. Oversight of state judges is also {{in the hands of the}} Supreme Court. The Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability investigates all reports of abuses and makes recommendations to the Supreme Court on any actions that may need to occur. The Supreme Court can then suspend judges, censure them, remove them from office, or take no action.|$|E
5000|$|Criticisms of the {{doctrine}} continue as in the past. Critics argue <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> are making determinations of policy and morality that properly belong with legislators (i.e. [...] "legislating from the bench"), or argue <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> are reading views into the Constitution that are not really implied by the document, or argue <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> are claiming power to expand the liberty of some people {{at the expense of}} other people's liberty (e.g. as in the Dred Scott case), or argue <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> are addressing substance instead of process.|$|R

They ask judges to do this by creating small, case-specific rulings rather than broad, sweeping rulings.|$|R
5|$|October 9, 1944, {{was another}} {{in a string of}} days {{consisting}} of accused men testifying on the witness stand. This day, however, Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sat in on the proceedings. Marshall had flown to the Bay Area on a special wartime travel priority arranged by Navy Secretary Forrestal. The NAACP had given the mutiny trial top importance due to the U.S. Navy's policy of putting Negroes into dirty and dangerous jobs with no hope of advancement. Although Marshall was allowed to observe the trial, as a civilian he was ineligible to take an official role in the men's defense. After hearing five of the men defend themselves, Marshall spoke to the 50 men and then conferred with Veltmann's defense team. The next day, Marshall held a press conference, charging <b>that</b> <b>Judge</b> Advocate Coakley was handling the case in a prejudicial manner. Marshall said that, from a review of the proceedings and his conversations with the accused, he could only see these men being tried for lesser charges of individual insubordination, not mass mutiny.|$|E

The court agreed with the prosecutor that an objective belief, one that would be shared by a hypothetical reasonable person, is also required.

In addition, friends and family indicated that Brown had consistently said that Simpson had been stalking her. She claimed that everywhere she went, she noticed Simpson would be there, watching her.

Larson also held that the 2001 settlement documents did not constitute a contract terminating the Siegel heirs' claim to the Superman and Superboy works. The Siegels regained the copyright to the Superman character, story, and indicia as they appeared in Action Comics #1 (but not prior to or after <b>that).</b> <b>Judge</b> Larson later expanded his ruling to allow the Siegel heirs to claim additional plots, Superman characters, costuming, and indicia.|$|E
