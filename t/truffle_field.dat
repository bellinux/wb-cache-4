Of these only the strains of Cryptococcus appear to be specific to this habitat, as Cryptococcus albidus (isolat-ed from the majority of samples) showed pectinolytic activity which may, for example, aid ectomycorrhizal formation by facilitating hyphal penetration. Likewise, the strains of Cryp-tococcus humicolus, consistently present {{on the surface of}} mature truffles, showed extracel-lular cellulosolytic, chitinolytic and proteolytic activities, which may contribute to the Tuber nutrition during the saprophytic stage or facilitate fungal ascospore dispersion. A compara-tive analysis of yeast distribution within the <b>truffle</b> <b>field</b> demonstrated higher numbers (up to 5 orders of magnitude) of yeast in samples characterized by the presence of Tuber aestivum as compared to those without the ectomycorrhizal fungus...|$|E
2500|$|In the 20th century, however, {{with the}} growing {{industrialization}} of France and the subsequent rural exodus, many of these <b>truffle</b> <b>fields</b> ( [...] or [...] ) returned to wilderness. The First World War also dealt a serious blow to the French countryside, killing 20% {{or more of the}} male working force. As a consequence, newly acquired techniques of [...] were lost. Also, between the two world wars, the truffle groves planted in the 19th century stopped being productive. (The average life cycle of a truffle-producing tree is 30 years.) Consequently, after 1945, the production of truffles plummeted, and the prices have risen dramatically. In 1900, truffles were used by most people, and on many occasions. Today, they are a rare delicacy reserved for the rich, or used on very special occasions.|$|R

For meat and seafood based crostata, there were recipes using pork jowls or prosciutto, crayfish, anchovies, or oysters. Other savoury crostata recipes included a crostata with creamy cheese {{referred to as}} a butirata, those with <b>truffles</b> or <b>field</b> mushrooms, one with artichoke or cardoon hearts, and one with [...] "the viscera of any sort of turtle".|$|R

5000|$|In 1875, a truffle hog {{could cost}} up to 200 francs. A skilled truffler could more than make up for this {{investment}} due to {{the high price of}} truffles on the gourmet food market. Today it is common for dogs (known as [...] "Truffle hounds") as well as truffle hogs {{to be used in the}} gathering of truffles because hogs have been known to eat too many <b>truffles</b> in the <b>field.</b> [...] However, traditionalists argue that the swine have more sensitive noses and their particular taste for truffles leads to a more devoted beast. It is frequent for the hog to be a family pet of the truffler.|$|R
40|$|The {{black truffle}} (Tuber melanosporum Vitt.) {{industry}} in Australia {{is relatively new}} and has enormous potential but some truffieres (truffle farms) fail to meet anticipated harvest projections. Inappropriate soil conditions and climate, and the management of such factors are suggested as the primary reasons for inadequate yield. In addition, requirements for ascocarp initiation and development {{and the role of}} the host plant in such processes are unknown. This study examines interactions between European hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) black truffle symbiont in a commercial truffiere (Hazel Hill) in south-western Australia. Specific studies were initiated to examine the interactions of host physiology, mycorrhizal infection and the interaction with abiotic factors. The study related specific physiological processes of the host plant to the known life cycle of the black truffle to determine the role of the host plant in ascocarp production, if any. The work also examined the effect of silvicultural treatments intended to increase truffle production. A review of existing literature was undertaken to determine the key soil and climatic factors required for successful truffle production. Climatic conditions appeared more important than soil chemistry and structure in Western Australia, with significant seasonal variation in air and soil temperatures required plus irrigation to supplement summer rainfall. This information was used to define areas with potential for truffle production in the south-west of Western Australia: the cooler, high rainfall regions (> 1000 mm annual rainfall) where there is sufficient seasonal variation in soil temperature and availability of adequate quantities of quality water for irrigation. Subsurface soil acidification and salinity, as well as groundwater salinity, are constraining factors. Lime amendment is necessary to create sufficiently high pH and CaCO 3 levels required by the <b>truffle</b> fungus. A <b>field</b> trial was established to monitor the seasonal C dynamics of European hazel in the context of the life cycle of the black truffle. Maximum translocation of sucrose in the phloem sap coincided with the period of anticipated rapid growth of the truffle ascocarp implicating the use of current photosynthate in C nutrition of the ascocarp. Sampling of non-structural carbohydrates (NC) of above and belowground plant material indicated maximum storage of C in the host coincides with maturation of the ascocarp. These observations provide evidence of a synchronous growth habit of the plant host and the ascocarp. The C allocation patterns of European hazel in response to liming a loamy soil, taken from near the Hazel Hill truffiere, and inoculation with ECM fungi (T. melanosporum, Hebeloma sp. and Scleroderma sp.) were examined in a glasshouse pot trial. Liming increased biomass allocation to the shoot and induced deficiencies of phosphorus and manganese. Colonisation by ECM fungi significantly increased net photosynthesis, indicating the sink strength of these fungi, but there was no relationship between the level of mycorrhizal infection and fine root NC. The maximum rate (40 g lime kg- 1 soil) reduced infection by Hebeloma and Scleroderma and had no impact on T. melanosporum. Further, infection rates of T. melanosporum did not increase in response to lime suggesting lime is not necessary for ECM development in this soil type. Fertiliser is widely used in commercial truffieres in Australia but the consequences for truffle production are unknown. In a field trial, the growth and physiological response of European hazel to forms of phosphorus (34 and 68 kg ha- 1 apatite-P and 68 kg ha- 1 triple super phosphate -P) and nitrogen (50 kg ha- 1 of NO 3 - and NH 4 -N) were examined as well as the mycorrhizal response to fertiliser. Apatite-P increased phloem sap sucrose concentrations which was attributed to increased root biomass and associated sink capacity. Fertiliser application did not change fine root NC concentrations suggesting no increase in allocation of C to ECM structures. The highest rate of apatite-P decreased mycorrhizal infection rates of T. melanosporum and, most likely, was the result of increased infection rates of Hebeloma. In contrast to the literature relating to indigenous Australian ECM fungi, the highest rate of soluble-P did not decrease ECM infection rates in T. melanosporum. Nitrogen treatments increased foliar N content and improved gas exchange efficiency of plants, and had no adverse impact on the level of ECM infection. Fertilisation with N significantly increased soil respiration rates suggesting N limits mineralisation at this site. Some truffieres manage the canopies of the host tree to ensure maximum exposure of the soil surface in order to increase soil temperatures. As there are no published data on the effect of pruning on black <b>truffle</b> production, a <b>field</b> trial was established to document the impact of canopy pruning on host physiology and soil temperature.
