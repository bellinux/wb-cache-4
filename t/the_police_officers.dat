5|$|Due to an {{accidental}} {{killing of a}} teenage girl while trying to shoot a psychotic suspect, the Tainan City Police Bureau {{made a decision to}} develop a special kind of baton in 2006. When dealing with suspects without firearms, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> are expected to use the baton first in order to reduce accidents. To commemorate the girl who died, mayor Hsu named the baton after her.|$|E
50|$|On October 17, 1993, in {{the city}} Halifax, Nova Scotia, a black youth was arrested, {{allegedly}} for assaulting <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> Stienburg while he was attempting to arrest another individual. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> claimed that <b>the</b> youth ran into him with his bike attempting to free <b>the</b> individual <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> already had handcuffed. The youth, on the other hand, alleges that he stopped his bike to see what <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> was doing, as a crowd had amassed at the scene. The youth recognised the individual being arrested and asked him repeatedly if he should call his mother, not once addressing the officer. Hearing the youth, the officer threatened to arrest him. When the youth continued to talk <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> arrested him.|$|R
50|$|A <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> finds a goat {{roaming the}} streets of Bansha and, presuming her to be either a loiterer or a prostitute ('Stholler', as used in the poem, has both of these definitions), announces that he will soon send her off to prison. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> and <b>the</b> goat argue over the {{circumstances}} of her arrest, {{and whether or not}} <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> would actually {{be able to get a}} conviction for a crime not committed. At the end of the song, the goat accuses <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> of being drunk, and asserts that if she had had enough money to purchase illegal liquor for <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer,</b> would have been allowed to go free.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> {{is another}} {{indication}} of the syncretic way of selecting procession characters: this character resembles the leader of similar żandary parades from Poznań. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> leads <b>the</b> procession, marches {{in the front and}} chooses <b>the</b> route. <b>Police</b> <b>officers</b> stop cars passing by to give the drivers [...] "holiday fines" [...] and knock on the doors of nearby houses so the hosts admit the procession and offer the participants some refreshments. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> collects donations offered by passers-by, drivers or other people. The person playing this role must be sociable and able to integrate the group and make people laugh.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, 25 {{years after}} the incident, former Gov. Romero Barceló {{admitted}} in a public radio interview that it was “an error of judgment” and “a premature declaration” to laud <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers,</b> since at that time he believed they were {{telling the truth about}} their self-defense. However, he has publicly denied any wrongdoing regarding the alleged cover-up during the first investigations.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, the Massachusetts {{legislature}} transferred {{control of}} the Boston police department from Boston's mayor to the governor of Massachusetts, whom it authorized to appoint a five-person board of commissioners to manage the department. In 1906, the legislature abolished that board and gave the governor the authority to name a single commissioner to a term of five years, subject to removal by the governor. The mayor and the city continued to have responsibility for the department's expenses and the physical working conditions of its employees, but the commissioner controlled department operations and the hiring, training, and discipline of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Boston Police Strike, Boston police {{officers}} {{went on strike}} on September 9, 1919. They sought recognition for their trade union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that {{police officers}} had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Attempts at reconciliation between the Commissioner and <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers,</b> particularly {{on the part of}} Boston's Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.|$|E

5|$|The Cerro Maravilla murders, {{also known}} as the Cerro Maravilla massacre, is the name given by the Puerto Rican public and media to {{describe}} the events that occurred on July 25, 1978, at Cerro Maravilla, a mountain in Puerto Rico, wherein two young Puerto Rican pro-independence activists were murdered in a Puerto Rico Police ambush. The event sparked a series of political controversies where, in the end, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> were found guilty of murder and several high-ranking local government officials were accused of planning and/or covering up the incident.|$|E
5|$|Between 9:00pm and 10:00pm {{the guards}} enacted a {{strategy}} whereby <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers,</b> {{backed by the}} bayonets of the soldiers, advanced to the crowd and arrested each a man, who was then taken into the station, disarmed, and held there. The strategy was largely successful, and by 11:00pm {{the area around the}} station was mostly cleared, though sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the night. Between 165 and 200 were detained in total, and the most violent of the captives were removed and taken to the police station. The news reported that four, including one police officer, were injured in the exchange, and several who resisted arrest were beaten severely.|$|E
5|$|By 9:00am it was {{apparent}} that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It {{was the first time that}} the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E

5|$|FITs {{were first}} {{formed in the}} early 1990s, {{as part of the}} Public Order Intelligence Unit (CO11), a section of the Public Order Branch of the Metropolitan Police. They {{initially}} targeted football fans, hunt saboteurs and political protesters (since at least 1996), using cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> wear full uniform, and are intended to be a highly visible presence. Their uniform is sometimes different from normal police officers in that the upper half of their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue. Civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside FITs. According to Scotland Yard, the aim of FIT teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later on at a protest.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, {{feared that}} the Lakota leader was about to flee the {{reservation}} with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him. On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead (noted as Bull Head in lead), an Indian agency policeman, that included instructions and a plan to capture Sitting Bull. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised {{the use of a}} light spring wagon to facilitate removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.|$|E
5|$|In Liverpool, at 8:30 am on 17 May, Saturday, {{the twins}} went into St Anne Street Police Station to report {{concerns}} over Sabina's children. At midday the pair boarded a National Express coach to London. A police report {{stated that the}} twins suddenly disembarked from the coach at Keele services, a motorway service station, as they were not feeling well. The driver of the coach, however, said he left them at Keele services after becoming suspicious of their behaviour. He noticed the twins clinging tightly to their bags and did not let them re-board because they refused to let him search their bags for illegal items. The manager of the service station was informed and, also feeling suspicious of the pair, called <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> <b>Officers</b> arrived {{to talk to them}} but left after deeming the women harmless.|$|E
40|$|I {{have studied}} {{the issues of the}} Swedish periodical, Polistidningen, over a period from 1974 to 2008 to examine how the image of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> is constructed. My main {{ambition}} was to explore how the magazine in question constructs the concept of <b>the</b> good <b>police</b> <b>officer,</b> in other words, what kind of police attributes were rewarded or encouraged. To do this I wanted to study changes over time in order to reveal the development of the concept of <b>the</b> good <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> as it evolved. Through a critical discourse analysis of the material, I identified three themes that together formed a comprehensive picture: <b>the</b> <b>police</b> culture, <b>the</b> woman <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> and <b>police</b> education. During <b>the</b> 1970 ’s, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> was a man with a neat appearance. The view of education was mechanical and <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> was fed with theoretical knowledge. He was a police cadet in Stockholm and in a climate of contemporary hatred towards <b>the</b> <b>police,</b> <b>the</b> job was tough. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> culture provided him a sense of safety and confidence, but his female colleagues were not welcome. In the 1980 ’s, <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> was a man and the job was seen as labourer work. The neat uniforms were replaced by leather jackets, which were a physical protection against knife stabbings and a mental shield against the hatred towards <b>the</b> <b>police</b> from <b>the</b> outside world. <b>The</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> was described as a superman: a tough policeman with a heart of stone. If <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> worked at Norrmalm, a district in central Stockholm, he worked in a culture where violence was a part of everyday life and where rumours of military marches beating time when the baton swung in the air were spread in the media. The spirit of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> body was <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer’s</b> shield against criminal charges and he protected his colleagues under the same premise. His female colleagues existed, but were not to be seen...|$|R

One of <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> who breaks the news to Dot is Nick's son Charlie Cotton, although it is later revealed that he is impersonating a police officer. Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne. During the funeral, Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from looking in the coffin. Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne {{to tell the truth}} and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson. A few weeks later, Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice, when he leaves his phone at her house, she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} {{motorcade}} {{to turn around}} at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and because <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E
5|$|One {{young man}} kicked and smashed {{the window of}} a police car, lit a pack of matches, and set the {{upholstery}} on fire. After burning for a short time, the fuel tank exploded; a dozen more police cars and eight other automobiles would be destroyed in a similar fashion. The photo on the front cover of the Dead Kennedys 1980 album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, which shows several police cars on fire, was taken that night. Several crowd members threw tear gas, which they had stolen from police vehicles. Riots began to break out, with one mob disrupting traffic. Electric trollies were disabled when their overhead wires were pulled down, and violence broke out against <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers,</b> who were outnumbered. Police Chief Charles Gain, standing inside City Hall, ordered officers not to attack and to simply stand their ground.|$|E

Leaving the money in their underground hideout, Diabolik and Eva attend a press conference held by the Minister of the Interior which they disrupt by releasing laughing gas. Due to {{the high level of}} crime, the death penalty is brought back. The police cannot find Diabolik, and gang leader Valmont suffers at their hands from a clampdown because of his actions. Realising things can only get worse because of Diabolik's crime spree, Valmont contacts Inspector Ginko and makes a deal to catch him for the police. At his hideout, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace from the Saint Just Castle for Eva's birthday. Valmont builds up an identikit picture of Eva and circulates it as a means of capturing Diabolik. Diabolik scales the walls of Saint Just Castle where he finds the police lying in wait. He manages to steal the necklace by fooling <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> with mirrors on the road and dummy decoys of himself.|$|E
5|$|Jan Wiley {{was cast}} as Scott's wife, Virginia. Although Wiley had {{appeared}} in several movies throughout the 1930s and 1940s, The Brute Man marked one of her final film performances. It was also recalled {{as one of her}} most memorable film appearances along with another Universal Pictures B horror film, She-Wolf of London. However, her performance in The Brute Man proved to be a less than memorable one for her, so much so that in an interview shortly before Wiley's death in 1993, she could barely remember even having appeared in the film. Donald MacBride and Peter Whitney portray <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> Captain M.J. Donelly and Lieutenant Gates, respectively. Their roles serve as comic relief for the film. Their characters portray the incompetence of the police force in their inability to find and arrest the Creeper and their focus on passing blame for their failures rather than diverting resources toward his arrest.|$|E
