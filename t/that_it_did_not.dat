40|$|Butyrate, in {{relatively}} low concentrations, {{has been shown}} to induce synthesis of enzymes, cause changes in cell morphology, and inhibit growth of a variety of mammalian cells in tissue culture (reviewed in [1]). In this communication, we report our observations on the effect of butyrate on lymphocyte activation. Butyrate completely and reversibly inhibits mitogen-induced blast formation. We present evidence <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> interfere with the binding of mitogens, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> inhibit a number of the “early” reactions involved in activation, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> affect ongoing DNA synthesis {{for an extended period of}} time. However, butyrate rapidly inhibits any increase in the rate of DNA synthesis...|$|R

She was asked to watch the episode being produced to ensure <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> breach any of the network's censorship rules. Several of the scenes that were being produced required quite small spaces during filming, requiring Nutter to record additional coverage on a handheld camera, which he later played back to the Standards and Practices liaison for approval.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{was created to}} {{accompany}} the song featuring Gaga.

It received mixed feedback from critics who called it un-interesting, and felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> present anything new. However, they complimented the costumes and the cinematic homage of the video. The video {{went on to win the}} BET award for Video of the Year.|$|E
5|$|A strong upper-level trough {{moving through}} the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward, which also {{triggered}} the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have {{the characteristics of a}} tropical cyclone. Therefore, it is not considered to be a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275mi (445km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|In February, Magoon {{was called}} {{to testify before the}} Senate Committee {{responsible}} for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report.

5|$|In January 2013, NJDOT {{announced}} that {{work on the}} $335 million projects for repaving and restoration of the roadway would begin {{at the end of}} 2013. To facilitate the work, the eastbound lanes (northbound US1/9) would close for two years after the Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014 at the nearby Meadowlands Sports Complex. The proposal was opposed by local politicians, who contended <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> satisfactorily address the effect on local traffic and called for more thorough investigation into alternatives. The closure date was postponed by NJDOT to more completely work out comprehensive traffic and travel options.|$|E
