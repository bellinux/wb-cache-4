40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} adding of metric real time to joint actions, {{and to the}} DisCo specification language and tool {{that are based on}} them. No new concepts or constructs are needed: time is represented by variables in objects, and action durations are given by action parameters. Thus, we can reason about real-time properties in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> as <b>about</b> other properties. The scheduling model is unrestricted in the sense that every logically possible computation gets some scheduling. This is more general than maximal parallelism, and the properties proved under it are less sensitive to small changes in timing. Since real time is handled by existing DisCo constructs, the tool with its execution capabilities can be used to simulate and animate also realtime properties of specifications. 1.

However, her anger at Laurie dissipates when Laurie's boyfriend Smith breaks up with her, having realized that he didn't feel <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>about</b> her as she did about him.

Travis falls into a depressive funk, stops going to college, and moves into Bobby's boat (while Bobby moves into an apartment). Finally, he impulsively moves to Hawaii and gets a job cleaning surfboards, forcing everyone else to follow him. At the same time, Grayson brings up the idea of having kids with Jules, who tells him she can't even consider it because of her stress over what her only child is doing with his life.

30|$|In theory, {{a better}} overall system {{performance}} {{could possibly be}} obtained by a general linear precoding scheme without the zero-forcing constraints of SZF. Those constraints do result in a restriction on the degrees of freedom that the transmitter has to transmit data to users. However, from a practical standpoint, we wish to note that often when linear precoding is implemented in practice, the base station may be restricted in its choice of precoding vectors and/or covariance matrices. For instance, the base station may have to perform precoding based on selections from a codebook [18, 19]. ZFB and BD are then approximated at the base station by selecting beamforming vectors for a given user that are aligned with that user's channel, but are not aligned with (i.e., near-orthogonal to) the channels of the other scheduled users. SZF can thus also be approximated in much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> with <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> complexity. <b>The</b> difference is that instead of selecting vectors unaligned with all other users, the base station would instead select ones that are unaligned with only the previously considered users.|$|R

Naturalism tries to explain these appearances without positing non-real objects or states of affairs. Biological naturalism explains that the false and the empty are tokens which fail to perform the function proper to their biological type.

The sensory stimuli which trigger the frog’s gulp-launching signal may be a poor guide to the signal’s content. Teleosemantics should be anti-verificationist.
