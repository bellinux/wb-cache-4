5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Skáldskaparmál, a partially euhemerized account is given of Ægir visiting the gods in Asgard and shimmering swords are brought out and used as their sole source of light as <b>they</b> <b>drink.</b> There, numerous gods feast, they have plenty of strong mead, and the hall has wall-panels covered with attractive shields. This location is confirmed as Valhalla in chapter 33.|$|E
5|$|The Sinclair {{method is}} a method of using {{naltrexone}} or another opioid antagonists to treat alcoholism by having the person take the medication {{about an hour before}} <b>they</b> <b>drink</b> alcohol, and only then. The medication blocks the positive reinforcement effects of ethanol and hopefully allows the person to stop drinking or drink less.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the main {{findings of a}} survey carried out to provide an up-todate picture of adult drinking patterns in Northern Ireland in 2008. The findings are based on responses to a questionnaire from {{a representative sample of}} 1753 respondents aged between 18 and 75 years old. The report examines the amount of alcohol respondents consumed, when, where and what <b>they</b> <b>drank</b> and who <b>they</b> <b>drank</b> with, together with binge and problem drinking. Those respondents who said that <b>they</b> <b>drank</b> alcohol were asked a series of questions about their alcohol consumption in the week prior to the survey...|$|R
5|$|Western jackdaws {{have learned}} to peck open the foil caps of milk bottles left on the doorsteps after {{delivery}} by the milkman. The bacterium Campylobacter jejuni has been isolated from their beaks and cloacae so milk can become contaminated as <b>they</b> <b>drink.</b> This activity was linked to cases of Campylobacter gastroenteritis in Gateshead in northeast England and led the Department of Health to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded. It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds attacking bottles in future.|$|E
5|$|The account starts briskly; {{only four}} pages {{are devoted to}} Ralph's early life and a further {{fourteen}} to his voyage to the Pacific Ocean on board the Arrow. He and his two companions– 18-year-old Jack Martin and 13-year-old Peterkin Gay– are the sole survivors of the shipwreck. The narrative is in two parts. The first describes how the boys feed themselves, what <b>they</b> <b>drink,</b> the clothing and shelter they fashion, and how they cope with having to rely on their own resources. The {{second half of the}} novel is more action-packed, featuring conflicts with pirates, fighting between the native Polynesians, and the conversion efforts of Christian missionaries.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Tom (Shearsmith), a primary school teacher, apathetically marking work while chatting {{to his girlfriend}} Gerri (Arterton), {{who is going to}} {{audition}} for a part in a play. Tom complains about a tramp begging outside their house. Later in the evening, Tom is home alone and Migg (Pemberton), the tramp, comes to his door, to return Tom's wallet. Tom rewards him with £40. Migg comes back later with a bottle of whiskey for Tom. Reluctantly, Tom invites Migg inside for a drink. Migg says he knew Charles Bukowski, whom Tom as an aspiring author idolises, and Tom warms to Migg as <b>they</b> <b>drink.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{achieved}} {{a condition in}} which my body was never free from alcohol. Nor did I permit myself to be away from alcohol. If I travelled to out-of-the-way places, I declined to run the risk of finding them dry. I took a quart, or several quarts, along in my grip. In the past I had been amazed by other men guilty of this practice. Now I did it myself unblushingly. And when I got out with the fellows, I cast all rules by the board. I <b>drank</b> when <b>they</b> <b>drank,</b> what <b>they</b> <b>drank,</b> and in the same way <b>they</b> <b>drank.</b>|$|R

5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount <b>they</b> <b>drink.</b> Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E
5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, <b>they</b> <b>drink</b> like sappers. What {{a pleasure to see}} these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the singer recalling {{memories}} from a hangover, including images of whiskey, a shoe in a chandelier, and her making out with a man flash on the screen, particularly getting a bottle of whiskey and drinking it with him. In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where <b>they</b> <b>drink</b> champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows {{a glimpse of the}} other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her shirt off, smears cake on her face, pours champagne on herself and starts to dance with her guests and the waitresses. In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was drinking with. The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo in a dark room, with mascara dripping from her eyes while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and smoking a cigarette.|$|E

5|$|Yellow-bellied marmots are diurnal, and {{are less}} active during the night. They are omnivores, but {{generally}} eat {{a wide variety of}} plants, as they are generalist herbivores.They mostly feed on grass, grains, leaves, flowers, legumes, bird eggs, and insects. Occasionally, they are also known to eat fruits and bark of fruit trees. In food choice experiments, yellow-bellied marmots are known to reject plants containing defensive compounds. Due to this, they consume flowers of lupinus, larkspur, and columbine, but avoid their shoots containing toxic compounds. Their food choice depends upon the fatty acid and protein concentrations, which are well present in cinquefoil, cow-parsnip, and leaves of dandelion, which are also present in their diet. In late summer, however, grasses, forbs, and seeds make up most of their diet. They also like to feed on alfalfa and clover. <b>They</b> <b>drink</b> less water, as their plant diet mostly serves their water requirements.|$|E
5|$|The Inquirers {{circulation}} {{has been}} dropping since the 1980s, {{and except for}} briefly seeing a rise in weekday circulation in 2007, The Philadelphia Inquirers weekday and Sunday circulation has continued to steadily drop since Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Loss of circulation combined with an unexpected drop in advertising revenue have forced more than 400 job cuts at The Inquirer and Daily News since they were bought by Philadelphia Media Holdings. As Philadelphia Media Holdings financial situation worsened in 2008 employees began complaining about how management has been monitoring things such as bathroom breaks and the coffee <b>they</b> <b>drink,</b> and that Tierney has been patrolling the parking garage seeing what time employees arrive for work. Despite efforts to manage the financial strain, on February 21, 2009, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the paper, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company hoped to restructure the US$390 million in debt it borrowed to buy the newspapers, but the end result was that the papers were auctioned off to the company's lenders. The beginning of 2009 also saw the filing of a lawsuit that accused The Philadelphia Inquirer of writing critical stories about Chester Community Charter School's use of public funds after business negotiations between school operator Vahan H. Gureghian and Tierney failed.|$|E
25|$|Water {{fluoridation}} pits {{the common}} good against individual rights. Some say {{the common good}} overrides individual rights, and equate it to vaccination and food fortification. Others say that individual rights override the common good, and say that individuals have no choice in the water that <b>they</b> <b>drink,</b> unless <b>they</b> <b>drink</b> more expensive bottled water, and some argue unequivocally, {{that it does not}} stand up to scrutiny relative to medical ethics.|$|E

The average consumption for students was nine drinks per week, while 29% reported that <b>they</b> <b>drink</b> on 10 or more occasions per month.

25|$|Dracunculiasis, {{also called}} Guinea-worm disease (GWD), is an {{infection}} by the Guinea worm. A person becomes infected when <b>they</b> <b>drink</b> water that contains water fleas infected with guinea worm larvae. Initially {{there are no}} symptoms. About one year later, the person develops a painful burning feeling as the female worm forms a blister in the skin, usually on a lower limb. The worm then emerges from the skin {{over the course of}} a few weeks. During this time, it may be difficult to walk or work. It is very uncommon for the disease to cause death.|$|E
25|$|They feed in {{the mornings}} and evenings. They use their semi-prehensile lips to grasp grass stems, bend the stem down, bite off the top, and then eat the grass. They tackle very tall grasses or saplings by walking over the plant, with legs {{on both sides and}} using the weight of their bodies to push the end of the plant down {{to the level of the}} mouth. Mothers also use this {{technique}} to make food edible for their calves. <b>They</b> <b>drink</b> for a minute or two at a time, often imbibing water filled with rhinoceros urine.|$|E
