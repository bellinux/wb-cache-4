A new <b>tubular</b> cathode <b>support</b> for Direct Ethanol Fuel Cell (DEFC) was {{prepared}} by the gelcasting process using mesocarbon microbead(MCMB) and graphite as the main raw materials.

The <b>tubular</b> silica <b>supports</b> were filled with glycerol/water mixtures to reduce the penetration of synthesis solution, and it was found that this solution-filling method could effectively improve the membrane flux by about 27 % with a higher separation factor.

40|$|Carbon {{membranes}} {{produced from}} the carbonization of polymeric materials is a promising candidate for gas separation, as it offers good permeability-selectivity combination exceeding polymeric membranes. Carbon membranes are particularly useful in gas separation, and excellent separation {{could be achieved}} even between gases with almost similar molecular size. In this study, <b>tubular</b> <b>supported</b> carbon membrane was prepared using Matrimid 5218 as polymeric precursor. The polymer solution was coated {{on the surface of}} <b>tubular</b> <b>support</b> by using dip-coating method. In order to produce a high quality carbon membrane, the effect of carbonization temperature on the gas permeation properties was studied.

Based on the results, the highest CO 2 / N 2 selectivity of 79. 69 was obtained for carbon membrane prepared at 850 °C.

40|$|Different from {{traditional}} seeded method, NaA zeolite membranes (NZMs) were prepared by in situ synthesis onto the inner side of porous α-alumina <b>tubular</b> <b>supports</b> in a hydrothermal synthesis reactor. The influences of pretreatment of porous <b>tubular</b> <b>support,</b> temperature, time, and synthetic cycle for {{the synthesis of}} the zeolite membranes were investigated. The operating conditions were optimized. Characterization of the membranes by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction showed that the crystalline materials on the inner surface of the porous α-alumina tubes were NaA-type zeolite. Single- and binary-gas permeation tests were conducted. Single-component permeabilities of hydrogen and nitrogen through the NZM changed slightly when the transmembrane pressure difference varied from 80 to 420 [*]kPa. Its selectivity for H 2 relative to N 2 was about 5. 3, which was {{greater than that of}} the Knudsen diffusion. The separation factors of binary gases H 2 /N 2 and H 2 /CO 2 at 473 [*]K were 3. 9 and 5. 7, respectively, again exceeding the Knudsen diffusion level.
