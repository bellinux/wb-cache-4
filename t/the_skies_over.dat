5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>over</b> Iraq's {{border with}} Turkey, an Iraqi fighter pilot shoots down a UFO. Later, in Lexington, Tennessee, {{a truck driver}} named Ranheim shoots {{something}} in the dark as another UFO flies overhead. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate the sighting the next day, but Ranheim is quickly let go by the uncooperative local authorities. In a seemingly inconsequential event, a woman briefly borrows Scully's pen before they leave Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|The {{supremacy}} of the Fifth Air Force in <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>over</b> Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first}} month of the war to resort to night movement of supplies to the battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front, however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals.|$|E
5|$|Word of the dogfight spread {{throughout}} the area, and an air alert was quickly posted over Seoul. In response, four F-80C Shooting Star aircraft of the 35th Fighter-Bomber Squadron under US Captain Raymond E. Schillereff were posted in <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>over</b> Seoul to counter any North Korean aircraft appearing in the area. The F-80s were jet engine-powered fighter aircraft which would easily defeat all of the aircraft known in the North Koreans' air force.|$|E

5|$|Between October 1957 and July 1960 Braham {{commanded}} No. 432 Squadron {{flying the}} Avro Canada CF-100. While {{there he was}} involved in a mid-air collision, losing a wing and unable to jettison the canopy. He ejected through the canopy, parachuting to safety but sustaining back and head injuries. In the summer 1960, the family moved to Paris when he was appointed senior officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe (SHAPE). Braham flew when he could. He would patrol <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>over</b> Belgium, West Germany and Luxembourg in variants of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and English Electric Lightning. His tenure at SHAPE ended in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Each year in {{late summer}} {{thousands}} of black swans and ducks descend on the area as the inland waterways they inhabit dry up. Waterbirds such as pelicans, cormorants, oyster catchers and terns are common often year round. Egrets, ibis, herons and spoonbills feed on the seagrass and fairy wrens, chats, fantails and thornbills feed on insects and plants amongst the samphire. Each September stints and sandpipers arrive from the Northern Hemisphere in a spectacular display. With the abundance of birdlife the area attracts birds of prey with swamp harriers, collared sparrowhawks, black-shouldered kites, kestrels and little falcons are all seen in <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>over</b> St Kilda.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1944, Feldwebel Günther Henschel of 8./JG 1 downed a Mustang {{north of}} Caen. One Fw 190 was downed without human loss. On 16 June 1944, II./JG 1 moved its {{complement}} of 25 Fw 190s to Essay and was tasked with defending <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>over</b> {{the beaches of}} Normandy. During the transfer, 8./JG 1, was probably attacked by the P-51s of the 354th Fighter Wing, near Alençon. JG 1 lost three pilots and one mechanic riding passenger, and also lost were two other aircraft without human loss with a claiming of two P-51s downed credited to Lt. Friedrich Krakowitzer (24th kill) and Oberfeldwebel Günther Heckmann (13th kill). The base at Essay was bombed the same day by B-24 Liberators, making the airfield unsuitable for missions.|$|E

5|$|There {{have also}} been {{accidents}} involving the Apache helicopter in Israeli service. During the Lebanon War in 2006, two IAF AH-64A helicopters collided, killing one pilot and critically wounding three. In another incident in the conflict an IAF AH-64D crashed due to a malfunction in the main rotor, killing the two crew. In late 2007, the Israeli Air Force put further purchases and deliveries of AH-64Ds on hold during an investigation upon the aircraft's performance envelope. However, Israeli officials have since praised the Apache for its role in Operation Cast Lead in 2008, against Hamas in Gaza. In recent years, Israeli Apaches {{have been used to}} patrol <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>over</b> Gaza; strike operations against insurgents using these helicopters has become a frequent occurrence.|$|E
5|$|When Operation Linebacker {{began in}} May 1972, American fighter jets {{returned}} to the offense in <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>over</b> North Vietnam {{for the first time}} in nearly four years. Navy and Marine Corps fighters, reaping the benefits of their TOPGUN program, immediately enjoyed considerable success. In contrast by June, as Olds had predicted, the Air Force's fighter community was struggling with a nearly 1:1kill-loss ratio. To the new Inspector General, Lt Gen , Olds offered to take a voluntary reduction in rank to colonel so he could return to operational command and straighten out the situation. Olds decided to leave the Air Force when the offer was refused (he was offered another inspection tour instead) and he retired on June 1, 1973.|$|E
5|$|Born in Braunschweig, Waldmann {{volunteered for}} {{service in the}} Luftwaffe in 1940. After {{training}} at various pilot and fighter-pilot schools, he was posted to Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52—52nd Fighter Wing), operating on the Eastern Front, in August 1942. Here Waldmann fought in the aerial battles over Stalingrad, the Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the Crimea. He was credited with 84 aerial victories before briefly being transferred to the Western Front, where he was credited with one aerial victory. Back on the Eastern Front, Waldmann accumulated further victories, bringing his score to 125 victories by end of May 1944. He then fought in <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>over</b> France after the Western Allied Invasion of Normandy, claiming seven aerial victories, before converting to the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter in late 1944. Flying the Me 262, Waldmann shot down two North American P-51 Mustangs on 22 February 1945 before being killed in a mid-air collision {{with one of his}} squadron members on 18 March 1945 near Schwarzenbek, Holstein.|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffe was paralysed in {{the second}} half of December. The weather, {{recorded}} as −42°C (–44°F), was a meteorological record. Logistical difficulties and freezing temperatures created technical difficulties until January 1942. In the meantime, the Luftwaffe had virtually vanished from <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>over</b> Moscow, while the Red Air Force, operating from better prepared bases and benefiting from interior lines, grew stronger. On 4 January, the skies cleared. The Luftwaffe was quickly reinforced, as Hitler hoped it would save the situation. The Kampfgruppen (Bomber Groups) II./KG 4 and II./KG 30 arrived from refitting in Germany, whilst four Transportgruppen (Transport Groups) with a strength of 102 Junkers Ju 52 transports were deployed from Luftflotte 4 (Air Fleet 4) to evacuate surrounded army units and improve the supply line to the front-line forces. It was a last minute effort and it worked. The German air arm was to help prevent a total collapse of Army Group Centre. Despite the Soviets' best efforts, the Luftwaffe had contributed enormously to the survival of Army Group Center. Between 17 and 22 December the Luftwaffe destroyed 299 motor vehicles and 23 tanks around Tula, hampering the Red Army's pursuit of the German Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{supremacy}} of the Fifth Air Force in <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>over</b> Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first}} month of the war to resort to night movement of supplies to the battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front, however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals. The North Korea Army was able to maintain transport to its front lines over long lines of communications despite heavy and constant air attacks. The United Nations air effort failed to completely halt military rail transport. Ammunition and motor fuel, which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued to arrive at the front, though in smaller amounts than before. At best there were rations for only one or two meals a day. Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness.|$|E

25|$|Although not {{specifically}} prepared to conduct independent strategic air operations against an opponent, the Luftwaffe {{was expected to}} do so over Britain. From July until September 1940 the Luftwaffe attacked Fighter Command to gain air superiority {{as a prelude to}} invasion.

Destroying RAF Fighter Command would allow the Germans to gain control of <b>the</b> <b>skies</b> <b>over</b> the invasion area.
