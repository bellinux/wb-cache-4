40|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of private and federally funded research, which {{have led to a}} prodigious {{accumulation}} of information concerning the assessment and diagnosis of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and interventions for students diagnosed with ADHD, a minimal amount of research focus has centered around the application of assessment information in the development of treatment plans. The evolution of diagnostic labels for ADHD and variability among school-based assessment practices have impeded the utilization of assessment data in intervention planning. Although reaction to the challenges presented by ADHD students has been widespread, research generated by the interest in this heterogeneous population has only recently begun to integrate the assessment and intervention phases of ADHD referrals in the schools. In the present study, a survey questionnaire developed by the research author was completed by 250 Kindergarten through sixth grade teachers in 16 central-western Kentucky school systems. The sample consisted of regular education, special education, and Title One teachers with one to thirty-one plus years of experience, and educational backgrounds of the predominantly female sample ranged from Bachelor 2 ̆ 7 s to Doctoral degrees. The survey included four distinct sections, wherein participants were questioned about (a) knowledge level with respect to the diagnostic criteria and diagnostic labels for ADHD, (b) intervention preferences for addressing ADHD student behaviors in the classroom, (c) interventions which they would use for ADHD student behaviors under ideal classroom circumstances, and (d) opinions concerning the importance of a number of issues related to ADHD and the classroom teacher. Data analysis consisted of frequency and percentage distributions, chi-square tests, and measures of central tendency. <b>The</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> knowledge of the specific diagnostic criteria and classifications for ADHD is limited at this time. Interventions currently utilized by the teachers, although vaiying with respect to particular behaviors, commonly included positive / token reinforcement, punishment, and response cost.

This study sought to investigate the impact of competition {{on the performance of}} the mobile telecommunication industry in Kenya. This research aimed at looking at how competition has impacted on performance of the four firms in the sector i. e. Orange Kenya, Airtel, Yu and Safaricom (K) ltd. The study used a descriptive research design that answered questions how competition affects the independent variables of the study i. e. new market entrants, competitive rivalry and buyer power. Simple stratified sampling was used to select the sample of the respondents to avoid bias and ensure that samples drawn were representative of the population of mobile service subscribers of the four firms. Data collection was done using questionnaires and analyzed using Ms Excel. The results were presented using bar graphs and pie charts. The study found out that competition has an impact on the performance of firms and this accounted for 79. 8 % while 20. 2 % of <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> competition did not have an impact on performance of firms. From the research it was further established that majority of <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> new market entrants, competitive rivalry and buyer power affects performance of the firms in this industry accounting for 61. 2 % while 38. 8 % of <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> new market entrants, competitive rivalry and buyer power did not affect the performance of the firms in the telecommunication industry in Kenya.
