5|$|Yasui v. United States, 320 U.S. 115 (1943) was a United States Supreme Court case {{regarding}} {{the constitutionality of}} curfews used during World War II when they were applied to citizens of the United States. The case arose out of the implementation of Executive Order 9066 by the U.S. military to create zones of exclusion along the West Coast of the United States where Japanese-Americans were subjected to curfews and eventual removal to relocation centers. <b>This</b> <b>Presidential</b> order followed the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 that brought America into World War II and inflamed the existing anti-Japanese sentiment in the country.|$|E
25|$|On 15 May, Wiranto {{met with}} Suharto {{who had gone}} to Egypt to attend an {{economic}} summit but was forced to come back to attend to the situation back home. Suharto brought up the idea of reinstating the Restoration of Security and Order Operation Command (KOPKAMTIB) to deal with the situation. Finally, on 18 May, a Presidential Instruction was issued from Suharto to Wiranto. Wiranto was to be made Commander of the National Alertness and Safety Operation Command (KOPKKN). <b>This</b> <b>presidential</b> instruction have been compared to Supersemar. Suharto allowed Wiranto to choose whether or not he wants to use his new power and Wiranto chose not to.|$|E
25|$|At that point, the U.S. {{had not yet}} {{entered the}} war but was energetically re-arming. African Americans were barred from working in defense plants, a {{situation}} that greatly angered both African Americans and white progressives. Civil rights leader A. J. Muste and Black union leaders A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin began planning a huge march on Washington to protest racial discrimination in war industries and to urge desegregation of the armed forces. The march, which many regard as the first manifestation of the Civil Rights Movement, was canceled after President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 (The Fair Employment Act) of June 25, 1941, barring discrimination in hiring by companies holding federal contracts for defense work. <b>This</b> <b>Presidential</b> act defused black anger considerably, although the United States Army still refused to desegregate, declining to participate in what it considered social experimentation.|$|E

In the second round, the electors voted at 61.56% or 9,434 votes for Nicolas Sarkozy against 38.44% or 5,890 votes for Ségolène Royal, a result more right in relation to the national average that was, in the second round, 53.06% for Nicolas Sarkozy and 46.94% for Ségolène Royal.

The main objectives of the commission were to inquire into [...] "the circumstances surrounding the Iran-Contra matter, other case studies that might reveal strengths and weaknesses in the operation of the National Security Council system under stress, {{and the manner in which}} that system has served eight different presidents since its inception in 1947". The Tower Commission was the first presidential commission to review and evaluate the National Security Council.|$|E
500|$|On March 25, 2008, Gravel {{announced}} that he would leave the Democrats and join the Libertarian Party, saying: [...] "My libertarian views, as well as my strong stance against war, the military industrial complex and American imperialism, seem not to be tolerated by Democratic Party elites who are {{out of touch with the}} average American; elites that reject the empowerment of American citizens I offered to the Democratic Party at the beginning of <b>this</b> <b>presidential</b> campaign with the National Initiative for Democracy." [...] The following day Gravel entered the race for the 2008 Libertarian presidential nomination, saying that he would have run as a third-party candidate all along except that he needed the public exposure that came from being in the earlier Democratic debates. Gravel's initial notion of running as a fusion candidate with other parties was met with skepticism and not pursued.|$|E

500|$|Through December, Foraker {{worked to}} try to retain his Senate seat, which {{required}} action by the Ohio legislature in the era before direct election of senators. [...] His rivals were Burton and the President-elect's brother, former congressman Charles Phelps Taft, though {{near the end of}} the contest, former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding asked for his name to be considered. Both Foraker and Burton opposed Charles Taft's call for a caucus of the Republican legislators to determine the party's candidate. On December 29, President Roosevelt weighed in on the question. Roosevelt [...] "lost no time in putting the Republican members of the Ohio legislature on notice that to re-elect Mr. Foraker to the Senate would be regarded as nothing less than treason to the party". [...] Roosevelt accused Foraker of seeking to make a bargain with the Democrats to secure his re-election in exchange for a Democratic replacement for Dick in 1911. Faced with <b>this</b> <b>presidential</b> intervention and Charles Taft's withdrawal from the race, Foraker saw no path to victory and conceded on December 31. [...] The Republican caucus two days later selected Burton, whom the legislators duly selected on January 12.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{viewed the}} pardons as a pragmatic {{decision}} of national reconciliation. Others condemned them as unconstitutional, {{noting that the}} constitutionally acknowledged right of the president to pardon does not extend {{to those who have}} not yet been convicted – which was the situation in the case of some military officials. Others consider that <b>this</b> <b>presidential</b> privilege is inappropriate for modern times, a relic of monarchic rule that should be abolished. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize and chairman of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission that advocated for forgiveness and reconciliation, said: [...] "without forgiveness there is no future". Lieutenant-General Félix Martín Bonnet, who was then commander of the Argentine Army, welcomed the pardons as an [...] "inspiration of the armed forces, not only because those who had been their commanders were deprived of their freedom, but because many of their present members fought, and did so, in fulfillment of express orders." [...] In September 1999, {{in the aftermath of the}} bloodshed witnessed in the break-up from Indonesia, the East Timorese leader, Xanana Gusmao, also called for reconciliation. Not everyone agreed with his decision.|$|E
2500|$|Sharaf {{was quoted}} in the press expounding the {{development}} of Egyptian—Chinese bilateral relations, emphasizing the importance of Mubarak's visit, the nature of the consultations the president would hold with his Chinese counterpart, and the various issues to be discussed. Sharaf also pointed out to the press China's keen and growing interest in peace and stability in the Middle East, the Far East and the globe. As this was the first visit of an Egyptian president to China, several treaties, protocols and memoranda of understanding (MOU) were signed between the two countries in various fields including agriculture, industry, technical and military cooperation. [...] Also concluded was a MOU on the establishment of an Egyptian consulate in Shanghai, considered necessary for bolstering bilateral trade. Sharaf also assisted in securing an agreement from China, where the latter would finance and build the Friendship and Culture Palace, later renamed the Cairo International Convention & Exhibition Centre (CICC). President Mubarak had earlier approved a land site of 15 acres in the Cairo suburb of Nasr City for the project. The cost of the CICC was estimated to be about 200 million Swiss francs, and China agreed to present it as a gift to the people of Egypt. It was also during <b>this</b> <b>presidential</b> visit to Beijing that Mubarak held informal talks with the former U.S Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who was visiting China at the time.|$|E
