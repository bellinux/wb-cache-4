Under this problematic context, several growers in our area proposed alternatives to conduction systems. An innovation was the system of divided canopy “Ramé”, developed by the local viticulture Luis Alberto Ramero. This system was attempted to combine high yield with high quality grape, machanize harvest and good cinditions of canopy microclimate. It's a system of vertical shoot position, with its canopy divided into two planes. These systems are characterized, in our region, by a low foliar surface exposed per hectare, a relatively low productivity (in the case of the VSP) or difficulty to mechanize the harvest (in the case of the Parral). The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the ecophysiology of Rame system, determining if it behaves differently when it is planted with one or two plants by post (Rame single and double). Also the two modalities of Rame were compared with the trellis in VSP. Since this latter system is not included in the statistical, but planted design on the side of the test, the comparison kept a descriptive character. For the Rame we established an experimental trial with statistical design, with two treatments in <b>trellis-training</b> system. A treatment consisted in planting one vine per post, called simple Rame (RS) and two vines per post, called double Rame (RD), leaving in this way different number of plants per unit area (1600 plantas / has and 3200 plantas / has respectively). Nevertheless, regardless of the number of plants per hectare, Rame system maintain high values of anthocyanins (1, 2 mg/Kg of grapes) and IPT (43) with high production (152 qq / has). This fact, added to that the system has potential for mechanization, converts Rame in a trellis system with high potential for vine growth in the viticulture regions. The trellis VSP behaved less productive (86 qq / has), and at the same time obtained lower values of qualitative components such as anthocyanins (1. 04 [*]mg/Kg of grapes) and IPT (35) ...|$|E
