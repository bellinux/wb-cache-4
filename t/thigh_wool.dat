A total of 12 Corriedale lambs was used in this study. A few staples on the threes body regions were cut from each lamb on the day of docking, and the wool samples to be examined were taken from these staples. The samples were washed by immersing them in bath of ether, and were then mounted with balsam, and microscopically examined. The diameters of the wool fibres were subsepuently measured with an ocular, micrometer and then the coefficients of variation of the degree of the fibre fineness were calculated. The results obtained are as follows; 1. In general, the mean diameter of the tail wool was greater than those of the shoulder and <b>thigh</b> <b>wool</b> in such early age as in dccking time of the Corriedale lamb. 2. In the early age of lamb, relatively high positive correlations of the degree of fibre finenss between the tail and shoulder and <b>thigh</b> <b>wool</b> were found and thus, {{it can be said that}} more the mean diameter of the tall wool greater, the more those of the shoulder and <b>thigh</b> <b>wool</b> greater. 3. Positive correlations of the variability of the degree of the fibre fineness were found between the tail and the shoulder and <b>thigh</b> <b>wool,</b> and especially between the tail and <b>thigh</b> <b>wool,</b> a high correlation of the variability of the degree of the fiber fineness was found. So it may be concluded that generally the more the variability of the degree of the fibre fineness of the tail wool greater, the more those of the shoulder and <b>thigh</b> <b>wool</b> greater, especially the variability of the degree of the fibre fineness of the <b>thigh</b> <b>wool</b> greater. 4. It seems that the degree of the fiber fineness and its variability of the adult fleece can be predicted, and a selection of the sheep uniform in the degree of the fibre fineness over the fleece can be made by discriminating macroscopically the degree of the fibre fineness and its variability in the early age of lamb of the corriedale sheep.

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 11 DEC 2014 Sheep can be vectors for the long-distance dispersal of weeds when seed becomes attached and retained in wool or survives the gastrointestinal tract. This study aimed to determine an appropriate quarantine period for sheep that minimized {{the risk of}} the long-distance dispersal of the seeds of branched broomrape (Orobanche ramosaâ€…L. subsp. mutelii [F. W. Shultz] Cout.), a parasitic weed. Experiments with penned sheep found that the seeds that were placed on the soil surface adhered to the wool on the thigh and belly of the sheep, with most of the seeds attaching to the feet. Most of the seeds that were applied to the belly and <b>thigh</b> <b>wool</b> detached within 2 days, although a small proportion was present after 7 days. The seeds that were introduced to the digestive tract via drenching had a peak voidance 2 days later and no seed was detected on Day 8. It is suggested that a 7 day quarantine period for sheep would be sufficient in order to reduce {{the risk of the}} internal transport of seed to acceptable levels, but a small risk of the external transport of seed on the fleece remains.
