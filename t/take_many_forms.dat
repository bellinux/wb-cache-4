5|$|In {{developed}} counties, {{training programs}} specifically {{relating to the}} international practice of emergency medicine are now available within many emergency medicine residencies. The curriculum that should be covered by such programs {{has been the subject}} of much discussion. Patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning, communication skills, professionalism, and system-based practice are the basic six competencies required of programs approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, but the application of these goals can <b>take</b> <b>many</b> <b>forms.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{components}} in an electric circuit can <b>take</b> <b>many</b> <b>forms,</b> which can include {{elements such as}} resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components {{are those that are}} termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Violence {{against women}} may <b>take</b> <b>many</b> <b>forms,</b> {{including}} physical, sexual, emotional and psychological and may occur throughout the life-course. Structural violence may be embedded in legislation or policy, or be systematic misogyny by organisations against groups of women. Perpetrators of personal violence include state actors, strangers, acquaintances, relatives and intimate partners and manifests itself across a spectrum from discrimination, through harassment, sexual assault and rape, and physical harm to murder (femicide). It may also include cultural {{practices such as}} female genital cutting.|$|E

As a technological discipline, computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models for the construction of computer vision systems.|$|E
25|$|A cult is a {{religious}} perversion. It is a belief and practice {{in the world of}} religion which calls for devotion to {{a religious}} view or leader centered in false doctrine. It is an organized heresy. A cult may <b>take</b> <b>many</b> <b>forms</b> but it is basically a religious movement which distorts or warps orthodox faith to the point where truth becomes perverted into a lie. A cult is impossible to define except against the absolute standard of the teaching of Holy Scripture.|$|E
25|$|Trafficking of {{children}} involves the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt {{of children}} {{for the purpose of}} exploita commercial sexual exploitation of children can <b>take</b> <b>many</b> <b>forms,</b> including forcing a child into prostitution or other forms of sexual activity or child pornography. Child exploitation may also involve forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude, the removal of organs, illicit international adoption, trafficking for early marriage, recruitment as child soldiers, for use in begging or as athletes (such as child camel jockeys or football players).|$|E

25|$|Digestive systems <b>take</b> <b>many</b> <b>forms.</b> There is a {{fundamental}} distinction between internal and external digestion. External digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history, and most fungi still rely on it. In this process, enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism, where they break down an organic material, {{and some of the}} products diffuse back to the organism. Animals have a tube (gastrointestinal tract) in which internal digestion occurs, which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured, and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{referred}} to in works on architecture as foliate heads or foliate masks, carvings of the Green Man may <b>take</b> <b>many</b> <b>forms,</b> naturalistic or decorative. The simplest depict a man's face peering out of dense foliage. Some may have leaves for hair, perhaps with a leafy beard. Often leaves or leafy shoots are shown growing from his open mouth and sometimes even from the nose and eyes as well. In the most abstract examples, the carving at first glance appears to be merely stylised foliage, with the facial element only becoming apparent on closer examination. The face is almost always male; green women are rare.|$|E
25|$|Splitter: A {{splitter}} or {{riving knife}} is a vertical projection located behind the saw blade. This {{can be a}} pin or a fin. It is slightly narrower in width than the blade and located directly {{in line with the}} blade. The splitter prevents the material being cut from being rotated thereby helping to prevent kickback. Splitters may incorporate pawls, a mechanism with teeth designed to bite into wood and preventing kickback. Splitters can <b>take</b> <b>many</b> <b>forms,</b> including being part of the blade guard that comes standard with the saw. Another type of splitter is simply a vertical pin or fin attached to an insert. Splitters are available commercially or can be made from wood, metal or plastic.|$|E

25|$|Even when undocumented {{individuals}} are employed, their positions are often precarious. Approximately 40% of immigrant workers in low-wage jobs are undocumented. A lack of formal documentation means {{that many of}} these individuals must find work in the informal economy where {{there is a lack of}} protection for worker rights. Undocumented workers may have difficulty obtaining justice in cases of mistreatment since employers can easily threaten them with deportation. This leaves these immigrant workers vulnerable to exploitation. Exploitation may <b>take</b> <b>many</b> <b>forms,</b> one of these being wage theft. While there are regulations to protect the rights of workers, such as laws that cover private domestic work, these policies are often underutilized since workers may be unaware of their existence. Individuals who lack formal documentation may also feel less empowered to seek legal recourse because of fear of having their undocumented status made known.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{activity}} {{can be classified}} into the gender and sexual orientation of the participants, {{as well as by}} the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, intimate partners, casual sex partners or anonymous. Sexual {{activity can}} be regarded as conventional or as alternative, involving, for example, fetishism, paraphilia, or BDSM activities. Fetishism can <b>take</b> <b>many</b> <b>forms</b> ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, armpits or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include erotic asphyxiation and self-bondage. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes (choking and bondage, respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.|$|E
25|$|While {{governments can}} create {{regulations}} to control people's behaviours {{this can be}} undermined by illegal fishing activity. Estimates {{of the size of}} the illegal catch range from 11 to 26 million tonnes, which represents 14-33% of the world's reported catch. Illegal fishing can <b>take</b> <b>many</b> <b>forms.</b> In some developing countries, large numbers of poor people are dependent on fishing. It can prove difficult to regulate this kind of overfishing, especially for weak governments. Even in regulated environments, illegal fishing may occur. While industrial fishing is often effectively controlled, smaller scale and recreational fishermen can often break regulations such as bag limits and seasonal closures. Fisherman can also easily fish illegally by doing things such as underreporting the amount of fish they caught or reporting that they caught one type of fish while actually catching another. There is also a large problem with surveillance of illegal fishing activity. In 2001, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), passed the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU). This is an agreement with the intention to stop port states from allowing boats to dock that participated in illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing. It also gives details for port states on effective measures of inspecting and reporting illegal fishing. Some illegal fishing takes place on an industrial scale with financed commercial operations.|$|E
