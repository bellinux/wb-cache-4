5|$|After Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{continued}} to struggle on offense. Quarterback Riley Skinner was sacked, threw an 18-yard completion, then three incomplete passes.

During the Wake Forest drive, Skinner completed a 39-yard pass to John Tereshinski, who drove the Deacons inside Georgia Tech territory, where the drive continued.

Four days later I Corps troops pushed northward against crumbling enemy opposition to establish contact with forces of the 7th Infantry Division driving southward from the beachhead. Major elements of the North Korean Army were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of Suwon on 26 September. The offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel on 1 October. <b>The</b> <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capitol, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division and U.S. 1st Cavalry Division both entered the city.

5|$|Despite the {{disadvantage}} in numbers {{as well as}} attacking a fixed position, Williams' and Macdonell's small force was driving the opposing force {{to the edge of}} the gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup and stand firm. <b>The</b> <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him to fall from the horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a wound to the head, and Dennis by a severe wound to the thigh (although he continued to lead his detachment throughout the action).

5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to <b>the</b> <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 France met eternal arch-rivals England in the quarterfinal at Parc des Princes. Earlier in {{the year}} at Twickenham the two sides had played off for the Five Nations Grand Slam. The French scored three {{magnificent}} tries but were denied by the fearsome English forward pack. In a very tense and brutally physical match, the scores were tied at 10-all when the French were awarded a scrum five metres out from the tryline. French number eight Marc Cecillon looked set to score the try that would have won the game for the French. Suddenly he was hit and driven back in a tackle from opponent Mick Skinner, a tackle which changed <b>the</b> <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match.

40|$|The {{evolution}} and distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> dark matter (DM) halos {{have been discussed}} in several studies over the past decades. In particular, the idea arose that angular momentum conservation should allow to infer <b>the</b> total angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire DM halo from measuring <b>the</b> angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baryonic component, which is populating <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> halo, especially for disk galaxies. To test this idea and to understand the connection between <b>the</b> angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DM halo and its galaxy, we use the Magneticum simulations. We successfully produce populations of spheroidal and disk galaxies self-consistently. Thus, {{we are able to}} study <b>the</b> dependence <b>of</b> galactic properties on their morphology. We find that (1) <b>the</b> specific angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> stars in disk and spheroidal galaxies as a function of their stellar mass compares well with observational results; (2) <b>the</b> specific angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars in disk galaxies is slightly smaller compared to <b>the</b> specific angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cold gas, in good agreement with observations; (3) simulations including the baryonic component show a dichotomy in the specific stellar angular momentum distribution when splitting the galaxies according to their morphological type (this dichotomy can also be seen in the spin parameter, where disk galaxies populate halos with slightly larger spin compared to spheroidal galaxies); (4) disk galaxies preferentially populate halos in which <b>the</b> angular <b>momentum</b> vector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DM component in the central part shows a better alignment to <b>the</b> angular <b>momentum</b> vector <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire halo; and (5) <b>the</b> specific angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cold gas in disk galaxies is approximately 40 percent smaller than <b>the</b> specific angular <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total DM halo and shows a significant scatter.

5|$|Gannets, boobies, tropicbirds, some terns {{and brown}} {{pelicans}} all engage in plunge diving, taking fast moving prey by diving {{into the water}} from flight. Plunge diving allows birds to use the energy from <b>the</b> <b>momentum</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dive to combat natural buoyancy (caused by air trapped in plumage), and thus uses less energy than the dedicated pursuit divers, allowing them to utilise more widely distributed food resources, for example, in impoverished tropical seas. In general, {{this is the most}} specialised method of hunting employed by seabirds; other non-specialists (such as gulls and skuas) may employ it but do so with less skill and from lower heights. In brown pelicans the skills of plunge diving take several years to fully develop—once mature, they can dive from 20m (70ft) above the water's surface, shifting the body before impact to avoid injury. It has been suggested that plunge divers are restricted in their hunting grounds to clear waters that afford a view of their prey from the air, and while they are the dominant guild in the tropics, the link between plunge diving and water clarity is inconclusive. Some plunge divers (as well as some surface feeders) are dependent on dolphins and tuna to push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E
