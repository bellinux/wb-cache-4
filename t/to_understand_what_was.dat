5|$|Devil Daggers was {{released}} for Windows in February 2016, after being greenlit for release on digital distribution platform Steam. OS X and Linux versions were released in July and September 2016 respectively. The game received a positive reception from reviewers, with praise directed towards its sound design, unique visual style and challenging gameplay. However, some reviewers noted {{that during the}} latter stages of the game, the overwhelming number of enemies and visual style made it difficult <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening. Critics likened the aesthetics, movement and shooting mechanics of Devil Daggers to Doom, Quake and other first-person shooters of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{grew up in}} Dunblane and {{attended}} Dunblane Primary School. He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says {{he was too young}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening and is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Murray later attended Dunblane High School.|$|E

25|$|A Carnatic {{composition}} {{really has}} two elements, one being the musical element, the other being what is conveyed in the composition. It is {{probably because of}} this fact that most Carnatic music compositions are composed for singing. In addition to the rich musical experience, each composition brings out the knowledge and personality of the composer, and hence the words {{are as important as}} the musical element itself. This poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve just playing or singing the correct musical notes; the musicians are expected <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> conveyed by the composer in various languages, and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of her}} {{preparation}} for each day's filming, she had the Trill spots applied by makeup artist Mary Kay Morse, with Michael Westmore working on her detailing instead. This was a change from when Farrell had portrayed Jadzia, as in that case, Westmore had applied the spots himself each day. She made her first appearance in the season seven opener, [...] "Image in the Sand", for which she was required for only half a day, as she was in only one scene. [...] "I came in and I had one line — that's it, I hadn't even moved to L.A. yet and I hadn't found a place to live." [...] She began <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> required of her from her second episode onwards. She later explained that [...] "I never really got too freaked in the beginning. I thought more of this as the biggest job I've ever had, than going into the whole Star Trek phenomenon. I {{just wanted to do}} a good job." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} {{cited as a}} factor in the success of the civil rights {{movement}} in the 1960s, however, in that it [...] "arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions (of) the accelerating civil rights movement". Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them. Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book's effectiveness is that it [...] "inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion" [...] and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as [...] "an act of humanity" [...] in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices. Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of Uncle Tom's Cabin, a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War. Childress states the novel [...] "gives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they've been brought up with and to find another way. And most white people in the South were good people. Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc... I think the book really helped them come <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do, because it was popular art, because it was told from a child's point of view." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 17, 2008, The Toronto Star {{reported}} {{details from}} Canadians {{caught in the}} violent riots in Tibet. 19-year-old John Kenwood of Victoria, B.C. was witnessing a Chinese motorcyclist being pummelled unconscious by a Tibetan mob hurling chunks of pavement as big as bricks. [...] "He may have died," [...] Kenwood said last night (March 16). [...] "I can't be certain." [...] "He didn't seem <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on," [...] said Kenwood. [...] "He was wearing a gold helmet and he got off his bike and raised his arms. He didn't know what to do." [...] Also the report cited Canadian eye-witnesses of how the riots turned violent and how some of them escaped with help from taxi drivers and guides. Another report described in detail how Canadian traveller Justin Winfield from Toronto helped to save a Han Chinese from mobs {{and took him to}} a local hospital along with two women.|$|E
2500|$|After Germany invaded and {{occupied}} France, the Chagalls naively remained in Vichy France, unaware that French Jews, {{with the help}} of the Vichy government, were being collected and sent to German concentration camps, from which few would return. The Vichy collaborationist government, directed by Marshal Philippe Pétain, immediately upon assuming power established a commission to [...] "redefine French citizenship" [...] with the aim of stripping [...] "undesirables", including naturalized citizens, of their French nationality. Chagall had been so involved with his art, that it was not until October 1940, after the Vichy government, at the behest of the Nazi occupying forces, began approving anti-Semitic laws, that he began <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening. Learning that Jews were being removed from public and academic positions, the Chagalls finally [...] "woke up to the danger they faced". But Wullschlager notes that [...] "by then they were trapped". Their only refuge could be America, but [...] "they could not afford the passage to New York" [...] or the large bond that each immigrant had to provide upon entry to ensure that they would not become a financial burden to the country.|$|E
