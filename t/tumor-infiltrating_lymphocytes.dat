In addition, we were able to assess the proportion of shared TCR sequences between tumor and peripheral blood at time points before and after therapy, and found the level of TCR overlap to correlate with survival outcomes.

Importantly, TIL therapy increases the breadth of the tumor-reactive T cell compartment in vivo, and T cell reactivity observed post-therapy can almost in full be explained by the reactivity observed within the matched cell product.

Although major histocompatibility complex class II–restricted human CD 4 + T cells with specific antitumor reactivities have been described, no standard method exists for cloning the recognized tumor-associated antigen (Ag). In this study, biochemical protein purification methods were used in conjunction with novel mass spectrometry sequencing techniques and molecular cloning to isolate a unique melanoma Ag recognized by a CD 4 + <b>tumor-infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (TIL) line. The HLA-DRβ 1 * 0101 –restricted Ag was determined to be a mutated glycolytic enzyme, triosephosphate isomerase (TPI).

ResultsPatients with high levels of CD 8 + <b>tumor-infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> demonstrated better survival than those with low levels (3 -year survival: 83 % vs 28 %; P =. 06). Moreover, high levels of CD 8 + <b>tumor-infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were associated with a lower incidence of mediastinal node disease (P =. 004) and longer progression-free survival (P =. 05). Higher levels of CD 8 + <b>tumor-infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> were observed in patients treated with cisplatin and pemetrexed than in those treated with cisplatin and vinorelbine (P =. 02). Patients presenting high levels of CD 4 + or CD 25 + <b>tumor-infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> or low levels of CD 45 RO+ also demonstrated a trend toward shorter survival. However, the presence of FOXP 3 + <b>tumor-infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> did not affect survival.

Methods: The immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the infiltration density of T-bet+ lymphoid cells in human epithelial ovarian cancer tissues, and the flow cytometry analysis was used to further analyze the presence of T-bet+ <b>tumor-infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> subgroups in cancer tissues. Results: Our immunohistochemistry analysis showed increased number of T-bet+ lymphoid cells in the human epithelial ovarian cancer tissues, and the flow cytometry analysis further demonstrated the presence of T-bet+ <b>tumor-infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> subgroups including CD 4 +, CD 8 + T cells and NK cells. In addition, we also observed a significant association of T-bet+ <b>tumor-infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> density in the tumor nest of cancer with not only serum CA 125 levels but also with distant metastasis. However no association was observed with other characteristics like patients' age, pathological type, FIGO stage, tumor site and tumor size.

40|$|A {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocyte (CTL) clone {{was derived}} from a <b>tumor-infiltrating</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (TIL) population infused to a melanoma patient who remained relapse free for 10 yr after this adoptive transfer. This clone recognized all melanoma cell lines tested and, to a lower extent, melanocytes, {{in the context of}} human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen A 2 (HLA-A 2), but it did not recognize other tumor cell types. The gene coding for the antigen recognized by this clone was identified by the screening of a melanoma complementary DNA expression library. This antigen is overexpressed in melanomas, compared with other cancer cell lines and healthy tissues, and was thus called melanoma-overexpressed antigen (meloe). Remarkably, the structure of meloe was unusual, with multiple short open reading frames (ORFs). The peptide recognized by the CTL clone was encoded by one of these ORFs, called MELOE- 1. Using a specific HLA-A 2 /peptide tetramer, we showed a correlation between the infusion of TILs containing MELOE- 1 –specific T cells and relapse prevention in HLA-A 2 patients. Indeed, 5 out of 9 patients who did not relapse were infused with TILs that contained MELOE- 1 –specific T cells, whereas 0 out of the 21 patients who relapsed was infused with such TIL-containing lymphocytes. Overall, our results suggest that this new antigen is involved in immunosurveillance and, thus, represents an attractive target for immunotherapy protocols of melanoma...|$|R
40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} induces {{modification of}} the tumor microenvironment such as tumor surrounding region, which is relevant to treatment outcome after radiotherapy. In this study, the effects of pre-irradiated tumor beds on the growth of subsequently implanted tumors were investigated as well as underlying mechanism. The experimental model {{was set up by}} irradiating the right thighs of C 3 H/HeN mice with 5 Gy, followed by the implantation of HCa-I and MIH- 2. Both implanted tumors in the pre-irradiated bed showed accelerated-growth compared to the control. <b>Tumor-infiltrated</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (TIL) levels were increased, as well as pro-tumor factors such as IL- 6 and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b 1) in the pre-irradiated group. In particular, the role of pro-tumor cytokine interleukin- 17 A (IL- 17 A) was investigated as a possible target mechanism because IL- 6 and TGF-b are key factors in Th 17 cells differentiation from naı̈ve T cells. IL- 17 A expression was increased not only in tumors, but also in CD 4 + T cells isolated from the tumor draining lymph nodes. The effect of IL- 17 A on tumor growth was confirmed by treating tumors with IL- 17 A antibody, which abolished the acceleration of tumor growth. These results indicate that the upregulation of IL- 17 A seems to be a key factor for enhancing tumor growth in pre-irradiated tumor beds...|$|R
