40|$|As part of flood {{protection}} and land reclamation schemes, <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> allow rivers to discharge to sea when open, and prevent {{salt water intrusion}} when closed.

40|$|<b>Tide</b> <b>gates</b> form a {{temporal}} barrier to fish migration, closing during the flood tide and opening during the ebb, primarily for flood prevention and land reclamation. Their impact on downstream adult migration of the critically endangered European eel, Anguilla anguilla, is unknown. The River Stiffkey, UK, has three top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> (one counterbalanced, two not) through which it discharges into the North Sea. Adult eels of silver appearance (n?=? 118) were caught between 0. 5 and 6. 0 km upstream from the <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> in Autumn 2011 and implanted with 23 mm half-duplex passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Tagged individuals were detected by PIT antennae {{located near the}} <b>tide</b> <b>gates.</b> Of the eels tagged, 80 were detected actively migrating downstream to the gates. Escapement past the gates was 98. 3 %. Speed of migration was slower near the gates than for an unimpeded upstream reach and was positively and negatively related to mean degree of gate opening and mean light intensity, respectively. When the largest gate was modified through installation of an orifice intended to improve upstream passage of sea trout and juvenile eels, downstream migration was more rapid when it was operating. However, video analysis revealed that eels did not pass through the orifice, meaning that faster migration {{may have been a}} result of the gates being open on more occasions when eels initially approached them, or the lower tides and upstream saline intrusion that occurred during these periods.

50|$|<b>Tide</b> <b>gates</b> {{are used}} in {{conjunction}} with dykes and culverts. They can be placed at the mouth of streams or small rivers, where an estuary begins or where tributary streams, or drainage ditches connect to sloughs. <b>Tide</b> <b>gates</b> close during incoming tides to prevent tidal waters from moving upland, and open during outgoing tides to allow waters to drain out via the culvert and into the estuary side of the dike.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{structures}} fragment river connectivity, impeding {{the migration}} of diadromous fish between essential habitats. <b>Tide</b> <b>gates</b> are used worldwide primarily for flood protection and land reclamation by closing under hydraulic pressure during the flood tide and opening when head differential is sufficient during the ebb. Although <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> are known to decrease fish species richness, abundance, and movement, their impacts on {{the migration of}} ecologically and socioeconomically important diadromous fish in terms of passage efficiency and delay have not been reported elsewhere. Acoustic and passive integrated transponder telemetry revealed that passage efficiencies of upstream migrating adult brown trout, Salmo trutta (92 %), and downstream migrating juvenile sea trout smolts (96 - 100 %) and adult European eel, Anguilla anguilla (98 %), were high at top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> in two small English streams. However, these fish experienced delay at the gates (adult brown trout, median = 6. 0 h; sea trout smolts, mean = 6. 5 and 23. 7 h; eels, mean = 66. 2 h) when compared to migration through unimpeded reaches. The percentage of time the gates were closed and mean angle of opening were positively related to delay in both species and life stages. Diel periodicity also influenced delay for smolts and eels, which were more active at night. For adult trout, water temperature was positively associated with delay. Upstream and downstream water temperature and salinity were influenced by the temporal operation of the gates. Orifices installed in the gates did not mitigate delay for adult or juvenile trout. For adult eels, delay was decreased when an orifice was operational, although this coincided with more eels first approaching the gates when open, higher tides and greater saline intrusion upstream of the gates. When gates were open, fish would not pass immediately through, indicating the potential influence of a behavioural avoidance component. To {{examine the effect of}} hydrodynamics created by top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> with different aperture sizes, wild sea trout smolt behaviour was observed by video cameras in an experimental flume at night. Avoidance responses occurred within an average of 1. 4 fish body lengths upstream of the gate. Fish were more likely to exhibit avoidance (switch in orientation from negative to positive rheotaxis, increased tail beat frequency and/or retreat upstream) in the vicinity of a model gate with a smaller angle of opening and passage aperture. Overall, top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> delayed the migration of diadromous fish, potentially increasing energy expenditure and predation risk. Delay was not decreased by orifices. Modifying or replacing top-hung <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> with designs that allow them to open wider and for longer could reduce migratory delay and improve the environmental conditions that cause behavioural avoidance. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Tide gates {{serve an}} {{important}} role in drainage and maintenance of low-lying estuarine environments for agricultural and urban development. However, the benefits of a properly functioning traditional-style <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> are contrasted by its reduction of aquatic and terrestrial species habitat. Where water would naturally ebb and flow in and out of estuaries, tidal marshes, and low-lying coastal streams and tributaries, the <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> effectively cuts off this important interaction between fresh-water and salt water and significantly reduces aquatic species opportunity to migrate between coastal and upland environments.

40|$|Dramatic {{declines in}} salmon {{populations in the}} Pacific Northwest have brought new {{attention}} {{to the importance of}} estuarine rearing habitats. Levees and tide gates used to convert estuarine wetlands into farmland have reduced available habitat by more than half of historical levels. Recent efforts to restore estuarine habitats include <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> replacement, though this method has been poorly studied. As a key indicator of salmon habitat suitability, temperature was used to evaluate the effects of <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> replacement in a tidally influenced freshwater slough in the Lower Columbia River estuary. Three tide gates in the largest slough on Tenasillahe Island were replaced in 2007 with side-hinged aluminum gates.

The study employed a Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI) approach, collecting data seasonally two years before and after replacement at the impact site and at the control site, a relatively unaltered slough on nearby Welch Island. Randomized Intervention Analysis and Monte Carlo tests revealed no significant difference in slough water temperatures after <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> replacement, although minimum temperatures dropped up and downstream of the tide gates. Although the new tide gates did not {{have a significant effect on}} water temperature, the lower minimum temperatures may have been caused by a slight increase in tidal circulation.

There are no physical obstructions to the amount of historical estuarine habitat available to migrating adults or young-of-the-year fish in the Savannah River.

40|$|Abstract: Tide gates are {{frequently}} placed at confluences of streams with tidal waters. These gates prevent tidal waters from inundating low-lying lands while allowing stream flows to drain during lower tidal stages. Traditional tide gates effectively preclude an estuarine environment upstream {{of the gate}} and often block native fish from entering these tributary streams. In recent years, {{a new generation of}} tide gates has been installed with the intent of improving fish passage and allowing a limited amount of tidal inflow into the stream to create a longitudinal transition from the marine to freshwater environment. This new generation of <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> uses side-hinged doors that open wider to permit efficient outflow and produce slower water velocities to accommodate fish passage. These gates also allow a limited amount of tidal water to flow upstream. Inflow of tidal water is regulated to mute the peak tidal stage and preventing upstream tidal flooding. The muted tide is regulated by either: 1. a small adjustable opening that functions as an orifice and sized to prevent excessive tidal inflow, or 2. a mechanical float system that holds the gate open until the upstream stage reaches a predetermined threshold. Design of these muted tidal systems involves extensive hydraulic analysis to evaluate fish passage, prevent upstream tidal flooding, and create the desired estuarine conditions, including vegetation zonation. This presentation will illustrate the types of analysis and considerations employed with this new generation of tide gates. Two recently constructed <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> replacements designed for passage of all life stages of Pacific anadromous salmonids will be used as case examples to highlight the design proces...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{findings}} of the historic data analysis and the 1997 monitoring program was to confirm {{the importance of the}} stratification process and the density-driven circulation as the primary mechanisms determining the upstream intrusion of salinity. The analysis of the historic data showed that following the decommissioning of the <b>Tide</b> <b>Gate,</b> the maximum salinity intrusion along the Front River occurred primarily during neap-tide conditions, as opposed to maximums during spring tide when the <b>Tide</b> <b>Gate</b> was in operation. One potential cause for this alteration is the reduction in the velocities along the Front River above Fort Jackson, during ebbing tide following the decommissioning. Since the turbulence energy, which causes mixing, is directly proportional to the tidal velocities, a reduction in the flows causes an associated reduction in turbulent mixing. Therefore, during neap-tide conditions, there is not enough energy to break down the salinity gradient and water masses with higher salinity are able to intrude further into the system. This system of stratification and collapse was again observed in the data from the summer of 1997 monitoring program. As with the historical data, increased stratification and intrusion of the salinity wedge up the Front River was linked with neap tide conditions and destruction of stratification, and decreased intrusion were related to the spring tide condition. Figure 1 shows the clear development and collapse of stratification at station GPA- 04, near Fort Jackson just east of the confluence (or split) between the Front and Back Rivers. This is a critical juncture which controls the salinity conditions farther upstream. Also plotted in Figure 1 is the tidal elevation at station GPA- 01 just offshore of the Savannah River Entrance. It is clear that the level of stratification in the system {{is directly related to the}} tidal range, via the increasing and decreasing current velocity and, therefore, turbulent energy in the system...|$|E

40|$|Tide gates are one-way doors {{integrated}} into dyke systems that prevent saltwater intrusion to agricultural land and allow freshwater drainage to the estuary during low tide. Tide gates may act as fish passage barriers for juvenile salmonids, limiting movements during migration {{and access to}} rearing habitats. We conducted our research in Coos Bay, {{one of the many}} Oregon estuaries with extensive use of tide gates. Our objectives were to 1) develop a methodology for recording fish passage at tide gates 2) describe the conditions under which fish passage occurs and 3) compare fish passage behavior between a top-hinged <b>tide</b> <b>gate,</b> a side-hinged <b>tide</b> <b>gate</b> and a non-gated stream. We installed stationary passive integrated transponder (PIT) antennae around a top-hinged gate, a side-hinged gate and in a non-gated reference system to track the movement of PIT tagged juvenile coho salmon. Our results indicate that coho salmon smolt passed upstream most frequently at the non-gated channel (48 % of all smolts detected), than the side-hinge gated site (28 %) or the top-hinge gated site (3 %). Subyearling coho salmon passed more frequently at a specific range of gate angles and tailwater depths at both top hinged and side-hinged tide gates. Smolts preferred greater gate angles and tailwater depths than average to pass downstream at both tide gates. Subyearlings passed upstream more frequently during small gate angles and a narrow range of tailwater depths at the top-hinged gate but did not display preference for a particular condition at the side-hinged gate. At the top-hinged gate, conditions favorable for subyearling upstream passage occurred {{towards the end of the}} gate open period and therefore subyearlings were severely limited in their opportunities for passage.

40|$|Densities of fecal {{indicator}} bacteria (FIB) {{represented by}} total coliforms, E. coli and enterococci were measured within tidal channels of the Ballona Wetlands (Los Angeles County) {{to see if}} the wetlands act as a sink or source for these bacteria and to measure increases in FIB densities during wet weather. Samples were collected on 10 days over a 1 -yr period beginning February 2003 at four sites within the wetlands and one site in Ballona Creek opposite the west <b>tide</b> <b>gate.</b> Incoming flood and outgoing ebb tides were sampled during each sampling event at each station. Water from Ballona Creek may be a significant source of indicator bacteria in the wetlands. Within the tidal channels, densities for total coliforms typically ranged from 103 â€“ 104 MPN/ 100 ml, but ranged up to 106 during runoff events. Densities of E. coli and enterococci were orders of magnitude less than those measured for total coliforms, generally ranging from 101 â€“ 104 for E. coli, and 101 â€“ 105 for enterococci; greater densities were associated with runoff events. Densities of FIB tended to be up to three times greater during flood than ebb tide conditions depending on the tidal range. This result suggests that more FIB may be entering the wetlands on flood tides than leaving during ebbs, so that these bacteria either are being destroyed, sinking into the tidal channel sediments and plant surfaces, or both. This hypothesis needs to be tested by further identifying other possible FIB sources within the wetlands, and increasing the study designâ€™s statistical power to better characterize the flux of these bacteria entering and leaving the wetlands...|$|E

Net production in macrophytes decreased with elevation (4380 to 164 g rrr 2 yr _ 1), soil nitrogen (NH 3) remained high at all levels, and soil salinity was seasonally variable (7 to 54 ppt). Low redox potentials indicated persistent anaerobiosis. With the recent removal of <b>tide</b> <b>gates</b> and return of tidal fluctuation, {{much of the}} pre-existing marsh has been drowned...|$|R
