Altogether 189 assessments of the pupils’ grammatical development and 80 assessments regarding phonological development were carried out. The assessment instruments used were <b>tandem</b> <b>tests</b> generating comparable results in both languages. Tests based on a second language theory, Processability Theory, were used for grammatical assessment. For phonological assessment tests regarding phonological awareness and repetition of non-words were employed. All pupils developed grammatically as anticipated in both languages, although the grammatical development in their second language Swedish was somewhat slower for some pupils than predicted by Processability Theory. The results underscore {{the importance of a}} sufficient exposure to both languages. Phonological awareness was well developed in both languages, which was also expected since access to two or more phonological systems enhances the development of metalinguistic abilities...|$|E
40|$|Sound design can be {{described}} as an inherently complex task, demanding the designer to understand, master and balance technology, human perception, aesthetics and semiotics. Given this complexity, there are surprisingly few tools available that {{meet the needs of the}} general designer or developer incorporating sound as design material. To attend to this situation, two software systems are being developed. The purpose with these is to inform and support general design projects where sound is one part. The first system is intended to inform early stages of sound design projects. The second system is intended to simulate the sounding dimension of physical environments. Together these tools can be used to support designers and developers when searching for, testing and evaluating sounds suitable for interfaces, products and environments. To further complement these systems, a number of methods and guidelines are being developed in <b>tandem.</b> <b>Tests</b> to verify the systems have been conducted with very promising results...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{longitudinal}} changes in subjective and objective measures of physical performance in elderly Europeans. DESIGN: Longitudinal study including SENECA measurements 1993 - 1999. SETTING: Data {{were collected in}} 9 'traditional' European towns. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In total 444 men and women, born 1913 - 1918 participated both in the follow-up survey in 1993 and in the finale in 1999. Changes in Activities of Daily Living (ADL), the 7 item Physical Performance Test (PPT) and {{in the ability to}} perform the chair stand and the <b>tandem</b> <b>test</b> were measured. RESULTS: ADL and PPT did not change significantly between the 2 surveys, while participants needed more time to perform the chair stand (p< 0. 02) and their balance declined according to the <b>tandem</b> <b>test</b> (p< 0. 01). Men were significantly better than women, in all measures of physical performance. However, the decline in functioning was of the same magnitude. All tests showed significant variation between centres in physical function, Significant cross cultural variation was found for changes in the capacity to perform the objective tests. Tests of distributions showed good association between the self reported and objective measures of physical performance. Rather than assessing the same task in several ways, the measures may reflect different levels of disability, and as such be important end point measures. CONCLUSIONS: Both ADL and objective tests of simple functions applied well in the SENECA population. Physical performance declines with age. Across European towns variation in physical performance was identified...|$|R
40|$|Toxicological {{implications}} {{of exposure to}} bioavailable platinum group metals, here Pd, Pt, and Rh, are still to be clarified. This study obtained by a biosensor-based method preliminary information on potential effects on cellular metabolism {{as well as on}} possible tolerance mechanisms. Aerobic respiration was taken as the toxicological end point to perform <b>tandem</b> <b>tests,</b> namely functional toxicity test and tolerance test. Cells were suspended in the absence of essential constituents for growth. The dose-response curves obtained by exposure (2 h) to the metals (nanogram per gram range) suggested the same mechanisms of action, with Rh showing the greatest curve steepness and the lowest EC 50 value. Conservative (95 % lower confidence interval) EC 10 values were 187, 85 and 51 ng g- 1 for Pt, Pd, and Rh respectively. Tolerance patterns were tested during the same runs. The full tolerance obtained after 12 h of exposure to each metal suggested mitochondrial inhibition of aerobic respiration as a target effect. The hazard rating of the metals in the tolerance test changed in the Rh EC 50 range, where Rh showed the lowest toxicity. The observed tolerance might suggest a protective mechanism such as metallothionein induction at concentrations around the EC 50 values. The performance of the bioassay was satisfactory, in terms of the limit of detection, repeatability, reproducibility, roboustness, sensibility, and stability; the method's critical uncertainty sources were identified for improvements.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} a multi-station proprioceptive exercise program on functional capacity, perceived knee pain, and sensoriomotor function. Twenty-two patients (aged 41 - 75 years) with grade 2 - 3 bilateral knee osteoarthrosis were randomly assigned to two groups: treatment (TR; n = 12) and non-treatment (NONTR; n = 10). TR performed 11 different balance/coordination and proprioception exercises, twice a week for 6 weeks. Functional capacity and perceived knee pain during rest and physical activity was measured. Also knee position sense, kinaesthesia, postural control, isometric and isokinetic knee strength (at 60, 120 and 180 °·s- 1) measures were taken at baseline and after 6 weeks of training. There {{was no significant difference in}} any of the tested variables between TR and NONTR before the intervention period. In TR perceived knee pain during daily activities and functional tests was lessened following the exercise program (p < 0. 05). Perceived knee pain was also lower in TR vs. NONTR after training (p < 0. 05). The time for rising from a chair, stair climbing and descending improved in TR (p < 0. 05) and these values were faster compared with NONTR after training (p < 0. 05). Joint position sense (degrees) for active and passive tests and for weight bearing tests improved in TR (p < 0. 05) and the values were lower compared with NONTR after training (p < 0. 05). Postural control ('eyes closed') also improved for single leg and <b>tandem</b> <b>tests</b> in TR (p < 0. 01) and these values were higher compared with NONTR after training. The isometric quadriceps strength of TR improved (p < 0. 05) but the values were not significantly different compared with NONTR after training. There was no change in isokinetic strength for TR and NONTR after the training period. The results suggest that using a multi-station proprioceptive exercise program it is possible to improve postural control, functional capacity and decrease perceived knee pain in patients with bilateral knee osteoarthrosi...|$|E
40|$|Osteoporosis is a {{widespread}} disease, which often occurs without clinical symptoms. There is {{a large number of}} risk factors which are accepted as cause for osteoporosis. The forecast value of single risk factors for osteoporosis is relatively small and the efforts for the preparation of a risk score have so far been largely unsuccessful. The bone mass loss can be measured by osteodensitometry and the diagnosis of osteoporosis can be placed. Routine bone mineral density measurement of all women, however, is not feasible for most populations, as it is not widely available and costly. Furthermore, only {{in the case of a}} fracture are the costs for examination refundable. So far the role of neuromuscular function tests has remained unconsidered, although bones and muscles are in close interrelation. Therefore, it is important not only to focus on the bones but likewise on the collection of the individual neuromuscular efficiency. We examined 1197 postmenopausal healthy women aged 60 years and older. Special focus was devoted to the potential of neuromuscular test battery with up and go-, chair rising- and Romberg test as well as semitandem- and tandemstand in order to detect gait- and balance disturbances. For the statistical analyses we conducted frequencies, drew up contingency tables, calculated the relative risk and 95 % confidence interval. The Up and Go test in the standard version showed that, the more time the women needed to perform the test the higher the risk of falls (CI 1, 16 - 1, 52). The risk of falling in this group was increased by one third in comparison to the faster group. Semitandem- and <b>tandem</b> <b>tests</b> showed a significant correlation with regard to a non successful test and an increased risk of falls (CI 1, 06 - 1, 34 and 1, 03 - 1, 26). We couldnt prove a statistical significance for the chair rising and Romberg tests. Fractures due to falls occur frequently in women over 60 years. 55 % of our participants suffered a fracture after a fall. This risk is in comparison to non fallers almost double. The portion of fractures with additional proof of osteoporosis increased to 65 %. Postmenopausal fractures manifested themselves four times more frequently than premenopausal fractures and they rose fivefold in women with osteoporosis. Identifying women at risk of increasing falls is possible with specific neuromuscular tests. Some tests are not sufficiently accurate for evaluation of individual prediction for risk of falling, but trends point to a certain amount of risk in this direction...|$|E

40|$|Background Fall-related  {{injuries}} {{may have}} huge and enduring impact on older people, resulting in chronic pain, disabled mobility {{and reducing the}} quality of life. Fall injuries is becoming a worldwide problem among older people and as a result, the measurement of balance ability for older people is of great importance. In this master thesis, a system used to measure balance ability will be introduced. The system allows participants to perform a series of balance tasks {{with the help of}} Wii balance board (WBB) which is a low-cost, commercial gamming instrument. Previous work has showed the possibility and reliability of using WBB to measure the balance ability for older people. Methods Mean sway velocity (MSV) is used to measure the <b>tandem</b> stance <b>test.</b>   Five-Repetition Sit-to-Stand (STS) test is measured by STS time. Since the system has high requirements on the input validity, input validation is also a main part of this thesis. Matlab is used to check the output validity of the program. Results For the <b>tandem</b> stance <b>test,</b> our results (mean = 7. 87) are much larger than the results from previous work (mean = 4. 27). The results indicate that experimental factors such as standing posture and testing time have great impact on the average MSV results for <b>tandem</b> stance <b>test.</b> For the five-repetition Sit-to-Stand test, our young participant did 9. 97 seconds on average which is close to previous work (8. 2 for average young people without balance disorders) The results from output validation <b>test</b> for <b>tandem</b> stance show that the correctness of the program is highly reliable. Conclusions We found standing postures and testing time is very sensitive to MSV. To conduct a <b>tandem</b> stance <b>test,</b> the hardware should also be considered {{to be one of the}} main factors that affects MSV. Testing results again indicate STS time is a good measurement for STS test. In our input validation <b>test</b> for <b>tandem</b> stance, we also found an effective and sensitive interval for the arguments which can be considered to be a good discriminator to distinguish between valid and invalid inputs...|$|R

In this study, we sought to find associations between ET and cerebellar dysfunction. Methods: We performed <b>tandem</b> gait <b>test</b> in 41 ET patients and 44 age-matched controls. Investigators assessed tandem gait by counting the number of missteps during ten-step tandem walk and each subject repeated the trial three times. Results: ET patients had a higher average and total numbers of missteps during <b>tandem</b> gait <b>tests</b> than control subjects (p< 0. 05). Sex-adjusted odds ratio of the association between tandem gait abnormality and ET was 3. 40 (95 % confidence intervals 1. 06 - 10. 85). According to age stratification, aged ET patients (age ≥ 70 years) showed significantly higher prevalence of tandem gait abnormality than young ones. Interaction terms determined by a likelihood ratio test was also statistically significant (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: Dysfunction of cerebellar neural circuitry may be associated with the pathophysiological mechanism of ET. In addition, aging may be an important factor modifying the association...|$|R
40|$|Astronauts {{experience}} a microgravity environment during spaceflight, {{which results in}} a central reinterpretation of both vestibular and body axial-loading information by the sensorimotor system. Subjects in bed rest studies lie at 6 deg head-down in strict bed rest to simulate the fluid shift and gravity-unloading of the microgravity environment. However, bed rest subjects still sense gravity in the vestibular organs. Therefore, bed rest isolates the axial-unloading component, thus allowing for the direct study of its effects. The Tandem Walk is a standard sensorimotor test of dynamic postural stability. In a previous abstract, we compared performance on a <b>Tandem</b> Walk <b>test</b> between bed rest control subjects, and short- and long-duration astronauts {{both before and after}} flight/bed rest using a composite index of performance, called the Tandem Walk Parameter (TWP), that takes into account speed, accuracy, and balance control.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{which measures}} of trunk sway taken during stance and gait tasks are best correlated with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. METHODS: We studied 37 MS patients (mean age 43 +/- 10 years; 76 % female; 81 % relapsing-remitting MS; mean EDSS score 2. 8 +/- 1. 1). The study protocol comprised the subjective Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and recorded peak-to-peak trunk sway angles and velocities during 14 stance and gait balance tasks. 76 {{age- and gender-matched}} healthy subjects served as controls (HCs). RESULTS: Patients had significant more trunk sway than HCs (p 0. 4; p> 0. 001). Patients with normal clinical Romberg and <b>tandem</b> gait <b>tests</b> showed significantly more trunk sway than HCs when standing on one leg eyes open on foam support (p> 0. 001). Patients with spinal cord manifestation of MS (n= 27) had higher trunk sway compared to patients without. Mean DHI score of the patients was 30 +/- 23. 5 %. DHI was highly correlated with trunk sway for all two-legged stance tasks in MS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Balance deficits in trunk sway observed in MS patients during stance and gait tasks are highly correlated with their EDSS and DHI scores, with stance and tandem gait tasks providing the highest correlations.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: There {{is a lack}} of {{data and}} {{consensus}} concerning the most appropriate functional evaluation in clinical practice at the definitive prosthetic phase after lower limb amputation. OBJECTIVES: To determine among several selected functional tests the most pertinent to evaluate balance and prosthetic walking. STUDY DESIGN: Validation of a diagnostic procedure. METHODS: Sixty-four patients were included. Outcome measures: Timed Up and Go test, Functional Reach test (FRT), one-leg balance, <b>tandem</b> <b>test,</b> Modified Houghton Scale, Berg Balance Scale, two-minute walk test (2 MW test). Correlations were assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Principal Component Analysis. Score distribution was analyzed with the Shapiro-Wilk W normality test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were drawn to identify the best predictor for the function. RESULTS: The clinical tests correlated highly with each other. Only 2 MW test and FRT did not have either a floor/ceiling effect, or a bi-modal distribution. The 2 MW test was the best predictor of prosthetic walking limitations (area under the curve 0. 93 (0. 83 - 0. 97), the best threshold was between 130 and 150 meters), and FRT was best for balance. CONCLUSIONS: 2 MW test can be proposed as the first-line clinical test. The FRT can be indicated for the specific assessment of balance disorders.

40|$|A {{system for}} testing {{the effects of}} {{specific}} codons on gene expression is described. <b>Tandem</b> <b>test</b> and control genes are contained in a transcription unit for bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase in a multicopy plasmid, and nearly identical test and control mRNAs are generated from the primary transcript by RNase III cleavages. Their coding sequences, derived from T 7 gene 9, are translated efficiently and have few low-usage codons of Escherichia coli. The upstream test gene contains a site for insertion of test codons, and the downstream control gene has a 45 -codon deletion that allows test and control mRNAs and proteins to be separated by gel electrophoresis. Codons can be inserted among identical flanking codons after codon 13, 223, or 307 in codon test vectors pCT 1, pCT 2, and pCT 3, respectively, the third site being six codons from the termination codon. The insertion of two to five consecutive AGG (low-usage) arginine codons selectively reduced the production of full-length test protein to extents that depended {{on the number of}} AGG codons, the site of insertion, and the amount of test mRNA. Production of aberrant proteins was also stimulated at high levels of mRNA. The effects occurred primarily at the translational level and were not produced by CGU (high-usage) arginine codons. Our results are consistent with the idea that sufficiently high levels of the AGG mRNA can cause essentially all of the tRNA(AGG) in the cell to become sequestered in translating peptidyl-tRNA(AGG) -mRNA-ribosome complexes stalled at the first of two consecutive AGG codons and that the approach of an upstream translating ribosome stimulates a stalled ribosome of frameshift, hop, or terminate translation...|$|R

Sixty patients with vestibular disorders were compared with 60 asymptomatic controls. Setting. Vestibular diagnostic laboratory, tertiary care center. Subjects and Methods. Subjects were screened with head impulse tests, Fukuda stepping tests while walking and marching in place, and <b>tandem</b> walking <b>tests</b> with eyes open and closed. All subjects underwent bithermal caloric tests and Dix-Hallpike maneuvers; patients underwent low-frequency sinusoidal tests of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in darkness and cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. Results. On <b>tandem</b> walking <b>tests,</b> patients differed significantly from controls, but receiver operating characteristic scores were = 20 % and = 60 %) differed significantly from controls. Receiver operating characteristic values were > 0. 80 only for subjects with severe bithermal caloric weakness and were highest, at 0. 88, for subjects with severe weakness and age >= 60 years. Conclusions. the Fukuda test is a poor screening test {{because it does not}} correlate well with objective <b>test</b> findings. <b>Tandem</b> walking is best used for screening older patients for vestibular disorders. Positive findings on a head impulse test are probably consistent with severe peripheral vestibular impairment and may be most useful in older patients. in younger patients with vertigo, negative results on head impulse tests may not be informative.

40|$|Objective: Observational {{studies have}} {{suggested}} positive associations between serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) levels and muscular strength, balance and quality of life. Our aim was to examine whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation would improve these measures as compared to standard-dose vitamin D, {{as well as the}} possible muscular effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding vitamin D-related enzymes. Design: A 12 -month randomized, double-blind, controlled trial where the participants received daily elemental calcium (1000 mg) plus vitamin D 3 (800 IU). In addition, the participants were randomized to receive either capsules with vitamin D 3 (20 000 IU) or matching placebos to be taken twice a week. Patients: A total of 297 postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis. Measurements: Muscle strength (handgrip and knee extensor strength), balance (<b>tandem</b> <b>test)</b> and quality of life (EQ- 5 D) were measured at baseline and after 12 months. The subjects were genotyped for SNPs related to vitamin D metabolism. Results: Of the 297 included women, 275 completed the study. Mean serum 25 (OH) D levels dramatically increased in the high-dose group (from 64. 7 to 164. 1 nmol/L; P<. 01), while a more moderate increased was observed in the standard-dose group (from 64. 1 to 81. 8 nmol/L; P<. 01). There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups in change in muscular strength, balance or quality of life over the intervention period. Polymorphisms in rs 3829251 (located in the 7 -dehydrocholesterol reductase gene) were associated with muscle strength and treatment effects. Conclusion: One-year treatment with high-dose vitamin D had no effect on muscular strength, balance or quality of life in postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis as compared to standard dose. The association between rs 3829251 and muscle strength needs confirmation in other populations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} natural history of physical function in older men limited by intermittent claudication. MethodsForty-three men limited by intermittent claudication (mean age, 69 ± 7 years) were recruited and followed up for 18 months. At baseline the patients reported a history of intermittent claudication for 6. 1 ± 6. 1 years, and were able to walk for 1. 9 ± 1. 6 blocks before experiencing claudication pain. Measurements during the 18 -month study included ankle-brachial index (ABI), calf blood flow, 6 -minute walk performance, monitored and self-reported physical activity, self-reported stability while walking, and summary performance score of physical function determined from a 4 -m walk test, a chair stand <b>test,</b> and a <b>tandem</b> stand <b>test.</b> ResultsPain-free walking distance during the 6 -minute walk test decreased by 22 % (P. 05).

40|$|Alcohol-based {{disinfectants}} and detergents {{are common}} workplace factors for irritant contact dermatitis (ICD). Though occlusion and water are relevant co-exposures, the tandem effects of occlusion and sequential exposure to alcohols and detergents {{have not been}} studied. We therefore investigated the combined effects of occlusion with water and repeated exposure to n-propanol and/or sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) in an occlusion-modified <b>tandem</b> irritation <b>test.</b> The outcomes included visual scoring, measurement of erythema, transepidermal water loss, capacitance and natural moisturizing factor (NMF) levels. Occlusion abrogated the skin barrier function and significantly enhanced the irritant-induced barrier damaging effects. The NMF levels of all irritant-exposed fields decreased significantly compared with the non-exposed fields; occlusion enhanced the decrease in NMF. Although SLS exerted more pronounced effects on the measured parameters, the barrier function impairment and NMF decrease after exposure to n-propanol in workplace-relevant concentrations, found in the study, confirm the significance of short-chain aliphatic alcohols for occupational IC...|$|R
40|$|The fluorescent-protein based {{fluorescence}} {{resonance energy}} transfer (FRET) {{approach is a}} powerful method for quantifying protein-protein interactions in living cells, especially when combined with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). To compare the performance of different FRET couples for FRET-FLIM experiments, we first tested enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) linked to different red acceptors (mRFP 1 -EGFP, mStrawberry-EGFP, HaloTag (TMR) -EGFP, and mCherry-EGFP). We obtained a fraction of donor engaged in FRET (f(D)) that {{was far from the}} ideal case of one, using different mathematical models assuming a double species model (i. e., discrete double exponential fixing the donor lifetime and double exponential stretched for the FRET lifetime). We show that the relatively low f(D) percentages obtained with these models may be due to spectroscopic heterogeneity of the acceptor population, which is partially caused by different maturation rates for the donor and the acceptor. In an attempt to improve the amount of donor protein engaged in FRET, we tested mTFP 1 as a donor coupled to mOrange and EYFP, respectively. mTFP 1 turned out to be at least as good as EGFP for donor FRET-FLIM experiments because 1), its lifetime remained constant during light-induced fluorescent changes; 2), its fluorescence decay profile was best fitted with a single exponential model; and 3), no photoconversion was detected. The f(D) value when combined with EYFP as an acceptor was the highest of all <b>tandems</b> <b>tested</b> (0. 7). Moreover, in the context of fast acquisitions, we obtained a minimal f(D) (mf(D)) for mTFP 1 -EYFP that was almost two times greater than that for mCherry-EGFP (0. 65 vs. 0. 35). Finally, we compared EGFP and mTFP 1 in a biological situation in which the fusion proteins were highly immobile, and EGFP and mTFP 1 were linked to the histone H 4 (EGFP-H 4 and mTFP 1 -H 4) in fast FLIM acquisitions. In this particular case, the fluorescence intensity was more stable for EGFP-H 4 than for mTFP 1 -H 4. Nevertheless, we show that mTFP 1 /EYFP stands alone as the best FRET-FLIM couple in terms of f(D) analysis...|$|R

This study explored the role of sensation in PC after the "transition" period. Method: PC in typical children aged 6, 7 and 8 years (N 35, 42, 36 respectively) was {{compared with that of}} children with Developmental Co-ordination Dysfunction (DCD) (N 19, 21, 10 respectively). Children stood on dual force plates in a standardised position for 30 s on floor or foam (tested with eyes open, closed or wearing a conflict dome) and in <b>tandem</b> stance (<b>tested</b> on the floor, same conditions). Reliable measures used included mean anteroposterior displacement of the centre of pressure (mAPCoP), percentage of foot length used, velocity and distance of sway.

40|$|Two {{inexpensive}} {{screening tests}} were evaluated singly and in tandem for distinguishing Neisseria gonorrhoeae from other oxidase-positive microorganisms growing on selective gonococcal media. In tests of 728 cultures, including 460 N. gonorrhoeae, 4 Neisseria lactamica, 257 Neisseria meningitidis, and 7 Branhamella catarrhalis, both Superoxol (30 % H 2 O 2; J. T. Baker Chemical Co., Phillipsburg, N. J.) and amylase inhibition tests were 100 % sensitive (positive) for 20 -h cultures of N. gonorrhoeae.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} vector {{quantization}} of speech in a noisy environment. We show that the performance of a vector quantization system can be improved by adapting the distortion measure to the changing environmental conditions. The proposed method emphasizes the distortion in spectral regions where the speech signal dominates. The method functions well even when conventional pre-processor methods fail because the noise statistics cannot be estimated reliably from speech pauses (as, e. g., in <b>tandeming</b> operations). Objective <b>tests</b> confirm that the use of environmentally adaptive measures significantly improves estimation accuracy in noisy speech, while preserving the quality in the case of clean input. 1...|$|R
