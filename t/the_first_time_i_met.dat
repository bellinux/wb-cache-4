2500|$|I was on {{the verge}} of {{painting}} the Portrait of Jacques Nayral. He was to become my brother-in-law, and was one of the most sympathetic men I have ever met. A strange lad, a little surprising on first encounter - both disturbing because of his sharp use of irony and also attractive because of a generosity that left him as vulnerable as a child. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him was at President Bonjean's house at Villepreux-les-Clayes, near Versailles, during a dinner which brought together the committee of that 'Villa Medicis Libre' which, as I said before, had been founded by Alexandre Mercereau. From that time onwards, we saw each other often and became friends.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stories of}} their {{encounters}} with other celebrities also became fodder for the press; for example, in May 1997, at The Prince's Trust 21st anniversary concert, Mel B and Geri Halliwell breached royal protocol when they planted kisses on Prince Charles's cheeks, leaving it covered with lipstick, and later, Halliwell told him [...] "you're very sexy" [...] and also pinched his bottom. In November, the British Royal Family were considered {{fans of the}} Spice Girls, including The Prince of Wales and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry. That month, South African President Nelson Mandela said: [...] "These are my heroes. This {{is one of the}} greatest moments in my life" [...] in an encounter organised by Prince Charles, who said, [...] "It is the second greatest moment in my life, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> them was the greatest". Prince Charles would later send Halliwell a personal letter [...] "with lots of love" [...] when he heard that she had quit the Spice Girls. In 1998 the video game magazine Nintendo Power created The More Annoying Than the Spice Girls Award, adding: [...] "What could possibly have been more annoying in 1997 than the Spice Girls, you ask?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Ralph Parcaut {{was born}} in Iowa on December 3, 1896. His parents, Edward and Eva Parcaut, were farmers who, in 1894, had settled {{on a farm in}} Grant Township an area near Sutherland a small town in O'Brien County, Iowa. [...] They had a family of seven children. From an early age, Parcaut took a keen {{interest}} in wrestling with other boys and began to demonstrate considerable aptitude for the sport. In 1906, at the age of 15, a local wrestling fan, impressed with Parcaut's talent and potential, gave him $100.00, a considerable sum of money at the time, to seek training from famed wrestler and instructor Martin [...] "Farmer" [...] Burns. [...] At the time, Burns operated a school for wrestlers in Omaha, Nebraska where he taught [...] "catch as catch can" [...] or modern day freestyle wrestling and physical training. [...] Parcaut traveled to Omaha, his $100.00 buying him 10 lessons, as Farmer Burns charged $10.00 an hour for one-on-one wrestling instruction with students. [...] Burns instilled in young Parcaut what would become a lifelong regimen of training and most importantly, [...] "clean living." [...] As Parcaut recalled years later, [...] "I'll never forget <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him in Omaha ... All {{the way back to the}} gymnasium he talked to me about the evils of drink and of smoking and even urged me not to partake of tea or coffee." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, here's {{something}} else I remember. It's about <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever stole a watermelon. [...] "Stole" [...] {{is a strong}} word. Stole? Stole? No, I don't mean that. It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever withdrew a watermelon. It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever extracted a watermelon. That is exactly the word I want--"extracted." [...] It is definite. It is precise. It perfectly conveys my idea. Its use in dentistry connotes the delicate shade of meaning I am looking for. You know we never extract our own teeth.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, of course, that's how {{he strikes}} people at first. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him, I {{thought he was}} an awful stiff. But you should see him in his moments of relaxation. He's one of those fellows {{you have to get}} to know. He grows on you." ...|$|E

[...] The son of the money-lender was in a perspiration now and mopped {{his face with his}} handkerchief.|$|E

He had just trimmed the life out of a bully half a head taller than himself for stealing the papers of a little Jew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mr. Rover, I {{think they}} will get along finely," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Stanhope. [...] "I liked Dick from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him-- and Dora-- well, there was nobody else after he came into view," [...] and she smiled faintly. Then her eyes traveled over to where Tom and Nellie were talking earnestly, and his followed. [...] "I think that is another pair," [...] she whispered.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} {{compensation}} for it all. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> the English lower classes face to face, and knew {{them for what}} they were.

Do you remember, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you, I told you I could not think of you as a clergyman. I cannot now--less than ever." ...|$|E

60|$|There is a {{movement}} in favour of co-education, especially in elementary education, because, owing to the inadequate supply of schools, the girls tend {{to be left out}} altogether unless they can go to the same school as the boys. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Professor and Mrs. Dewey was at a banquet in Chang-sha, given by the Tuchun. When the time came for after-dinner speeches, Mrs. Dewey told the Tuchun that his province must adopt co-education. He made a statesmanlike reply, saying that the matter should receive his best consideration, but he feared the time was not ripe in Hunan. However, {{it was clear that the}} matter was within the sphere of practical politics. At the time, being new to China and having imagined China a somewhat backward country, I was surprised. Later on I realized that reforms which we only talk about can be actually carried out in China.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} she would be--I knew she would be, in fact; and {{for that very reason}} I hesitated to do it, as I hesitated to dance with you <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you, as soon as I knew who you really were. But I felt I ought to face it out. You know by this time, no doubt, Miss Hazleden, that my mother was once a slave on your grandfather's estate. Now, it is a theory of mine--a little Quixotic, perhaps, but still a theory of mine--that the guilt and the shame of slavery lay with the slave-owners (forgive me if I must needs speak against your own class), and not with the slaves or their descendants. We have nothing on earth to be ashamed of. Thinking thus, I felt it {{incumbent}} upon me to call at Palmettos, partly in defence of my general principles, and partly also because I wished to see whether you shared your mother's ideas on that subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mayble's {{a hearty}} feller enough," [...] the tranter replied, [...] "and will spak to you be you dirty or be you clane. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> en {{was in a}} drong, and though 'a didn't know me {{no more than the}} dead, 'a passed the time of day. 'D'ye do?' he said, says he, nodding his head. 'A fine day.' Then the second time I met en was full-buff in town street, when my {{breeches}} were tore into a long strent by getting through a copse of thorns and brimbles for a short cut home-along; and not wanting to disgrace the man by spaking in that state, I fixed my eye on the weathercock to let en pass me as a stranger. But no: 'How d'ye do, Reuben?' says he, right hearty, and shook my hand. If I'd been dressed in silver spangles from top to toe, the man couldn't have been civiller." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{resolved}} {{to get at}} their hearts--their inner thoughts--and my commanders put me forward {{from time to time}} as interpreter, where I could serve both the army and the redman. In some strange way all the Northwest tribes came to know of me, and I could go where few men could follow me. It is curious, but they never did seem strange to me. From <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> an Indian I felt that he was a man like other men--a father, a son, a brother, like anybody else. Naturally, when the plan for enlisting redmen into the cavalry came to be worked out, I was chosen to command a troop of Shi-an-nay. I received my promotion at that time. My detail as Indian agent came from the same cause, I suppose. I was known to be a friend of the redman, and the department is now experimenting with 'Curtis of the Gray-Horse Troop,'" [...] he added, with a smile. [...] "Such is the story of my life." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him, to my knowledge, {{was on an}} evil-smelling, one-funnelled steam {{boat that}} in those days plied between London Bridge and Antwerp. He was walking the deck arm-in-arm with a showily dressed but decidedly {{attractive}} young woman; both of them talking and laughing loudly. It struck me as odd, finding him a fellow-traveller by such a route. The passage occupied eighteen hours, and the first-class return fare was one pound twelve and six, including three meals each way; drinks, as the contract was careful to explain, being extra. I was earning thirty shillings {{a week at the}} time as clerk with a firm of agents in Fenchurch Street. Our business was the purchasing of articles on commission for customers in India, and I had learned to be a judge of values. The beaver lined coat he was wearing--for the evening, although it was late summer, was chilly--must have cost him a couple of hundred pounds, while his carelessly displayed jewellery he could easily have pawned for a thousand or more.|$|E
