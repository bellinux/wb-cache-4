5|$|In {{addition}} to these player versus environment (PvE) challenges, two forms of player versus player (PvP) combat exist in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. The first type, the Wolves' Den, is an arena featuring structured four-versus-four battles; players may queue into a battle with up to three teammates to challenge another four-person team. The second type, Frontlines, is a large battleground instance in which players form teams of up to 24 characters. Teams are delineated by players' allegiance {{to one of three}} Grand Companies and the team which reaches the <b>target</b> <b>number</b> of points first wins the match. Four modes are available with differing locations and rulesets, such as King of the Hill, capture the flag, and team deathmatch. Within the fiction, Frontlines is presented as an organized set of military exercises between the three nations with the ulterior goal of jockeying for dominance of regions rich in magical artifacts.|$|E

40|$|In this report, {{road safety}} {{developments}} in the Netherlands during 1948 - 1998 were analysed at the macroscopic level. The purpose of these analyses was to find models that, so accurately and simply possible, describe developments of mobility (exposure) and casualty risk. Based on this, prognoses were made for future developments in mobility, casualty risk, numbers of road deaths and in-patients up to 2010. These were then compared with the <b>target</b> <b>numbers</b> for road deaths and in-patients for 2010. The following annual numbers for the Netherlands were used in this analysis: {{the total number of}} road deaths, the total number of registered in-patients, and the total number of motor vehicle kilometres driven. These last have been used as an indication of Dutch mobility. Apart from these, two derived variables (from these annual totals) {{play a central role in}} the analyses: (1) fatal or death risk; and (2) non-fatal risk. When compared with the <b>target</b> <b>numbers</b> of road deaths for 2010, the prognoses show that these <b>target</b> <b>numbers</b> appear achievable. This is on condition that the effectiveness of the road safety policy does, during the coming years, result in a greater annual decrease in fatal risk than was achieved during 1991 - 1998. When compared with the <b>target</b> <b>numbers</b> of in-patients for 2010, the prognoses indicated that these <b>target</b> <b>numbers</b> will probably not be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Method for face {{identification}} {{based on}} eigen value decomposition together with tracing trajectories in the eigen space after the eigen value decomposition is proposed. The proposed method allows {{person to person}} differences due to faces in the different emotions. By using the well known action unit approach, the proposed method admits the faces in the different emotions. Experimental results show that recognition performance depends on the <b>number</b> of <b>targeted</b> peoples. The face identification rate is 80 % for four peoples of <b>targeted</b> <b>number</b> while 100 % is achieved for the <b>number</b> of <b>targeted</b> <b>number</b> of peoples is two.

25|$|Before {{the fourth}} edition, skill and ability checks worked as follows: all {{actions in the}} game, {{from the use of}} skills to making attacks in combat, are first given a <b>target</b> <b>number</b> that {{reflects}} the difficulty of the action which is then raised or lowered by various modifying factors, such as environmental conditions, the condition of the character, the use of mechanical aids, and so forth. The player then rolls a number of dice equal to their level in the relevant skill, and the number of dice rolled that meet or exceed the <b>target</b> <b>number</b> determines if the character is successful performing the action and the degree of success the character has. As an example, a character with a high firearms skill not only has a better chance at hitting a target than someone with a lower ranked skill, but also is more likely to cause more damage to the target. Target numbers may exceed 6, in which case any dice that show a 6 have to be re-rolled (a <b>target</b> <b>number</b> of, e.g., 9 is reached by rolling a 6 followed by at least a 3; thus, a <b>target</b> <b>number</b> of 6 and one of 7 are identical, except extra dice rolls are not allowed for <b>target</b> <b>number</b> 7 or greater). For even higher target numbers, this procedure has to be repeated; thus, an action with a <b>target</b> <b>number</b> of 20 (like attempting to procure military-grade weaponry) will only succeed if three successive dice rolls result in sixes, and the fourth gives at least a 2. For any dice-roll a roll of 1 always counts as a failure. This system allows great flexibility in setting the difficulty of an action.|$|E

25|$|Only the {{contestant}} whose {{result is}} closer to the <b>target</b> <b>number</b> scores points: 10 for reaching it exactly, 7 for being 1-5 away, 5 for being 6-10 away. Contestants score no points for being more than 10 away, or if their calculations are flawed. Both score if they reach the same result, or if their results are the same distance away.|$|E
25|$|Basic {{gameplay}} in arcade mode {{remains the}} same as in the campaign, although certain new rules take effect. There are a total of sixteen stages in arcade mode, although only seven can be played in one playthrough due to branching mission paths. The player begins each stage with a set amount of time and a <b>target</b> <b>number</b> of enemy units that must be destroyed. The player must destroy the specified number of enemies before time expires in order to advance to the next stage. Although the player begins with a limited amount of time, each target the player destroys adds time to the clock and also awards the player a set number of points. The player's weaponry is more restricted in arcade mode than during the campaign; although destroying certain marked targets replenishes the player's stock of weaponry, the player can still end up without any if they waste too much ordnance.|$|E
5000|$|Go Slow: The player must walk {{a balance}} beam {{from one end}} to the other while staying within a zone of green lights that slowly {{advances}} across the floor.

500|$|Microsoft's {{target was}} to sell 1.5 {{million copies of}} the game. Marketing {{research}} suggested that the [...] "Halo faithful" [...] could only {{be counted on to}} buy 75% of that amount, meaning that 375,000 copies would have to be sold to non-fans. Thus marketing goals were to attract an audience beyond the Halo nation, and to break sales records; in short, to [...] "make Halo 3 a true cultural phenomenon". The team upped their goals to not only selling the <b>target</b> <b>number</b> of copies, but making Halo 3 the biggest entertainment launch ever.|$|E
500|$|The trend {{reversed}} itself {{following the}} election of the last king of Poland, Stanisław II Augustus, in 1765 and the introduction of the new governing body, Permanent Council, in 1775. Its Military Department attempted to modernize the army, and increase its size (although even the <b>target</b> <b>number</b> of 30,000 was never achieved). A major military reform came with the passing of the Constitution of May 3, 1791, which stated that the Army was to be built up to 100,000 men. (The exact number would be settled on only on 22 May 1792, at 25,654 cavalry and 72,910 infantry). A new conscription law was introduced, affecting all lands (royal, noble and Church-owned). With the days of the Commonwealth numbered, the Constitution was never fully implemented in practice, although the new Military Commission saw the Army expanded to 65,000 before the Polish defeat in the War in Defense of the Constitution. After the [...] Commonwealth defeat in that war and the rescinding of the Constitution, the Army was reduced to about 36,000. In 1794 Russians demanded a further downsizing of the army to 15,000. This plan was one of the sparks that led to the Army's (and Commonwealth's) final conflict, the Kościuszko Uprising.|$|E
500|$|There {{are five}} {{multiplayer}} modes: Team Favor of the Gods, Match of Champions, Trial of the Gods, Capture the Flag, and Bout of Honor. Team matches randomly assign players {{to compete on}} either the Spartan or Trojan team. The [...] "signature" [...] multiplayer mode is Team Favor of the Gods, in which two teams of two-to-four players try to win by accumulating a target quantity of points. Points, known as Favor, are earned by killing and other methods. When players {{are not on the}} offensive, they may help their team earn points by capturing altars, collecting red orbs from chests, and setting traps for opposing players. The non-team version, Match of Champions, is a four-to-eight-player deathmatch with a similar goal to Team Favor of the Gods. Trial of the Gods is a two-player, cooperative (co-op), time-trial mode in which the duo faces five waves of mythological monsters concluding with a boss fight. A single-player version is also available. In Capture the Flag, two teams of four players battle to capture the opposing team's flag and return it to their base until a <b>target</b> <b>number</b> of flags have been obtained. In Bout of Honor, added in the July 11, 2013 update, players test their skills in a best-of-seven-rounds one-on-one fight.|$|E
50|$|Swing Low: The player must jump up {{from the}} floor and {{completely}} clear the horizontal bar of a giant trapeze as it swings down toward him/her. Higher <b>target</b> <b>numbers</b> increase the required jump height. The bar is padded and designed to break away from its supports without injuring the player if the jump is unsuccessful.|$|R
50|$|As {{continuing}} part of non-league restructuring, the Division One South temporarily has 20 teams, {{while the}} Division One North contains 21, with a <b>targeted</b> <b>number</b> {{for both of}} 22 teams.

Each player has a swivel-mounted ramp to use in rolling balls onto the table, attempting to get them into the hole. Higher <b>target</b> <b>numbers</b> reduce the size of the hole. To win, the team must get 10 balls in. (90 seconds) ...|$|R
2500|$|The game uses ten-sided dice and a {{variation}} of the Storyteller System to arbitrate the action, and, as with many other RPGs, requires little beyond the rulebooks themselves, dice, pencil, and paper. [...] The Exalted version of the rules were derived from the trilogy of White Wolf Publishing games Aeon (Trinity), Aberrant, and Adventure where the idea of a fixed <b>target</b> <b>number</b> of 7 or higher was first introduced.|$|E
2500|$|Each rule {{system has}} its own task {{mechanic}} for resolving character actions. [...] Some systems use two or three six-sided dice, while others use multiple six-sided dice or a twenty-sided die.

Situation and equipment used can provide a bonus or penalty to a roll. [...] Depending on the task, a success may require rolling above or below the <b>target</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{contestant}} {{in control}} chooses six of 24 shuffled face-down number tiles, arranged into two groups: 20 [...] "small numbers" [...] (two each of 1 through 10), and four [...] "large numbers" [...] of 25, 50, 75 and 100. Some special episodes replace {{the large numbers}} with 12, 37, 62 and 87. The contestant decides how many large numbers are to be used, from none to all four, after which the six tiles are randomly drawn and placed on the board. A random three-digit <b>target</b> <b>number</b> is then generated by an electronic machine, affectionately known as [...] "CECIL" [...] (which stands for Countdown's Electronic Calculator In Leeds). The contestants have 30 seconds {{to work out a}} sequence of calculations with the numbers whose final result is as close to the <b>target</b> <b>number</b> as possible. They may use only the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and do not have to use all six numbers. A number may not be used more times than it appears on the board. Fractions are not allowed, and only positive integers may be obtained as a result at any stage of the calculation. Likewise with letters rounds, if both contestants obtained the target using the same method, they must show their calculations to their opponent.|$|E
5000|$|Mind Map: The {{players are}} shown a path {{in which every}} segment is a {{different}} colour and length. They are given a short time to memorize the path, then must build it on the stage floor by connecting a set of pre-arranged posts with coloured bars.

2500|$|According to John Aubrey, cribbage {{was created}} by the English poet Sir John Suckling in the early 17th century, as a {{derivation}} of the game [...] "noddy." [...] While noddy has disappeared, crib has survived, virtually unchanged, {{as one of the most}} popular games in the English-speaking world. The objective of the game is to be the first player to score a <b>target</b> <b>number</b> of points, typically 61 or 121. Points are scored for card combinations that add up to fifteen, and for pairs, triples, quadruples, runs and flushes.|$|E
2500|$|In some games, {{there are}} many ways to reach the target exactly—the example target above could also be reached by 7 × (75 + 50 + 2 – 8 – 3) = 812. Not all games are solvable, and for a few {{selections}} it is impossible even to get within 10, most commonly when a contestant picks six small numbers and the <b>target</b> <b>number</b> is quite large[...] There is a tactical element in selecting how many large numbers to include. One large and five small numbers is the most popular selection, despite two large numbers giving the best chance of the game being solvable exactly. Selections with zero or four large numbers are generally considered the hardest.|$|E
