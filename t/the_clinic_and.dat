5|$|During Sanger's 1916 {{speaking}} tour, she promoted {{birth control}} clinics {{based on the}} Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe. Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established. Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control clinic in New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women. New York state law prohibited the distribution of contraceptives or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit {{a provision in the}} law which permitted doctors to prescribe contraceptives for the prevention of disease. On October 16, 1916, she opened the Brownsville clinic in Brooklyn; it was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.Engelman, p. 79–80. A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a cervical cap at <b>the</b> <b>clinic,</b> <b>and</b> Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out of the clinic by police officers.Engelman, p. 83. The clinic was shut down, and it was not until 1923 that another birth control clinic was opened in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Himmler met {{his future}} wife, Margarete Boden, in 1927. Seven years his senior, {{she was a}} nurse who shared his {{interest}} in herbal medicine and homoeopathy, and was part owner of a small private clinic. They were married in July 1928, and their only child, Gudrun, was born on 8 August 1929. The couple were also foster parents to a boy named Gerhard von Ahe, son of an SS officer who had died before the war. Margarete sold her share of <b>the</b> <b>clinic</b> <b>and</b> used the proceeds to buy a plot of land in Waldtrudering, near Munich, where they erected a prefabricated house. Himmler was constantly away on party business, so his wife took charge of their efforts—mostly unsuccessful—to raise livestock for sale. They had a dog, Töhle.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} at <b>the</b> <b>clinic</b> <b>and</b> pays {{for it by}} pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver electric shocks to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore the {{experiences}} of primary health care nurses working in <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> <b>and</b> health centres involved in the provision of free health care services. The research design followed was exploratory, descriptive and qualitative. The population of the study included all primary health care nurses working at <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> <b>and</b> health centres in the Vhembe (northern) region of the Limpopo Province. The sampling method used was purposive for the samples of both <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nurses. The inclusion criteria for the nurses included experience of two or more years in providing primary health care. The inclusion criteria for <b>the</b> selection of <b>clinics</b> included being a busy clinic (a minimum of 2000 patients per month) with a staff establishment of four or more primary health care nurses. In conducting this research, ethical principles were taken into account. Data was collected from 23 participants in the Northern Region. The research question read as follows: What are your experiences regarding the provision of free health care services? An open coding method consisting of eight steps provided by Tesch's (1990 : 140 - 145) eight-step method of analysing data was used. The research findings revealed that the primary health care nurses working in <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> experience feelings of failure to provide adequate primary health care services due to the increased workload, misuse of the service, and fear associated with lack of security in <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> <b>and</b> health centres. <b>The</b> conclusions drawn from this research are that on the one hand a poor mechanism exists for the monitoring of the implementation of free health services, and on another hand, there has been misuse of the facilities by the community. The concept “free health care service” has been misinterpreted...|$|R

25|$|On 6 January 1889, Burckhardt {{showed the}} letter he had {{received}} from Nietzsche to Overbeck. The following day, Overbeck received a similar letter and decided that Nietzsche's friends had {{to bring him back}} to Basel. Overbeck travelled to Turin and brought Nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in Basel. By that time Nietzsche appeared fully {{in the grip of a}} serious mental illness, and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in Jena under the direction of Otto Binswanger. In January 1889, they proceeded with the planned release of Twilight of the Idols, by that time already printed and bound. From November 1889 to February 1890, the art historian Julius Langbehn attempted to cure Nietzsche, claiming that the methods of the medical doctors were ineffective in treating Nietzsche's condition. Langbehn assumed progressively greater control of Nietzsche until his secretiveness discredited him. In March 1890, Franziska removed Nietzsche from <b>the</b> <b>clinic</b> <b>and,</b> in May 1890, brought him to her home in Naumburg. During this process Overbeck and Gast contemplated what to do with Nietzsche's unpublished works. In February, they ordered a fifty-copy private edition of Nietzsche contra Wagner, but the publisher C. G. Naumann secretly printed one hundred. Overbeck and Gast decided to withhold publishing The Antichrist and Ecce Homo because of their more radical content. Nietzsche's reception and recognition enjoyed their first surge.|$|E
25|$|In early 2006, Benefis {{sought to}} stop the Great Falls Clinic from {{purchasing}} 20-bed Central Montana Surgical Hospital. The clinic had partnered with Essentia Health, a non-profit healthcare system based in Minnesota and North Dakota, to purchase Harold Poulsen's outstanding stock in Central Montana Surgical Hospital and gain a controlling interest in the surgical hospital. Benefis sued to prevent the transaction, arguing that the new owners intended to run the facility as a specialty hospital in contravention of a 2005 state law banning further construction {{of these types of}} facilities and that <b>the</b> <b>Clinic</b> <b>and</b> Essentia did not apply for the required health care facility license. The health system won a temporary restraining order. Benefis also said it stood to lose $4 million a year in revenues if Central Montana Surgical Hospital was licensed as a general hospital. The company said it would likely close its renal dialysis unit, suspend Mercy Flights, shutter its nursing home, and end outpatient psychiatric and chemical dependency services. Benefis also said it would lose several million dollars a year in federal payments as well. On March 24, the injunction was lifted. Benefis filed an emergency motion with the Montana Supreme Court three days later, appealing the district court's ruling. The state of Montana then issued a six-month provisional license to Central Montana to operate as a general hospital. But on October 4, 2006, the Montana Supreme Court ruled 4-to-3 to uphold the district court's dismissal of the temporary injunction. However, the state supreme court declined to rule on other issues raised by Benefis' lawsuit, and left open the door for the company to continue litigation in the district courts. On November 6, 2006, Benefis declined to appeal the high court's ruling and said it would not bring the other issues back to the district court. In February 2007, the Clinic sued Benefis to recover its legal fees. A state judge ruled in September 2007 that Benefis must pay these fees.|$|E
