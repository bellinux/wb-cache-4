30|$|In this paper, we take {{a closer}} look at how the cost of debt is {{estimated}} for a defaultable firm. We consider a situation in which the decision maker—either internally for capital budgeting, etc. or externally for firm valuation—has already carried out a reasonable estimation for the cost of equity. He or she additionally needs an estimation for the cost of debt. We take the yield to maturity of corporate debt as given and show how the actual cost of debt can be calculated as a value between the risk-free interest rate and this yield to maturity. As an input, the approach requires a current value of the fair corporate interest rate, either from a publicly <b>traded</b> <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> or, for example, from recent conditions of a fair bank loan.|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the proposal to}} modify regulations that determine a <b>debt</b> <b>instrument’s</b> issue price whenever there is an exchange of an instrument involving publicly traded property. Under both proposed and current regulation section 1. 1273 - 2, the issue price of an instrument received in an exchange involving public property {{is equal to the}} fair market value of the publicly traded property. In contrast, an instrument’s issue price in an exchange involving non-publicly traded property is equal to the principal amount or stated principal amount of the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> received, amounts that are unlikely to equal or approximate fair market value. The proposed regulations continue this dichotomy. Existing regulations under 1001, not scheduled to be changed, provide that the amount realized on debt exchanges is determined by reference to the section 1273 issue price rules. By preventing the issue price of a <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> from being equal to fair market value of property in all cases, the plain language of section 1001 is violated, as is the fundamental principal of tax law that income be clearly reflected.

40|$|At {{the current}} time, when India is endeavoring to sustain its high growth rate, it is {{imperative}} that financing constraints in any form be removed and alternative financing channels be developed in a systematic manner for supplementing traditional bank credit. While the equity market in India has been quite active, the size of the corporate debt market is very small in comparison with not only developed markets, but also some of the emerging market economies in Asia such as Malaysia, Thailand and China. A liquid corporate bond market can play a critical role by supplementing the banking system to meet the requirements of the corporate sector for long-term capital investment and asset creation. While {{it is true that the}} Indian corporate debt market has transformed itself into a much more vibrant <b>trading</b> field for <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> from the elementary market about a decade ago, yet there is still along way to go.

40|$|The bill of exchange, the {{promissory}} note and the cheque are <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> {{regulated by the}} bill of exchange law. The <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are differentiated from other instruments used in civil and commercial relations by {{the inclusion of the}} <b>debt</b> in the <b>instrument,</b> hence the name of <b>debt</b> <b>instrument.</b> The main features of the <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are: formal, literal and autonomous nature. The <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are formal {{in the sense that the}} creation, the existence, the circulation and the exercise and the use of the patrimonial rights included depend on the existence of the elements included in the instrument. Moreover, the high rigorous nature of the <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> is reflected by the obligation to meet some requirements regarding the form (the bill of exchange, the {{promissory note}} and the cheque imply some compulsory requirements in order to be valid). The <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are literal, in the sense that the existence and the coverage of the patrimonial rights are established through the wording included in the instrument; thus, the juridical relation that caused the issuing of the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> no longer influences the right deriving from the instrument (whether a sales-purchase agreement, or a loan or a debt opening); no possibility for the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> to be interpreted or completed with other documents. The autonomous nature of the <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> can be seen, on the one hand, in relation to the fundamental juridical relation that caused it, and in this case, we shall consider that the individual who issued the instrument has an obligation which is not under the existing fundamental relation but exclusively under the instrument which the individual signed; on the other hand, each new signatory has an autonomous juridical position and acquires a new, original right, not a transferred right. The autonomy of the <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> explains the principle according to which the holder of the instrument exercises one’s own right and exceptions cannot be opposed to him, namely the protection measures that could be opposed to the previous holders (principle of non-opposability of exceptions) ...|$|R

40|$|As U. S. Treasury {{securities}} {{carry the}} full faith and credit of the U. S. government, {{they are free}} of default risk. Thus, their yields are risk-free rates of return, which allows the most recently issued U. S. Treasury securities {{to be used as}} a benchmark to price other fixed-income instruments. This article analyzes the time series properties of interest rates on U. S. Treasury benchmarks and related <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> by modelling the conditional mean and conditional volatility for weekly yields on 12 Treasury Bills and other <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> for the period January 8, 1982 to August 20, 2004. The conditional correlations between all pairs of <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> are also calculated. These estimates are of interest as they enable an assessment of the implications of modelling conditional volatility on forecasting performance. The estimated conditional correlation coefficients indicate whether there is specialization, diversification, or independence in the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> shocks. Constant conditional correlation estimates of the standardized shocks indicate that the shocks to the first differences in the <b>debt</b> <b>instrument</b> yields are generally high and always positively correlated. In general, the primary purpose in holding a portfolio of Treasury Bills and other <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> should be to specialize on instruments that provide the largest returns. Tests for Stochastic Dominance are generally consistent with these findings, but find somewhat surprising rankings between <b>debt</b> <b>instruments,</b> with implications for portfolio composition. Thirty year treasuries, Aaa bonds, and mortgages tend to dominate the other instruments, at least to the second order.

40|$|The {{definition}} of deposit substitutes in Philippine tax law fails {{to consider the}} maturity of a <b>debt</b> <b>instrument.</b> This {{makes it possible for}} long-term bonds to be considered as deposit substitutes if they meet the 20 -lender rule, taxable at 20 % final tax. However, long-term <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> cannot realistically function as deposit substitutes even if they fall in the hands of 20 or more lenders. First, long-term <b>debt</b> <b>instruments</b> cannot simultaneously replicate the twin features of capital preservation and liquidity, which are integral to the nature of a deposit substitute. Second, deposit substitutes {{are an integral part of}} the maturity transformation process (i. e. short-term borrowing for the purpose of long-term lending) in financial intermediaries, which means that they should have low borrowing cost, made possible only by having short-term maturity. To prove these propositions, this paper situates the function of deposit substitutes within the context of shadow banking, where said instruments originated and are generally used. To show the incompatibility between a deposit substitute and a long-term <b>debt</b> <b>instrument,</b> the paper applies the fundamental theory of bond values to 10 -year zero-coupon treasury notes called 'PEACe Bonds' in Banco De Oro, et al. vs. Republic (2015 and 2016).
