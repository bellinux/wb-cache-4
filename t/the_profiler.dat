Later in the [...] "green reality" [...] (where Rex is alive and Hannah is not), Michael and Rex (Dylan Minnette) are stuck in traffic, and Michael is later called into work. His partner in the [...] "green reality", Isaiah [...] "Bird" [...] Freeman (Steve Harris) talks to Michael, then Michael goes for {{a run at the}} Griffith Park. He goes {{to the top of a}} hill {{overlooking}} the city, while a dog appears from behind a bush and barks at him. Michael notices human flesh in him, and goes to investigate, where he finds a corpse sitting against a tree. Michael goes to the police station, and shows Captain Harper similar cases starting in 1999. In each case, a killer, nicknamed Gemini (Salvator Xuereb), vertically slashed the victim's wrists and carved a Roman numeral in their chests. The murders have taken place all across the United States, but everyone believes that Gemini is dead after an FBI agent Elizabeth Santoro (Megan Dodds) had shot him. Michael wants to cover the area as much as they can and Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) agrees, telling Michael to pick up <b>the</b> <b>profiler</b> that the FBI has sent. Michael goes to Brentwood and meets with FBI agent Elizabeth Santoro. They discuss his history and she admits that she has been focused solely on the [...] "Gemini Killer" [...] for the last 12 years. Michael confirms that they did not find one on the body, so she figures that it is a copycat. Michael goes to the crime scene, while Bird is already there. The partners go over the hillside and find the dog. They take him to Dr. Banks (Chris McGarry) and have him check his stomach, where he finds a United States two-dollar bill in it. When Michael takes the evidence to Harper and Santoro, Santoro insists that it only means that someone with classified information to the case is involved. She suggests they check anyone who has recently laid off law enforcement officers with psych problems. Bird and Santoro create a database if the killer is alive. Santoro lets Harper decide and she tells the detectives to pull the files on law officers. As Santoro leaves, Michael approaches her and says that he understands the implications if the man she shot was Gemini. Meanwhile, the killer prepares a set of medical tools, a wad of two-dollar bills, and a syringe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In the {{system-level}} {{design of}} MPSoCs (Multi-Processor System-on-a-Chips), system designers start from de-scribing {{functionalities of the}} system as processes and channels, and then decide mapping of them to various Processing Elements (PEs) including CPUs and dedicated hardware modules. A mapping decision is evaluated by simulation or FPGA-based prototyping. Designers iterate mapping and evaluation until all design requirements are met. We have developed two profilers, a process profiler and a memory profiler, for FPGA-based performance analysis of design candidates. <b>The</b> process <b>profiler</b> records a trace of process activations, while <b>the</b> memory <b>profiler</b> records a trace of channel accesses. According to mapping of processes to PEs, <b>the</b> <b>profilers</b> are automatically configured and instrumented into FPGA-based system prototypes by a system-level design tool that we have developed. Designers therefore need to manually modify neither the system description nor <b>the</b> <b>profilers</b> upon each change of process mapping.

40|$|Pavement profile or {{smoothness}} {{has been}} identified nationally as a good measure of highway user satisfaction. This has led highway engineers to measure profiles of both operating and new highways. Operational highway profiles are often measured with high-speed inertial profilers. New highway profiles are usually measured with profilographs {{in order to establish}} incentives or disincentives for pavement construction. In most cases, these two processes do not measure the same value from the “cradle to grave” life of pavements. In an attempt to correct the inconsistency between measuring techniques, lightweight profilers intended to produce values to be used for construction acceptance are being made that measure the same profile as high-speed inertial profilers. Currently, two profiler systems have been identified that can measure pavement profile during construction. This research has produced a field evaluation of the two systems. <b>The</b> <b>profilers</b> evaluated in this study are able to detect roughness in the final profile, including localized roughness and roughness at joints. Dowel basket ripple is a significant source of pavement surface roughness. <b>The</b> <b>profilers</b> evaluated in this study are able to detect dowel basket ripple with enough clarity to warn the paving crew.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} development of a proof-of-concept measurement instrument to satisfy the requirements of the University of Cape Town's Load Research Group. The new instrument needed to make use of current technologies to cost-effectively measure multiple residential households and provide remote communications capabilities for reliable remote data retrieval. Measurement of three-phase 4 -wire configurations was necessary as well as the ability to create second-based profiles of consumer voltage, current and active, reactive and apparent powers for load identification purposes. The main components of a measurement system were identified and prototype development was split into two stages: component integration testing and final product integration. The product was called <b>the</b> Power <b>Profiler</b> and two early prototypes were developed to test the main measurement and processing components and mechanical integration to create a compact versatile test instrument. Energy measurement ICs were used instead of discrete sampling of voltage and current to improve accuracy and allow the use of a low- cost and easy to program digital signal controller for measurement processing and storage. Several communication options were incorporated into <b>the</b> Power <b>Profiler</b> including remote GSM and local USB and Bluetooth communication. The third prototype was subjected to full calibration testing with a Chauvin Arnoux power quality analyzer used as the reference meter. <b>The</b> Power <b>Profiler</b> proved to be a high accuracy instrument with a typical inaccuracy of 0. 4 % for RMS voltage (over a 20 : 1 range), 0 % for RMS current, 1. 1 % for active power, 0. 3 % for reactive power and 0. 1 % apparent power versus the reference meter. To validate <b>the</b> Power <b>Profiler</b> measurement functionality it was connected to a residential household in conjunction with the reference meter and 4 hours of measurement data was captured for comparison. After a successful validation <b>the</b> Power <b>Profiler</b> was then left to capture another 43 hours of measurement data using a 5 -second, 10 -minute and 2 -hour measurement profile. This data was then analyzed to see if non-intrusive load discrimination could be performed. From the measurement and validation data several common household appliances were identified including the refrigerator, geyser, kettle, microwave and washing machine. <b>The</b> Power <b>Profiler</b> stores not only the average values measured between recording intervals but the maximum and minimum levels as well. This data proved very valuable for the detection of voltage dips and swells that would otherwise have gone unreported by a conventional power meter. The maximum statistic also effectively showed the startup current of motor-based appliances such as the refrigerator and washing machine which greatly assisted with load discrimination. The embedded software for <b>the</b> Power <b>Profiler</b> was split into several software tasks to simplify code maintenance and future development. A C# PC Control and Configuration application was developed to automate calibration as far as possible, and to allow an operator to configure and upload measurement data from <b>the</b> Power <b>Profiler.</b> Extensive use of object-oriented programming techniques was made to allow the reuse of the interface and control software in future applications by other developers. Remote communications capabilities were demonstrated over GSM GPRS connections to allow the retrieval of measurement data from field-deployed Power <b>Profilers.</b> <b>The</b> ability of <b>the</b> Power <b>Profiler</b> to simultaneously record second-, minute- and hour-based profiles and to allow the operator to decide which of this measured data to upload is highly effective in managing remote communication bandwidth and reducing overall operating cost of the system. <b>The</b> Power <b>Profiler</b> product proved to be a cost-effective replacement to the currently used logger and offered more channels with higher resolution measurement and profiling capabilities in a compact instrument. Remote communication capabilities reduces the overall operating cost of the system and simplified measurement retrieval. The ability to easily custom-develop software for both <b>the</b> Power <b>Profiler</b> and PC-based applications made it a flexible instrument valuable for research-orientated applications...|$|R
