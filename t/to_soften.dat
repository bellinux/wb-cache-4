5|$|In The Orphant Annie Story Book (1921), author Johnny Gruelle augments the character’s {{background}} story {{and goes to}} great lengths <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> her image, portraying her as telling pleasant tales of fairies, gnomes and anthropomorphic animals rather than her characteristic horror stories.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{would be}} divided into batches of 13, and placed under broody chickens. In {{the last week of}} the four-week {{incubation}} period the eggs would be sprinkled daily with warm water <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> the shells and allow the ducklings to hatch.|$|E
5|$|When the Trent Affair—the forcible {{removal of}} Confederate envoys from a British ship by Union forces during the American Civil War—threatened {{war between the}} United States and Britain, Albert was gravely ill, but intervened <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> the British {{diplomatic}} response.|$|E

40|$|Flow {{softening}} {{behavior during}} hot compression deformation process of near β titanium alloys was reviewed, including the influencing factors, the flow softening mechanism and its analysis methods, {{the development of}} the constitutive model based on softening mechanism. The influence of deformation parameters and initial microstructure on flow softening behavior was primarily analyzed. Besides, the contribution of softening mechanisms such as dynamic recovery, dynamic recrystallization and deformation heating <b>to</b> flow <b>softening</b> was discussed. The problems urgently to be solved during hot deformation process regarding <b>to</b> flow <b>softening</b> were proposed, and it is pointed that quantify and physical modeling will be the important directions of near β titanium alloys during hot deformation process with respect <b>to</b> <b>softening</b> phenomenon in the future...|$|R
5|$|Among the reds, Grenache, Syrah, Carignan, Cinsault, and Mourvedre {{are major}} grapes of the Corbières, Faugères, Fitou, and Minervois AOCs. Cinsault is also {{commonly}} used in rosé production along with Lladoner Pelut, Picpoul noir, Terret noir, and Grenache. Grenache is also the main grape used in the fortified wines of the Banyuls and Rivesaltes region. Some of the oldest vines in France are Carignan grapes. Winemakers often use carbonic maceration <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> the tannins.|$|E
5|$|Since medieval times, dubbin, a waxy product, {{was used}} <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> and {{waterproof}} leather; however, {{it did not}} impart shine. It was made from natural wax, oil, soda ash and tallow. As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century, a high glossy finish became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, a variety of homemade polishes were used to provide this finish, often with lanolin or beeswax as a base.|$|E
5|$|A widely {{consumed}} liquor among Palestinian Christians, non-religious Palestinians {{and many}} less-stringently observant Muslims is Arak. Arak {{is a clear}} anise-flavored alcoholic drink that is mixed with water <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> it {{and give it a}} creamy white color. It is consumed during special occasions such as holidays, weddings, and gatherings or with the mezze. Beer is also a consumed drink and the Palestinian town of Taybeh in the central West Bank contains one of the few breweries in Palestine. In addition to regular beer, the brewery produces non-alcoholic beer for observant Muslims. The nearby town of Birzeit is also home to Shepherds Brewery.|$|E

Tanzer (1921-2004) re-emphasized {{the use of}} {{autologous}} cartilage as {{the most}} advantageously reliable organic material for resolving microtia, abnormally small ears, because of its great histologic viability, resistance to shrinkage, and resistance <b>to</b> <b>softening,</b> and lower incidence of resorption.|$|R

5|$|Carey and Helford co-wrote {{the pilot}} episode together. Helford had {{expected}} The Drew Carey Show to air at 8:30pm. When ABC placed {{the show in}} the 7:30 pm slot, Helford agreed <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> the language in the pilot. An executive from Standards and Practices had asked for nine words deemed offensive {{to be removed from}} the script, as well as a mention of Jack Daniel's and a line that implied one of the characters was going to buy and use drugs.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the length}} of time it took to build her, Wisconsin missed much of the initial thrust into Japanese-held territory, having arrived {{at a time when the}} reconquest of the Philippines was well underway. As a part of that movement, the {{planners}} had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of Mindoro, south of Luzon. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the South China Sea. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, Wisconsin was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at Manila <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> up Japanese positions.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
5000|$|In shales, mud {{weight is}} usually {{sufficient}} to balance formation stress, as these wells are usually stable. With water base mud, chemical differences can cause interactions between mud & shale that lead <b>to</b> <b>softening</b> {{of the native}} rock. Highly fractured, dry, brittle shales can be extremely unstable (leading to mechanical problems).|$|R
50|$|In recent years, it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} popular to decorate caramel apples for holidays like Halloween.

5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} {{a combination of the}} barrel of the 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} {{assault was}} preceded by a massive artillery bombardment that was meant <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> up the Union defense and silence its artillery, but was largely ineffective. Approximately 12,500 men in nine infantry brigades advanced over open fields for three-quarters of a mile under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire. Although some Confederates were able to breach the low stone wall that shielded many of the Union defenders, they could not maintain their hold and were repulsed with over 50% casualties, a decisive defeat that ended the three-day battle and Lee's campaign into Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Unsurprisingly, the {{two teams}} found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already {{concluded}} they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic Caravelle). As neither company had experience {{in the use of}} high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used– above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins <b>to</b> <b>soften.</b> This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that Küchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one.|$|E
40|$|Associated {{with the}} {{durability}} of railway wheelsets, thermal damage was studied for two different steels in the temperature range 500 °C <b>to</b> 725 °C. <b>Softening</b> caused by cementite spheroidisation in the pearlitic materials leads {{to changes in the}} mechanical behaviour. It was found that higher contents of silicon and manganese leads to better resistance <b>to</b> <b>softening.</b> Correspondingly, <b>softening</b> leads <b>to</b> loss in fatigue life times at given stress amplitudes as read out from Wöhler curves. However the higher alloyed steel looses much less in fatigue life time than the less alloyed steel...|$|R
50|$|If larger {{trees are}} removed from the toe area of a slope there will be both a {{reduction}} in soil strength due {{to the loss of}} evapotranspiration effects and a reduction in applied loading which may result in temporary suctions in clay soils which could lead <b>to</b> <b>softening</b> as the available water is drawn in to compensate for the suction forces. This is similar <b>to</b> the recognised <b>softening</b> of overconsolidated clays due to the relaxation of overburden pressures when placed in the top layers of an embankment from deep cutting.|$|R
40|$|Nonlinear {{structural}} {{problems in the}} presence of material softening represent a severe challenge to solution algorithms. Special numerical procedures are required to pass critical points. The Authors discuss some relevant computational aspects of the procedure recently proposed. The interest is mainly devoted <b>to</b> <b>softening</b> models where snap-backs might arise. The procedure can be used in BEM applications on nonlocal continuum models...|$|R
5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. <b>To</b> <b>soften</b> the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Ensign Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes) and Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao) are {{returning}} to the Enterprise from the planet Marlonia, but a transporter accident results in them changing into 12-year-old children. Although the four still retain an adult mind, the crew have trouble taking them seriously, and Picard (David Tristan Birkin) is convinced by Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) to temporarily relinquish command of the ship. After turning over command of the Enterprise to Commander William Riker, Picard ponders resigning his Starfleet commission, albeit temporarily, in order to pursue other interests. Meanwhile, Keiko (Caroline Junko King) is dismayed by her husband Miles's (Colm Meaney) reluctance {{to be with her}} and is further saddened her daughter (Hana Hatae) does not recognize her. While Ro (Megan Parlen) is at first upset after being reminded of her unpleasant childhood, once Guinan's (Isis Carmen Jones) enthusiasm causes her <b>to</b> <b>soften,</b> the duo begin jumping on a bed and other childish pursuits.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they did nothing wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, few Brazilians opposed {{slavery and}} even fewer openly {{condemned}} it. PedroII, who did not own slaves, {{was one of the}} few who did oppose slavery. Its abolition was a delicate subject. Slaves were used by everyone, from the richest to the poorest. PedroII wanted to end the practice gradually <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> the impact to the national economy. With no constitutional authority to directly intervene to abolish slavery, the Emperor would need to use all his skills to convince, influence and gather support among politicians to achieve his goal. His first open move occurred back in 1850, when he threatened to abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the Atlantic slave trade illegal.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, a {{large part}} of Cabernet Sauvignon's {{reputation}} was built on its ability to age and develop in the bottle. In addition to softening some of their austere tannins, as Cabernet wines age new flavors and aromas can emerge and add to the wines' complexity. Historically this was a trait characterized by Bordeaux with some premium examples in favorable vintages having the potential to last for over a century, but producers across the globe have developed styles that could age and develop for several decades. Even with the ability to age, some Cabernet Sauvignon wines can still be approachable a few years after vintage. In Bordeaux, the tannins of the wines tend <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> after ten years and can typically last for at least another decade-sometimes longer depending on the producer and vintage. Some Spanish and Italian Cabernet Sauvignons will need similar time as Bordeaux to develop but most examples are typically made to be drunk earlier.|$|E
5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin <b>to</b> <b>soften</b> it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, joining them as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E
40|$|Stress {{amplitude}} {{and temperature}} dependences of internal friction in polycrystal and single crystal aluminas and aluminas subjected to thermal shock, were measured.

50|$|The {{reliance}} on Hebrew Scripture allows Milton to emphasise a plot {{that he feels}} is worthy of discussion, while the elements of Greek tragedy allows Milton to deal with complex issues through use of choruses and messengers instead of directly depicting them in addition <b>to</b> <b>softening</b> the Hebrew characters.

40|$|The work {{hardening}} of metals subjected to complex processing paths {{is different from}} that in monotonic deformation. Changes in the deformation mode can promote transients in the strain-hardening rate, leading <b>to</b> anomalous <b>softening</b> or hardening of the material. This paper investigates the influence of strain path changes on the tensile behavior of drawn 0. 12 % steel rods. Annealed or predrawn specimens were submitted to cyclic twisting and then tested in tension. The results show that the cyclic deformation causes changes in the mechanical behavior of the metal, and the effect will depend on the previous "history" of the material. Cyclic twisting causes hardening in annealed samples, but leads <b>to</b> <b>softening</b> of the drawn bars. These phenomena are in line with the corresponding substructural aspects...|$|R
