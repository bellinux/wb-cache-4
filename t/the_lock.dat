5|$|Kelston Lock and weir have {{permanent}} moorings {{above and}} below them. The Riverside Inn and Saltford Marina are also close by. Saltford Lock and weir are overlooked by {{the remains of the}} Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925. It is a grade II listed building. Alongside <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> is a pub, whose garden extends over <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> to the small island between <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> and weir. <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 by rival coal dealers to stop the use of the river for transportation. In its heyday, between 1709 and 1859 Swineford had an active brass and copper industry around the Swineford Lock which were served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry, as did the River Boyd, a tributary which flows into the Avon near Bitton. Keynsham Lock opened in 1727. Just above <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> and the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew. Hanham is the last tidal lock, after which the river is joined by Brislington Brook.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} locks and bridges in Hungerford, {{including}} one which carries the A338.

In the area around <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> called Hungerford Marsh Nature Reserve, more than 120 bird species have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|After playing {{just three}} {{games of the}} 1999–2000 NHL season, Brewer was {{assigned}} to the Islanders' AHL affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters. It was speculated that the reason behind this move was laziness by Brewer, who was benched during the final thirty minutes by head coach Butch Goring after losing a race for the puck against Mike Knuble in the Islanders' October 11, 1999, loss to the New York Rangers. Brewer also took a bad penalty earlier in the game, putting the Islanders down two men. After a two-week, five-game stint with <b>the</b> <b>Lock</b> Monsters, Brewer was subsequently recalled by the Islanders. After playing 26 games with the Islanders in which he only recorded two assists, Brewer was reassigned to <b>the</b> <b>Lock</b> Monsters on January 8, 2000, {{for the remainder of the}} season. Shortly after joining <b>the</b> <b>Lock</b> Monsters, Brewer suffered a sprained knee and missed the next two-and-a-half months of the season. Brewer went on to play 25 games for <b>the</b> <b>Lock</b> Monsters, recording two goals and two assists. He also participated in his first professional playoffs, as <b>the</b> <b>Lock</b> Monsters swept the Saint John Flames in three games in the first round, before being swept themselves in four games in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Providence Bruins.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011, <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> {{were again}} closed, this time {{owing to the}} {{excessive}} corrosion of the locks' gate anchors. The further deterioration of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> resulted in <b>the</b> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reclassifying <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> as being in a [...] "non-operational status," [...] out of concern that any further operation of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> {{could lead to a}} failure of <b>the</b> <b>locks,</b> posing a safety risk. <b>The</b> <b>locks</b> are expected to remain permanently closed, as the lack of traffic through <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> makes funding for any repairs a low priority.

5|$|Keynsham {{is located}} where the River Chew meets the River Avon. Fishing {{rights for the}} Millground and Chewton {{sections}} of the Chew are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six fields on the western bank from Chewton Place at Chewton Keynsham to the Albert Mill. The water is home to Chub, Roach, European perch and Rudd, along with good numbers of Gudgeon, Dace and Trout. Keynsham Lock on the Avon opened in 1727. Just above <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> and the weir.

50|$|In {{common with}} many of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> on {{this section of the}} canal, the remains of <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>locks</b> can still be seen beside the newer ones. <b>The</b> four <b>locks</b> raise <b>the</b> level of the canal by 26.75 ft. Below <b>the</b> bottom <b>lock,</b> <b>the</b> canal is level for 0.4 mi to Welsh Road <b>Lock,</b> and above <b>the</b> top <b>lock,</b> it is level for 1.6 mi to Itchington Bottom <b>Lock.</b> <b>The</b> paddles on <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> reflect <b>the</b> style of the Warwick and Napton Canal, and are different from those further south, where the canal was built by the Grand Junction company.|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} simulation model of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> system on <b>the</b> Illinois Waterway is described. The model was developed using ProModel for Windows and includes boats and barge tows traveling through <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> system {{and operation of}} <b>the</b> <b>locks.</b> Entities with attributes are used to simulate the boats and barge tows that enter the system, travel either upstream or downstream through <b>the</b> <b>locks,</b> and then leave the system. Locations are used for <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> and for entry and exiting of the boats and barge tows. The operation of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> is simulated {{through the use of}} variables, resources, and operation logic in the processing module. The handling of both boats and barge tows in <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> greatly complicates <b>the</b> simulation model, since their differences in size is significant. For example, a lockage can easily handle ten or more boats, while a barge tow with fIfteen barges can require a double lockage (typically nine barges for the fIrSt lockage and six barges and the tow boat for the second lockage). At times both barge tows and boats are included in a single lockage...|$|R
5|$|Shopham Lock {{was another}} where <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> cut was built across a large meander to the north. The bridge {{at the tail}} of <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> is built from red and grey brick, and has a single, round-headed arch. It dates from the {{construction}} of the navigation, and is virtually unaltered. Nearby, the Petworth Canal headed northwards to Haslingbourne Bridge. Below the end of the cut, the river is joined by the stream from Burton Mill Pond, which supplied an iron forge built in 1789. It is crossed by Shopham Bridge, built in the nineteenth century from red brick with grey headers and a parapet in stone, with three segmental arches. At Lower Fittleworth, there is another mill building, although it is unused and in poor condition. It was built in 1628 and enlarged in 1742. It stands in the grounds of the mill house, which was rebuilt in 1913. <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> cut ran along the south-western edge of the site. Fittleworth Bridge consists of a southern section, originally built in the sixteenth century, which was rebuilt between 1717 and 1739, and modified when the navigation was built, to enable boats to pass through the centre arch. A north section, adjacent to the millpond, dates from 1811-12.|$|E
5|$|The Act of 1767 had {{specified}} {{points on}} the river at which tolls could be collected, but had {{made no mention of}} tolls for use of Bow Creek, Bow Back Rivers, or the section of the navigation between Bow tidal gates and Old Ford, and these had remained toll-free. An Act of Parliament obtained on 14 August 1850 allowed the trustees to build a pound lock at Bow tidal gates. To prevent opposition from the bargees, the Act had formalised the freedom from tolls on the Bow River section. Once <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> was built, however, the trustees charged a toll for using it. This was unpopular, but there was still the option of using the tidal gates at certain states of the tide, which did not incur a toll. A clause to authorise <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> toll was deleted by Parliament from a subsequent Act of 1868, and it was still the case in 1977 that a charge was made for using <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> but not for using the gates.|$|E
5|$|The canal was a centre for boatbuilding between 1858, when Richard Dunston {{moved his}} yard to Thorne from Torksey, and 1984 when the yard closed. Dunston's company were pioneers {{in the use}} of welded {{construction}} and innovative tug propulsion systems. The operation was always restricted by the size of Keadby Lock, although vessels longer than <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> could pass through when the river was level with the canal and both sets of gates could be opened. The largest ship to be built required Dunston's to build a dam across the canal, as the canal company feared that it might get stuck in <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> resulting in flooding and draining of the canal.|$|E
