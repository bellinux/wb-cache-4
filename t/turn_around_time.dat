The cargo did not necessarily just contain truck and trailer units, but was also cargo stacked in the decks using forklifts. This necessitated the vehicle decks of the ship being build to withstand the loading of up to 39t per axle that could be exerted by a heavy forklift. Union Rotorua was built with a large angled stern ramp that allowed her to unload her cargo at any wharf {{without the need for}} a specialist linkspan as required by most ro-ro ships.

The method was fast, accurate and precise. Sample <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>times</b> were approximately six minutes, with an accompanying average percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) of less than 10 %. Four linear saturated hydrocarbons with 27, 29, 31 and 33 carbon atoms were quantitated in an array of reference cigarettes ranging in “tar” deliveries from approximately 2 to approximately 20 mg. By use of a cyclohexane extraction of cigarette smoke captured on Cambridge filter pads, the extraction efficiency was determined to be greater than 95 % for each hydrocarbon.

Governments in Nigeria are trying various approaches to deal with this perennial issue. Three of the key factors that affect the efficiency of solid waste managers and therefore the degree of cleanliness of urban centres are: The type of vehicles deployed, their discharge and <b>Turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>times.</b> This study measured the three variables in the solid waste collection operations of Lagos state. Forty discharge and <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> <b>times</b> in minutes were obtained for all the various types of vehicles on two of the three operating Landfill sites in the state; these are Olusoshun- (the biggest) and Solous (the smallest).
