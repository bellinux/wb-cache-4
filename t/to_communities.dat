5|$|Ahead of Hurricane Beta, the U.S. {{ambassador}} to Nicaragua signed a disaster declaration on October28, prompting the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to send aid. Before the storm hit, $200,000 {{was sent to}} the country for emergency relief supply distribution and helicopter fuel. On November1, USAID and OFDA airlifted 200 rolls of plastic sheeting, 5,020 ten-litre water containers, and 2,736 hygiene kits, valued at $120,877. Another $22,000 was used to supply an aircraft and Bell 204/205 helicopter to assist affected areas. On November10, another $100,000 was sent for sanitation and health activities. The United Nations sent $10,000 to the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region to cover emergency needs. Forty-five tents were sent <b>to</b> <b>communities</b> in need. The Spanish Government also sent $377,188 in aid and to Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|GO Bus service {{consists}} {{of a combination of}} routes, many of which stand in for train service when it is not operating and/or which extend the reach of train service <b>to</b> <b>communities</b> beyond their termini. Other GO buses are independent of rail services, such as the Highway 407 series of routes, which provides an orbital-type service that encircles Toronto proper and makes connections between all train lines. There are also routes that serve Pearson International Airport, seasonal destinations such as Canada's Wonderland, and several colleges and universities. The vast majority of GO train stations have connecting GO bus service, of which almost all the exceptions are situated within Toronto proper. There are also 16 bus terminals served by GO buses, many of which provide local transit connections, as well as intermediate stops and ticket agencies.|$|E
5|$|Governor McDaniel {{appointed}} a commission in January 1886 {{to organize and}} run the school. This commission elected Harris chairman, a position he would hold until his death. Other members included Samuel M. Inman, Oliver S. Porter, Judge Columbus Heard, and Edward R. Hodgson; each was known either for political or industrial experience. Their first task was to select a location for the new school. Letters were sent <b>to</b> <b>communities</b> throughout the state, and five bids were presented by the October 1, 1886 deadline: Athens, Atlanta, Macon, Penfield, and Milledgeville. The commission inspected the proposed sites from October 7 to October 18.

5|$|In south Florida, peak gusts were {{estimated}} near 150mph (240km/h) at the Army Air Base in Homestead. The strong winds destroyed 1,632 residences across the state, while 5,372 homes received damages. In Miami, gusts reached 107mph (170km/h), and damages were minimal, mostly snapped power lines, compared <b>to</b> <b>communities</b> in southern Dade County. Nearly 200people were injured at the Richmond Naval Air Station, when a fire ignited during the storm, affecting three hangars worth $3million each and destroying 25 blimps, 366 planes, and 150 automobiles. Damages to the Miami area {{was estimated at}} $40million. An additional fire also destroyed a furniture factory and a tile manufacturing plant in the northwestern portion of downtown Miami. One death {{was reported in the}} area, the fire chief of Richmond's fire department, and 26 required hospitalization. Another death was recorded after a schooner ran aground in present-day Bal Harbour, Florida, killing its chief engineer.|$|E
5|$|Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs. Mostly megalithic, the {{earliest}} instances date {{to within a}} few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the Iberian peninsula have been dated through thermoluminescence to c. 4510BCE, and some burials at the Carnac stones in Brittany also {{date back to the}} fifth millennium BCE. The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from {{the earliest}}, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of ancestor-worship, a development available only <b>to</b> <b>communities</b> that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} {{nature of}} past eruptions at Silverthrone Caldera {{suggests that this}} volcano poses a significant long-distance threat <b>to</b> <b>communities</b> across Canada. A large explosive eruption can produce large amounts of ash that could significantly affect communities across Canada. Ash columns could rise to several hundred meters above the volcano which would make this a hazard for air traffic along the coastal airway between Vancouver and Alaska. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure as well as damage to other aircraft systems. In addition, pyroclastic fall could also have a deleterious effect on the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield surrounding the volcano. Melting of glacial ice could cause lahars or debris flows. This in turn could endanger water supplies on the Machmell River and other local water sources.|$|E

5|$|The seven {{islands that}} came to {{constitute}} Mumbai were home <b>to</b> <b>communities</b> of fishing colonies of the Koli people. For centuries, the islands were {{under the control of}} successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.|$|E
5|$|In Britain and Australia, early {{memorials}} {{were closely}} linked to the need to promote military recruitment and the state had an ambivalent attitude towards the informal memorials that emerged during the conflict. In Britain, stone memorials to the war began to be erected in towns and villages from 1915 onwards; some of these were given out by the state as rewards <b>to</b> <b>communities</b> for meeting military recruitment targets. In Australia, the existing memorials to mark the Boer War were used initially for commemorative ceremonies intended to increase military recruitment. As casualties increased, rolls of honour listing the dead began to be displayed in Britain and honour tablets with the names of those who had enlisted were put up inside Australian buildings: Australia used these lists to apply moral pressure on those who were not yet joined up. Informal memorials began to multiply as the war progressed. Local Australian groups erected small monuments, such as drinking fountains and stone pillars, {{to the point where the}} government became concerned about the expenditure on them and passed a law in 1916 to control their numbers. In Britain, some Anglican church leaders began to create street war shrines to the dead. These cheap, local memorials were mainly constructed in working class districts, often built from wood and paper, and were used for holding short services in honour of the dead and to hold donations of flowers. They were criticised, however, as promoting Catholic ritualism. Official support for the shrines only came after a national newspaper campaign, efforts by the Lord Mayor of London and a well-publicised visit from Queen Mary to a shrine, and standardised stone shrines then began to replace the earlier, temporary versions.|$|E
5|$|In the 9th and 10th centuriesCE, Pandya and Chola incursions into Sri Lanka {{culminated in}} the Chola {{annexation}} of the island, which lasted until {{the latter half of}} the 11th century CE. Raja Raja Chola I renamed the northern throne Mummudi Chola Mandalam after his conquest of the northeast country to protect Tamil traders being looted, imprisoned and killed for years on the island. Rajadhiraja Chola's conquest of the island led to the fall of four kings there, one of whom, Madavarajah, the king of Jaffna, was a usurper from the Rashtrakuta Dynasty. These dynasties oversaw the development of several Kovils that administered services <b>to</b> <b>communities</b> of land assigned to the temples through royal grants. Their rule also saw the benefaction of other faiths. Recent excavations have led to the discovery of a limestone Kovil of Raja Raja Chola I's era on Delft island, found with Chola coins from this period. The decline of Chola power in Sri Lanka was followed by the restoration of the Polonnaruwa monarchy in the late 11th century CE. In 1215, following Pandya invasions, the Tamil-dominant Arya Chakaravarthi dynasty established an independent Jaffna kingdom on the Jaffna peninsula and other parts of the north. The Arya Chakaravarthi expansion into the south was halted by Alagakkonara, a man descended from a family of merchants from Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu. He was the chief minister of the Sinhalese king Parakramabahu V (1344–59CE). Vira Alakeshwara, a descendant of Alagakkonara, later became king of the Sinhalese, but he was overthrown by the Ming admiral Zheng He in 1409CE. The next year, the Chinese admiral Zheng He erected a trilingual stone tablet in Galle in the south of the island, written in Chinese, Persian and Tamil that recorded offerings he made to Buddha, Allah and the God of Tamils Tenavarai Nayanar. The admiral invoked the blessings of Hindu deities at Temple of Perimpanayagam Tenavaram, Tevanthurai for a peaceful world built on trade. The 1502 map Cantino represents three Tamil cities on the east coast of the island – Mullaitivu, Trincomalee and Pannoa, where the residents grow cinnamon and other spices, fish for pearls and seed pearls and worship idols, trading heavily with Kozhikode of Kerala. The Arya Chakaravarthi dynasty ruled large parts of northeast Sri Lanka until the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom in 1619CE. The coastal areas of the island were conquered by the Dutch and then became part of the British Empire in 1796CE.|$|E
40|$|Much {{has been}} learned {{over the past decade}} about the way {{children}} respond to experiences of violence in their community. The goal {{of this paper is to}} review what is known about the effects of community violence on children’s development. In addition to main effects, factors that mediate these effects, as well as factors that moderate children’s response <b>to</b> <b>community</b> violence are discussed. Special attention is paid to developmental differences in children’s responses <b>to</b> <b>community</b> violence and the factors that may promote resilient functioning. KEY WORDS: community violence; child development; psychopathology; resilience. Much {{has been learned}} over the past decade about the way children respond to experiences of vi-olence in their community (see Margolin & Gordis, 2000). Researchers around the country have iden-tified a variety of main effects associated with this particular form of environmental adversity. In addi-tion, more is being learned about variables that me-diate the link between exposure <b>to</b> <b>community</b> vio-lence and children’s adaptation, as well as factors that may moderate children’s responses <b>to</b> <b>community</b> vio-lence. Understanding more about potential mediators and moderators of the effects of community violence is critical for specifying how exposure to this form of violence impacts the course of development. As the consequences of children’s exposure <b>to</b> <b>community</b> violence are delineated, it is also important to exam-ine whether there are any developmental differences in children’s responses <b>to</b> <b>community</b> violence, and whether there are factors that may protect children from the harmful effects of exposure <b>to</b> <b>community</b> violence. Despite advances that have been made in the field, there are a number of challenges that re-searchers face.
