5|$|In February 2001, Ehren Kruger {{sold his}} spec script to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). With Gilliam's hiring as director, the script was rewritten by Gilliam and Tony Grisoni, but the Writers Guild of America refused to credit <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> work, thus Kruger {{received}} sole credit. MGM eventually dropped out as distributor, {{but decided to}} co-finance The Brothers Grimm with Dimension Films and Summit Entertainment, while Dimension took over distribution duties.|$|E

The remake also features new items, additional areas, mini-bosses, difficulty levels, and a rewritten story which explores Samus's past.|$|E
5|$|Phát and Thảo were {{stripped}} of their ranks, but nothing was initially done as far as prosecuting or sentencing <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> involvement in the coup. The new junta decided to ignore Khiêm’s actions and he remained in Washington as the ambassador, with no further action taken. Phát and Thảo stayed in hiding in Catholic villages.

5|$|Detailed {{training}} {{began at}} Campbellfield shortly after concentration and in May the battalion marched {{through the streets}} of Melbourne, before being presented with its unit colour. They were subsequently laid up at St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne prior to embarkation. They departed Australia on the transport Wandilla on 6 June 1916, and endured a seven-week voyage to the United Kingdom, sailing via Cape Town. After arriving in the United Kingdom, the battalion subsequently concentrated {{with the rest of the}} 3rd Division around Larkhill on Salisbury Plain, in Wiltshire. Between July and November 1916, the 3rd Pioneers carried out intensive training to prepare <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> arrival on the Western Front.

Fiver {{and the rest of the}} group work together to rescue Bigwig from a snare, then continue on their journey, along with a rabbit from the new warren called Strawberry, who asks to join them after his doe is killed in a snare.|$|E

In the first round, Nashville swept the New Orleans Zephyrs in three straight games {{to advance to the}} league finals. In the best-of-five championship series, the Indianapolis Indians defeated the Sounds, three games to one. Nashville hosted the mid-summer Triple-A All-Star Game in 1994. Nashville's Rick Renick managed the team of American League affiliated All-Stars which included Sounds players Ray Durham, Drew Denson, and Scott Ruffcorn, however Ruffcorn was later placed on the disabled list and replaced by Steve Schrenk.

5|$|Overcrowding and {{shortages}} of equipment in England {{meant that it}} was decided to keep the Anzacs in Egypt during the European winter, during which time they would undertake further training in order to prepare <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> eventual use in the trenches in France. Despite this, however, the training that the Australians and New Zealanders received in this time could only be considered very rudimentary in nature, and despite popular opinion at the time, it did little to prepare them for what was to come.|$|E
5|$|Saladin went to Alexandria in 1171–72 {{and found}} himself facing the dilemma of having many {{supporters}} in the city, but little money.

In order to justify the raid, a letter was sent to the Bedouin tribes of Barqa, rebuking <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> robberies of travelers and ordering them to pay the alms-tax (zakat).

5|$|Six {{units were}} leased by CFL between 2000 and 2004. The Luxembourgian State Railways were {{in need of}} new diesel {{locomotives}} to overcome the three different electrification systems in use. Because of a three-year waiting time for new locomotives, CFL leased the Di6 units for freight trains between Esch-sur-Alzette, Bettembourg and Mertert. In November 2003, the locomotives were sold to Vossloh and given the designation DE 2700. Since 2006, the main leaser is the Veolia Verkehr-owned Nord-Ostsee-Bahn, which operates passenger trains in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Eight locomotives are used to haul six to ten-car passengers trains on the route between Hamburg and Sylt. In 2008, three locomotives returned to Norway, when Cargolink leased <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> new autorack freight operations. In 2009, NOB transferred its ninth unit to HSL Logistik.|$|E
5|$|The Christians, {{believing that}} this tribulation came upon <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> {{neglect of the}} Law of God and their {{religious}} duties, began to fervently read the Krista Purana, an epic poem {{on the life of}} Jesus Christ written by the English Jesuit Thomas Stephens (1549–1619). On discovering this, some Muslims destroyed the books, but the Christians constructed subterranean refuges in which to perform their religious devotions, read the books, and strengthen their faith. According to Mr. Silva of Gangollim, a survivor of the captivity, if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found, the punishment ordered by Tipu was amputation of the ears, nose, feet and one hand.|$|E
5|$|The Domesday Book records ponies on Exmoor in 1086, and {{descendants}} of ponies {{removed from the}} moor in 1818 form the foundation bloodstock of today's Exmoor breed, although a breed society was not formed until 1921. The breed nearly became extinct after the Second World War, owing to soldiers using them for target practice and thieves killing <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> meat. After the war {{a small group of}} breeders worked to save the Exmoor, and during the 1950s ponies began to be exported to North America. The first stud book was published in 1963, and in 1981 publicity resulted in increased interest in the breed. As of 2010 there were an estimated 800 Exmoor ponies worldwide.|$|E
