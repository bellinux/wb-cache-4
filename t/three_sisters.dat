5|$|When {{the first}} {{geological}} reconnaissance of the <b>Three</b> <b>Sisters</b> region {{was published in}} 1925, its author, University of Oregon professor E. T. Hodge, suggested that the area's volcanoes comprised the remains of an enormous collapsed volcano active during the Miocene or early Pliocene epoch. Naming this ancient volcano Mount Multnomah, Hodge theorized that it had collapsed to form a caldera just as Mount Mazama collapsed to form Crater Lake. However, in the 1940s, University of California, Berkeley professor Howel Williams completed {{an analysis of the}} <b>Three</b> <b>Sisters</b> vicinity and concluded that Multnomah had never existed, instead showing that each volcano in the area possessed its own individual eruptive history.|$|E

5|$|By {{the winter}} of 1894–1895, {{the last of the}} four s had been commissioned; these ships were {{assigned}} to the I Division, which displaced Baden and her <b>three</b> <b>sisters</b> to the II Division. The eight ships conducted training cruises over the winter and spring before conducting the annual autumn fleet exercises. On 21 June 1895, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal was opened for traffic, eight years after work had begun. Baden and her <b>three</b> <b>sisters,</b> along with dozens of other warships, attended the ceremonies. The major naval powers sent fleets to join the fleet review. The Autumn 1895 maneuvers simulated a high-seas battle between the I and II Divisions in the North Sea, followed by combined maneuvers {{with the rest of the}} fleet in the Baltic.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1886 maneuvers, Württemberg and her <b>three</b> <b>sisters</b> {{were removed}} from active duty {{to serve as the}} Baltic reserve division. In June 1887, Germany {{dedicated}} the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal; Württemberg was among the ships present during the celebrations. The ship returned to active service with the fleet in 1890 when she joined the I Division during the annual maneuvers. Württemberg was commanded by Captain Alfred von Tirpitz during the exercises. The eight ships of the I and II Divisions simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel, which was defended by torpedo boat flotillas. Württemberg was in reserve during the 1891 maneuvers, but returned to the I Division in 1892, 1893, and 1894. By the winter of 1894–1895, the last of the four s had been commissioned; these ships were assigned to the I Division, which displaced Württemberg and her <b>three</b> <b>sisters</b> to the II Division.

5|$|In 2002, {{straight}} {{after finishing}} Cold Feet, Bathurst went straight into filming My Dad's the Prime Minister, a series {{in which he}} portrays fictional British prime minister Michael Philips. The first series was broadcast in a Sunday afternoon CBBC slot in 2003. He watched debates in the House of Commons {{to prepare for the}} role but did not base his portrayal on Tony Blair. In 2003, he returned to theatre {{for the first time in}} four years to play Vershinin in The <b>Three</b> <b>Sisters,</b> opposite Kristin Scott Thomas and Eric Sykes. He had not seen The <b>Three</b> <b>Sisters</b> before starring in it. Director Michael Blakemore advised him to turn this to his advantage, as he would not feel he had to live up to previous portrayals. After its run concluded, a special edition of The <b>Three</b> <b>Sisters</b> was filmed with the same cast for television broadcast on BBC Four. In 2005, the second series of My Dad's the Prime Minister was broadcast, now moved to a Friday night time slot to take advantage of the adult humour. The same year, he starred in the ITV thriller The Stepfather playing Christopher Veazey, a man whose daughter goes missing. Bathurst was pleased that this white-collar worker had an emotional side, in comparison to David Marsden, whom he used as a yardstick when accepting those sorts of roles. Also in 2005, he played Mr Sesseman in an adaptation of Heidi and Dottore Massimo in The Thief Lord.|$|E

On 18 October, Regina Elena and her <b>three</b> <b>sisters,</b> along with three cruisers and several destroyers and torpedo boats escorted a convoy that carried half of the 2nd Infantry Division to Benghazi. When the Ottomans refused to surrender the city before the amphibious assault, the Italian fleet opened fire on the Turkish defenders at 08:00, while landing parties from the ships and the Army infantry went ashore. The Italians quickly forced the Ottomans to withdraw into the city by evening. After a short siege, the Ottoman forces withdrew on 29 October, leaving the city to the Italians.|$|E
