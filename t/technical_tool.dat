25|$|In 1927, Deming was {{introduced}} to Walter A. Shewhart of the Bell Telephone Laboratories by C.H. Kunsman of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Deming found great inspiration {{in the work of}} Shewhart, the originator of the concepts of statistical control of processes and the related <b>technical</b> <b>tool</b> of the control chart, as Deming began to move toward the application of statistical methods to industrial production and management. Shewhart's idea of common and special causes of variation led directly to Deming's theory of management. Deming saw that these ideas could be applied not only to manufacturing processes, but also to the processes by which enterprises are led and managed. This key insight made possible his enormous influence on the economics of the industrialized world after 1950.|$|E
500|$|Songs in Peking opera are proscribed {{by a set}} {{of common}} {{aesthetic}} values. A majority of songs are within a pitch range of an octave and a fifth. High pitch is a positive aesthetic value, so a performer will pitch songs {{at the very top of}} his or her vocal range. [...] For this reason, the idea of a song's key has value in Peking opera only as a <b>technical</b> <b>tool</b> for the performer. Different performers in the same performance may sing in different keys, requiring the accompanying musicians to constantly retune their instruments or switch out with other players. Elizabeth Wichmann describes the ideal basic timbre for Peking opera songs as a [...] "controlled nasal tone". Performers make extensive use of vocal vibrato during songs, in a way that is [...] "slower" [...] and [...] "wider" [...] than vibrato used in Western performances. The Peking opera aesthetic for songs is summed up by the expression zi zheng qiang yuan, meaning that the written characters should be delivered accurately and precisely, and the melodic passages should be weaving, or [...] "round".|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{research}} how pedagogues work with communication and technique within language development for children with special needs. It covers children with language disorder and language delay as well as children having a different language than Swedish as their native language. The main questions used are: What means of communication methods are the pedagogues using on their daily work with children with special needs and what methods are used in the preschool to support the children with the language development? What obstacles and possibilities do the pedagogues identify when it comes to use of <b>technical</b> <b>tools</b> and what holdbacks are identified in the preschools when it comes to use of <b>technical</b> <b>tools?</b> The identified conclusions were that the sociocultural perspective became the focus of argument throughout the study as it can be used to connect communication and language development. The method to get answers to the questions was to perform four interviews in different preschools. The preschools were located within different counties close to a major city. The aim was initially to see how preschools work with <b>technical</b> <b>tools</b> and language development with children. This purpose was revisited as several preschools do not use <b>technical</b> <b>tools</b> as portable reading devices as we initially thought. The performed interviews were influenced by the model of Bornholm and knowledge of how this model can be used in the preschool support to support the language development for the children. Keywords: communication in preschool, language development, children with special needs, first language, learning tablet and social context. ...|$|R
