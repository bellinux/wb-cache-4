5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> fairly unstable: it was once thought {{that they could not}} exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{crystalline}} binary compounds {{are known}} for samarium {{and one of the}} group-14, 15 or 16 element X, where X is Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb or Te, and metallic alloys of samarium form another large group. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> prepared by annealing mixed powders of the corresponding elements.

Devastated, Lisa runs to her room crying, while Bart is sent to his room by his parents for causing the incident.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a limited}} number of {{actinium}} compounds are known including AcF3, AcCl3, AcBr3, AcOF, AcOCl, AcOBr, Ac2S3, Ac2O3 and AcPO4. Except for AcPO4, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> similar to the corresponding lanthanum compounds. They all contain actinium in the oxidation state +3. In particular, the lattice constants of the analogous lanthanum and actinium compounds differ by only a few percent.|$|E

5|$|River {{dolphins}} are {{not very}} widely distributed; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> restricted to certain rivers or deltas. This makes them extremely vulnerable to habitat destruction. River dolphins feed primarily on fish. Male river dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate {{every two to three}} years. Calves are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. River dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.|$|E

They have similar implants to Scully's, and inform her that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> dying of cancer. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the Newport News shipyard and searches the Talapus. Armed men arrive and scour the ship, but Mulder manages to escape. That night, he discovers a warehouse where a craft is being fumigated by a hazmat team. Mulder believes the craft to be of alien origin, recovered by the Talapus.|$|E
5|$|Shaktas {{approach}} the Devi in many forms; however, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> {{considered to be}} but diverse aspects of the one supreme goddess. The primary Devi form worshiped by a Shakta devotee is his or her ishta-devi, that is a personally selected Devi. The selection of this deity can depend on many factors, such as family tradition, regional practice, guru lineage and personal resonance.|$|E

5|$|Some Peace dollars using a {{base metal}} {{composition}} were struck as experimental pieces in 1970 {{in anticipation of}} the approval of the Eisenhower dollar; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> presumed destroyed. This new dollar coin was approved by an act signed by President Richard Nixon on December 31, 1970, with the obverse to depict President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had died in March, 1969. Circulating Eisenhower dollars contained no precious metal, though some for collectors were struck in 40%silver.|$|E
