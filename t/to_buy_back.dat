5|$|A {{siege of}} the castle was started, but through papal {{intervention}} King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path. A commission was appointed to draw up an arrangement that would be acceptable to both sides. The resulting Dictum of Kenilworth offered the rebels the right <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> forfeited estates, at prices depending on their level {{of involvement in the}} rebellion. After initial resistance, the terms were eventually accepted. By the summer of 1267, the country was pacified, and this spirit of reconciliation would last until the 1290s. The Dictum of Kenilworth was later incorporated into the Statute of Marlborough.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century, Dinefwr Castle {{was built}} by Lord Rhys. The castle and grounds were seized by Henry VIII in 1531, and the estate owners, who changed their family surname to Rice, {{subsequently}} had <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> their property from the Crown. The family were elevated to the peerage of Great Britain as Baron Dynevor. Mary I is documented to have restored some of the land back to the Rhys family, {{but it was not}} until the reign of Charles I that the family fully regained their properties.|$|E
5|$|Lacking the {{financial}} means <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> their Woodland home, they rented the Steamboat House in Huntsville.

Until daughter Maggie took over as his personal assistant, his wife shouldered the duties. Even so, during this period, he managed to get the Confederate War Department to discharge all draftees from the Alabama-Coushatta tribe, which had distanced itself completely from the conflict.|$|E

25|$|The friary of the Order of the Holy Trinity, {{also known}} as the Trinitarians, was {{established}} in 1360. The order devoted a third of its income <b>to</b> <b>buying</b> <b>back</b> captives of the Saracens, during the Crusades. Their house was on the Wall Knoll, in Pandon, to the east of the city, but within the walls. Wall Knoll had previously been occupied by the White Friars until they moved to new premises in 1307.|$|R

Tōbei later rides into the marketplace on his new horse, eager to return home to show his wife. However, he visits a brothel and finds her working there as a prostitute. Tōbei promises <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> her honor. Later, the two return to Nakanogō, Tōbei throwing his armor into a river along the way.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{took part}} in the Norman {{invasion}} of Ireland and in 1172 was made Lord of Meath; he spent much time away from Ludlow, and HenryII confiscated the castle in his absence, probably to ensure that Hugh stayed loyal while in Ireland. Hugh died in Ireland in 1186 and the castle passed to his son, Walter, who was a minor and did not take charge of the property until 1194. During Prince John's rebellion against Richard I in 1194, Walter joined in the attacks against the prince; Richard did not approve of this and confiscated Ludlow and Walter's other properties. Walter de Lacy offered <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> his land for 1,000marks, but the offer was rejected until in 1198 the vast sum of 3,100marks was finally agreed.|$|E
5|$|Many in the {{conservation}} movement urged the state <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> the land, {{especially after the}} Curtiss-Wright lease was canceled. In April 1967 Penn State vacated the site and gave the reactor complex to the state. Martin Marietta departed in June 1967, and early in that same year, Pennsylvania bought the remaining land back from Curtiss-Wright for $992,500, about $811,000 more than they had sold it for in 1955. Various usage plans for the area were proposed, including: a vacation resort with a large artificial lake, motels, golf courses, and honeymoon resort; a Penn State game preserve stocked with exotic animals like bison and boar; a large youth camp for several hundred children; and a radioactive waste disposal site. By November 1967, all of the land {{was back in the}} state forests and state game lands.|$|E

5|$|Moran {{introduced}} and supported legislation to increase benefits {{and pay for}} federal workers, {{in part due to}} the Federal Government’s large presence within the 8th District – 114,000 federal employees work within its bounds. He introduced a bill signed into law that allows FERS employees <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> credit from a lapse in federal service toward annuity payments, with the goal of attracting individuals from the private sector back to public service. Moran also authored a law that allows a federal worker’s unused sick leave to count toward their annuity. In the 112th Congress, he also spoke against attempts by Republicans to cut back the size of the federal workforce.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1993, the {{municipal}} council {{voted in favor}} of purchasing the stadium. The proposal was supported by the Labour Party and Centre Party, who had 28 of 49 councilors, but opposed {{by the rest of the}} council. Along with two banks, {{the municipal}}ity established a limited company which would own the venue. The municipality and banks would pay for the club's debt of NOK5.4 million, and take over the stadium's operating costs of roughly NOK1 million per year. Ham-Kam would have to pay rent on the stadium. The transaction took place on 26 January 1994, and included a clause granting Ham-Kam the right <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> the stadium at a later date. The municipality issued a loan of NOK4 million to Ham-Kam in 2003 to allow them to install floodlighting at Briskeby.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} pitched to several studios, {{and the only}} {{interested}} studio was Focus Features, who wanted to film it in Canada. After the studio attempted to have the film be centered on the character Richard Hoover, and Arndt disagreed, he was fired and replaced by another writer. The new writer added several scenes, including Richard's confrontation with the character who dismisses his motivational technique business. A corporate change brought in a new studio head and Arndt was rehired when the new writer left after four weeks of rewriting the script. After two years of pre-production, Focus Features dropped the film in August 2004. Marc Turtletaub paid $400,000 to Focus Features <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> {{the rights to the}} film and for development costs. He also paid for the $8million budget, allowing Little Miss Sunshine to then be filmed.|$|E

5|$|The royals {{were eager}} to settle scores after Montfort’s defeat. At the Parliament at Winchester in September the same year, all those who had taken part in the {{rebellion}} were disinherited. Yet even though the uprising of the younger Simon Montfort in Lincolnshire was over by Christmas, scattered resistance remained. The main problem was the garrison encamped at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle, and a siege started {{in the summer of}} 1266 seemed futile. By the end of October, the royals drew up the so-called Dictum of Kenilworth, whereby rebels were allowed <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> their land at prices dependent on their level of involvement in the rebellion. The defenders of the castle turned down the offer at first, {{but by the end of}} the year conditions had become intolerable, and in 1267 the Dictum was agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|Manuel's {{attention}} was again drawn to Antioch in 1156, when Raynald of Châtillon, the new Prince of Antioch, {{claimed that the}} Byzantine emperor had reneged on his promise to pay him a sum of money and vowed to attack the Byzantine province of Cyprus. Raynald arrested {{the governor of the}} island, John Komnenos, who was a nephew of Manuel, and the general Michael Branas. The Latin historian William of Tyre deplored this act of war against fellow Christians and described the atrocities committed by Raynald's men in considerable detail. Having ransacked the island and plundered all its wealth, Raynald's army mutilated the survivors before forcing them <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> their flocks at exorbitant prices with what little they had left. Thus enriched with enough booty to make Antioch wealthy for years, the invaders boarded their ships and set sail for home.* T. F. Madden, The New Concise History of the Crusades, 65 Raynald also sent some of the mutilated hostages to Constantinople as a vivid demonstration of his disobedience and his contempt for the Byzantine emperor.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{with the}} Welsh Wars, Hereford was also {{struggling}} to assert his claims to {{lands in the}} Marches against other Marcher lords. In 1284 Edward I granted the hundred of Iscennen in Carmarthenshire to John Giffard. Hereford believed the land belonged to him by right of conquest, and started a campaign to win the lands back, but the king took Giffard's side. Problems also arose with the earl of Gloucester. As Gloucester's former ward, Hereford had <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> his own right of marriage, but Gloucester claimed he had not received the full sum. There was also remaining resentment on Hereford's part for his subordination to Gloucester in the 128283 campaign. The conflict {{came to a head}} when Gloucester's started construction of a castle at Morlais, which Hereford claimed was his land. In 1286, the Crown ordered Gloucester to cease, but to no avail.|$|E

Lacavera had called for the consolidation of WIND Mobile, Mobilicity, and Public Mobile {{in the past to}} better compete with the three major Canadian wireless companies, a plan rebuffed by both Mobilicity and Public Mobile. After it was announced that American carrier Verizon Wireless would be putting off and ultimately cancelling a decision on offering <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> Wind Mobile or Mobilicity, Lacavera announced that in addition <b>to</b> <b>buying</b> <b>back</b> a controlling share of Wind Mobile he remained interested in purchasing Mobilicity.|$|R

5|$|The current club {{ownership}} {{have stated}} that a larger stadium is necessary in order for Chelsea to stay competitive with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia, such as Arsenal and Manchester United. Owing to its location next to a main road and two railway lines, fans can only enter the ground via the Fulham Road exits, which places constraints on expansion due to health and safety regulations. The club have consistently affirmed their desire to keep Chelsea at their current home, but have nonetheless been linked with a move to various nearby sites, including the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, Battersea Power Station and the Chelsea Barracks. In October 2011, a proposal from the club <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> the freehold to the land on which Stamford Bridge sits was voted down by Chelsea Pitch Owners shareholders. In May 2012, the club made a formal bid to purchase Battersea Power Station, {{with a view to}} developing the site into a new stadium, but lost out to a Malaysian consortium. The club subsequently announced plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge into a 60,000-seater stadium.|$|E
5|$|Various {{other plans}} were {{considered}} to address the debt issues during the first session of Congress, but none were able to generate widespread support. In September 1789, with no resolution in sight and the close of that session drawing near, Congress directed Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to prepare a report on credit. In his Report on the Public Credit (the first of three fiscal and economic policy reports), Hamilton called for the federal assumption of state debt and the mass issuance of federal bonds. Hamilton believed that these measures would restore the ailing economy, ensure a stable and adequate money stock, and {{make it easier for}} the federal government to borrow during emergencies such as wars. He also proposed redeeming the promissory notes issued by the Continental Congress during the American Revolution at full value. Many former soldiers had sold their notes at a fraction of face value, believing them to be worthless. He planned <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> the promissory notes from their current holders. This idea drew loud objections from many who were of the opinion that the notes should be paid back either to the original holder or to both the current and original holder.|$|E
5|$|Cope's {{relations}} with Marsh {{turned into a}} competition for fossils between the two, known today as the Bone Wars. The conflict's seeds began upon the men's return to the United States in the 1860s. Cope introduced his colleague to the marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site. Marsh went behind Cope's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that Vorhees's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven. When Marsh was at Haddonfield examining one of Cope's fossil finds—a complete skeleton of a large aquatic plesiosaur, Elasmosaurus, that had four flippers and a long neck—he commented that the fossil's head was on the wrong end, evidently stating that Cope had put the skull {{at the end of}} the vertebrae of the tail. Cope was outraged and the two argued for some time until they agreed to have Leidy examine the bones and determine who was right. Leidy came, picked up the head of the fossil and put it on the other end. Cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on the fossil with the error at the American Philosophical Society. He immediately tried <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>back</b> the copies, but some remained with their buyers (Marsh and Leidy kept theirs). The whole ordeal might have passed easily enough had Leidy not exposed the cover-up at the next society meeting, not to alienate Cope, but only in response to Cope's brief statement where he never admitted he was wrong. Cope and Marsh would never talk to each other amicably again, and by 1873, open hostility had broken out between them.|$|E
