5|$|Western artists often infused Euro-American {{characteristics}} in their {{depictions of the}} dogs of Polynesia and possibly many actually depicted the pet dogs kept on European ships rather than native breeds. This resulted in few accurate depictions of the dogs surviving. A few works likely depicting the aboriginal dog breed done by Parkinson, Webber, Alexander Buchan and John Frederick Miller were compiled by American anthropologist Katharine Luomala including the <b>two</b> <b>images</b> above.|$|E

5|$|A {{limited edition}} retail {{version of the}} PC game was {{released}} in April 2011. It included bonuses such as behind-the-scenes videos, a sample disc of the game's music, and a Super Meat Boy comic. In 2012 Team Meat began prototyping an iOS and Android version of the game. The game {{is intended to be}} a different take on the Super Meat Boy concept that is more adapted to touch-screen controls than a direct port would be. Later Team Meat released <b>two</b> <b>images</b> of the new game one with the new graphics and other with the new chapter named The Green Hills.|$|E

It appeared on commemorative coins issued to mark its 1986 centennial, and on New York's 2001 {{entry in the}} state quarters series. An image of the statue was chosen for the American Eagle platinum bullion coins in 1997, and it {{was placed on the}} reverse, or tails, side of the Presidential Dollar series of circulating coins. <b>Two</b> <b>images</b> of the statue's torch appear on the current ten-dollar bill.

In the other, the subject's right leg is raised to provide a clearer view of the genitalia. Another image presents the subject lying back with one arm covering the face while someone else's hand pulls on the penile tissue. A similar photograph shows the subject in an examination position, with a hand– visible in the uncut photographic plate as belonging to Maisonneuve– spreading the vaginal lips. The series also includes a close-up of the subject's genitalia, with the legs open.|$|E
5|$|The Borodino {{class were}} {{originally}} fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric rangefinders that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the crow's nest, {{to estimate the}} range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He then transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire-control transmission system to each gun or turret. While fitting out, these rangefinders were replaced on the first four ships by two Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinders that used <b>two</b> <b>images</b> {{that had to be}} superimposed to derive the range. Perepelkin telescopic sights were also installed for their guns, but their crews were not trained in how to use them.|$|E
5|$|When {{juxtaposed}} together, Stelae 15 and 12 {{offer up}} <b>two</b> <b>images</b> of a {{what it means}} to be a genuine king. Stela 15 shows K'inich Yat Ahk II as a devout practitioner of religious rituals, doing his sacred duty. On the other hand, Stela 12 shows the ajaw as a victorious military chief, defeating enemies and taking captives. O'Neil argues that their presence on the upper terrace of the O-13 pyramid is similar to how the images of previous kings of Piedras Negras were serialized. In addition, both Stelae 15 and 12 include the names of several sculptors and artists, one of whom worked on both stelae. These names are difficult to translate because many are unique when compared to extant Mayan glyphic texts.|$|E

There are also <b>two</b> tertiary <b>images</b> (replacing the mass lost by the secondary <b>images),</b> <b>two</b> quaternary <b>images</b> (replacing the mass lost by the tertiary images), and so on ad infinitum.|$|R

5|$|When lasers {{were first}} invented, laser speckle was {{considered}} to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the grainy image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the <b>two</b> <b>images</b> results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a peak versus contour lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.|$|E
5|$|Expensive and {{elaborate}} ornamentation {{was an important}} part of a ship's appearance in the 1660s, even though it had been simplified since the early 17th century. Such ornamentation was believed to enhance the authority of absolute monarchs and to portray the ship as a symbol of martial prowess and royal authority. There are no contemporary illustrations of the ornamentation of Kronan, but according to common practice it was most lavish on the transom, the flat surface facing aft. There are <b>two</b> <b>images</b> of Kronan shown from the stern by two Danish artists. Both works were commissioned many years after the sinking to commemorate the Danish victory. Claus Møinichen's painting at Fredriksborg Palace from 1686 shows a transom dominated by two lions rampant holding up a huge royal crown. The background is blue with sculptures and ornaments in gold. Swedish art historian Hans Soop, who has previously studied the sculptures of Vasa, a prestige ship of Gustavus Adolphus's navy that sank only 20 minutes into her maiden voyage in Stockholm in 1628, has suggested that Møinichen may have intentionally exaggerated the size of the ship to enhance the Danish victory. A tapestry at Rosenborg Castle shows Kronan as a two-decker with a crown motif that is even larger than Møinichen's painting.|$|E
25|$|German imaging {{researchers}} Claus-Christian Carbon of the University of Bamberg and Vera Hesslinger of the University of Mainz performed {{further analysis}} of the Museo del Prado version, comparing it to Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, and in May 2014 speculated that, based on perspective analysis of key features in the images, the <b>two</b> <b>images</b> were painted {{at the same time}} from slightly different viewpoints. They further proposed that <b>two</b> <b>images</b> may therefore form a stereoscopic pair, creating the illusion of 3-dimensional depth, when viewed side by side.|$|E

25|$|Distortion {{corrections}} {{account for}} field nonuniformities of the scanner. One method, as described before, {{is to use}} shimming coils. Another is to recreate a field map of the main field by acquiring <b>two</b> <b>images</b> with differing echo times. If the field were uniform, {{the differences between the}} <b>two</b> <b>images</b> also would be uniform. Note these are not true preprocessing techniques since they are independent of the study itself. Bias field estimation is a real preprocessing technique using mathematical models of the noise from distortion, such as Markov random fields and expectation maximization algorithms, to correct for distortion.|$|E
