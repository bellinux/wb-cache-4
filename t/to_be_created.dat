5|$|An {{elaborate}} and oppressive system of rules regulating {{every facet of}} Victoria's life, it kept her in reclusive isolation most of the time, {{with the goal of}} making her weak, compliant and utterly dependent upon her mother and Conroy.

The large island objects were broken apart to facilitate efficient rendering, which required them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>created</b> using polygonal geometry. All other objects were modeled using B-splines and NURBS.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo {{gravitational}} collapse to form a black hole. According to classical physics, these massive stellar objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>created</b> at the event horizon of these stellar remnants.|$|E

It was released worldwide in October 2008 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|From the {{coronation}} of Henry IV in 1399 the full ceremonies were restricted to major royal occasions such as coronations, investitures of the Prince of Wales or Royal dukes, and royal weddings, and the knights so created {{became known as}} Knights of the Bath.

5|$|In 1955, the {{district}} replaced the province as the country's main administrative unit. Ampara District {{was created in}} April 1961, followed by the creation of Mullaitivu and Gampaha districts in September 1978 through a new constitution, which also reintroduced the province as the main administrative unit. The last district <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>created</b> was Kilinochchi in February 1984, and the current constitution (that of 1978) states that the territory of Sri Lanka consists of 25 administrative districts.

5|$|Lesbians {{portrayed in}} literature, film, and {{television}} often shape contemporary thought about women's sexuality. The majority of media about lesbians {{is produced by}} men; women's publishing companies did not develop until the 1970s, films about lesbians made by women did not appear until the 1980s, and television shows portraying lesbians written by women only began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>created</b> in the 21st century. As a result, homosexuality—particularly dealing with women—has been excluded because of symbolic annihilation. When depictions of lesbians began to surface, they were often one-dimensional, simplified stereotypes.|$|E
