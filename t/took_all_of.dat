5|$|Byrd {{resigned}} from the presidency in January 1954 to embark upon an unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Maryland. He narrowly beat perennial candidate George P. Mahoney in the Democratic primary by 50.64% to 49.37% and faced Republican incumbent McKeldin in the general election. Byrd campaigned on his stance of separate but equal. McKeldin won comfortable majorities in Baltimore's black, Jewish, and upper-middle class white districts, while Byrd <b>took</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the blue-collar white South and East Baltimore neighborhoods, including McKeldin's boyhood home along Eutaw Street. Elsewhere in the state, however, middle-class white voters did not support Byrd. Byrd lost by 54.46% to 45.54%. He went on to make unsuccessful bids for the Democratic nominations to the U.S. Senate in 1964 and the U.S. Congress in 1966.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Aspern-Essling {{started at}} 2:30pm on 21 May. The initial and poorly coordinated Austrian attacks against Aspern and the Gemeinde Au woods {{to the south}} failed completely, but Charles persisted. Eventually, the Austrians managed to capture the whole village but lost the eastern half. The Austrians did not attack Essling until 6pm because {{the fourth and fifth}} columns had longer marching routes. The French {{successfully}} repulsed the attacks against Essling throughout the 21st. Fighting commenced by 3am on the 22nd, and four hours later the French had captured Aspern again. Napoleon now had 71,000 men and 152 guns {{on the other side of}} the river, but the French were still dangerously outnumbered. Napoleon then launched a massive assault against the Austrian center designed to give enough time for the III Corps to cross and clinch the victory. Lannes advanced with three infantry divisions and travelled for a mile before the Austrians, inspired by the personal heroics of Charles with his rally of the Zach Infantry Regiment (No. 15), unleashed a hail of fire on the French that caused the latter to fall back. At 9am, the French bridge broke again. Charles launched another massive assault an hour later and captured Aspern for good, but still could not lay claim to Essling. A few hours later, however, the Austrians returned and <b>took</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Essling except the staunchly defended granary. Napoleon replied by sending a part of the Imperial Guard under Jean Rapp, who audaciously disobeyed Napoleon's orders by attacking Essling and expelling all Austrian forces. Charles then kept up a relentless artillery bombardment that counted Marshal Lannes as one of its many victims. Fighting diminished shortly afterwards, and the French pulled back all of their forces to Lobau. Charles had inflicted the first major defeat in Napoleon's military career.|$|E

Sure enough, the carabao ate it, but his stomach couldn't handle the spoiled food, so he defecated, leaving behind him a mound of feces, until he had emptied his stomach of the food.

25|$|Gloucestershire resumed {{the second}} day on 28 for 1, and players from the Indian subcontinent were to {{dominate}} the day's proceedings, as they <b>took</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the thirteen wickets. Sussex' Pakistani spinner Mushtaq Ahmed took six for 65, while Rana Naved-ul-Hasan added three to his overnight tally of one to end with four for 53. No Gloucestershire batsman passed 50, as they trailed by 141 on first innings. Sussex took on seven overs from the seamers, before Michael Ball and Bandara started another marathon spell. The openers survived to pair up for 67, but then Bandara took a burst of wickets, finishing the day with four for 58 as Sussex closed {{the second day}}'s play on 128 for 4.|$|E
25|$|After the defeat, Richthofen {{travelled}} to see Hitler on 11 February. He {{first met}} with Göring, who {{was worried that}} Richthofen would use the opportunity to criticise his leadership. In the event he did not, but Richthofen did criticise Göring's reluctance to disagree with Hitler and attacked his willingness {{to allow him to}} receive what he considered to be faulty advice. When Richthofen did meet Hitler he criticised him openly for micromanagement, though he did insist he had been let down by his advisors. Hitler <b>took</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> this calmly, and admitted (as he had done to Erhard Milch) that he bore the ultimate responsibility for the air lift fiasco. Richthofen argued commanders needed more tactical and operational freedom, as had Manstein. Hitler agreed. Richthofen was probably helped, regardless of his criticism, by the fact that Hitler genuinely liked him, and believed him to be loyal. Four days later Richthofen was promoted to the rank of field marshall being the youngest officer beside Göring to reach this rank in the Wehrmacht.|$|E

She has also discussed how Jay-Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life. Beyoncé has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter [...] "what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music... he is lyrical and raw". In February 2013, Beyoncé said that Madonna inspired her to take control of her own career. She commented: [...] "I think about Madonna and how she <b>took</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the great things she achieved and started the label and developed other artists.

500|$|Just {{after dawn}} on 5 September, Engelbert Endrass--serving as first watch officer aboard U-47--spotted the SS Bosnia zigzagging {{and in a}} darkened state. [...] Prien {{surfaced}} and fired a single shot from his 88 mm deck gun to stop the ship but instead the Bosnia made steam and began radioing an alert ('SSS') along with its name and position. [...] Prien then immediately fired an additional four rounds of which three hit the ship, prompting its crew to abandon ship. [...] U-47 rendered assistance to the crew of Bosnia, bringing them aboard the submarine and helping {{to set up a}} lifeboat which had capsized during the crew's escape. [...] A Norwegian vessel also arrived and <b>took</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the survivors aboard. [...] Following its departure, Prien fired a single torpedo which wrecked the ship which sunk with its load of sulfur almost immediately. [...] The 2,407 ton Bosnia became the second British vessel, and first freighter, sunk after Athenia.|$|E

Board of Education Supreme Court decision. After their application to adopt a daughter from Kentucky's foster care system was denied because they already had five children, the Bevins adopted four children– between the ages of 2 and 10– from Ethiopia in June 2012. By 2015, Bevin said all of {{his children}} were homeschooled. To avoid disruptions in the children's schooling, the Bevin's opted not to move into the Kentucky Governor's Mansion immediately after Bevin's election as governor in November 2015, instead waiting until after the school year ended in August 2016.

500|$|When the Stork Club {{initially}} {{closed its}} doors, news stories indicated {{it was being}} shut because the building it occupied had been sold and a new location was being sought. The years of labor disputes had taken their toll on Billingsley financially. Trying to keep the Stork Club going <b>took</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his assets and about $10 million from his three daughters' trust funds. While in the hospital recuperating from a serious illness in October 1965, Billingsley sold the building to Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), who later turned the site into a park named after its founder's father. In a 1937 interview, Billingsley said, [...] "I hope I'll be running a night club the last day I live." [...] He fell just short of that mark. [...] One year after the Stork Club closed, Sherman Billingsley {{died of a heart}} attack at his Manhattan apartment, leaving a wife, Hazel, and three daughters, Jacqueline, Barbara, and Shermane. He was planning on re-opening the Stork Club in another location and was working on writing a book at the time of his death.|$|E
500|$|His {{style of}} play was hard on his left knee, leading to {{injuries}} and surgeries that shortened his career. The left knee <b>took</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the punishment and was operated on [...] "13 or 14" [...] times according to Orr. Orr was a left-hand shot who played the right side. He would race down the right wing with the puck and attempt to beat the opposing defenceman using his speed and strength. He 'protected the puck', leading with his left knee, and holding his left arm up to fend off opponents. This put him into a position where a hit by the opposing defencemen would often hit the left knee. Also, he would often end up crashing into either the opposing goalie, the net or the end boards. [...] "It was the way I played," [...] Orr has said. [...] "I liked to carry the puck {{and if you do}} that, you're going to get hit. I wish I'd played longer, but I don't regret it." [...] Orr stated in 2008. [...] "I had a style—when you play, you play all-out. I tried to do things. I didn't want to sit back. I wanted to be involved." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1986 to 1992 Hill {{was one of}} the world's top sport climbers, {{winning over}} thirty {{international}} titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, [...] "at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). [...] "It <b>took</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was so excited to get to the top... I proved a point about women and what we're capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route." [...] As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.|$|E
