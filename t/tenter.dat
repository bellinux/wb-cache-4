During the 2014-15 season, Marshall Plumlee gave tours of the most notable tents in K-Ville and interviewed tents' members in a mini video series called [...] "K-Ville Kribs."

His attitude betrays an overwhelming, gloomy anxiety which has him on <b>tenter</b> hooks. He pretends {{to be engaged in}} setting things ship-shape, but this occupation is confined to picking up some object, staring at it stupidly for a second, then aimlessly putting it down again.

5000|$|Tenterhooks are hooks in {{a device}} called a <b>tenter.</b> Tenters were {{originally}} large wooden frames which {{were used as}} far back as the 14th century in the process of making woollen cloth. After a piece of cloth was woven, it still contained oil from the fleece and some dirt. A craftsman called a fuller (also called a tucker or waulker) cleaned the woollen cloth in a fulling mill, and then had to dry it carefully or the woollen fabric would shrink. To prevent this shrinkage, the fuller would place the wet cloth on a <b>tenter,</b> and leave it to dry outdoors. The lengths of wet cloth were stretched on the <b>tenter</b> (...) using tenterhooks (hooked nails driven through the wood) all around the perimeter of the frame to which the cloth's edges (selvedges) were fixed, so that as it dried the cloth would retain its shape and size. In some manufacturing areas, entire tenter-fields, larger open spaces full of tenters, were once common.|$|E

By the 19th century, the site had been built upon with housing, but remained an enclave where the Dutch immigrants lived as a close-knit and generally separate community. Demolished and rebuilt during the twentieth century, the area is now bounded by White's Row, Wentworth Street, Bell Lane and Toynbee Street (formerly Shepherd Street).|$|R
