5|$|A two-part, feature-length {{version of}} Hogfather {{starring}} David Jason {{and the voice}} of Ian Richardson was first aired on Sky One in the United Kingdom in December 2006, and on ION Television in the US in 2007. Pratchett was opposed to live action films about Discworld before because of his negative experience with Hollywood film makers. He changed his opinion when he saw <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> Vadim Jean and producer Rod Brown were very enthusiastic and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Chen was {{appointed}} {{director for the}} upcoming film Li Shizhen. However, due to his insistence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>director,</b> rather than government administrators, have artistic control, he was dismissed and the film was directed by his friend Shen Fu.|$|E
5|$|When Refn {{read the}} first {{screenplay}} for Drive, he was more intrigued by {{the concept of a}} man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the story itself. Believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> might be intimidated by the script as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about Refn's desire to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.|$|E

50|$|So, in Mahoney, {{where the}} company's {{articles}} provided that cheques should be signed by any two of <b>the</b> three named <b>directors</b> and by <b>the</b> secretary, <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>directors</b> who had signed the cheques {{had never been}} properly appointed was held {{to be a matter}} of internal management, and the third parties who received those cheques were entitled to presume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>directors</b> had been properly appointed, and cash the cheques.|$|R
5|$|In 1960 Djajakusuma {{released}} his first film based on traditional wayang stories, Lahirnja Gatotkatja; the traditional puppetry had fascinated {{him as a}} child, and he greatly enjoyed the character Gatotkaca. Shot in Yogyakarta, the film featured a cast of stars from Jakarta and local talent in backing roles. It was, however, controversial: dhalang and others versed in wayang argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> had ignored too many traditional aspects of the puppetry. That year Djajakusuma also served as production manager for Ismail's Pedjuang (Warriors for Freedom) and directed Mak Tjomblang (Mrs. Tjomblang), a comedy adapted from Nikolai Gogol's 1842 drama Marriage.|$|E
5|$|Much of Savile's career {{involved}} {{working with}} children and young people, including visiting schools and hospital wards. He spent 20 years presenting Top of the Pops before a teenage audience, and an overlapping 20 years presenting Jim'll Fix It, in which he helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true. During his lifetime, two police investigations had looked into reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958, but none had led to charges; the reports had each {{concluded that there was}} insufficient evidence for any charges to be brought relating to sexual offences. In October 2012, it was announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Director</b> of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, would investigate why proceedings against Savile in 2009 were dropped.|$|E
5|$|Mystery Train was {{released}} theatrically by Orion Classics under a restricted rating in the United States, where it grossed over $1.5 million. It enjoyed critical acclaim {{on the film}} festival circuit, and like the director's earlier films premiered at the New York Film Festival and was shown in competition at Cannes, where Jarmusch was awarded the Best Artistic Achievement Award. The film was also shown in the Edinburgh, London, Midnight Sun, Telluride, and Toronto film festivals, and was nominated in six categories at the Independent Spirit Awards. Critical reaction was overwhelmingly positive, with reviewers praising the structure, humor, and characters of the film, though there was criticism <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> had not been sufficiently adventurous.|$|E
50|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{has also}} argued <b>that</b> because <b>the</b> <b>directors</b> were nominated {{by the various}} shareholders, if <b>the</b> <b>directors</b> were liable then it followed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shareholders should be vicariously liable. This point was not addressed at all by the Court of Appeal (even by May LJ who was prepared to accept <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>directors</b> might be properly liable in the assumed facts).|$|R

Isaacs was replaced as Provost in March 2016 by Daniel Diermeier.|$|E
5|$|While Sundaram is busy {{shooting}} for the climax {{scene of a}} film, his mother falls down the footsteps of her home and is badly wounded. Sundaram's manager Manickam tries to convey the news to Sundaram, but is blocked by the studio authorities who inform him <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> has instructed them not to allow anyone in there. After finishing his shot, Sundaram hears of the news about his mother and rushes home to learn that she is dead. At last realising the happiness he enjoyed as a waiter, Sundaram dons his hotel uniform again. He explains to Raghavan that the waiter's job is permanent, while the actor's was only temporary. Raghavan and Radha get married.|$|E
5|$|The first Springbok colours {{were created}} in 1906 during the 1906–07 South Africa rugby union tour of the Northern Hemisphere as none had been {{provided}} for them and the captain Paul Roos decided that the team need {{to create their own}} emblem and nickname to prevent the British press creating one for them. Using the guidelines <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> of the South African Rugby Board (SARB) had given for the playing kit of myrtle green jerseys and a gold collar, Roos instructed that a green blazer with gold piping and a Springbok emblem on the breast pocket would be made for the team in Richmond. Despite this, not many colours were made as they were not standard issue at the time. Later on they became standard issue for all sportsmen representing South Africa internationally but primarily was used by rugby union as the creators.|$|E

25|$|At RKO's request, Welles {{worked on}} an {{adaptation}} of Eric Ambler's spy thriller, Journey into Fear, co-written with Joseph Cotten. In addition to acting in the film, Welles was the producer. Direction was credited to Norman Foster.

5000|$|Dave Nusair of Online Film Critics Society grants <b>that</b> while <b>the</b> <b>director</b> [...] "generally does a {{nice job}} of {{capturing}} <b>the</b> awkwardness <b>that's</b> part and parcel with new relationships", the film itself [...] "has been suffused with a pervasively uneventful atmosphere that ultimately proves oppressive." [...] He points out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>director's</b> low-key approach [...] "wouldn't be quite so problematic had he managed to transform either of the central characters into fleshed out, thoroughly compelling figures", and that his inability to do so ensured [...] "that it becomes impossible to work up any interest or enthusiasm in Ben and Isabel's tentative romance," [...] due to the [...] "relentlessly superficial nature of their conversations". And toward sound quality, Nusair makes note <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>director's</b> use of actual locations drowned out much of the dialog.|$|R
50|$|The Government's {{response}} to the disaster was to reasonably promptly issue a Proclamation bringing the Act into force throughout the country on 28 February 1879. Attention in the newspapers of the time turned towards <b>the</b> <b>Director's</b> of <b>the</b> company, notwithstanding the Coroners Court finding negiligence by the Hodges. The newspapers pointed out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Director's</b> had left William Hodge, the Mine Manager, to do pretty much as he liked, had shirked their duty of care, and suggested the Government should examine them. The papers further suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Directors</b> had not done sufficient in determining Hodge's competency. Enabling the Mine inspectors was lauded and more inspectors were called for.|$|R
25|$|Another {{constitutional}} {{provision to}} be implemented by President Quezon's administration dealt {{with the question of}} The Philippines' national language. Following a year's study, the Institute of the National Language – established in 1936 – recommended that Tagalog be adopted {{as the basis for the}} national language. The proposal was well received, considering <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Director</b> – the first to be appointed – at the time, Jaime C. de Veyra, was an ethnic Visayan.|$|E
25|$|Chekhov {{originally}} intended the {{play as a}} comedy (indeed, the title page of the work refers to it as such), and in letters noted that it is, in places, almost farcical. When he saw the original Moscow Art Theatre production directed by Konstantin Stanislavski, he was horrified to find <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> had moulded the play into a tragedy. Ever since that time, productions have had to struggle with this dual nature of the play (and of Chekhov's works in general).|$|E
25|$|The LOE prescribes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Director</b> of a LLC may be sued by {{shareholders}} {{should he}} fail to perform his obligations and duties. In contrast, in a SC, {{there are no}} such provisions to grant the shareholders power to bring an action against Directors who do not perform their duties. While the law lays out the fiduciary duties of the Directors, it does not provide a way to enforce these duties. This has led to the criticism that the interests of shareholders of SCs are not adequately protected.|$|E
50|$|In another interview, <b>the</b> <b>directors</b> {{elaborated}} <b>that</b> {{in constructing}} <b>the</b> screenplay of the film, {{they take the}} superficial parts of real-life stories reported in the news media.

25|$|In an October 2008 {{interview}} Jack Fisk, {{a longtime}} Malick collaborator, suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> was attempting something radical. He also implied that {{details of the}} film were a close secret. In March 2009, visual effects artist Mike Fink revealed to Empire magazine that {{he was working on}} scenes of prehistoric Earth for the film. The similarity of the scenes Fink describes to descriptions of a hugely ambiguous project entitled Q that Malick worked on soon after Days of Heaven has led to speculation that The Tree of Life is a resurrection of that abandoned project.|$|E
25|$|In April 1936 it was {{reported}} that RKO had purchased the rights to the serialized story, The Big Game, by Francis Wallace, which had appeared in Collier's magazine. On April 8 RKO announced that Pandro Berman would handle the producing duties. Later that month RKO hired a young author, Irwin Shaw, to pen the screenplay. Shaw had just seen the successful production of his first play on Broadway, Bury the Dead. In June the studio assigned Nicholls to direct, shortly after renewing his contract. Also in June, it was announced that Berman would be the producer, although it was initially reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>director</b> would be George Stevens.|$|E
25|$|Weil (1898–1975), a young Marxist, {{had written}} his {{doctoral}} thesis (published by Karl Korsch) on the practical problems of implementing socialism. With {{the hope of}} bringing different trends of Marxism together, Weil organized a week-long symposium (the Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche) in 1922 in Ilmenau, Thuringia, a meeting attended by Georg Lukács, Karl Korsch, Karl August Wittfogel, Friedrich Pollock and others. The event was so successful that Weil set about erecting a building and funding salaries for a permanent institute. Weil negotiated with the Ministry of Education <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Director</b> of the Institute would be a full professor from the state system, so that the Institut would have {{the status of a}} University institution.|$|E
