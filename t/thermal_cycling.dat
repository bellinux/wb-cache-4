25|$|In {{the first}} step, the two strands of the DNA double helix are {{physically}} separated {{at a high}} temperature in a process called DNA melting. In the second step, the temperature is lowered and the two DNA strands become templates for DNA polymerase to selectively amplify the target DNA. The selectivity of PCR results {{from the use of}} primers that are complementary to sequence around the DNA region targeted for amplification under specific <b>thermal</b> <b>cycling</b> conditions.|$|E
25|$|The corium {{undergoes}} degradation. The Elephant's Foot, {{hard and}} strong shortly after its formation, is now cracked enough that a glue-treated wad easily separated its top 1–2 centimeter layer. The structure's shape itself is changed as the material slides down and settles. The corium temperature is now just slightly different from ambient, {{the material is}} therefore subject to both day-night temperature cycling and weathering by water. The heterogeneous nature of corium and different thermal expansion coefficients of the components causes material deterioration with <b>thermal</b> <b>cycling.</b> Large amounts of residual stresses were introduced during solidification due to the uncontrolled cooling rate. The water, seeping into pores and microcracks and freezing there, the same process that creates potholes on roads, accelerates cracking.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of PCR methods rely on <b>thermal</b> <b>cycling,</b> which involves exposing the reactants to cycles of repeated heating and cooling, permitting different temperature-dependent reactions—specifically, DNA melting and enzyme-driven DNA replication—to quickly proceed many times in sequence. Primers (short DNA fragments) containing sequences complementary to the target region, along with a DNA polymerase, after which the method is named, enable selective and repeated amplification. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a chain reaction in which the original DNA template is exponentially amplified. The simplicity of the basic principle underlying PCR means it can be extensively modified to perform {{a wide array of}} genetic manipulations. PCR is not generally considered to be a recombinant DNA method, as it does not involve cutting and pasting DNA, only amplification of existing sequences.|$|E
40|$|A radio {{frequency}} single-electron transistor (RF-SET) {{based on a}} silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate is demonstrated to operate successfully at temperatures above 4. 2 K. The SOI SET was fabricated by inducing lateral constrictions in doped SOI nanowires. The device structure was optimized to overcome the inherent drawback of high resistance with the SOI SETs. We performed temperature variation measurements after five <b>thermal</b> <b>cyclings</b> of the same sample to 4. 2 K {{and found that the}} single-dot device transport characteristics are highly stable.

25|$|PCR greatly amplifies {{the amounts}} of a {{specific}} region of DNA. In the PCR process, the DNA sample is denatured into the separate individual polynucleotide strands through heating. Two oligonucleotide DNA primers are used to hybridize to two corresponding nearby sites on opposite DNA strands in such a fashion that the normal enzymatic extension of the active terminal of each primer (that is, the 3’ end) leads toward the other primer. PCR uses replication enzymes that are tolerant of high temperatures, such as the thermostable Taq polymerase. In this fashion, two new copies of the sequence of interest are generated. Repeated denaturation, hybridization, and extension in this fashion produce an exponentially growing number of copies of the DNA of interest. Instruments that perform <b>thermal</b> <b>cycling</b> are readily available from commercial sources. This process can produce a million-fold or greater amplification of the desired region in 2 hours or less.|$|E

The new detector (a back-illuminated Marconi 2 K x 2 K detector) shows excellent quantum efficiency, and employs dual readout channels to keep the readout time as short as 20 seconds.

40|$|Recently, Chu {{announced}} {{the observation of}} sharp drops of up to two orders of magnitude in the resistance of several Y-, Sc- and La-based multi-phase Ba–Cu oxide samples at temperatures as high as 240 K.

In the absence of zero resistivity and evidence for the Meissner effect, the sharp resistance drops have been taken only {{as an indication of}} the possible existence of superconductivity at these unusually high temperatures. More recently, Chen et al. detected the reverse a. c. Josephson effect in mixed-phase Y–Ba–Cu oxide samples below 240 K, providing the strongest evidence for superconductivity to date.

40|$|Background: Certain {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the effects of mechanical and <b>thermal</b> load <b>cycling</b> on the microtensile bond strength (microTBS) of composites to dentin, but the results were different. The authors therefore decided to evaluate these effects on the bonding of Clearfil SE bond to superficial dentin. Materials and Methods: Flat dentinal surface of 42 molar teeth were bonded to Filtek-Z 250 resin composite by Clearfil SE bond. The teeth were randomly divided into 7 groups and exposed to different mechanical and <b>thermal</b> load <b>cycling.</b> Thermocycling was at 5 - 55 °C and mechanical load cycling was created with a force of 125 N and 0. 5 Hz. Then, the teeth were sectioned and shaped to hour glass form and subjected to microTBS testing at a speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The results were statistically analyzed by computer with three-way analysis of variance and T-test at P < 0. 05 significant. To evaluate the location and mode of failure, the specimens were observed under the stereomicroscope. Then, one of the specimens in each group was evaluated under Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) for mode of failure. Results: All of the study groups had a significantly lower microTBS as compared to the control group (P < 0. 001). There was no statistically significant difference between mechanical cycling with 50 K (kilo = 1000) cycles, and 50 K mechanical cycles plus 1 K thermal cycles. Most of the fractures in the control group were of adhesive type and this type of fracture increased after exposure to mechanical and <b>thermal</b> load <b>cycling.</b> Conclusion: <b>Thermal</b> and mechanical load cycling had significant negative effects on microTBS and the significant effects of mechanical load cycling started to be significant at 100 K cycles...|$|R

40|$|A nano-structure {{conductive}} coating was fabricated on a Crofer 22 APU alloy interconnect by an original coating strategy using Mn(0. 9) Y(0. 1) Co(2) O(4) (MYC) novel spinel nanocrystalline powder. A unique treatment {{method by which}} the spinel powder was reduced was used to prepare the green coating. The resulting coating was about 12 mu m in thickness, and was composed of MYC nanocrystalline with an average particle size of about 100 nm. The coating was well adhered with the substrate alloy. Less than 4 m Omega cm(2) of the area specific resistance (ASR) was obtained, and no obvious degradation was observed for a coated alloy (whose coating thickness was about 30 mu m) after operated at 800 degrees C for 538 h under seven <b>thermal</b> <b>cyclings.</b> The coated alloy exhibited excellently electrical performance and long-term stability compared with the uncoated one. The exploration of the novel spinel powder reduction coating technique for alloy interconnect to obtain cheap coatings with excellent microstructure and performance showed a promising prospect for the practical application of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (1) to evaluate the bond strength of four resin materials with various chemical compositions following the manufacturers' instructions only and (2) to test their durability in dry and thermal aged conditions when they were bonded to zirconia ceramic. Four types of resin materials namely, Panavia F 2. 0, Multilink, SuperBond and Quadrant Posterior Dense, were attached to the disc-shaped zirconia ceramics (LAVA, 3 M ESPE) using polyethylene molds and polymerized accordingly after the ceramics were wet ground finished and ultrasonically cleaned. The specimens were randomly divided into two groups for ageing conditions. While the dry groups were tested immediately after attachment of the resin cement, the other specimens were subjected to thermocycling (x 6, 000, 5 - 55 degrees C). Bond strength results were significantly affected by the storage condition (p +/- 0. 001) and type of resin (p < 0. 001; analysis of variance). Panavia F 2. 0 showed the highest bond strength results under dry conditions (9. 6 +/- 4. 1 MPa).
