5|$|Billy Smith of the New York Islanders, in the 1979–80 season, was {{the first}} goaltender to be {{credited}} with a goal in the NHL when Rob Ramage of the Colorado Rockies put <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> into his own empty net. Smith was the last Islander to have touched <b>the</b> <b>puck,</b> and by NHL rule 78.4, an unassisted goal is awarded to the last player on the scoring team who had contacted <b>the</b> <b>puck,</b> {{in the event of}} an own goal.|$|E
5|$|Eleven goaltenders {{have scored}} {{a total of}} {{fourteen}} goals in National Hockey League (NHL) games. A goalkeeper can score by either shooting <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> into the net, or being awarded the goal as the last player on his team to touch <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> when an opponent scored an own goal. A goal scored by shooting <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> is particularly challenging as the goaltender has to aim for a six-foot-wide net that is close to 180 feet away, while avoiding opposing defencemen; {{in the case of}} own goals, the combined circumstance of the own goal itself in addition to the goaltender being the last player to touch <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> makes it a very rare occurrence. Of the fourteen goals, seven were scored by shooting <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> and seven were the result of own goals.|$|E
5|$|As a goaltender, Lehman was {{a strong}} skater and good puckhandler. He chased down loose pucks, {{and was able to}} pass <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> to his forwards, {{surprising}} the other team's defenders. Playing in the OPHL, Lehman scored a goal by shooting <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> in the opponent's net. The first NHL goaltender to duplicate such a feat was Ron Hextall, who did it in 1987.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{rumors that}} Fox {{employees}} would sometimes {{go into the}} stands to retrieve a <b>puck</b> that left <b>the</b> playing area, <b>the</b> <b>pucks</b> were not re-usable, and only had a battery life of around 18 minutes. Cavallaro noted that <b>the</b> <b>pucks</b> had become prized by spectators.|$|R
50|$|Crossfire is a {{board game}} {{created by the}} Milton Bradley Company in 1971. The object {{of the game is}} to score goals by pushing one of <b>the</b> two <b>pucks</b> into <b>the</b> {{opposing}} player's goal. This task is accomplished by shooting small metal ball bearings at <b>the</b> <b>pucks</b> using <b>the</b> attached guns. The earliest version of the game featured a flat board, whereas the new board is dome-shaped. This causes the ball bearings to roll into the players' bins more easily, but can cause <b>the</b> <b>pucks</b> to indefinitely rest {{at the edges of the}} board.|$|R

5|$|During the 1999–2000 season, on February 15, 2000, Brodeur was {{credited}} with his second career goal, as Brodeur was the last Devils player on the ice to touch <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> before Daymond Langkow of the Flyers accidentally put <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> into his own empty net during a delayed penalty call against the Devils. Brodeur had previously stopped an attempted Flyers shot.|$|E
5|$|The first goaltender {{to score}} a goal by {{intentionally}} shooting <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> into the opponent's net was the Philadelphia Flyers' Ron Hextall, who on December 8, 1987, scored on an empty net after Boston pulled their goaltender, Rejean Lemelin, for a sixth attacker late in the third period. The most recent goaltender to have scored a goal by deliberately shooting <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> into his opponents' net was Mike Smith, in 2013.|$|E
5|$|A Ellis {{had not yet}} {{reached the}} bench to be {{replaced}} by an extra attacker (he even attempted to return to stop <b>the</b> <b>puck)</b> and thus the goal was credited as an official goal against Ellis, as opposed to an empty-net goal.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from his}} career in hockey, Ross was {{interested}} in improving the game. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1927–28 season, the NHL adopted a new style of goal net created by Ross. With the back molded into a B-shape, it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until 1984, when a modified version was adopted. He also improved the design of <b>the</b> <b>puck.</b> Ross' design had bevel edges, which prevented it bouncing too much, and used synthetic rubber, rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue. Along with New York Rangers coach Frank Boucher, Ross helped to create the red line, which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> from the defensive to offensive zone; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a two line pass. More scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> down the ice with impunity. In order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television, Ross suggested that the red line be striped.|$|E
5|$|Defensively he {{made use}} of poke checks to take <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> from his opponents and excelled at getting to loose pucks and {{clearing}} {{them out of the}} defensive zone. He was adept at keeping opposing forwards from creating offence from behind the net.|$|E
5|$|Jacques {{joined the}} Quebec Citadelles in 1947. It was while {{playing for the}} Citadelles that Plante started to play <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> outside his crease. He {{developed}} this technique when he recognized that the team's defense was performing poorly. Fans found Plante's unconventional playing style to be exciting, but it angered his managers. They believed that a goaltender should stay in net and let his players recover <b>the</b> <b>puck.</b> Plante {{had come to the}} conclusion that as long as he was in control of <b>the</b> <b>puck,</b> the opponents could not shoot it at him – this is now standard practice for goaltenders. The same season, the Citadelles beat the Montreal Junior Canadiens in the league finals, with Plante being named most valuable player on his team. The Montreal Canadiens' general manager, Frank J. Selke, became interested in acquiring Plante as a member of the team. In 1948, Plante received an invitation to the Canadiens' training camp. On August 17, 1949, Selke offered Plante a contract with the Canadiens' organization. Plante played for Montreal's affiliate Royal Montreal Hockey Club, earning $4,500 for the season, and an extra $500 for practicing with the Canadiens.|$|E

5|$|Thompson was a {{stand-up}} goaltender, rarely falling on both knees {{to stop a}} puck. He {{was one of the}} first NHL goaltenders to catch <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> with his hand to make a save, and helped popularize the technique. Using gloves that were smaller than those of other players, he was among the best puck-catchers of his era. He stood in the way of <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> with minimal padding, risking being struck when moving to catch it instead of simply deflecting it away from the net. His signature technique, very often featured in photographs of him, involved dropping to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the five-hole, and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> with his glove, he did so without gloves resembling the modern blocker and trapper glove combination. Thompson was described by Johnny Bower, a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as a good puckhandler, and one of the best of his time at forward passing. In the 1935–36 season, Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> with his stick to a fellow player.|$|E

5|$|For the 1947–48 season, defenceman Doug Harvey {{joined the}} team. Within {{a couple years}} Harvey would become the best offensive-oriented defenceman in the NHL and he and Bouchard would form a long-time and very {{effective}} defensive pairing. Whenever Harvey undertook one of the offensive rushes for which he became famous, he was confident {{in the knowledge that}} Bouchard was backing him up if he was to lose <b>the</b> <b>puck.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Leafs {{finished}} {{in first place}} {{at the end of}} the regular season. Kennedy had finished the regular season third in points on the team behind the other two star centers Apps and Bentley, but it was Kennedy who was to dominate the playoffs. In the first round Toronto played Boston and eliminated the Bruins in five games. Kennedy set up the tying goal which led to an overtime win in game 1 and scored four times in the second game. But it was in the fifth and deciding for which he received greatest praise for his fore-checking tenacity and clutch goalscoring. First, with Toronto down 2–1 and the Bruins having the better of the play, he out-fought two Boston players for possession to get <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> to Bentley who in turn set up Lynn for the tying goal. Then later, Kennedy was carrying <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> into the Boston end. He passed to Meeker, who returned the pass, Kennedy faked once, moved in front of the net, forced goaltender Brimseck to go down, then lifted <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> over him. In the finals, Toronto swept Montreal in four straight games to win the Stanley Cup. Kennedy scored twice in the Cup-winning game and finished leading all players in the playoffs in points with eight goals and five assists and he was also not given a single penalty in the entire playoffs. His checking and work in the corners has been credited as critical to the victory.|$|E
5|$|The score {{remained}} unchanged {{until the second}} period. Montreal held the advantage in play {{for much of the}} frame, taking 21 shots on Miikka Kiprusoff. They earned their only power play opportunity of the game midway through the frame when Jay Bouwmeester was penalized for interference. The Flames had the better chances despite being shorthanded; Curtis Glencross was unable to deflect a pass into the net while rushing towards the Montreal goal, but fought to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> and sent it back out front of the net, where Anton Babchuk snapped it behind Price to extend Calgary's lead to 2–0. Bourque made the score 3–0 with five minutes left in the period when he cut in front of Price from {{the left side of the}} ice and put <b>the</b> <b>puck</b> in before being sent airborne over the fallen goaltender's pads. The goal was the 100th of Bourque's career.|$|E
