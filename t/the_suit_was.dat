5000|$|... <b>the</b> old <b>suit</b> names <b>were</b> {{attributed}} to <b>the</b> new <b>suits</b> - this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reason why Portuguese names for <b>suits</b> don't match <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> drawings. In Portuguese, <b>the</b> Hearts <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Copas ("cups"), <b>the</b> Spades <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Espadas ("swords"), <b>the</b> Diamonds <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Ouros ("gold coins"), and <b>the</b> Clubs <b>suit</b> <b>is</b> called Paus ("clubs" [...] or [...] "sticks").|$|R

5|$|Carl Johnson sued Jefferson County for {{unlawful}} termination, {{after he}} was forced to resign from his position as Director of the Jefferson County Health Department.

5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E

As an example of modern {{body painting}} artwork, it raised the profile of Gair in pop culture as an artist in that genre.|$|E
5|$|In 1920 {{the heirs}} of Venancio Sanchez {{filed a lawsuit}} against James Deering, {{claiming}} an undivided half interest in his Cape Florida property. This brought development of the resort on Cape Florida to a halt. After many legal battles, <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> finally decided in Deering's favor by the United States Supreme Court in 1926. The decision came too late for Deering; he had died the previous year.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Elissa Wall filed {{a multimillion-dollar}} {{lawsuit against the}} FLDS, Warren Jeffs, and the UEP Trust with the {{expressed}} intention to assist {{other members of the}} FLDS in leaving the community. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> ongoing for several years afterwards, and a CPA filed a counter-lawsuit in response, charging that Wall's family, not the FLDS or the UEP Trust, was responsible for her underage marriage.

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Lincoln Center campus {{and some of the}} Upper West Side community residents have been strained, over campus development. In 2010 the New York State Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit against Fordham brought by the Alfred Condominium Complex. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> filed in response to the University's expansion plans at Lincoln Center and their expected visual and auditory impact on the surrounding community. The Lincoln Center campus does, however, have a lively connection to the artistic scene in Manhattan through its dance and theater productions and visual art exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{brought by}} John Blacksmith in 1846. Represented by lawyer John H. Martindale, Blacksmith sued Joseph Fellows and Robert Kendle, {{agents of the}} Land Company, for the torts of assault and battery and trespass, quare clausum fregit, with the sawmill as the locus in quo.

5|$|Tupper's role as {{the founder}} of the first {{university}} dedicated to educating freedmen attracted opposition. During the Reconstruction era, his home was burned to the ground by the Ku Klux Klan. He and his wife fled and hid in a nearby cornfield. In 1870 the trustees of the local Second Baptist Church of Raleigh sued Tupper on charges of defrauding its members in relation to his fundraising for Shaw College. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> settled in his favor in 1875.|$|E
5|$|Upon its publication, {{the book}} {{received}} favorable comments from book reviewers. Thompson later {{claimed that the}} Navy tried to suppress sales by banning the book from Navy exchange stores on Navy bases throughout the world. In 2001, five Navy servicemen named in Thompson's book sued Thompson, the book's publisher, and one of Thompson's sources for libel, false light privacy, and conspiracy. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> settled out-of-court in 2007 for undisclosed terms.|$|E

5|$|Wizards of the Coast {{was founded}} by Peter Adkison in 1990 just outside Seattle, Washington, and its current {{headquarters}} are located in nearby Renton. Originally the company only published role-playing games such as the third edition of Talislanta and its own The Primal Order. The 1992 release of The Primal Order, a supplement designed for use with any game system, brought legal trouble with Palladium Books suing for references to Palladium's game and system. <b>The</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> settled in 1993.|$|E
5|$|A {{request by}} the state to dismiss <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> denied in August 1966, and the case was {{eventually}} heard {{by the state}} Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. In the meantime, the state built the easternmost mile (1.6km) of the new alignment, which was not affected by the lawsuit. On July7, 1967, the court ruled 6â€“1 in favor of the Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely. The new alignment of NY117 was completed in November1970 and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY448.|$|E
5|$|Given Armstrong's concerns, the {{administration}} employed general counsel J. Patrick Abell {{to file a}} friendly test case to determine {{the constitutionality of the}} incentive package. While <b>the</b> <b>suit</b> <b>was</b> pending, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported that {{the administration}} had failed to include the interest on the bonds used to finance the expenditures in its estimation of the cost; this, plus the cost overruns reported by the Herald-Leader, had already pushed the total cost of the package to about $354million by late September 1986. In October, Toyota agreed to cover the cost overruns associated with preparing the site for construction.|$|E
