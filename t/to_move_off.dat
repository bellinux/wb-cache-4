5|$|Katherine {{continues}} to pursue Mike, believing {{that he is}} {{still in love with}} her. Mike warns her to leave his family alone and claims he never truly loved her. After he leaves, Katherine calls 9-1-1 asking for an ambulance, and then stabs herself with a knife with Mike's fingerprints on it. Katherine frames Mike for her wound. Susan, realizing that Katherine has suffered a total nervous breakdown, calls Katherine's daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca), who comes to town and has her mother committed for psychiatric observation. Susan later forgives Katherine once she recovers from her breakdown. Soon after, Mike reveals that he has accumulated an immense debt in the past year. Unable to balance their debt, Susan and Mike decide <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>off</b> Wisteria Lane and rent their house out temporarily. They move into an apartment across town while Paul Young rents their house on Wisteria Lane.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st century the club {{struggled}} financially, paying players £10-a-week and manager Dennis Newall became the first unpaid manager at senior level in Scottish football. As a result, the club ranked last in the Scottish Football League for five consecutive seasons from 2002–03 to 2006–07, losing 24 consecutive league games in the 2003–04 season, recording only 8 points from two wins and two draws in 36 games. From the 2005–06 season, it was determined if a club finished bottom of the Third Division twice in successive years, it would face the risk of being reduced to associate member status, meaning the loss of voting rights. In East Stirlingshire's case, a league vote was held and concluded in favour of the club retaining full member status with the condition that it did not finish last the following season in 2008. The club won its final game of the season <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>off</b> the bottom of the table in a 3–1 win against Montrose, which was also the last game at Firs Park. The following season, retaining full member status, the club moved to Ochilview Park in a ground-share agreement with neighbours Stenhousemuir.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant-Colonel Otway, {{who wrote}} an {{official}} {{history of the}} British airborne forces during World War II, stated that Operation Varsity highlighted the vulnerability of glider-borne units. While they arrived in complete sub-units and were able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>off</b> more quickly than airborne troops dropped by parachute, the gliders were easy targets for anti-aircraft fire and short-range small-arms fire once landed; Otway concluded that in any future operations, troops dropped by parachute should secure landing zones prior {{to the arrival of}} glider-borne units. Thus, by having the landings conducted during daylight to ensure greater accuracy, the Allied planners incurred a far greater casualty rate, particularly amongst the glider-borne elements. The operation also suffered from poor piloting. Although the piloting was of a better quality than in the Sicilian and Normandy operations, there were still significant failures {{on the part of the}} pilots, especially when it is considered that the drop was conducted in daylight. A significant error occurred when the pilots of the transports carrying 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment dropped much of the regiment several miles from their designated drop zones, with the mis-dropped units actually landing in the British landing zones.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{cause of}} the riot has been disputed – some sources {{indicate}} it was caused by an unprovoked baton charge by the police, while others indicate that strikers attempted to stop trams traveling through the square. Pitched battles took place between police and strikers in the streets around the square. Iron palings were pulled up and used as a defence against the police truncheons, while bottles were mobilised from a passing lorry to serve as missiles. The police's efforts to disperse the crowd from the Square were unsuccessful. Eventually there was a re-grouping and the workers began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>off</b> from George Square to march towards Glasgow Green. Police were again unsuccessful {{in their attempts to}} disperse the strikers.|$|E

In 1963 Stephenson established that the bus company was indeed operating a colour bar and inspired by the example of Rosa Parks' refusal <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>off</b> a [...] "whites only" [...] bus seat in Montgomery, Alabama, leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a Bristol bus boycott was organised.|$|E

[...] Though there were many visitors, Morenz often found himself alone in the hospital room, unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>off</b> his bed. To pass the time, he read newspapers to stay up to date with the Canadiens as they finished the season. Since his injury, the team had dropped in the standings, causing Morenz to worry. He began to think he would never play hockey again and became depressed.|$|E
500|$|A {{few moments}} after {{beginning}} the display, and while still ascending, the balloon {{was seen to}} be in flames. Some reports say that the balloon momentarily disappeared behind a cloud and that when it reappeared it was on fire—whatever the circumstances, the gas in the balloon was burning. Blanchard began to descend rapidly, but the balloon, caught in the wind, continued <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>off</b> from the pleasure gardens even as it went down. Some spectators thought these events {{were part of the}} show and applauded and shouted their approval. The balloon had not risen very high and, although the escaping gas was burning, the gas within the balloon maintained sufficient lift for a while to prevent the craft plummeting directly to the ground. By rapidly shedding ballast Blanchard was able to slow the descent. Most reports say she appeared to be calm during the descent, but she was said to be wringing her hands in despair as the craft approached the ground. Rumours later circulated that she had gripped the chair of her craft so tightly that [...] "several arteries had snapt through the effort." ...|$|E

500|$|Dilkes, {{instead of}} {{following}} Browne's route up the slope, {{advanced to the}} right where there was more cover and ground not visible to the French. [...] As a result, the French artillery could not be brought to bear, and Dilkes's brigade managed to get {{near the top of}} the ridge without suffering serious loss. [...] By this time, though, its formation had become disorganised, so Ruffin deployed four battalion columns in an attempt to sweep both Dilkes and the remaining [...] "Flankers" [...] back down the slope. Contrary to French expectations, the crude British line stopped the attacking columns in their tracks, and the two forces exchanged fire. [...] Marshal Victor, by then himself on the crest of the ridge, brought up his reserve in two battalion columns of grenadiers. [...] These columns were, as with the previous four, subjected to intense musket fire and were brought to a halt just metres from the British line. [...] The first four columns had started to give ground, so Victor tried to disengage his reserves and bring them to their support. [...] However, as the two grenadier columns attempted <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>off</b> from their stalled positions, they came under additional fire from the remnants of Browne's battalion, which had renewed its own advance. [...] Prevented from rallying, the entire French force broke and fled to the valley below.|$|E

Weather conditions {{at the start of the}} race were dry and sunny with an air temperature ranging from [...] and a track temperature of a 90 percent chance of rain was forecast. 21,000 people attended the race. The race began at 16:00 Argentina Time (...) [...] When the race started, di Grassi maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first turn. Vergne fended off an attempt by Buemi to keep second place. Rosenqvist made a fast getaway, overtaking Evans and Prost and challenged Piquet for fifth position. The full course yellow was necessitated when Carroll was unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>off</b> his starting position but was able to restart his car as the field approached to lap him, and was ordered by his team to catch up to all the drivers but was required to abide by the full course yellow speed limit. At the end of the first lap, di Grassi led from Vergne, Buemi, Turvey, Piquet, Rosenqvist, Prost, d'Ambrosio, Bird, Evans, Sarrazin, Heidfeld, Duval, Frijns, Abt, Félix da Costa, López, Engel, Ma and Carroll.|$|E
500|$|Returning to the Credit Mission, Jones {{believed}} {{the most pressing}} issue for the Mississaugas was their lack of a clear title to their land. [...] The settlement had established successful farms, and was almost self-sufficient. [...] It was also developing industry, {{with a pair of}} carpenters and a shoemaker. [...] The Credit Mission Mississaugas had also funded the construction of a pair of piers {{at the mouth of the}} Credit River, the beginning of Port Credit. [...] Although the settlement was prospering, Indian Superintendent Thomas G. Anderson pressured to band <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>off</b> the Credit Mission to a different location, hoping to group Indians into larger settlements where schools could be reasonably established and funded. [...] As an inducement to motivate the Mississaugas to move, he promised them the title deeds which were Jones' main goal for the band. [...] The Saugeen Ojibwa invited the Credit Mississaugas to move to the Bruce Peninsula, which was the last large piece of unceded land in southern Ontario. [...] The Credit Mississaugas believed this to be their best chance to obtain deeds to land, and so the band prepared for a move. [...] They turned the Credit lands over to the province in trust, but the first survey of the Bruce returned with terrible news: The soil of the Bruce Peninsula was completely unsuitable for farming. [...] Having already surrendered their land at the Credit Mission, the Mississaugas faced an uncertain situation. [...] The Six Nations, hearing of the Mississaugas' desperate situation offered a portion of their tract to the Credit Mississaugas, remembering that when the Six Nations had fled to Upper Canada the Mississaugas had donated the land the Six Nations. [...] The Mississaugas relocated to this land along the Grand River that was donated by the Six Nations. [...] Founded in 1847, the settlement was named New Credit. Jones would continue in his role as a community leader here, petitioning various branches of government for funding to build the settlement. [...] In 1848, the Wesleyans and Methodists reconciled, and William Ryerson established a mission in New Credit.|$|E
