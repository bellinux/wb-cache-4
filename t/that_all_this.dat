We looked at McLuhan as the theoretician–and {{we were the}} practitioners...We had a mission to bring about public {{awareness}} of the impact <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> instantaneous communication was having and was going to have–to attempt to be prepared for it and to change it if necessary.|$|E
25|$|Servetus {{also had}} very unorthodox {{views on the}} end times. He {{believed}} {{that he was the}} Michael referenced in both Daniel and Revelation who would fight the Antichrist. Furthermore, he believed <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> would take place in his lifetime. This possibly explains his decision to visit Calvin in Geneva. Servetus could have thought that he was somehow bringing about the beginnings of the end times by facing those who argued and fought against him.|$|E
25|$|Does not {{consider}} storm-absent survival of larvae: Admittedly, one study supported the SOH by documenting {{a correlation between}} increased daily mortality rates of first-feeding anchovy larvae and intervals of unperturbed, storm-absent conditions. Yet {{it is important to}} realize, as Peterman and Bradford did, <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> evidence does not affirm a certain relationship between larval survival and severe weather; this is particularly true given the lack of data regarding larval survival in the absence of storm events for context and comparison. Furthermore, Peterman and Bradford (1987) did not find a strong relationship between the larval survival rates documented adjacent to wind/storm events and recruitment levels observed months afterward.|$|E

25|$|A {{whiteboard}} grid {{is used to}} plan episodes a {{few weeks}} in advance, based on release schedules, events like E3, interviews, and other segments. They try to time reviews so they occur before or in the week the game is released, however, being a television show with a longer production period than most online content, {{this is not always}} possible. One challenge is having publishers provide games early enough to be reviewed and filmed in time. Often they receive debug code which can only be played on debug consoles, and developers are usually still working out kinks, so will provide a list of bugs for the team to take into account. Good Game also have to be wary of embargo dates as reviews can't be broadcast before then. Even if the embargo ends a few hours after a Good game episode, the review must be held back for a week. Sometimes, Good Game can only get a copy of the game after it is released, and Bajo points out that while this is sometimes due to random factors it can also be a sign that the game is bad. They try to avoid having too many of the same type of game in each week, and try to include games on all consoles. They hope <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> will ensure there is something for everyone.|$|E
500|$|Many at {{the time}} felt that Salisbury had been {{involved}} in the plot to gain favour with the King and enact more stridently anti-Catholic legislation. Such conspiracy theories alleged that Salisbury had either actually invented the plot or allowed it to continue when his agents had already infiltrated it, for the purposes of propaganda. The Popish Plot of 1678 sparked renewed interest in the Gunpowder Plot, resulting in a book by Thomas Barlow, Bishop of Lincoln, which refuted [...] "a bold and groundless surmise <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> was a contrivance of Secretary Cecil".|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{himself was}} {{ambiguous}} about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He {{wrote to the}} Dutch composer Julius Röntgen in 1909 [...] "I am surprised by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. What {{do you think about}} songs sung in unison? We must go back... to the pure and the clear." [...] On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 [...] "Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does... and it is impossible to deliver national music on request." ...|$|E

What's unfortunate, however, is <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> technical artistry is in the service of unremarkable themes and ideas." [...] Entertainment website The A.V. Club complimented the book, writing, [...] "perhaps taking his cues from his protagonist's profession, Whitehead keeps his prose as streamlined as it comes, and he uses it to craft a satiric novel in tune with a moment where marketing overshadows content and even the lowliest blogger thinks in branding terms." [...] Michael McGirr of The Sydney Morning Herald called it [...] "a book of abundant irony".|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the Millennium Group was a real-life organization called the Academy Group, which consisted of retired law enforcement agents working as a private investigative firm. Millennium creator Chris Carter {{had come to know}} members of the Academy Group through contacts he had made with the Federal Bureau of Investigation while researching his earlier television series The X-Files. The Academy Group focused on offender profiling, which shaped the main Millennium Group characters of Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). Describing his initial inception of the Group, Carter has stated [...] "they believe <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> random violence we see these days, there may actually be some order in the chaos [...] These guys think that, if they care enough, that they can stem the tide of this thing".|$|E

The Neighbours official website said Emilia's arrival would dig up a lot of secrets and she plays a [...] "pivotal role in Natasha's teenage angst." [...] Novakovic revealed Natasha and Emilia had met before, but Natasha was a toddler and does not remember her. The actress said Natasha and Emilia begin meeting each other in secret and get along well. Novakovic added [...] "Although when Tash mentions her mother, Emilia's reaction is quite strange.

500|$|The Post {{was worried}} about how the episode would affect Pakistan: [...] "This is going to ratchet up {{religious}} sentiments, and could lead to increased polarization between the moderates and extremists in the country, the former including General Musharraf {{under the banner of}} 'enlightened moderation'." [...] The Islam newspaper criticised the government, stating, [...] "The government cannot absolve itself of the tragedy. If it wanted, the matter could have been resolved at the start. But this was not done and, {{for the first time in}} the history of Pakistan, our own security forces not only bombarded a mosque and religious seminary, but also brought in armored personnel carriers, tanks and helicopter gunships in numbers that made you wonder. This shows <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> activity was masterminded by some satanic minds. This incident is tragic, shameful and dangerous. How much it has harmed the country and the nation, and how worse an impact it will leave on the country on the future, can at this point only be imagined." ...|$|E
500|$|For some time, it was {{doubtful}} that the match would be played at all. Shortly before the match, Fischer {{demanded that the}} players receive, {{in addition to the}} agreed-upon prize fund of $125,000 (5/8 to the winner, 3/8 to the loser) and 30% of the proceeds from television and film rights, 30% of the box-office receipts. He failed to arrive in Iceland for the opening ceremony on July 1. Fischer's behavior was seemingly full of contradictions, as it had been throughout his career. He finally flew to Iceland and agreed to play after a two-day postponement of the match by FIDE President Max Euwe, a surprise doubling of the prize fund by British investment banker Jim Slater, and much persuasion, including a phone call by Henry Kissinger to Fischer. Many commentators, particularly from the USSR, have suggested <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> (and his continuing demands and unreasonableness) was part of Fischer's plan to [...] "psych out" [...] Spassky. Fischer's supporters say that winning the World Championship was the mission of his life, that he simply wanted the setting to be perfect for it when he took the stage, and that his behavior was the same as it had always been.|$|E
500|$|August Strindberg was {{familiar}} with Either/Or and this book made him [...] "forever a champion of the ethical as juxtaposed to the aesthetic life conception and he always remained faithful {{to the idea that}} art and knowledge must be [...] to life, and that life itself must be lived as we know best, chiefly because we are part of it and cannot escape from its promptings." [...] Strindberg was obviously attracted to Either/Or Part II where Kierkegaard developed his categorical imperative. He wrote the following in Growth of a Soul published posthumously in 1913 about Kierkegaard’s Either—Or: [...] "it was valid only for the priests who called themselves Christians and the seducer and Don Juan were the author himself, who satisfied his desires in imagination". Part II was his [...] "Discourse on Life as a Duty, and when he {{reached the end of the}} work he found the moral philosopher in despair, and <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> teaching about duty had only produced a Philistine." [...] He then states that Kierkegaard's discourses might have led him closer to Christianity but he didn't know if he could come back to something [...] "which had been torn out, and joyfully thrown into the fire". However, after reading the book he [...] "felt sinful". Then another writer began to influence his life. This is how he described Either/Or: ...|$|E
