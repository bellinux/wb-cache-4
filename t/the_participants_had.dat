5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E
5|$|CMLL held a 15-woman torneo cibernetico {{elimination}} {{match on}} June 5, 1992 {{to determine the}} two women who would fight for the newly created CMLL World Women's champion the following week. La Diabólica was originally scheduled to work the match, but did not appear {{which led to the}} uneven sides in the elimination match. Several of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> recently joined CMLL, leaving the Universal Wrestling Association to join CMLL and its recently restarted women's division. Zuleyma was the reigning UWA World Women's Championship going into the match and CMLL allowed her to keep and defend the UWA championship in the years following Zuleyma's jump to CMLL. The finals came down to Lola Gonzales, a pioneer for women's wrestling in Mexico, and Bull Nakano, a Japanese wrestler that worked regularly for CMLL. The following week, on June 12, 1993 Bull Nakano became the first CMLL World Women's Champion by virtue of her victory over Lola Gonzales.|$|E
30|$|So, {{the rest}} of 210 (51.09 %) <b>participants,</b> who <b>had</b> publications, it asked for them to further fill out the {{information}} regarding the type of publications, they had. In response to this query 32.3 % of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> did not <b>have</b> any publication in internationally proclaimed Journals and 21.9 % of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> only one publication in internationality accredited Journals. Whereas, 13.8 % of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> two publications in international scientific Journals. Similarly, 41.9 % of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> did not <b>have</b> any publication in national impact factor journals somehow 20.9 % of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> only one publication and 12.3 % of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> two publications. At the same time, 93.8 % of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> haven’t published any book and 80.5 % of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>have</b> not written any chapter at all, in any book. Finding of this section somehow strengthens believe that women faculty member has published less. Some other studies also indicated that Jones et al. (2012) women faculty members found themselves more overburdened and they concentrate less on research. Another study revealed that in general faculties tend to publish less {{in recent years to}} highly competitive and specialized work. They tend to put more work in teachings as compared to research and publication unless they are appointed solely for research (Jones et al. 2012; Rajiv, Chu, and Jiang 2015).|$|R

However, food was delivered to the landfill on a weekly basis. A prize fund of £20,000 was shared equally between those who participated for the entire three weeks. Rob Holdway, director of environmental consultancy Giraffe Innovation, presented the programme and set the contestants regular challenges. <b>The</b> <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> to wear Kevlar gloves, protective boots and face masks when working on the real landfill site.

500|$|While delegates bickered in Prague, {{similar to}} the {{situation}} in Rastatt in 1799, the diplomats negotiated throughout the war zone and in the capitals of Europe, to create a new set of alliances. The subsequent Sixth Coalition (Russia, Prussia, Britain, Sweden and, eventually, Austria), differed significantly from the earlier coalitions. Unlike previous coalitions in which <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> organized their armies independently of one another, the Allies of the Sixth Coalition created multi-national armies. This theoretically accomplished two goals: Napoleon could not defeat them piecemeal, and the presence of soldiers from several states within a single armed force limited [...] "politically motivated acts of national self-interest." [...] Klenau, promoted to General der Kavallerie (full general) on 26 July 1813, held command of an independent corps in the Army of Bohemia. This Army of Bohemia illustrated one of the biggest differences in the Sixth Coalition's organizational schema: it included 127,435 Austrians, 78,200 Russians, and 44,907 Prussians.|$|E
500|$|In an August 30, 2009 Detroit Free Press article, several {{current and}} former players on the 2008 and 2009 teams {{speaking}} anonymously said Michigan frequently violated the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) off-season 8-hour-per-week and in-season 20-hour-per-week practice limit. Rodriguez denied all of the allegations {{at a press conference}} the next day; [...] The New York Times quoted him as saying [...] "We know the rules, and we follow the rules." [...] The University of Michigan Athletic Department's compliance office notified both the NCAA and the Big Ten Conference of its intentions to investigate itself. [...] Unlike the University of Michigan basketball scandal where all of <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> left the school by the time the investigation completed and punishment was handed down, many of the athletes involved in this scandal are still students at the University of Michigan; failure to cooperate with the investigation might result in the NCAA revoking the athletes eligibility to participate in athletic competitions. In November, the university revealed its finding that the team failed to file the proper paperwork to document the team's training schedule.|$|E
500|$|The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not {{agreed to}} by {{everyone}} that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes {{are not the same}} as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers on the idea that transgenderism and transsexuality have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals. Another problem associated is that people may not always identify with the given labels. One study conducted in Australia discovered that all <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> experienced microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours. However, not all of the participants believed their victimisation to be motivated by anti-LGBTIQ beliefs. What it did establish is that many of these microaggressions occurred due to misconceptions and conflicting opinions on what these labels entailed (in particular, transsexual and bisexual). Evidently, by placing blanket labels on many people, who all experience difference narratives, there are inconsistencies.|$|E

500|$|The {{first round}} was a [...] "never have I ever" [...] round, in which <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>had</b> {{to admit to}} {{experiences}} {{they had never been}} involved in. If the opponent had partaken in a similar action he was forced to drink a shot. Storm was the victor of this round. The second round was contested with both participants having beer bottles taped to their hands and neither being allowed to go to the bathroom. Young won after Storm wet himself, which was confirmed by Ms. Jackie, now named Jackie Moore. The third round involved the two drinking shots; it was won by Storm after Young passed out because Storm had drugged him. With Storm winning two contests to one, he earned the ability to determine their match at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008. At Against All Odds, Young defeated Storm to retain the TNA World Beer Drinking Championship after Rhino interfered attacking Storm. On the February 28, 2008 episode of Impact!, a Ladder match for the World Beer Drinking Championship was held between Storm and Young. Storm won the bout after Moore climbed a ladder and retrieved the championship for Storm without the referee seeing. On the March 6, 2008 episode of Impact!, Rhino stole the title belt from Storm and bashed the belt across a ring post, thus destroying it and ending the storyline surrounding it.|$|E
