40|$|Between June 1984 and April 1988, 41 {{patients}} with severe posttraumatic lesions of the cervical spine between the C 2 -C 3 and the C 7 -T 1 level seen consecutively were treated by an anterior cervical fusion and osteosynthetic stabilization according to Caspar. These patients were prospectively studied. Seven patients had a bilateral facet dislocation, 5 a unilateral facet dislocation, 9 an anterior subluxation, 9 an anterior compression fracture, 5 a hangman's fracture, and 6 a hyperextension injury {{at a lower}} cervical level. From a neurological point of view, there were 12 {{patients with}} an initial complete <b>transverse</b> <b>lesion</b> and 14 with an incomplete <b>transverse</b> <b>lesion,</b> and the remaining 15 patients {{did not have any}} deficit initially. Four patients died during the first 3 months after the operation. In 38 patients good anatomical position was obtained, generally by the intraoperative use of the vertebral distractor of Caspar. In all patients excellent immediate postoperative stability of the spine was obtained, although in 2 patients a second operation was necessary {{a few days after the}} first one. Postoperatively all patients were "immobilized" by a soft collar for 3 months. Four patients with an initial complete <b>transverse</b> <b>lesion</b> showed some neurological recovery in the postoperative period, and all patients with an incomplete <b>transverse</b> <b>lesion</b> improved. There were no postoperative neurological disturbances in the group of patients who were neurologically normal from the beginning. The mean postoperative hospitalization time was 13. 6 days.

40|$|Background: Transverse nasal groove is a {{condition}} of cosmetic concern which awaits due recognition and has been widely described as a shallow groove that extends transversely over the dorsum of nose. However, we observed variations in the clinical presentations of this entity, hitherto undescribed in literature. Aims: We conducted a clinicoepidemiological study of <b>transverse</b> nasal <b>lesions</b> in patients attending our outpatient department. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study. We screened all patients attending our out-patient department for presence of <b>transverse</b> nasal <b>lesions,</b> signs of any dermatosis and associated other skin conditions. Results: One hundred patients were recruited in the study. Females (80 %) predominated over males. Most patients were of 15 - 45 years age group (70 %). Majority of the <b>transverse</b> nasal <b>lesions</b> were classical <b>transverse</b> nasal groove (39 %) and others included transverse nasal line (28 %), strip (28 %), ridge (4 %) and loop (1 %). Seborrhoeic diathesis {{was the most common}} condition associated with <b>transverse</b> nasal <b>lesion.</b> Conclusions: Occurrence of transverse nasal line, strip, ridge and loop, in addition to classical transverse nasal groove implies that latter is actually a subset of <b>transverse</b> nasal <b>lesions.</b> Common association of this entity with seborrheic dermatitis, seborrhea and dandruff raises a possibility of whether <b>transverse</b> nasal <b>lesion</b> is a manifestation of seborrheic diathesis...|$|R

Appropriate technique is described in the ISIS guidelines [81] where emphasis is made on the electrode placement: parallel to the target nerve in order to achieve denervation along a substantial length of the targeted nerve [26]. These considerations seem more important to take into account with the RF technique than with CN, where circumferential lesions are less extensive than with cryoprobe [82]. RF probes produce <b>transverse</b> <b>lesions</b> around the electrodes, but little lesioning at the needle tip. Perpendicular placement may miss the targeted nerve [80].

40|$|Purpose: To {{retrospectively}} {{determine if}} pixel histogram analysis of unenhanced computed tomographic (CT) {{images can be}} used to distinguish angiomyolipomas (AMLs) with minimal fat from clear cell renal cell carcinomas (CCRCCs). Materials and Methods: The human studies committee approved this HIPAA-complaint study, with waiver of informed consent. Patients with pathologically proved AMLs lacking visible macroscopic fat at CT and patients with pathologically proved CCRCCs were included. Lesions were measured, and a histogram (number of pixels with each attenuation) was calculated electronically within a central region of interest. The percentage of pixels below the attenuation thresholds - 20 HU and 10 HU was calculated in both cohorts. The unpaired Student t test was used to compare the average percentage of subthreshold pixels at each threshold. P <. 05 indicated a significant difference. The number of lesions with more than the selected percentage of subthreshold pixels was calculated in both groups, and the chi(2) test was used to test the significance of differences between cohorts. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine if any percentage of subthreshold pixels could be used to differentiate between the two cohorts. Results: There were 22 patients with pathologically proved AMLs lacking visible macroscopic fat on CT images. Tuberous sclerosis affected three of these patients. Mean maximal <b>transverse</b> <b>lesion</b> diameter was 20 mm (range, 11 - 38 mm). There were 28 patients in the CCRCC comparison group. Mean maximal <b>transverse</b> <b>lesion</b> diameter was 26 mm (range, 15 - 36 mm). Neither the Student t test (P <. 2 for all thresholds < 0 HU) nor the chi(2) test (P <. 15 for all thresholds < 0 HU) revealed a significant difference between cohorts. A lesion with more low-attenuation pixels was significantly more likely to be characterized as CCRCC than as AML with ROC curve analysis. Conclusion: Once AMLs with visible fat on CT images are excluded, pixel histogram analysis cannot be used to distinguish between AMLs and CCRCCs. (C) RSNA, 2008...|$|E

A <b>transverse</b> <b>lesion</b> {{was made in the}} biceps femoris muscle (50 %). CTU (1. 0 MHz) was applied at 12 -hour intervals on the lesion, for three days, with 0. 4 W cm- 2 and three minutes of duration (six applications in the total). PTU was applied in the pulsed mode 20 % (2 ms on/ 8 ms off), maintaining the other parameters. Fibrinogen, white and red blood cells were analyzed in the 24 th, 48 th and 72 nd hour after the injury. PTU has reduced fibrinogen levels by 20 % at the 24 thh and by 30 % at the 48 thh (p < 0. 001) and haemoglobin reduction at the 72 nd hour (p < 0. 001), which had already occurred during the 2 nd collection in the other groups. CTU favoured erythrocyte reduction at the 48 th h (p = 0. 003). PTU presented an anti-inflammatory effect due to plasma fibrinogen reduction, and CTU favored haemorrhage due to the reduction of erythrocytes when applied in the first 72 hours after muscle injury...|$|E

40|$|Eight {{patients}} with traumatic <b>transverse</b> <b>lesions</b> of {{the spinal cord}} and eight healthy controls were examined {{with respect to the}} function of the anal sphincters. Continuous recordings of anal pressure and electromyograms from the striated sphincter muscles were obtained during gradual rectal distension by means of an air-filled balloon. The patients were more prone than the controls to display a cessation of all electrical activity from the striated muscles in response to rectal distension and they also exhibited a less pronounced inflation reflex. It is concluded that upon rectal distension in normal man the striated muscles are stimulated by a cerebral centre at an unconscious level as well as by a low centre of the spinal cord. The former accounts for an augmented inflation reflex and maintained or increased electrical activity when rectal distension is substantial. The smooth internal sphincter was found to be independent of cerebral influence at rest as well as during rectal distension...|$|R

Methods: This experimental study involved use of fifteen adult male New Zealand White rabbits. Each animal received a <b>transverse</b> <b>lesion</b> in the middle of the right tibialis anterior muscle, to which an absorbable collagen sponge, soaked in a centrifugate of bone marrow aspirate from the ipsilateral iliac bone, was added. The left hind limb was used as a control and underwent the same injury, but in this case only the absorbable collagen sponge. Thirty days later, the animals were sacrificed to study the muscle healing. These muscle areas were subjected to histological analysis with histomorphometry, with the aim of measuring the number of muscle cells per square micrometer undergoing regeneration and the proportion of resultant fibrosis. Results: The centrifugation method used in this study resulted in an average concentration of nucleated cells greater than the number of these cells in original aspirates, without causing significant cell destruction. Addition of the bone marrow centrifugate did not result in any significant increase in the number of muscle cells undergoing regeneration, in relation to the control group. There was also no significant difference in the proportion of resultant fibrosis, compared with the control group. Conclusion: Administration of the bone marrow centrifugate used in this study did not favor healing of muscle injuries in rabbits...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the outcomes of}} endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for colorectal polyps, with particular regard to procedural complications and recurrence rate, in typical United Kingdom (UK) hospitals that perform {{an average of about}} 25 colonic EMRs per year. METHODS: A total of 239 colorectal polyps (â¥ 10 mm) resected from 199 patients referred to Rochdale Infirmary, Salford Royal Hospital and Royal Oldham Hospital for EMR between January 2003 and January 2009 were studied. RESULTS: The mean size of polyps resected was 19. 6 Â± 12. 4 mm (range 10 - 80 mm). The overall major complication rate was 2. 1 %. Complications were less frequent with non-adenomas compared with the other groups (Pearsonâs Ï 2 test, P < 0. 0001). Resections of larger-sized polyps were more likely to result in complications (unpaired t-test, P = 0. 021). Recurrence was associated with histology, with carcinoma-in-situ more likely to recur compared with low-grade dysplasia [hazard ratio (HR) 186. 7, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) : 8. 81 - 3953. 02, P = 0. 001].

40|$|Abstract Sciatic nerve transection (SNT), a {{model for}} {{studying}} neuropathic pain, mimics the clinical symptoms of âphantom limbâ, a pain condition that arises in humans after amputation or <b>transverse</b> spinal <b>lesions.</b> In some vertebrate tissues, this condition decreases acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, the enzyme responsible for fast hydrolysis of released acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses. In spinal cord of frog Rana pipiens, this enzymeâs activity was not significantly changed {{in the first days}} following ventral root transection, another model for studying neuropathic pain. An answerable question is whether SNT decreases AChE activity in spinal cord of frog Lithobates catesbeianus, a species that has been used as {{a model for}} studying SNT-induced neuropathic pain. Since each animal model has been created with a specific methodology, and the findings tend to vary widely with slight changes in the method used to induce pain, our study assessed AChE activity 3 and 10 days after complete SNT in lumbosacral spinal cord of adult male bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus. Because there are time scale differences of motor endplate maturation in rat skeletal muscles, our study also measured the AChE activity in bullfrog tibial posticus (a postural muscle) and gastrocnemius (a typical skeletal muscle that is frequently used to study the motor system) muscles. AChE activity did not show significant changes 3 and 10 days following SNT in spinal cord. Also, no significant change occurred in AChE activity in tibial posticus and gastrocnemius muscles at day 3. However, a significant decrease was found at day 10, with reductions of 18 % and 20 % in tibial posticus and gastrocnemius, respectively. At present we cannot explain this change in AChE activity. While temporally different, the direction of the change was similar to that described for rats. This similarity indicates that bullfrog is a valid model for investigating AChE activity following SNT...|$|R

One of these models is the sciatic nerve transection (SNT), which mimics the clinical symptoms of &# 8220;phantom limb&# 8221;, a condition that arises in humans after amputation or <b>transverse</b> spinal <b>lesions.</b> In mammals, the SNT increases glucose metabolism in the central nervous system, and the lactate generated appears to serve as an energy source for nerve cells. An answerable question is whether there is elevated glucose uptake in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after peripheral axotomy. As glucose is the major energy substrate for frog nervous tissue, and these animals accumulate lactic acid under some conditions, bullfrogs Lithobates catesbeianus were used to demonstrate the effect of SNT on DRG and spinal cord 1 -[14 C] 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (14 C- 2 -DG) uptake in the presence and absence of lactate. We also investigated the effect of this condition on the formation of 14 CO 2 from 14 C-glucose and 14 C-L-lactate, and plasmatic glucose and lactate levels. The 3 -O-[14 C] methyl-D-glucose (14 C- 3 -OMG) uptake was used to demonstrate the steady-state tissue/medium glucose distribution ratio under these conditions. Three days after SNT, 14 C- 2 -DG uptake increased, but 14 C- 3 -OMG uptake remained steady. The increase in 14 C- 2 -DG uptake was lower when lactate was added to the incubation medium. No change was found in glucose and lactate oxidation after SNT, but lactate and glucose levels in the blood were reduced. Thus, our results showed that SNT increased the glucose metabolism in the frog DRG and spinal cord. The effect of lactate on this uptake suggests that glucose is used in glycolytic pathways after SNT...|$|R
40|$|The {{skeleton}} is {{the third}} most common site for metastasis of malignant carcinoma after the lung and liver, most frequently involving the ax-ial skeleton and the proximal ends of long bones, ribs, and vertebrae. 1 Acrometastasis, metastasis to hands or feet, comprises only 0. 1 % of all metastases. The distal phalanx is most frequently involved, followed by metacarpals and remaining phalanges. 2, 3 Acro-metastases typically arise from primary lung, kidney, and breast tumors in decreasing order of frequency. 3 Here, we report 2 cases of hand acrometastasis, one from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the other from renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Acrometastasis, a poor prognostic indicator of survival, requires the plastic hand surgeon to understand prognosis and treatment to appropriately manage these patients. CASE 1 A 30 -year-old man presented to the clinic for bleed-ing masses of the left ring and small fingers. His medical history consists of Hepatitis B and HCC with metastasis to the brain and phalanges of the left hand. He under-went 2 craniotomies, Gamma knife treatment for the brain metastasis, and chemotherapy and radiation to the left hand. Physical examination revealed blistering masses of the left ring and small fingers that bled and enlarged over several days and weeks, respectively, be-fore presentation (Fig. 1). The hand was nonfunctional, diffusely tender, and exhibited muscular wasting. Radio-graphs demonstrated an aggressive lesion in the second metacarpal and a <b>transverse</b> lucent <b>lesion</b> with nondis-placed fracture in the fourth distal phalanx (Fig. 2).

This study compared the effects of three flavonoids, proanthocyanidin, naringin and quercetin on artificial root caries remineralization and collagen mineralization. Methods: Caries lesions created artificially from seventy-five root fragments were subjected to a pH cycling model. Demineralized root fragments were randomly divided into 5 groups for treatment with the remineralizing agents for 10 minutes: (i) 6. 5 % proanthocyanidin, (ii) 6. 5 % naringin, (iii) 6. 5 % quercetin, (iv) 1000 ppm fluoride and (v) deionized water (control). The remineralization effects were evaluated using <b>transverse</b> microradiography (<b>lesion</b> depth and mineral loss), confocal laser scanning microscopy and microhardness. The lesion depth and mineral loss were analyzed with one-way ANOVA; while microhardness at different lesion depths were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Tukeyâs test. For observation of collagen mineralization, TEM grids coated with Type I collagen fibrils were divided into 4 groups for treatment with remineralizing agents for 1 hour: (i) 6. 5 % proanthocyanidin, (ii) 6. 5 % naringin, (iii) 6. 5 % quercetin and (iv) 1000 ppm fluoride. Collagen fibrils were then incubated in the remineralization medium for 72 hours. Finally the collagen-coated grids were washed, dried and observed under Transmission Electron Microscopy. Results: The lesion depths and mineral loss of flavonoid-treated groups were both significantly lower than the control group, but higher than the fluoride-treated group (P 0. 05). Artificial caries lesions treated with fluoride and flavonoids showed significantly greater hardness than control group (P< 0. 05).

In the practical section of this pilot study was aplicated the questionnaire and battery testing, which we have originally created. Respondent fills the questionnaire {{on his own and}} the paraplegic's practical skills are evaluated. The battery testing is focuesd on practical measurement of single components of health-related fitness and it is provided by terapeut. Fifteen parplegics participated in the research (14 men, 1 woman). From created graphs of individual questions we were examinating diversions of respondents from average value, individual respondents with each other and we were searching relation with several parameters. We were focusing on practicableness of terrain measurement and we were interested in reactions of paraplegics on the course of the testing, because it was a pilot study.

40|$|This {{paper is}} based on study over twelve {{and a half years}} of 170 {{patients}} suffering from traumatic paraplegia or tetraplegia, ofwhom 162 survived for more than a month after injury, and of 103 patients with other lesions of the spinal cord. The patients in the second group were less suitable for analysis because in many the lesions were disseminated or incomplete: few could be compared with the patients with traumatic paraplegia, who generally had <b>transverse</b> and complete <b>lesions</b> with a well defined neurological level. Heterotopic ossification was found in forty-seven patients with traumatic paraplegia and twenty-five with non-traumatic lesions. HISTORY Towards the end of the first world war D#{ 233 }jerineand Ceillier presented to the Soci#{ 233 }t#{ 233 }de Neurologie in Paris a series of cases of heterotopic ossification in paraplegia, and published a comprehensive paper (1918 c) containing a clinical and radiological study ofthe condition as observed at the Institution Nationale des Invalides. The following year D#{ 233 }jerine, Ceillier and D#{ 233 }jerine (1919) presented a paper on the anatomical and histological aspects of the disease, presenting sixteen anatomical specimens and a number of histological slides and colou...|$|R
40|$|Poster Session: Dentin Morphology, Occlusion, RemineralizationObjective: Root caries {{remains a}} major oral health problem among the elderly. Proanthocyanidin (PA) has shown {{positive}} effects on remineralization of artificial root caries. It is advantageous to find methods to enhance the remineralization effect of PA. This study evaluated the synergistic effect of PA and casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate (CPP-ACFP) on remineralization of artificial root caries. Method: Demineralized root fragments (n= 90) were randomly divided into six groups based on treatments: (i) 6. 5 % PA, (ii) CPP-ACP, (iii) CPP-ACFP, (iv) CPP-ACFP + 6. 5 % PA, (v) 1000 ppm fluoride and (vi) deionized water (control). Each specimen was immersed in the demineralizing solution for 14 h, testing solutions/pastes for 2 h and remineralizing solution for 8 h. The pH cycling was performed at 37 oC for 8 days. Specimens were evaluated using <b>transverse</b> microradiography (<b>lesion</b> depth and mineral loss), a microhardness tester (Knoop hardness) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The lesion depth and mineral loss were analyzed using one-way ANOVA; while microhardness were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Tukeyâs test. Result: One-way ANOVA indicated that testing solutions {{had a significant effect}} on lesion depth (P< 0. 05) and mineral loss (P< 0. 05). Lesion depth was significantly lower in CPP-ACFP+PA and 1000 ppm fluoride groups (P< 0. 05). Mineral loss was the lowest in CPP-ACFP+PA group (P< 0. 05). Two-way ANOVA indicated that the factors âtesting solutions/pastesâ and âlesion depthâ had a significant effect on Knoop hardness (P< 0. 05), with interaction between the two factors (P< 0. 05). Artificial caries lesions treated with CPP-ACFP+PA showed significantly higher microhardness values at 130 Î¼m and 150 Î¼m from the surface (P< 0. 05). Remineralizing bands with higher mineral density were observed in CPP-ACFP+PA group. Conclusion: The combined use of proanthocyanidin and casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate has a synergistic effect on root caries remineralization by enhancing mineral gain and increasing hardness of the artificial root caries...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} effect of a <b>transverse</b> spinal cord <b>lesion</b> on {{cerebral}} energy metabolism in view of sensorimotor reorganisation. METHODS: PET and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose were used to study resting cerebral glucose metabolism in 11 patients with complete paraplegia or tetraplegia after spinal cord injury and 12 healthy subjects. Regions of interest analysis was performed to determine global glucose metabolism (CMRGlu). Statistical parametric mapping was applied to compare both groups on a pixel by pixel basis (significance level P = 0. 001). RESULTS: Global absolute CMRGlu was lower in spinal cord injury (33. 6 (6. 6) mumol/ 100 ml/min (mean (SD)) than in controls (45. 6 (6. 2), Mann-Whitney P = 0. 0026). Statistical parametric mapping analysis disclosed relatively increased glucose metabolism particularly in the supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate, and putamen. Relatively reduced glucose metabolism in patients with spinal cord injury was found in the midbrain, cerebellar hemispheres, and temporal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: It is assumed that cerebral deafferentiation due to reduction or loss of sensorimotor function results in the low level of absolute global CMRGlu found in patients with spinal cord injury. Relatively increased glucose metabolism in brain regions involved in attention and initiation of movement may be related to secondary disinhibition of these regions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{efficacy}} of four different radio-frequency ablation (RFA) systems in normal hepatic parenchyma in large animals. The RFA was applied to pig livers in vivo and to calf livers ex vivo using the Radionics cluster needle, RITA starburst XL needle, Radiotherapeutics Le Veen 4. 0 needle, and the Berchtold 14 -G saline-perfused 15 -mm active-tip needle based on constructor specifications. The volume of tissue coagulation from RF was calculated from measurements of the vertical diameter (Dv) and <b>transverse</b> diameter (Dt). <b>Lesion</b> shape was characterized using the ratio between Dt/Dv. Radiotherapeutics and RITA produced in vivo lesion volume of 42 +/- 10, 39 +/- 4 cm 3 with a reproducible spherical shape (Dt/Dv of 1. 01 +/- 0. 16 and 0. 97 +/- 0. 1, respectively). Radionics produced in vivo RF lesions volume of 29 +/- 11 cm 3) with an ovoid shape (Dt/Dv 0. 88 +/- 0. 09). The RF lesions with the Berchtold device could not be assessed in vivo as 5 of 8 animals died during treatment. Ex vivo RF lesions had similar volumes with each system; however, the Radiotherapeutics device produced more reproducible shaped lesions than the other systems. In our experimental study, we found no difference between expandable needle systems in vivo. Cooled needles produced slightly smaller and ovoid shape in vivo lesions...|$|R
40|$|The {{techniques}} {{used for the}} investigation of a patient with lung carcinoma {{are determined by the}} mode of presentation of the disease. The first step is based on the clinical examination and the chest X-ray (frontal and lateral view). The pathological examination of the tumor represents the second step. Depending on the operability of the patient {{at this stage of the}} investigation, further evaluation will (or will not) be performed to determine the extension of the tumor, using TNM staging system. Any candidate for surgery has to be bronchoscoped in order to evaluate the endobronchial spread of the tumor and to look for additional <b>lesions.</b> <b>Transverse</b> tomography of the thorax is the central part of any staging procedure. The choice among the other methods of investigation depends on the site of the tumor in the thorax. Mediastinoscopy is only needed in case of a lesion of unknown nature located in the anterior mediastinum or in addition to CT scan when there is a suspicion of mediastinal involvement. Transthoracic needle aspiration is best performed on peripheral lesions. In small cell lung carcinoma, the preoperative work-up should be very systematic even in the absence of clinical or laboratory abnormality. Whereas in certain cases the investigation of a patient with lung carcinoma can be limited to a clinical examination and a chest X-ray, any candidate for surgery has to be submitted to a detailed TNM staging...|$|R
40|$|Histopathologic {{interpretation}} of dermoscopic and reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) features of cutaneous melanoma was timidly carried out using perpendicular histologic sections, {{which does not}} mimic the same plane of the image achieved at both techniques (horizontal plane). The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the transverse histologic sections research technique and correlate main dermoscopic features characteristic of cutaneous melanoma (atypical network, irregular globules and pseudopods) with RCM and histopathology in perpendicular and transverse sections in order to offer a more precise {{interpretation of}} in vivo detectable features. Four melanomas and 2 nevi with different dermoscopic clues have been studied. Lesion areas that showed characteristic dermoscopic features were imaged by dermoscopy and confocal microscopy and directly correlated with histopathology in perpendicular and transverse sections. We presented the possibility to perform transverse sections as a new approach to understand RCM features. Atypical network showed different aspects in the 2 melanomas: in one case it was characterized by pleomorphic malignant melanocytes with tendency to form aggregates, whereas in the other elongated dendritic cells crowded around dermal papillae, some of them forming bridges that resembled the mitochondrial aspect at confocal and histopathology transversal sections. Pigment globules in melanomas and nevi differed for the presence of large atypical cells in the former, and pseudopods showed up as elongated nests protruded toward the periphery of the <b>lesion.</b> <b>Transverse</b> histologic research sections have a consistent dermoscopic and confocal correlate, and it may represent an help in confocal feature interpretation and an advance in improving melanoma diagnosis and knowledge of the biology of melanocytic lesions...|$|R
40|$|The aims of this {{laboratory}} study were {{to compare the}} effects of lesion baseline severity, mineral distribution and substrate on remineralization and progression of caries lesions created in root dentin. Lesions were formed in dentin specimens prepared from human and bovine dentin using three protocols, each utilizing three demineralization periods to create lesions of different mineral distributions (subsurface, moderate softening, extreme softening) and severity within each lesion type. Lesions were then either remineralized or demineralized further and analyzed using <b>transverse</b> microradiography. At <b>lesion</b> baseline, {{no differences were found}} between human and bovine dentin for integrated mineral loss (ÎZ). Differences in mineral distribution between lesion types were apparent. Human dentin lesions were more prone to secondary demineralization (ÎÎZ) than bovine dentin lesions, although there were no differences in ÎL. Likewise, smaller lesions were more susceptible to secondary demineralization than larger ones. Subsurface lesions were more acid-resistant than moderately and extremely softened lesions. After remineralization, differences between human and bovine dentin lesions were not apparent for ÎÎZ although bovine dentin lesions showed greater reduction in lesion depth L. For lesion types, responsiveness to remineralization (ÎÎZ) was in the order extremely softened > moderately softened > subsurface. More demineralized lesions exhibited greater remineralization than shallower ones. In summary, some differences exist between human and bovine dentin and their relative responsiveness to de- and remineralization. These differences, however, were overshadowed by the effects of lesion baseline mineral distribution and severity. Thus, bovine dentin appears to be a suitable substitute for human dentin in mechanistic root caries studies...|$|R
