5|$|In December1994, CSU {{predicted}} that only 12named storms would form and 8of <b>those</b> <b>would</b> become hurricanes; 3major hurricanes were projected. CSU noted an above average season due to expectations {{that the existing}} El Niño would dissipate, while a La Niña would develop {{by the summer of}} 1995. Additionally, the western areas of the Sahara Desert were predicted to have the fourth or fifth rainiest season since 1970. A year with heavier precipitation in this region usually correlates with an active Atlantic hurricane season. In April1995, CSU revised their forecast, decreasing the number of named storms to 10, hurricanes to 6, and major hurricanes to 2. However, in June, CSU reverted to their December forecast, which called for 12named storms, 8hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. The forecast by the WRC in early 1995 was 10named storms and 6hurricanes, with no prediction on the number of major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU) and the Weather Research Center (WRC). A normal season, {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has 12.1named storms, of these 6.4reach hurricane strength, and 2.7major hurricanes, which are Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Additional, the 1950-2000 CSU average for a normal season is 9.6named storms, of these 5.9reach hurricane strength, and 2.3become major hurricanes. In December1995, CSU predicted that only 8named storms would form and 5of <b>those</b> <b>would</b> become hurricanes; no specific number of major hurricanes was given. However, in April1996, CSU revised their forecast, stating that 11named storms would develop, with seven of those intensifying into a hurricane, and three reaching major hurricane intensity. In June, CSU predicted 10named storms, 6hurricanes, and 2major hurricanes. The forecast by the WRC in early 1996 was 10named storms and 6hurricanes, though there was no prediction on the number of major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Gurovich, Guillermo Rougier, and colleagues, on {{the other}} hand, {{maintain}} that the dentary is referable to Ferugliotherium and that the p4s of Argentodites and MACN Pv-RN 975 are very similar. The alveolus of MACN Pv-RN 975 fits the lower incisors attributed to Ferugliotherium in size and the blade-like premolar is of the size expected for an animal with molariforms the size of Ferugliotherium teeth. If the dentary and premolars (whose identification has been similarly controversial; see below) {{do not belong to}} Ferugliotherium, then, Gurovich and Beck argue, the Los Alamitos Formation would contain two mammals (Ferugliotherium and a multituberculate) similar in size and morphology, and therefore presumably occupying similar ecological niches—and one of <b>those</b> <b>would</b> be represented only by molariforms and incisors and the other only by premolars and a jaw fragment among the available fossils. Furthermore, they noted that the transition from blade-like to molariform premolars had actually been observed in the fossil record of the extinct sthenurine kangaroos, and that the first molariform in Sudamerica and Gondwanatherium is laterally compressed, suggesting that it may have derived from a blade-like tooth. Gurovich and Beck attributed the difference in shape between the MACN Pv-RN 975 and Argentodites p4s to the extensive wear of the former, and suggested that the two are similar enough that they probably represent at least closely related species.|$|E

25|$|Hirsh was {{not highly}} {{recruited}} {{out of high}} school, but after attending California Lutheran University, he was drafted by the Houston Astros {{in the second round}} of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft. From 2005–06, Hirsh won the Double-A Texas League Pitcher of the Year Award and the Triple-A Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Year Award in successive seasons, as he went a combined 26–10 with 283 strikeouts. In 2006, he was called up to the major leagues for the first time, and he appeared in nine games with the Astros. During the offseason, he was traded to the Colorado Rockies. He was named to the Rockies' starting rotation in 2007 and made a career-high 19 starts before injuries curtailed his season. In 2008, he was limited to four games with the Rockies due to injuries; as it turned out, <b>those</b> <b>would</b> be his last game in the major leagues. He spent the next two season in the minors, getting traded to the New York Yankees (whom he never played in the major leagues with) in 2009.|$|E

Martin {{proved to be the}} difference in Game 2 in what was otherwise a tight pitching duel between Bill Hallahan of the Cardinals and George Earnshaw for the Athletics. He scored the first run of the game in the second inning by stretching a single into a double when the ball was mishandled in the outfield, stealing third base, and then scoring on a sacrifice fly. Martin added another run in the seventh inning when he hit a single, stole second base, took third base on a fielder's choice, and then scored on a squeeze bunt. <b>Those</b> <b>would</b> be the only runs of the game as Hallahan pitched a three-hit shutout to even the series at one win apiece.|$|E
500|$|The {{convictions}} in the 1949 trial {{encouraged the}} Department of Justice {{to prepare for}} additional prosecutions of CPUSA leaders. Three months after the trial, in January1950, {{a representative of the}} Justice Department testified before Congress during appropriation hearings to justify an increase in funding to support Smith Act prosecutions. See also Fast, Howard, [...] "The Big Finger", Masses & Mainstream, March, 1950, pp 62–68. He testified that there were 21,105 potential persons that could be indicted under the Smith Act, and that 12,000 of <b>those</b> <b>would</b> be indicted if the Smith Act was upheld as constitutional. The FBI had compiled a list of 200,000 persons in its Communist Index; since the CPUSA had only around 32,000 members in 1950, the FBI explained the disparity by asserting that for every official Party member, there were ten persons who were loyal to the CPUSA and ready to carry out its orders. Navasky, p 26 (32,000 figure). Seven months after the convictions, in May1950, Hoover gave a radio address in which he declared [...] "communists have been and are today at work within the very gates of America.... Wherever they may be, they have in common one diabolic ambition: to weaken and to eventually destroy American democracy by stealth and cunning." [...] Sabin, p 56.|$|E

[...] Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times also gave a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and noted [...] "The canvas is wide like early Sanjay Leela Bhansali's; bird's view of the stunning bridge is very Mani Ratnam; witty, earthy dialogues are so Vishal Bhardwaj. Director Imitiaz Ali manages to retain a personal, auteur's touch in a genre vastly commercial, mainstream. This is a rare feat." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and said [...] "On the whole, Rockstar does {{not live up to}} the confidence and expectations from the otherwise very skilled and accomplished film-maker Imtiaz Ali." [...] Hrithik Sharma of El Viaje Reviews included it into his select list of Bollywood classics and says that [...] "Rockstar is a unique cocktail of 50% drama, 40% romance and 10% comedy. What stands out is the music by A. R. Rahman. Each song in the film is a masterpiece and fits very well into the plot. Cinematography is realistic but prepossessing indeed. The film gets a 10 on 10 in this department. There are certain scenes in the film that may seem unrelated to the plot but <b>those</b> <b>would</b> be the scenes that would stay with you longer."
