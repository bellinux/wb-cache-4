5|$|A cryptozoologist named Lincoln Anderson, a {{biologist}} named Wendy Gardner, and a hunter named Cameron Caine visit {{the town and}} have a brief meeting with Overman to discuss capturing the shark. With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to hunt the shark. The shark kills each person except for Mike. Following this, Chapman, Lincoln, Wendy, and Cameron {{make their way into}} the woods, armed with a miniature crossbow, a shotgun, and a motion-sensing camera. They set up <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> a tree and depart. At the town bar, Professor Hoffman enters, having gone into hiding and now wearing an eyepatch. Later, he and a grieving Mike drink beers.|$|E
5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E

50|$|This story {{features}} the only use in Doctor Who of a camera-linking system known as Scene-Sync {{that allowed the}} use of non-static shots of characters superimposed onto a miniature set. As <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actors were moved, <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> miniature set moved the equivalent scaled amount automatically. The exact scale motion was achieved by trial and error, involving minute adjustments to the voltage delivered to <b>the</b> slave <b>camera's</b> motors. Part Four's closing theme was transposed to the lower key of the original theme music.|$|R

5|$|The random {{selection}} of ninety-one {{stars in the}} Upper Scorpius association provided a sample of stars to be observed using the Near Infrared Imager and Spectrometer (NIRI) and Altitude conjugate Adaptive Optics for the Infrared (ALTAIR) adaptive optics system at the Gemini Observatory. Among the ninety stars selected for direct imaging was the star HIP 78530, which was first imaged by <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> May 24, 2008.

5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} {{to pass by}} Io were the twin Pioneer 10 and 11 probes on 3 December 1973 and 2 December 1974, respectively. Radio tracking provided an improved estimate of Io's mass, which, along with the best available information of Io's size, suggested that Io had the highest density of the four Galilean satellites, and was composed primarily of silicate rock rather than water ice. The Pioneers also revealed {{the presence of a}} thin atmosphere at Io and intense radiation belts near the orbit of Io. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> board Pioneer11 took the only good image of Io obtained by either spacecraft, showing its north polar region. Close-up images were planned during Pioneer 10s encounter with Io, but those observations were lost because of the high-radiation environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{image of}} him waving the ball fair changed the way {{baseball}} was televised. During this time, cameramen covering baseball were instructed to follow the flight of the ball. In a 1999 interview, NBC cameraman Lou Gerard {{said that he had}} been distracted by a nearby rat. Unable to follow the ball, he kept <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> Fisk instead. This play was perhaps the most important catalyst in getting camera operators to focus most of their attention on the players themselves.|$|E
25|$|Man Ray {{directed}} {{a number of}} influential avant-garde short films, known as Cinéma Pur. He directed Le Retour à la Raison (2 mins, 1923); Emak-Bakia (16 mins, 1926); L'Étoile de Mer (15 mins, 1928); and Les Mystères du Château de Dé (27 mins, 1929). Man Ray also assisted Marcel Duchamp with the cinematography of his film Anemic Cinema (1926), and Ray personally manned <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> Fernand Léger's Ballet Mécanique (1924).

25|$|During {{a routine}} flush {{out of the}} shuttle waste water tank Wednesday morning, the astronauts ran into a problem. Mission Control noticed a {{reduction}} in the flow from the nozzle that vents the waste water into space. The tank can hold 165 pounds of liquid waste and the crew only managed to get it down to about 80 pounds. Later in the day, astronauts used <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> Orbital Boom Sensor System (OBSS) to survey the condition of the nozzle. Since no ice was found, Flight Controllers told the crew that it is likely that there is a blockage in the line.|$|E

During the Mission Status briefing, lead Flight Director Mike Sarafin said that after having the crew focus <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> the left OMS pod, it did not appear that there was any damage, but the image analysis team would {{take a closer look at}} the area.|$|E

Ratner compared her to Madonna, saying, [...] "she can be hanging out and laughing, and then you put <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> her and it's like, 'Holy shit!'" [...] The effervescence made editing {{more difficult for the}} director. He said, [...] "It was the hardest video I've ever edited because every moment was great.

500|$|During filming Åkerlund was {{accompanied}} by three of his Swedish employees, photographer Henrik Halvarsson, production designer Mattias Lindgren, and editor Max Vitali. Madonna's daughter Lourdes was also present on set. Åkerlund remembered that {{one day after the}} filming he got a call from Mick Jagger for directing the new music video for The Rolling Stones, however he had to decline since [...] "Ray of Light" [...] consumed all his time. They filmed for over 14 days, during which he fit the crew in one car, found an angle for the 35 mm camera and just waited as the shots were taken one by one. He had to carry a diagram in his pocket for the whole time, which had all the plans for every frame they shot. Every ten seconds they captured one frame and continued for half-an-hour to get around five seconds of footage, resulting in [...] "Ray of Light" [...] being the longest shoot ever for a music video for Åkerlund. They also mounted <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> a bus and rode around New York capturing the scenes.|$|E
500|$|The social {{networking}} site developed for the pit project is inspired by sites like MySpace and Facebook, which were extremely popular when the episode was first broadcast. Leslie makes a public apology to all female government officials in alphabetical order, starting with Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann, Wisconsin Democratic Rep. Tammy Baldwin (Democrat, Wisconsin) and Illinois Democratic Rep. Melissa Bean. On her desk, Leslie has framed photos of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The apology scene was filmed with <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> a tripod, something seldom done in the documentary-style series. An online game of Scrabble is visible {{on the computer screen}} in Ron's office during one scene. It is exactly the same Scrabble game he had been playing with Tom in the previous episode, [...] "The Reporter". While preparing Leslie for her ethics board review, Tom asks if she has ever fantasized about Ron [...] "covered in Powerade". This is a reference to commercials for the sports drink, in which athletes sweat the multi-colored liquid while working out.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Khan also {{made use of}} illusory camera tricks. For example, the opening scene of Ishaan {{collecting}} fish outside his school was shot on location and at Film City. Shots focusing on Ishaan {{took place at the}} former, while those involving the gutter terrarium were filmed at a water tank at the latter. The tank's water often became murky because the mud would rise to the top, forcing production to constantly empty and refill it. Due to this hindrance, the scene took eight hours to film. The film's next sequence involved Ishaan playing with two dogs. To compensate for the [...] "absolutely petrified" [...] Safary, most joint shots used a body double, though other portions integrated close-up shots of the actor. Ishaan's nightmare—he becomes separated from his mother at a train station and she departs on a train while he is trapped in a crowd—was filmed in Mumbai on a permanent railway-station set. To work around the train set piece's immobility, production placed <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>on</b> a moving trolley to create the illusion of a departing train. For the sequences related from the mother's point of view—shot from behind the actress—Chopra stood on a trolley next to a recreated section of the train's door.|$|E
