5|$|The first Mew Mew Ichigo {{encounters}} is Minto Aizawa, a spoiled, wealthy {{girl and}} ballerina who is infused with <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the blue lorikeet; Retasu Midorikawa, a shy but smart girl who endures constant bullying from three girls and absorbs <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the finless porpoise; a hyper and yet young girl named Bu-Ling Huang who receives <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the golden lion tamarin; and Zakuro Fujiwara, a professional actress and model infused with <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: {{these are}} double-stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes. These viruses {{have been studied}} in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the viruses. Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA, which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> {{interest}} directly causes {{production of}} protein(s) or RNA that produce a desired trait or phenotype, whereas markers (a DNA sequence or the morphological or biochemical markers produced {{due to that}} DNA) are genetically linked to <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest and <b>the</b> marker tend to move together during segregation of gametes due to their proximity on the same chromosome and concomitant reduction in recombination (chromosome crossover events) between <b>the</b> marker and <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest. For some traits, <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest has been discovered {{and the presence of}} desirable alleles can be directly assayed {{with a high level of}} confidence. However, if <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest is not known, markers linked to <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest can still be used to select for individuals with desirable alleles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest. When markers are used there may be some inaccurate results due to inaccurate tests for the marker. There also can be false positive results when markers are used, due to recombination between the marker <b>of</b> interest and <b>gene</b> (or QTL). A perfect marker would elicit no false positive results. The term 'perfect marker' is sometimes used when tests are performed to detect a SNP or other DNA polymorphism in <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest, if that SNP or other polymorphism is the direct cause of the trait of interest. The term 'marker' is still appropriate to use when directly assaying <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest, because <b>the</b> test of genotype is an indirect test of the trait or phenotype of interest.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> {{interest}} is <b>the</b> {{target of the}} mosaic analysis. Cells lacking the extrachromosomal array also lack <b>the</b> functional <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest. Cells which develop normally without the array do not require <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest for normal function. Cells which do not develop normally are said to require <b>the</b> <b>gene.</b> In this way, those cell lineages which require a specific gene can be identified.|$|R
50|$|Look for flies expressing <b>the</b> {{reporter}} <b>gene.</b> These carry <b>the</b> inserted <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest, so can {{be investigated}} {{to determine the}} phenotype due to <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest.|$|R
5|$|The white Schnauzer {{is one of}} four color {{varieties}} of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. However, they are not accepted for conformation showing by the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: whether it was contained within <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two Schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC chooses not to recognize white.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the Thale cress, Arabidopsis thaliana, a weedy species in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The genome or hereditary information contained in <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of DNA, forming {{one of the smallest}} genomes among flowering plants. Arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced, in 2000. The sequencing of some other relatively small genomes, of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon, has made them important model species for understanding the genetics, cellular and molecular biology of cereals, grasses and monocots generally.|$|E
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the viruses.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> nSH 3 (131 - 205) from c-CRK II was amplified from plasmid pAT 044 1 (a kind {{gift from}} Dr. Patrik Forrer) {{by the two}} oligo nucleotides: #SK 202 TCATATGCAG-GAGGAGGCAGAGTATGTG, and #SK 201, TCGGATCCCTGGTTACCTCCAATCAG. The PCR product was ligated into a vector pHYRSF 49 - 36 after {{digestion}} with NdeI and BamHI, which resulted in pMMRSF 17 {{for the expression of}} H 6 -Smt 3 -nSH 3 -NpuDnaE-IntN 123. pHYRSF 49 - 36 was derived from pHYRSF 1 containing the fragment from pSKDuet 1 digested with NcoI and HindIII and a mutation of SpeI site after the N-terminal His-tag. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> yeast ubiquitin-like protein, Smt 3 amplified from S. cerevisiae genome was ligated between SpeI and NdeI sites. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> NpuDnaE-IntN 102 was replaced with that of NpuDnaE-IntN 123 using BamHI and HindIII sites, which finally resulted in pHYRSF 49 - 36. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> cSH 3 (213 - 304) of c-CRK II was amplified from pAT 044 and ligated into pHYBAD 44 (pMMBAD 16 for the expression of IntC 15 -cSH 3) after the digestion with KpnI and HindIII. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> NpuDnaE-IntC 15 was amplified together with <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> GB 1 from pSKDuet 16 by the two oligo nucleotides: #HK 146 : TACATATGGACCA...|$|R
25|$|One {{should decide}} on <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest.|$|R
50|$|Other {{systems such}} as the T-REx system by Life Technologies work in a {{different}} fashion. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest is flanked by an upstream CMV promoter and two TetO2 sites. Expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest is repressed by the high affinity binding of TetR homodimers to each TetO2 sequences {{in the absence of}} tetracycline. Introduction of tetracycline results in binding of one tetracycline on each TetR homodimer followed by release of TetO2 by the TetR homodimers. Unbinding of TetR homodimers and TetO2 result in derepression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest.|$|R
5|$|Mallard {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Almost all domestic duck breeds derive from the mallard, {{with the exception of}} a few Muscovy breeds. Mallards are generally monogamous while domestic ducks are mostly polygamous. Domestic ducks have no territorial behaviour and are less aggressive than mallards. Domestic ducks are mostly kept for meat, as their eggs have a strong flavor. They were first domesticated in Southeast Asia at least 4000 years ago, during the Neolithic Age, and were also farmed by the Romans in Europe, and the Malays in Asia. It is also common for mallards to mate with domestic ducks and produce hybrid offspring that are fully fertile. Due to this, mallards have been found to be contaminated with <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the domestic duck.|$|E
5|$|The Mew Mews {{are young}} {{girls who have}} been {{injected}} with <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> endangered species, giving them the ability to transform into Mew Mews. The project chose endangered species because they felt that these species would have the strongest desire to preserve their kind. These superheroes are biological weapons tasked with fighting the chimera anima, the monsters created when alien parasites infect a living host. They are later called on to fight the aliens that were {{the source of the}} Chimera Anima invasion. The creation of the first five Mew Mews occurred accidentally. The head of the project, Ryô Shirogane, originally intended to inject a Chimera Anima with the endangered animal genes directly to see if that would reverse the effects of the infection. Instead, it was accidentally injected into five different girls when the earthquake happened.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of preserved soft tissue remains and DNA of woolly mammoths {{has led to}} the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this. Cloning would involve removal of the DNA-containing nucleus of the egg cell of a female elephant, and replacement with a nucleus from woolly mammoth tissue. The cell would then be stimulated into dividing, and implanted on a female elephant. The resulting calf would have <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> the woolly mammoth, although its fetal environment would be different. Most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough to guide the production of an embryo.|$|E
50|$|Expression vectors are a {{specialized}} type of cloning vector {{in which the}} transcriptional and translational signals needed for <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest {{are included in the}} cloning vector. The transcriptional and translational signals may be synthetically created to make <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> interest easier to regulate.|$|R

5|$|Tuberculosis {{has been}} present in humans since antiquity. The {{earliest}} unambiguous detection of M. tuberculosis involves {{evidence of the}} disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17,000 years ago. However, whether tuberculosis originated in bovines, then was transferred to humans, or whether it diverged from a common ancestor, is currently unclear. A comparison of <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in humans to MTBC in animals suggests humans did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication, as was previously believed. Both strains of the tuberculosis bacteria share a common ancestor, which could have infected humans even before the Neolithic Revolution. Skeletal remains show prehistoric humans (4000 BC) had TB, and researchers have found tubercular decay in the spines of Egyptian mummies dating from 3000–2400 BC. Genetic studies suggest TB was present in the Americas from about 100 AD.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it is not a genetic ability and thus is very rare, the Rinnegan has been {{regarded}} as a legend with only the Sage of Six Paths known to acquire it. However, the reincarnations of Hagoromo's sons, Indra and Asura, can potentially access Rinnegan by having <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> both reincarnations, as in the case of Madara (Indra's reincarnation), who obtained the DNA of Hashirama (Asura's reincarnation), although he only awoke the Rinnegan near the end of his natural lifespan. This is considered a wrongful act by Hagoromo as he attempted to leave a message in the form of a stone tablet for Indra's descendants to reconsider the act. The Rinnegan is shown to be transplantable, as Madara was able to implant his Rinnegan into the young Nagato, and Obito takes up Madara's left Rinnegan to use it in conjunction with his Sharingan. After meeting with Hagoromo, Sasuke, who is the current reincarnation of Indra, awakens a Rinnegan in his left eye, which has an additional six tomoe on top of the ripple pattern, making it closer to the Rinne Sharingan in appearance. His Rinnegan allows him to perform , which can shift himself, others, and objects a set distance away from his original location. He can increase the range of this technique by instantaneously changing place with a remote space. Due to its speed, this technique has proven to be especially useful for launching surprise attacks against enemies within its range. While there is no prerequisite for using the technique, it does have a recharging period after each use. Once fully mastered it can even cross dimensions but requires a large amount of chakra and drains his dōjutsu of its power for an extended period of time.|$|E
