5|$|Allied {{planners}} began formulating {{their plans}} for the future direction of the fighting in the wider Pacific with a focus upon retaking the Philippines and the eventual capture of the Japanese Home Islands. The lynchpin to Japanese strength in the region was their main base at Rabaul. The reduction of this base came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> key tenet of success in the SWPA for the Allies and was formalised into Operation Cartwheel.|$|E

5|$|Chrysippus was a {{prolific}} writer. He {{is said to}} rarely have gone without writing 500 lines a day and he composed more than 705 works. His desire to be comprehensive meant {{that he would take}} both sides of an argument and his opponents accused him of filling his books with the quotations of others. He was considered diffuse and obscure in his utterances and careless in his style, but his abilities were highly regarded, and he came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> preeminent authority for the school.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{regarded}} as a barren, desolate and dangerous to cross, the Pine Bush has come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> historical, cultural, and environmental asset to the Capital District and Hudson Valley regions of New York.

5|$|Jackson's last album, Invincible, was {{released}} six years later, in 2001, his longest period between full studio records.

5|$|Overall Set {{was viewed}} with ambivalence, until {{during the first}} {{millennium}} BCE he came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> totally malevolent deity. This transformation was prompted more by his association with foreign lands than by the Osiris myth. Nevertheless, in these late times, the widespread temple rituals involving the ceremonial annihilation of Set were often connected with the myth.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was seen as {{more than just the}} simple renaming of an international tendency that was already in existence. It was argued that the Third International had now degenerated completely and was therefore <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> counter-revolutionary organisation that would in time of crisis defend capitalism. Trotsky believed that the coming World War would produce a revolutionary wave of class and national struggles, rather as World War I had done.|$|E

5|$|The term Żydokomuna {{originated}} {{in connection with}} the Russian Bolshevik Revolution and targeted Jewish communists during the Polish-Soviet War. The emergence of the Soviet state was seen by many Poles as Russian imperialism in a new guise. The visibility of Jews in both the Soviet leadership and in the Polish Communist Party further heightened such fears. In some circles, Żydokomuna came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> prominent antisemitic stereotype expressing political paranoia.|$|E
5|$|Film noirs {{tend to have}} unusually {{convoluted}} story lines, frequently involving flashbacks {{and other}} editing techniques that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs as varied as The Element of Crime (surrealist), After Dark, My Sweet (retro), and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor {{shut off}} from the rest of the world, except for a few years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} that the vast majority of East Timorese supported integration. This position was followed closely by the Indonesian media such that an East Timorese acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken for granted by, and was a non-issue for, the majority of Indonesians. East Timor came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> training ground for the officer corps in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua, and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia.|$|E

The Windows on the World restaurant, located {{on top of the}} North Tower, reported revenues of $37 million in 2000, making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the United States. The Twin Towers became known worldwide, appearing in movies, television shows, postcards, and other merchandise.

5|$|After {{several members}} of the {{resistance}} are killed by the Gestapo, Winther suspects they have an informant among them. Later, Bent visits Ketty's hotel room, and they have sex. Meanwhile, Jørgen visits his wife and advises her boyfriend to treat her properly or he will return. In a meeting, Winther says the informer is Ketty and orders her death. Bent meets Ketty; she tells him she works for both Winther and army intelligence, and that Winther does not work for the British. Winther, involved with Gilbert and Seibold, had ordered them to be killed in order not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> traitor. Bent and Jørgen search for Winther in the bar and discover that he has escaped to Stockholm. They realize it is a trap, and they escape from the Gestapo men. They decide to kill Karl Heinz Hoffmann, the Gestapo's leader, and then take over the favorite Gestapo restaurant. Bent cannot kill Hoffmann because they have to get away when he notices the police coming. That night, Ketty says to Bent that he and Jørgen should go to Stockholm. In the meeting, they are offered positions in the Danish Army but they refuse. A man called Ravnen gives them the name of the real informer, and Jørgen soon kills him.|$|E
5|$|Parsons was {{employed}} by North American Aviation at Inglewood, {{where he worked}} on the Navaho Missile Program. He and Cameron moved into a house in Manhattan Beach, where he instructed her in occultism and esotericism. When Cameron developed catalepsy, Parsons referred her to Sylvan Muldoon's books on astral projection, suggesting that she could manipulate her seizures to accomplish it. They were married on October 19, 1946, four days after his divorce from Helen was finalized, with Forman as their witness. Parsons continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> specialist in rocketry; he acted as an expert consultant in numerous industrial tribunals and police and Army Ordnance investigations regarding explosions. In May 1947, Parsons gave a talk at the Pacific Rocket Society in which he predicted that rockets would take humans to the Moon. Although he had become distant from the now largely defunct O.T.O. and had sold much of his Crowleyan library, he continued to correspond with Crowley until the latter's death in December 1947.|$|E

5|$|Beta, Delta and Kappa are {{multiple}} star systems containing six, two and four stars respectively. Located near {{the tail of}} the toucan, Beta Tucanae's two brightest components, Beta1 and Beta2 are separated by an angle of 27 arcseconds and have apparent magnitudes of 4.4 and 4.5 respectively. They can be separated in small telescopes. A third star, Beta3 Tucanae, is separated by 10 arcminutes from the two, and able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate star with the unaided eye. Each star is itself a binary star, making six in total. Lying in the southwestern corner of the constellation around 251 light-years away from Earth, Delta Tucanae consists of a blue-white primary contrasting with a yellowish companion. Delta Tucanae A is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.49. The companion has an apparent magnitude of 9.3. The Kappa Tucanae system shines with a combined apparent magnitude of 4.25, and is located around 68 light-years from the Solar System. The brighter component is a yellowish star, known as Kappa Tucanae A with an apparent magnitude of 5.33 and spectral type F6V, while the fainter lies 5 arcseconds to the northwest. Known as Kappa Tucanae B, it has an apparent magnitude of 7.58 and spectral type K1V. Five arcminutes to the northwest is a fainter star of apparent magnitude 7.24 —actually a pair of orange main sequence stars of spectral types K2V and K3V, which can be seen individually as stars one arcsecond apart with a telescope such as a Dobsonian with high power.|$|E
