5|$|Freeway {{construction}} had {{its impact}} on the city, with neighborhoods disrupted and housing stock lost. Between 1963 and 1975, Interstate 35W from the south border of the city to its northeastern corner, Interstate 94 from the St. Paul border into downtown, and the Crosstown (County Road 62, later to become Minnesota State Highway 62) on the southern boundary of Minneapolis were built. The remaining portion of Interstate 94, from U.S. Highway 12 to the northern boundary of the city, was completed in 1982. Highway 12 was later rebuilt to Interstate standards in 1992, at which point it was renumbered Interstate 394. Several proposed projects never were built, though. Minnesota State Highway 55, running southeast from downtown to the Fort Snelling area and the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport, was slated to become a freeway, but the upgrade was canceled due <b>to</b> <b>neighborhood</b> opposition. Similarly, a proposed Interstate 335 was to run from Interstate 35W in northeast Minneapolis to a connection with Interstate 94 just north of downtown. This project was also canceled due <b>to</b> <b>neighborhood</b> opposition.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stations}} {{proposed for}} the DART Light Rail network are classified as deferred. As defined by DART, a deferred station {{is one that has}} been identified, but will not be constructed until land use changes warrant the construction of a station. In addition to the deferred stations, the network also features a single ghost station, the Knox–Henderson Station. The underground station was excavated {{at the time of the}} original construction of the Red and Blue Lines, only to have plans subsequently scrapped due <b>to</b> <b>neighborhood</b> opposition.|$|E
5|$|Kim's {{associates}} {{characterize the}} director as an eccentric individual. Tokyo International Film Festival programming director Kenji Ishizaka recalls that Kim's way {{of writing a}} screenplay was {{to walk away from}} home for three months. He would shut himself up in a cheap hotel, listen <b>to</b> <b>neighborhood</b> gossip, and write all night in the dark. South Korean film critic Lee Young-il remembers that Kim's shoes were never shined, and that one of his few material pleasures was high-quality coffee. Kim Ki-young's unconventional and nonconformist nature also prevented him from participating in South Korea's mainstream film industry. The only official title he held within the film community was member of The National Academy of Arts, which he joined in 1997, and he did not cultivate friendships with journalists who could further his career.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{centralized}} {{policies and}} practices, the captains {{who ran the}} precincts or districts were relatively independent of headquarters, owing their jobs <b>to</b> <b>neighborhood</b> politicians. Decentralization meant that police could respond to local concerns, but graft often determined which concerns got most attention. In 1895, Chicago adopted civil service procedures, and written tests {{became the basis for}} hiring and promotion. Standards for recruits rose, though policing remained political.|$|E
25|$|In April 2008, {{the city}} {{unveiled}} a $300-million stimulus {{plan to create}} jobs and revitalize neighborhoods, financed by city bonds and paid for by earmarking about 15% of the wagering tax. The city's plans for revitalization with the Next Detroit Neighborhood Initiative, a 501 (c)(3) organization, include 7-Mile/Livernois, Brightmoor, East English Village, Grand River/Greenfield, North-End, and Osborn.

25|$|The city's Office of Neighborhood Involvement {{serves as}} a conduit between city {{government}} and Portland's 95 officially recognized neighborhoods. Each neighborhood is represented by a volunteer-based neighborhood association which {{serves as a}} liaison between residents of the neighborhood and the city government. The city provides funding <b>to</b> <b>neighborhood</b> associations through seven district coalitions, each of which is a geographical grouping of several neighborhood associations. Most (but not all) neighborhood associations belong to one of these district coalitions.|$|E
25|$|Also, as {{real estate}} prices and {{neighborhood}} pressure increased to move these {{people out of their}} areas, the SROs diminished in number, putting most of their residents in the streets.

His father died during the First World War, and his widowed mother emigrated to New York City with her two {{children}} in 1921. They joined an uncle {{who was in the}} Italian lemon-ice business in Brooklyn. By the late 1920s, the family began making ice pops, and by 1929, chocolate-covered ice cream bars and sandwiches under the name Senator Frozen Products on Southern Boulevard in the South Bronx, delivering them with a horse-drawn wagon <b>to</b> <b>neighborhood</b> stores in the Bronx.|$|E

In 1983, he gave up his pastoring position and began taking construction jobs to make ends meet.|$|E
25|$|The Yat dialect is {{the most}} {{pronounced}} version of the New Orleans Accent. Natives often speak {{with varying degrees of}} the Brooklyn-esque accent, ranging from a slight intonation to what is considered full Yat. As with all dialects, there is variance by local speakers due to geographic and social factors. This results in many different levels of Yat throughout the area, marking distinct differences between higher-income people and lower-income people. Yat tends to differ in strength and intonation from neighborhood <b>to</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> The type, strength, and lexicon of the accent vary from section to section of the New Orleans Metropolitan Area. Longtime residents can often tell what area the other residents are from by their accent.|$|E

25|$|Stickball: Wheeler Hall is {{the most}} storied of the {{residence}} halls, known for its unique traditions. It is also the site for a popular campus sport known as stickball, a long-standing Holy Cross tradition usually played by Wheeler residents. It is estimated that Holy Cross students began playing stickball at Wheeler Hall around 1940. The Holy Cross version's origins are the stuff of legends. The sport lends itself <b>to</b> <b>neighborhood</b> stickball, and is played with a tennis ball and broomstick. Wheeler Hall's five floors and symmetrical design makes it an ideal setting for the playing and spectating of the sport. A hill behind home plate helps contribute to the playing area's natural amphitheater-like setting.|$|E
25|$|With Langston Golf Course {{closed for}} the third time in 10 years, District of Columbia highway {{officials}} argued the land should be used for a new bridge across the Anacostia River. The Barney Circle Freeway would at last be built (they claimed) to bring the Southeast Freeway north along the west bank of the Anacostia River, through Anacostia Park and Langston Golf Course, and then travel over the new bridge to connect with the Anacostia Freeway. But widespread protests from wealthy Capitol Hill residents, numerous lawsuits, and design changes caused the freeway's cost to balloon to $160 million, and it remained unbuilt by 1992. The D.C. City Council had the final say on whether to proceed with the project or not. In December 1994, the City Council bowed <b>to</b> <b>neighborhood</b> opposition and voted overwhelmingly to cancel the Barney Circle Freeway.|$|E
25|$|The Intifada was not {{initiated}} by any single individual or organization. Local leadership came from groups and organizations {{affiliated with the}} PLO that operated within the Occupied Territories; Fatah, the Popular Front, the Democratic Front and the Palestine Communist Party. The PLO's rivals in this activity were the Islamic organizations, Hamas and Islamic Jihad {{as well as local}} leadership in cities such as Beit Sahour and Bethlehem. However, the uprising was predominantly led by community councils led by Hanan Ashrawi, Faisal Husseini and Haidar Abdel-Shafi, that promoted independent networks for education (underground schools as the regular schools were closed by the military in reprisal for the uprising), medical care, and food aid. The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) gained credibility where the Palestinian society complied with the issued communiques. There was a collective commitment to abstain from lethal violence, a notable departure from past practice, which, according to Shalev arose from a calculation that recourse to arms would lead to an Israeli bloodbath and undermine the support they had in Israeli liberal quarters. The PLO and its chairman Yassir Arafat had also decided on an unarmed strategy, in the expectation that negotiations at that time would lead to an agreement with Israel. Pearlman attributes the non-violent character of the uprising to the movement's internal organization and its capillary outreach <b>to</b> <b>neighborhood</b> committees that ensured that lethal revenge would not be the response {{even in the face of}} Israeli state repression. Hamas and Islamic Jihad cooperated with the leadership at the outset, and throughout the first year of the uprising conducted no armed attacks, except for the stabbing of a soldier in October 1988, and the detonation of two roadside bombs, which had no impact.|$|E
