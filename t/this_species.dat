5|$|A solitary male {{purple-throated cotinga}} attracts a female by {{perching}} above the canopy {{and letting the}} sun highlight its iridescent plumage. The breeding behavior of <b>this</b> <b>species</b> is largely unknown, but the range in molting times implies that <b>this</b> <b>species</b> may breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the rapid}} rate of human {{expansion}} throughout the range of <b>this</b> <b>species,</b> bites are relatively common. Domestic animals and livestock are frequent victims. In Great Britain, most instances occur in March–October. In Sweden, there are about 1,300 bites a year, with an estimated 12% that require hospitalisation. At least eight different antivenoms are available against bites from <b>this</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cameroon is {{the only}} nation with a {{national}} law protecting <b>this</b> <b>species.</b> This law prohibits killing the rockfowl, though it can be captured with a proper permit. International trading of the grey-necked rockfowl is governed under CITES Appendix I, meaning that legal trading of <b>this</b> <b>species</b> is only authorized in extraordinary circumstances. In 2006 BirdLife International drafted an international action plan to provide strategies for protecting <b>this</b> <b>species.</b> This plan focused on surveying the remaining habitat, raising awareness amongst the local populace, and limiting the continued destruction of its habitat.|$|E

50|$|The {{flowers of}} <b>this</b> Carpobrotus ("Sour-fig") <b>species</b> range bright pink to mauve. It can be {{difficult}} to distinguish from the other 5 southern African Sour-fig species, but its leaves are long, thin and equilateral triangular in cross-section. <b>This</b> <b>species's</b> flower base is also strongly and distinctively double-ridged.|$|R

5|$|In 2006, most of <b>this</b> <b>species</b> {{lived in}} the Brazilian Amazon and its {{bordering}} areas. A significant population lives in the wetlands of the central Araguaia River, and in particular within Cantão State Park, which, with its 843 oxbow lakes and extensive flooded forests and marshlands, {{is one of the}} best habitat patches for <b>this</b> <b>species</b> in Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Pacific {{angelsharks}} are {{not dangerous}} to humans unless provoked, {{in which case}} their bite can cause a painful injury. They are valued for their meat and are captured by commercial and recreational fishers across their range. A targeted gillnet fishery for <b>this</b> <b>species</b> began off Santa Barbara, California in 1976 and ended in 1994, after overfishing and new regulations led to its near-collapse. <b>This</b> <b>species</b> is now mainly fished in Mexican waters. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed <b>this</b> <b>species</b> as Near Threatened, as the Californian population is largely protected and recovering, while the impact of Mexican fisheries is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Red-veined Darter – {{following}} influxes {{in previous}} years, <b>this</b> <b>species,</b> like Yellow-winged Darter, has formed temporary breeding colonies. However, since the mid-1990s, {{the number of}} these colonies has increased and many have continued to be present from year-to-year, so <b>this</b> <b>species</b> is now better regarded as a successful colonist.|$|E
5|$|The Chittenango ovate amber snail is {{endemic to}} the Chittenango area of Madison County, New York, United States. There {{is only one}} {{population}} of <b>this</b> <b>species</b> at Chittenango Falls State Park in central New York, {{even though it was}} believed to have a broader range previously; based on fossil records, some authors argue that the distribution of <b>this</b> <b>species</b> may have been much wider in the past. In opposition to this, other authors argue {{that it is impossible to}} identify <b>this</b> <b>species</b> based on fossil records, because they only allow for examination of shell features. Shell features of species in this particular family of snails are usually not very distinctive.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to the {{situation}} in the dark-eyed junco, <b>this</b> <b>species's</b> systematics is still in need of much research before they can be considered resolved. Four subspecies groups are usually distinguished. These are, north to south: ...|$|R

5000|$|However G. brachyphylla can be {{distinguished}} by its very shiny, smooth leaves (its two relatives' leaves are rough with tiny tubercles). [...] "Brachyphylla" [...] means [...] "wide/short leaves", and <b>this</b> <b>species's</b> leaves are shorter than its relatives'.|$|R
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>species</b> is {{classified}} as vulnerable as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by habitat destruction. A conservation plan has been drawn up for <b>this</b> <b>species,</b> and research into its current distribution is ongoing. Some of the indigenous peoples of Cameroon either respect <b>this</b> <b>species</b> or, in some cases, fear it. Today, this rockfowl {{is considered one of}} Africa’s most desirable birds by birders and is a symbol of ecotourism across its range.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>species</b> is {{sometimes}} called the leopard shark, a name otherwise used for Triakis semifasciata.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{synonyms}} exist for <b>this</b> <b>species</b> including: Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum, Cryptoheros nigrofasciatus and Heros nigrofasciatus.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{chestnut}}-headed oropendola shares much of <b>this</b> <b>species's</b> range, it is smaller, mainly {{black with}} a chestnut head (instead of mainly chestnut with a blackish head), and lacks coloured facial patches, {{so the two}} oropendolas {{are unlikely to be}} confused.|$|R
50|$|Acrochordonichthys strigosus is {{a species}} of catfish of the family Akysidae. It is only known from the Indonesian part of Borneo. A {{detailed}} discussion of <b>this</b> <b>species's</b> relationship with {{the other members of}} its genus can be found on Acrochordonichthys.|$|R
5|$|Although the edibility has {{not been}} {{documented}} for <b>this</b> <b>species,</b> some sources have noted that toxicity is suspected.|$|E
5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for <b>this</b> <b>species</b> exist off Baja California {{and to a lesser}} extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. <b>This</b> <b>species</b> is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of <b>this</b> <b>species</b> to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E

5|$|Inquisitive and bold, {{especially}} {{in the presence of}} food, the silvertip shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans. Often, several Silvertip sharks will rush up from deep water to inspect divers when they first enter the water, which can be a very intimidating experience, as the sharks may approach quite close. <b>This</b> <b>species</b> has also been known to circle or pursue divers. In one experiment involving bait, a large silvertip shark tore the leg off a dummy dressed in SCUBA gear, demonstrating that <b>this</b> <b>species</b> is capable of inflicting lethal injuries. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed four provoked attacks attributable to <b>this</b> <b>species,</b> none of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the smoothtooth blacktip shark's natural history; it likely inhabits shallow waters and feeds on small bony fishes. It is presumably {{viviparous}} like other members of its family. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) last assessed <b>this</b> <b>species</b> as Endangered. Although more specimens have since been discovered, the conservation status of <b>this</b> <b>species</b> remains precarious due to heavy fishing and habitat degradation within its range.|$|E
