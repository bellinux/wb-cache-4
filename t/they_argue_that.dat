On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E

5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind of}} work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E
5|$|Many feminist economists argue {{economics}} {{should be}} focused less on mechanisms (like income) or theories (such as utilitarianism) {{and more on}} well-being, a multidimensional concept including income, health, education, empowerment and social status. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> economic success {{can not be measured}} only by goods or gross domestic product, but must also be measured by human well-being. Aggregate income is not sufficient to evaluate general well-being, because individual entitlements and needs must also be considered, leading feminist economists to study health, longevity, access to property, education, and related factors.|$|E

50|$|VCCL and Vadarlis {{made two}} main arguments. Firstly, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the {{provisions}} of the Migration Act 1958 (which regulates immigration) applied to the asylum seekers, and the normal procedures for dealing with other non-citizens should be applied. The Migration Act did empower the Government to detain all non-citizens, under the system of mandatory detention, but it also gave non-citizens certain rights, such as the right to seek asylum and to apply for protection visas. As such, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the asylum seekers should be taken to the mainland and be allowed to apply for visas. Alternatively, <b>they</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> if the Migration Act did not apply to the situation of these asylum seekers, then they were being detained unlawfully, and that no-one in Australia, regardless of their citizenship status, could be detained unlawfully or arbitrarily, and so they should be released.|$|R
5|$|Most {{churches in}} the {{prosperity}} movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject Presbyterian polity (or governance) {{and the idea that}} a pastor should be accountable to elders; it is common for pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E
5|$|Such eliminativists have {{developed}} different arguments {{to show that}} folk psychology is a seriously mistaken theory {{and needs to be}} abolished. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> folk psychology excludes from its purview or has traditionally been mistaken about many important mental phenomena that can, and are, being examined and explained by modern neurosciences. Some examples are dreaming, consciousness, mental disorders, learning processes, and memory abilities. Furthermore, they argue, folk psychology's development in the last 2,500 years has not been significant and it is therefore a stagnating theory. The ancient Greeks already had a folk psychology comparable to modern views. But in contrast to this lack of development, the neurosciences are a rapidly progressing science complex that, in their view, can explain many cognitive processes that folk psychology cannot.|$|E

The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus.

5|$|Blökumen are {{mentioned}} in the Flateyjarbók, an Icelandic manuscript from the late 14th century, which preserved a 13th-century biography of King Olaf of Norway. This work contains a separate chapter on the adventures of a Norwegian prince, Eymund, at the court of Prince Jarizleifr in Novgorod. The chapter narrates that Eymund informed Jarizleifr of the departure of Jarizleifr's brother, Burizlaf, to Tyrkland, and added that Burizlaf was preparing to attack Jarizleifr with a huge army formed by Tyrkir, Blökumen and other peoples. Curta, Spinei and other scholars identify Jarizleifr with Yaroslav the Wise, and Burizlaf with Sviatopolk I of Kiev. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the reference to the Tyrkir and Blökumen proves that Sviatopolk I hired Pechenegs and Vlachs {{when he decided to}} go to war with Yaroslav. Furthermore, they propose that the Blökumenn of the Flatey Book, like the Blakumen of the runic inscription from Gottland, were Vlachs from Moldavia or Wallachia.|$|E
5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{paper on}} the affinities of Gondwanatheria, Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argue that the {{difference}} in shape between MACN-RN 975 and Argentodites is due to extensive wear on the former specimen; they write that {{the parts of the}} p4 that are not worn are virtually identical to the equivalents parts of the Argentodites p4. In addition, MACN-RN 975 is said to have as many ridges as Argentodites and to be of approximately similar size—about 15% larger. They allocate MACN-RN 975 to the gondwanathere Ferugliotherium and consequently, <b>they</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Argentodites most likely represents either Ferugliotherium or some related species. In the same year, Guillermo Rougier and colleagues also suggested ferugliotherian affinities of Argentodites in a {{paper on the}} mammals of the Allen Formation, another Cretaceous rock unit of Argentina. Ferugliotherium is a gondwanathere from Late Cretaceous Argentinean deposits. Gondwanatheres are a small and enigmatic group from the late Cretaceous and Paleogene of South America, Antarctica, Madagascar, India, and perhaps Tanzania. Although the evolutionary affinities of gondwanatheres are controversial, both teams that identified Argentodites as gondwanathere believe gondwanatheres are likely themselves multituberculates or closely related to them.|$|E

5|$|Rome {{typically}} employed four legions each year, each {{consisting of}} 4,000 foot soldiers and 200 cavalry. Perceiving the Carthaginian army {{as a real}} threat, {{for the first time}} ever the Senate introduced eight legions, each consisting of 5,000 foot soldiers and 300 cavalry, with allied troops numbering the same amount of foot soldiers but 900 cavalry per legion-- more than triple the legion numbers. Eight legions--some 40,000 Roman soldiers and an estimated 2,400 cavalry--formed the core of this massive new army. However, some have suggested that the destruction of an army of 90,000 troops would be impossible. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Rome probably had 48,000 troops and 6,000 cavalry against Hannibal's 35,000 troops and 10,000 cavalry. Livy quotes one source stating the Romans added only 10,000 men to their usual army. While no definitive number of Roman troops exists, all sources agree that the Carthaginians faced a considerably larger foe.|$|E
5|$|The company DuPont {{and many}} {{industrial}} historians dispute {{a link between}} nylon and hemp. <b>They</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the reason for developing nylon was to produce a fiber that could compete with silk and rayon in, for example, thin stockings for women. Silk was much more expensive than hemp and imported largely from Japan. There was more money in a substitute for silk. DuPont focused early on thin stockings for women. As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, {{it was possible to}} make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand was greater than DuPont could produce. And the DuPont Group was very big; it could move on if nylon had not become a success.|$|E
5|$|The single known living specimen, a {{young adult}} male, was {{collected}} at 80m (260ft) altitude in the Andaladomo forest (part of the Mikea Forest) in 2003. The Andaladomo forest is different in vegetation {{from the rest of}} the Mikea Forest, and is similar to forests further to the north on Madagascar. The animal was found in an isolated fragment of dry deciduous forest amid land cleared for maize cultivation. The trap was set at the foot of a tree surrounded by bushes and succulent plants. Other small mammals known from the Mikea Forest include the bastard big-footed mouse, the introduced black rat (Rattus rattus), several species of tenrecs, and the shrew Suncus madagascariensis. Although only a single individual of Petter's big-footed mouse was caught during Goodman and Soarimalala's survey, which accrued 3100trap-nights, <b>they</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> this does not necessarily mean the species is rare, since trapping rates for rodents in the dry forests of Madagascar are often variable depending on year and season.
