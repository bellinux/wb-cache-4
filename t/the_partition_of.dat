We find that <b>the</b> <b>partitioning</b> <b>of</b> energy is qualitatively {{different from that}} <b>of</b> charge. <b>The</b> <b>partition</b> ratio <b>of</b> energy depends on the excess energy of the tunneling electrons (controlled by the applied bias) and on the interaction strength within the wire (characterized by the Luttinger liquid parameter κ), while <b>the</b> <b>partitioning</b> <b>of</b> charge is fully determined by κ.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>partitioning</b> <b>of</b> rare-earth ions in polymer-based three-liquid-phase system (TLPS) of Cyanex 272 /PEG 6001 (NH 4) (2) SO 4 -H 2 O {{and the change}} in volume ratios of PEG-rich middle phase to salt-rich bottom phase was investigated. It {{was found that the}} change in phase volume ratios might be attributed to the transfer of hydrated PEG molecules. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>partitioning</b> <b>of</b> hydrated PEG is a main driving force for <b>the</b> <b>partitioning</b> <b>of</b> rare earths. <b>The</b> change in water content in PEG-rich phase should be taken into account for calculating <b>partition</b> coefficients <b>of</b> rare-earth ions. The traditional Diamond-Hsu model derived from Flory-Huggins theory considered only <b>the</b> <b>partitioning</b> <b>of</b> simple PEG molecules to calculate <b>the</b> <b>partition</b> coefficients <b>of</b> targets in polymer-based aqueous biphasic system, so that it could not reflect such influences from the change in phase volume ratios. The present work discusses the influences from the change of the concentrations of PEG and inorganic salt, Cyanex 272 concentration in top organic phase of TLPS, aqueous pH value and initial concentration of rare-earth ions, on <b>the</b> <b>partitioning</b> <b>of</b> rare-earth ions into PEG-rich middle phase of TLPS.

5|$|After World War I, {{in which}} {{approximately}} one million Indians served, a new period began. It {{was marked by}} British reforms but also repressive legislations, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by {{the beginnings of a}} nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol. During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections. The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by <b>the</b> <b>partition</b> <b>of</b> India into two states: India and Pakistan.|$|E

About 35 to 40 % of the drug was seen to partition into uninfected RBCs at a hematocrit of 33 %, irrespective of the incubation period or the drug concentration used.
