5|$|The postwar {{drive-in}} theater boom {{was vital}} to the expanding independent B movie industry. In January 1945, there were 96 drive-ins in the United States; a decade later, {{there were more than}} 3,700. Unpretentious pictures with simple, familiar plots and reliable shock effects were ideally suited for auto-based film viewing, with all its attendant distractions. The phenomenon of <b>the</b> <b>drive-in</b> movie became one of the defining symbols of American popular culture in the 1950s. At the same time, many local television stations began showing B genre films in late-night slots, popularizing the notion of the midnight movie.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Nigel Dick and was filmed from 4 to 6 October 1999 at the Mission Tiki drive-in theatre in Montclair, California. In the video, Raven sings the song while {{she is in a}} car with a boy, while Larsen sings and plays the guitar in front of another car. This footage is mixed with M2M singing together at <b>the</b> <b>drive-in,</b> people dancing, the projectionist struggling with his malfunctioning equipment, and the concession stand worker who has an overflowing popcorn maker. When the popcorn stand explodes, M2M continue to perform surrounded by people as popcorn rains down. Air cannons were used to fire 200 garbage bin-sized bags of popcorn into the air to create the raining popcorn effect. In the US the music video made its premiere on 24 October on The WB following that night's screening of 7th Heaven. It began airing on The Box and MuchMusic in early November 1999 and began airing on MTV on 15 November.|$|E
