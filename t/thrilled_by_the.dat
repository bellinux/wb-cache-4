The general public was concerned that steamboat racing contributed to these disasters, but many steamboat captains and passengers were <b>thrilled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> excitement and gambling accompanying the contests.|$|E

As a youngster, Voris (whose hobby was building model airplanes out of balsa wood and tissue paper) was <b>thrilled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> exploits of Eddie Rickenbacker and other World War I aces, and would spend hours watching the big planes come into Mines Field (Los Angeles Airport).|$|E

Queen Victoria was {{concerned}} that the Prussian prince would not find her daughter sufficiently attractive. Nevertheless, from the first dinner with the prince, {{it was clear to}} Queen Victoria and Prince Albert that the mutual sympathy of the two young people that began in 1851 was still vivid. In fact, after only three days with the royal family, Frederick asked Victoria's parents permission to marry their daughter.

25|$|In early 1944, when, as {{a result}} of Antonescu's Axis commitment, Bucharest was subject to a massive air bombardment, the Cioculescus took refuge to the southwestern {{periphery}} of Bucharest, moving into a small house in Ciorogârla. They subsequently moved into a villa owned by Şeicaru, where, as the Red Army troops entered Romanian territory; according to Barbu Cioculescu, the host and guest would debate the future of Romania in the post-fascist era—with Şeicaru expressing his hope in the Western Allies' anti-communism, and Cioculescu believing in a restoration of democracy with Soviet consent. According to the same author, Cioculescu-father was <b>thrilled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fall of Vichy France and ridiculed French Nazi collaborators who had escaped to Bucharest. Şeicaru left the country soon before the Royal Coup of August 1944, which aligned Romania with the Allied Powers, and the house was soon after occupied by Romanian soldiers of the Soviet-commanded Tudor Vladimirescu Division, leaving the family to move back into central Bucharest.|$|E

Paul reads Connie a book in Braille amidst mild flirting. Connie, despite her {{feelings}} of attraction, leaves. Connie is unable to stop thinking about Paul, and decides to visit him {{with a bag of}} muffins. After Connie and Paul have a dance, she stops, saying she can't continue, and leaves. When she returns to retrieve her coat, Paul literally sweeps her off her feet and into his bed. While on the train ride home via the Metro-North Railroad, Connie, in tears, recalls their sexual encounter in flashbacks. She is <b>thrilled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sexual attention she is receiving from a younger man, but feels guilty at the same time. Connie uses her work for a charity event as an excuse to go into the city to visit Paul more frequently. Edward almost immediately senses something and sees subtle changes in her, which is confirmed by an inconsistency in an excuse she uses to visit the city one day. One morning he notices that Connie is fixing herself up to go into the city, with brand new shoes and lingerie draped over a chair, and he tells Connie he will wait for her so they can go into the city together. She urges him to go without her, that she won't be ready for quite a while, so he tries to get her to agree to meet him for lunch, but she says she has a salon appointment and won't be able to meet him. Later on, at the office, suspecting Connie is lying, Edward calls the salon she mentioned and it is confirmed that she doesn't have an appointment that day.|$|E

The average rating was 4.2 out of 10, and the consensus is: [...] "Due to obvious plot twists and foreshadowing, The Glass House fails to <b>thrill.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> end, it degenerates into ludicrousness." [...] Roger Ebert rated the film 2 out of 4 stars and criticized the film's script. [...] Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called it unintentionally funny. [...] Robert Koehler of Variety also called the film unintentionally funny and questioned why so many talented actors signed on to a poor script. [...] Edward Guthmann, of the San Francisco Chronicle, criticized the film's violence and {{the timing of the}} release, which coincided with the September 11 attacks (in fact, for many critics it was the first film they saw after returning to work).

25|$|Leopold Moczygemba, a Polish priest, founded Panna Maria {{by writing}} letters back to Poland {{encouraging}} them to emigrate to Texas, a place with free land, fertile soils, and golden mountains. About 200-300 Poles took the trip and nearly mutinied when they encountered the desolate fields and rattlesnakes of Texas. Moczygemba and his brothers served as leaders during the town's development. The settlers and their children all spoke Silesian. Resurrectionist priests led church services and religious education for children. Letters sent back to Poland demonstrate a feeling of profound new experience in America. Hunting and fishing were favorite pastimes among the settlers, who were <b>thrilled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> freedoms of shooting wild game in the countryside. The farmers used labor-intensive agricultural techniques that maximized crop yields of corn and cotton; they sold excess cotton to nearby communities and created profitable businesses selling crops and livestock. Polish leaders and Polish historical figures settled in the community, including Matthew Pilarcyk, a Polish soldier sent to Mexico in the 1860s {{to fight for the}} Austrian Emperor Maximilian. Some records recall that he fled the Army in 1867 during the fall of the empire, escaped a firing squad and traversed the Rio Grande to enter Panna Maria, where he had heard Poles were living. When he arrived, he married a local woman and joined the community as a political leader. The community was nearly massacred following the Civil War, where the government of Texas was dismantled and gangs of cowboys and former Confederate nativists harassed and shot at Poles in Panna Maria. The Poles in Panna Maria had Union sympathies and were the subject of discrimination by the local Southerners. In 1867, a showdown between a troupe of armed cowboys and the Polish community neared a deadly confrontation; Polish priests requested the Union Army to protect them, and a stationed Army helped keep them safe, registered to vote in elections, and free from religious intolerance. The language used by these settlers was carried down to their descendants over 150 years, and the Texas Silesian dialect still exists. Cemeteries contain inscriptions written in Polish or Polish-and-English. The Silesians held a millennial celebration for the Christianization of Poland in 966, and were presented a mosaic of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa by President Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E

Started in Sacramento, California, Shakey's Pizza became known outside Sacramento not for its pizza but for the jazz program it sponsored on a regional radio network. Shakey's used banjo players performing Dixieland and ragtime classics, plus hits of the early 1900s, '20s, and '30s, similar to the format of Jack Dupen's Red Garter club in San Francisco which spurred demand for banjo players.
