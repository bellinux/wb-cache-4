5|$|In the 970s, Haakon Sigurdsson, Jarl of Lade, became <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> in Norway, {{at first}} {{supported}} by Harald Bluetooth of Denmark and paying tribute to him—though the two later fell out over religious matters. Harald had converted to Christianity and {{was eager to}} Christianise Norway, while Haakon remained a staunch pagan. In 995 Haakon was deposed and the young Christian leader Olaf Tryggvason came to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Under the Plantagenets, England was transformed, {{although}} {{this was only}} partly intentional. The Plantagenet kings were often forced to negotiate compromises such as Magna Carta. These constrained royal power in return for financial and military support. The king was no longer just <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> in the nation, holding the prerogative of judgement, feudal tribute and warfare. He now had defined duties to the realm, underpinned by a sophisticated justice system. A distinct national identity was shaped by conflict with the French, Scots, Welsh and Irish, {{and the establishment of}} English as the primary language.|$|E

5|$|King James rewarded Robert Cecil, whom {{he made a}} Privy Councillor and {{secretary}} of state, with the granting of the title of Earl of Salisbury in 1605 and Lord High Treasurer in 1608, making him <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> at the royal court. As Cecil rose, Calvert rose with him. Calvert's foreign languages, legal training, and discretion made him an invaluable aide to Robert Cecil who, no lover of Catholics, seems to have accepted Calvert's conformity as beyond question. Working at the centre of court politics, Calvert exploited his influence by selling favours, an accepted practice for the times. Calvert accumulated {{a number of small}} offices, honours, and sinecures. In August 1605, he attended the King at Oxford, and received an honorary master-of-arts degree in an elaborate ceremony at which the Duke of Lennox (Ludovic Stewart), the earls of Oxford and Northumberland, and Cecilius received degrees. Given the prestige of the other graduates, Calvert's was the last awarded, but his presence in such company signalled his growing stature.|$|E
5|$|Niko defends Roman {{from his}} loan sharks several times, but {{is forced to}} work for Vlad Glebov, Roman's Russian loan shark. Niko kills Vlad after finding out he slept with Roman's girlfriend, Mallorie. After Vlad's murder, Niko and Roman are kidnapped {{by members of the}} Liberty City Bratva on order of Mikhail Faustin and his associate, Dimitri Rascalov. Faustin, not bothered by the murder of Vlad, hires Niko. Niko quickly learns that Faustin is a {{psychopath}} after being ordered to kill the son of Kenny Petrović, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> in the Bratva. After the Petrović family threatens retaliation, Dimitri convinces Niko to assassinate Faustin in order to prevent a gang war. When Niko meets with Dimitri to collect on the assassination, Dimitri brings Niko's former employer Ray Bulgarin instead, who accuses Niko of stealing from him a few years earlier. When Niko truthfully denies the allegation, a firefight ensues, allowing Dimitri and Bulgarin to escape.|$|E
5|$|The Liberals, or Grits, {{maintained}} {{power in}} the 1851 election, but soon, they were divided by a parliamentary scandal. In September, the government resigned, and a coalition government uniting parties from both parts of the province under Sir Allan MacNab took power. Macdonald did {{much of the work}} of putting the government together and served as Attorney General. The coalition which came to power in 1854 became known as the Liberal-Conservatives (referred to, for short, as the Conservatives). In 1855, George-Étienne Cartier of Canada East (today Quebec) joined the Cabinet. Until Cartier's 1873 death, he would be Macdonald's political partner. In 1856, MacNab was eased out as premier by Macdonald, who became the leader of the Canada West Conservatives. Though <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> in the government he remained as Attorney General, with Sir Étienne-Paschal Taché as premier.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} {{never took}} place. Instead, the fighter force {{was committed to}} the disastrous Operation Bodenplatte, designed to support German forces during the Battle of the Bulge. Galland's influence on matters was now virtually nil. Appalled by the Ardennes losses, he personally confronted Gollob and criticised him severely. Gollob contacted the Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. Himmler's reputation as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> after Hitler at that time {{may have been a}} prime motive. Gollob complained about his misuse in the Luftwaffe and Galland's leadership. The SS had already spread their influence into other areas of military affairs including the V-2 operations. Himmler, whose relationship with Göring was poor, took the opportunity to exploit the dissent in the Luftwaffe and undermine the Reichsmarschall by supporting Gollob. It was also an opportunity for the SS to seize control of the Luftwaffe and for Himmler to oust Göring from power. Göring, for his part offered no support to Galland when Himmler or the SS were mentioned. On 13 January 1945, Galland was finally relieved of his command.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> in the {{province}} was a man named Åke, who had formerly been one of Halfdan the Black's men, and he invited both the Norwegian king and the Swedish king to his halls.

25|$|After Stalin's death, Beria was {{appointed}} First Deputy Premier and reappointed {{head of the}} MVD, which he merged with the MGB. His close ally Malenkov was the new Prime Minister and initially <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> in the post-Stalin leadership. Beria was second most powerful, and given Malenkov's personal weakness, was poised to become the power behind the throne and ultimately leader himself. Khrushchev became Party Secretary. Voroshilov became Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (i.e., the head of state).|$|E

25|$|Tings {{were huge}} open-air events, which {{required}} plenty of space. The more important ting that king Olof talked about {{was probably the}} Ting of all Swedes, which {{was held at the}} end of February in Uppsala, during the Disting. The king was obliged to obey the common decisions made at this ting, and <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> at this assembly was not the king, but the lawspeaker of Tiundaland. Locally important tings were the Westrogothic Ting of all Geats in Skara and the Ostrogothic Lionga ting in the vicinity of today's Linköping.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the start}} of a civil war with Mạc Đăng Dung and his {{supporters}} {{on one side and the}} Trịnh and the Nguyễn on the other side. Thanh Hóa Province, the ancestral home to the Trịnh and the Nguyễn, was the battle ground between the two sides. After several years of warfare, Emperor Lê Chiêu Tông was assassinated 1522 by Mạc Đăng Dung's supporters. Not long after, the leaders of the Nguyễn and the Trịnh were executed. Mạc Đăng Dung was now <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> in Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|At that point, Emperor and King Charles was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> in Christendom. The {{accumulation}} {{of so much}} power by one man and one dynasty greatly concerned Francis I of France, who found himself surrounded by Habsburg territories. In 1521 Francis invaded the Spanish possessions in Italy and Navarre, which inaugurated {{a second round of}} Franco-Spanish conflict. The war was a disaster for France, which suffered defeats at Biccoca (1522), Pavia (1525, at which Francis was captured), and Landriano (1529) before Francis relented and abandoned Milan to Spain once more.|$|E

25|$|A {{successful}} merchant and lawyer, Thomas Cromwell was {{a self-made}} man of relatively humble beginnings whose intelligence and abilities {{enabled him to}} rise to become <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> in England next to the king. His own father, Walter Cromwell, had been a jack of all trades - a blacksmith, fuller and brewer who had, from time to time, come {{to the attention of}} the authorities. Thomas Cromwell was sent to school as a boy, where he learned to read and write and was taught a little Latin. Thomas Cromwell was determined to provide a more extensive education for his own son, Gregory.|$|E
25|$|While not {{directly}} an inheritance, Charles was elected emperor of the Holy Roman Empire {{after the death}} of his grandfather Emperor Maximilian thanks to prodigious bribes paid the prince-electors. Charles became <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> in Europe. It was often said during this time that it was the empire on which the sun never set. The sprawling overseas empire of the Spanish Golden Age was controlled, not from inland Valladolid, but from Seville, where the Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) regulated commerce with the Indies, as well as licenses for emigration. The supreme body for administering the Indies was the Council of the Indies, established in 1524.|$|E
25|$|Following Eisenhower's {{election}} and the Republican takeover of Congress, Taft served as Senate Majority Leader in 1953, and he strongly supported Eisenhower's domestic proposals. He worked hard to assist the inexperienced new officials of the administration. He even tried, with little success, to curb the excesses of red-baiting US Senator Joseph McCarthy. By April, Eisenhower and Taft were friends and golfing companions, and Taft was praising his former adversary. Defeat in 1952, it seemed, had softened Taft. No longer burdened by presidential ambitions, he had become less partisan, less abrasive, and more conciliatory; he was now widely regarded as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> <b>man</b> in Congress.|$|E
