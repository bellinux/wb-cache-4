50|$|On 12 May 1935, while {{engaging}} in Fleet Problem XVI off Diamond Head, Oahu, Sicard was rammed by Lea (DD-118) and badly damaged. The ship was <b>towed</b> by <b>Rail</b> (AM-26) to the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard, where she received extensive repairs before resuming operations with her squadron in August.|$|R
50|$|A crawler {{excavator}} (or crawling digger) is a {{tracked vehicle}} designed to dig or grade, or move earth and large objects, and is classified by its mode of locomotion. The {{many types of}} excavators include wheeled, walker, <b>towed</b> and <b>rail</b> excavators. Related to tracked tanks widely used by armies, these crawlers move upon the same rotating wheel systems, but also {{have the ability to}} dig, pick and transport excavated materials as they proceed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{race was}} called off, and {{by order of}} the French Government the cars were impounded and <b>towed</b> to the <b>rail</b> station by horses and transported to Paris by train. (The cars' engines were not even allowed to be restarted.) ...|$|R
50|$|A newly {{developed}} alternative is the HANDWave DRT (Dual Rail Tester) which {{is capable of}} ultrasonic rail flaw detection performance equivalent to current rail bound testers. This unit can be separated into two separate Single Rail Testers (HANDWave SRT) or <b>towed</b> behind a <b>rail</b> vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Bagnall 3079 was {{withdrawn}} in 1989 {{due to the}} increased shunting being beyond its capabilities. Replaced by chop-nosed DA 512, it was provisionally sold to the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway who planned to have it <b>towed</b> by <b>rail</b> to their Kawakawa depot. Unfortunately NZ Rail Ltd was concerned that the tyres needed reprofiling and wanted the locomotive to be road transported to Westfield depot in Auckland for this work to be carried {{before it could be}} moved by rail. Unable to meet the cost of transporting the locomotive and reprofiling the tyres, the BoIVR were unable to move the locomotive and it was later scrapped at Kinleith in 1990.|$|R
5000|$|The Union Pearson Express uses Nippon Sharyo DMU trains. The fleet {{consists}} of 18 {{diesel multiple unit}} (DMU) cars, as four three-car and three two-car sets. [...] On 1 March 2011, Metrolinx announced that it had chosen to buy 12 DMU cars (six two-car trains) from Nippon Sharyo {{at a cost of}} C$53 million, for the service. This was later expanded to 18 DMU cars (adding one car to each train) via an option order. This brought the cost to US$75 million. The DMUs were manufactured in Japan, assembled in Nippon Sharyo's facility in Rochelle, Illinois, and <b>towed</b> by <b>rail</b> to Toronto, with the first trainset arriving on August 15, 2014.|$|R
25|$|December 31, 1940: No. 1676, a 2-10-2 type {{locomotive}} with a 40-car {{freight train}} in <b>tow,</b> jumps the <b>rails</b> while cruising north via the Sorrento Grade and {{lands in the}} Pacific Ocean, {{with much of the}} rolling stock following suit. No one is killed in the accident, and it is many days before all of the wreckage can be pulled out of the sea.|$|R
5000|$|Out of the twenty-five {{scheduled}} journeys in the trial, nineteen were run, transporting a {{total of}} 2845 tonnes of timber (an average of 150-154 tonnes per trip). [...] Loading capacity was reduced on the first journey by an imposed requirement by Network <b>Rail</b> to <b>tow</b> a British <b>Rail</b> Class 37 {{at the rear of}} the train as insurance up the thirteen-mile 1-in-47 incline at Talerddig.|$|R

50|$|In 2006, NBL-built no. 3007 was {{returned}} to its builder's home city, Glasgow in Scotland, where it was initially put on static display in George Square for fundraising purposes by the North British Locomotive Preservation Group. The move of no. 3007 from staging in the Bloemfontein locomotive depot to Glasgow was recorded in Season 3 of the television documentary series Monster Moves in 2008. The locomotive was originally to have been trucked to Durban by Moveright International, but the transporter was not capable of carrying the locomotive. Instead, it was <b>towed</b> by <b>rail</b> on a two-day journey across the country, with ten flat wagons used to augment the braking capacity of the locomotives which hauled the Class 15F. The locomotive now resides in the Glasgow Museum of Transport's collection at the new Riverside Museum.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of chopper harvesters solved the loading problem. These harvesters chop the cane stalks into short lengths or billets. The billets are {{ejected from the}} harvester directly into bins towed by motor vehicle alongside the harvester. The bins are <b>towed</b> to the <b>rail</b> siding where they are transferred onto tram or rail wagons. Alternatively, the billets are tipped into bins on the wagons. By the mid-1960s, chopper harvesters had almost completely superseded whole stalk harvesters. The extant cane lifts probably all predate this time and some could date to the late 19th century.|$|R
