25|$|Vacuum tubes mostly rely on <b>thermionic</b> {{emission}} of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament. This type {{is called a}} <b>thermionic</b> tube or <b>thermionic</b> valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes (evacuated); gas-filled tubes are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.|$|E
25|$|In a mercury-arc valve, an arc forms {{between a}} {{refractory}} conductive anode and {{a pool of}} liquid mercury acting as cathode. Such units were made with ratings up to hundreds of kilowatts, and were important {{in the development of}} HVDC power transmission. Some types of smaller <b>thermionic</b> rectifiers had mercury vapor fill to reduce their forward voltage drop and to increase current rating over <b>thermionic</b> hard-vacuum devices.|$|E
25|$|In 1886 Ediswan moved {{production}} {{to a former}} jute mill at Ponders End, North London. In 1916 Ediswan set up the UK's first radio <b>thermionic</b> valve factory at Ponders End. This area, with nearby Brimsdown subsequently developed as a centre for the manufacture of <b>thermionic</b> valves, cathode ray tubes, etc. and nearby parts of Enfield became an important centre of the electronics industry {{for much of the}} 20th century. Ediswan became part of British Thomson-Houston and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) in the late 1920s.|$|E
5000|$|Lester Halbert Germer (October 10, 1896 [...] - [...] October 3, 1971) was an American physicist. With Clinton Davisson, {{he proved}} the wave-particle duality of {{matter in the}} Davisson-Germer experiment, which was {{important}} {{to the development of}} the electron microscope. These studies supported the theoretical work of De Broglie. He also studied <b>thermionics,</b> erosion of metals, and contact physics. He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1931.|$|R
30|$|Slanted Ag NRs were {{prepared}} on Si (001) substrates by oblique angle deposition (OAD) technique in an electron-beam system (GLAD, <b>Thermionics</b> Inc.) {{with a background}} vacuum level of 10 − 6  Pa. During deposition, the incident angle between the surface normal of substrates and vapor flux was set at ~ 86 °, with a deposition rate of ~ 0.75  nm/s. The NR growth finished at a thickness of 1000  nm read by a quartz crystal microbalance [10, 12].|$|R
50|$|He was {{a leading}} figure in the {{pioneering}} field of venture capital, which began as a joint partnership with all five brothers and their only sister, Babs, in 1946. In 1969 this became the successful Venrock Associates, which provided important early funding for Intel and Apple Computer, amongst many other start-up technology companies, including many other firms involved in healthcare. Over the years his investment interests ranged also into the fields of aerospace, electronics, high temperature physics, composite materials, optics, lasers, data processing, <b>thermionics,</b> instrumentation and nuclear power.|$|R
25|$|Most {{fluorescent}} lamps use electrodes that operate by <b>thermionic</b> emission, meaning they are operated {{at a high}} enough temperature for the electrode material (usually aided by a special coating) to emit electrons into the tube by heat.|$|E
25|$|Cold cathode lamps are {{generally}} less efficient than <b>thermionic</b> emission lamps because the cathode fall voltage is much higher. The increased fall voltage results in more power dissipation at tube ends, {{which does not}} contribute to light output. However, this is less significant with longer tubes. The increased power dissipation at tube ends also usually means cold cathode tubes have to be run at a lower loading than their <b>thermionic</b> emission equivalents. Given the higher tube voltage required anyway, these tubes can easily be made long, and even run as series strings. They are better suited for bending into special shapes for lettering and signage, and can also be instantly switched on or off.|$|E
25|$|A <b>thermionic</b> diode is a thermionic-valve device (also {{known as}} a vacuum tube, tube, or valve), {{consisting}} of a sealed evacuated glass envelope containing two electrodes: a cathode heated by a filament, and a plate (anode). Early examples were fairly similar in appearance to incandescent light bulbs.|$|E
40|$|This broad {{study is}} aimed at {{identifying}} the most attractive advanced energy conversion systems for industrial cogeneration for the 1985 to 2000 time period and assessing the advantages of advanced technology systems compared to using today's commercially available technology. Energy conversion systems being studied include those using steam turbines, open cycle gas turbines, combined cycles, diesel engines, Stirling engines, closed cycle gas turbines, phosphoric acid and molten carbonate fuel cells and <b>thermionics.</b> Specific cases using today's commercially available technology are being included {{to serve as a}} baseline for assessing the advantages of advanced technology...|$|R
30|$|The nanochannel and the pre-patterned {{electrodes}} {{were built}} up lithographically using an e-beam evaporator (VE- 180, <b>Thermionics,</b> Hayward, CA, USA) and an {{electron beam lithography}} machine (e-LiNe, Raith, Dortmund, Germany), explained in detail elsewhere [18 – 20]. Aniline solutions utilized in the nanowire growth process (0.01 M aniline in 0.1 M HCl) with ZnO NPs (1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 wt.%) were sonicated for 60 to 90 min to disperse NPs homogeneously in the solution. Aniline and ZnO NPs were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Alfa Aesar, respectively. During sonication, {{the temperature of the}} solution was kept below 50 °C to prevent high-temperature agglomeration of the NPs.|$|R
50|$|Venture {{capitalist}} Laurance S. Rockefeller (1910-2004) was {{the fourth}} of the six children of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. In January 1946 he formed Rockefeller Brothers, Inc., {{one of the first}} postwar venture-capital operations, starting with a capitalization of $1.5 million. There were eight partners in all, the five brothers and their sister, Abby, and two non family members Harper Woodward and MIT scientist, Ted Walkowicz. In August 1969, the firm became known as Venrock. Laurance S. Rockefeller became an investor in enterprises based on science and technology. His investment interests included the fields of aviation, aerospace, electronics, high temperature physics, composite materials, optics, lasers, data processing, <b>thermionics,</b> and nuclear power.|$|R
25|$|This {{equation}} {{shows that}} in order to achieve sufficient current density it is necessary to heat the emitter, taking care not to cause damage by application of excessive heat. For this reason materials with either a high melting point, such as tungsten, or those with a low work function (LaB6) are required for the gun filament. Furthermore, both lanthanum hexaboride and tungsten <b>thermionic</b> sources must be heated in order to achieve <b>thermionic</b> emission, this can be achieved by the use of a small resistive strip. To prevent thermal shock, there is often a delay enforced in the application of current to the tip, to prevent thermal gradients from damaging the filament, the delay is usually a few seconds for LaB6, and significantly lower for tungsten.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} also tubes that operate in cold cathode mode, whereby {{electrons}} are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes. This {{does not mean the}} electrodes are cold (indeed, they can be very hot), but it does mean they are operating below their <b>thermionic</b> emission temperature. Because cold cathode lamps have no <b>thermionic</b> emission coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than hot cathode tubes. This quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as backlights in liquid crystal displays). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.|$|E
25|$|The {{photomultiplier}} tube {{is an extremely}} sensitive detector of light, which uses the photoelectric effect and secondary emission, rather than <b>thermionic</b> emission, to generate and amplify electrical signals. Nuclear medicine imaging equipment and liquid scintillation counters use {{photomultiplier tube}} arrays to detect low-intensity scintillation due to ionizing radiation.|$|E
40|$|Special {{attention}} has been given to manned missions to the Moon and Mars not only for exploration, but to establish permanent manned outposts. In order to fulfill such ambitious plans, it is necessary to establish technology bases in the areas of transportation, robotics, life support, and power generation. In the latter area, major {{progress has been made in}} solar dynamics, photovoltaics, heat cycle engines, <b>thermionics,</b> and nuclear space power generation. At the level of the present technology, massive structures are required for power generation, cooling, and shielding. The great mass of these systems will hinder a manned mission from obtaining a reasonable mobility over a planetary surface. For planetary exploration, small wheeled vehicles driven by batteries or fuel cells have been proposed, although other types such as solar or nuclear powered could potentially be used...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of the organization and methodology of the Cogeneration Technology Alternatives Study is presented.

Advanced systems studied include steam turbines, open and closed cycle gas turbines, combined cycles, diesel engines, Stirling engines, phosphoric acid and molten carbonate fuel cells and <b>thermionics.</b> Steam turbines, open cycle gas turbines, combined cycles, and diesel engines were also analyzed in versions typical of today's commercially available technology to provide a base against which to measure the advanced systems.

40|$|CTAS {{compared}} {{and evaluated}} various advanced energy conversion systems that can use coal or coal-derived fuels for industrial cogeneration applications. The principal {{aim of the}} study was to provide information needed by DOE to establish research and development (R&D) funding priorities for advanced-technology systems that could significantly advance the use of coal or coal-derived fuels in industrial cogeneration. Steam turbines, diesel engines, open-cycle gas turbines, combined cycles, closed-cycle gas turbines, Stirling engines, phosphoric acid fuel cells, molten carbonate fuel cells, and <b>thermionics</b> were studied with technology advancements appropriate for the 1985 - 2000 time period. The various advanced systems were compared and evaluated for a wide diversity of representative industrial plants on the basis of fuel energy savings, annual energy cost savings, emissions savings, and rate of return on investment (ROI) as compared with purchasing electricity from a utility and providing process heat with an on-site boiler...|$|R
25|$|In 1873, Frederick Guthrie {{discovered}} the basic principle of operation of <b>thermionic</b> diodes. He {{discovered that a}} positively charged electroscope could be discharged by bringing a grounded piece of white-hot metal close to it (but not actually touching it). The same {{did not apply to}} a negatively charged electroscope, indicating that the current flow was only possible in one direction.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{development}} of silicon semiconductor rectifiers, vacuum tube <b>thermionic</b> diodes and copper oxide- or selenium-based metal rectifier stacks were used. With the introduction of semiconductor electronics, vacuum tube rectifiers became obsolete, except for some enthusiasts of vacuum tube audio equipment. For power rectification from very low to very high current, semiconductor diodes of various types (junction diodes, Schottky diodes, etc.) are widely used.|$|E
25|$|Irving Langmuir at the General Electric {{research}} laboratory (Schenectady, New York) had improved Wolfgang Gaede's high-vacuum diffusion pump {{and used it}} to settle the question of <b>thermionic</b> emission and conduction in a vacuum. Consequently, General Electric started producing hard vacuum triodes (which were branded Pliotrons) in 1915. Langmuir patented the hard vacuum triode, but De Forest and AT successfully asserted priority and invalidated the patent.|$|E
50|$|Physical vapor {{deposition}} {{takes place}} in a vacuum and produces a thin film of solar cells by depositing thin layers of metals onto a backing structure. Electron-beam evaporation uses <b>thermionics</b> emission to create a stream of electrons that are accelerated by a high-voltage cathode and anode arrangement. Electrostatic and magnetic fields focus and direct the electrons to strike a target. The kinetic energy is transformed into thermal energy at or near the surface of the material. The resulting heating causes the material to melt and then evaporate. Temperatures in excess of 3500 degrees Celsius can be reached. The vapor from the source condenses onto a substrate, creating a thin film of high-purity material. Film thicknesses from a single atomic layer to many micrometers can be achieved. This technique is used in microelectronics, optics, and material research, and to produce solar cells and many other products.|$|R
40|$|About fifty {{industrial}} processes from the largest energy consuming sectors {{were used as}} a basis for matching a similar number of energy conversion systems that are considered as candidate which can be made available by the 1985 to 2000 time period.

25|$|When {{the light}} is turned on, the {{electric}} power heats up the cathode enough for it to emit electrons (<b>thermionic</b> emission). These electrons collide with and ionize noble gas atoms inside the bulb surrounding the filament to form a plasma {{by the process of}} impact ionization. As a result of avalanche ionization, the conductivity of the ionized gas rapidly rises, allowing higher currents to flow through the lamp.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets {{had much}} larger rockets and could use vacuum tubes (<b>thermionic</b> valves) in their {{guidance}} systems. (The weights of the Minuteman I and II remain classified, but the Minuteman III was 35,000kg versus the Soviet R-7 missile (1959) of 280,000kg.)

25|$|Valve electrometers use a {{specialized}} vacuum tube (<b>thermionic</b> valve) {{with a very}} high gain (transconductance) and input resistance. The input current is allowed to flow into the high impedance grid, and the voltage so generated is vastly amplified in the anode (plate) circuit. Valves designed for electrometer use have leakage currents as low as a few femtoamperes (10−15 amperes). Such valves must be handled with gloved hands as the salts left on the glass envelope can provide leakage paths for these tiny currents.|$|E

Early cathode ray tubes had been applied experimentally to laboratory measurements {{as early as the}} 1920s, but suffered from poor stability of the vacuum and the cathode emitters.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{wireless}} computing and mobile devices have decreased {{in size and}} power requirements. These devices traditionally had significant power requirements that necessitated the use of batteries as their power source. However, as the power requirements are reducing, with wireless sensor nodes rarely exceeding 75 mW, alternative means of power provision become available. One of these alternatives {{is the use of}} thermal energy harvesting from waste heat or environmental sources. This report discusses the field of thermal energy harvesting, with a particular focus on those thermal technologies that provide direct electricity as output. There are a number of technologies in this field. The general technologies discussed in this report are thermoelectric devices, such as devices utilising the Seebeck effect, thermocouples and, <b>thermionics.</b> Sources of thermal energy discussed include solar, the human body, vehicle exhaust systems and subsurface heating. Solar has an obvious advantage of being a very large source of energy. Cases studies are presented to show magnitudes and the daily variation of power output from Seebeck style thermoelectric devices. Overall, this report reveals that while present thermal energy harvesting technologies suffer from very low efficiencies, {{there are a number of}} promising technologies that are increasing in reliability and efficiency. This, along with a continuing decrease in power requirements on the demand side of the equation, marks thermal energy harvesting as a very promising field of research...|$|R
