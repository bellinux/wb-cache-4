500|$|During the {{reproductive}} season, males splash their urine on their tails and nether regions. To attract females they extrude their soft palate – a trait {{unique to the}} dromedary. As the male gurgles, copious quantities of saliva turns <b>to</b> <b>foam</b> and covers the mouth. Males threaten each other for dominance over the female by trying to stand taller than the other, making low noises {{and a series of}} head movements including lowering, lifting and bending their necks backwards. Males tries to defeat other males by biting the opponent's [...] legs and taking the head between his jaws. Copulation begins with foreplay; the male smells the female's genitalia and often bites her there or around her hump. The male forces the female to sit, then grasps her with his forelegs. Camelmen often aid the male insert his penis into the female's vulva. The male dromedary's [...] ability to penetrate the female on his own is disputed, though feral populations in Australia reproduce naturally. Copulation takes from 7 to 35 minutes, averaging 11 to 15 minutes. Normally, three to four ejaculations occur. The semen of a Bikaneri dromedary is white and viscous, with a pH of around 7.8.|$|E
500|$|By {{this time}} George's health was deteriorating. He had a mental illness, characterised by acute mania, which was {{possibly}} {{a symptom of}} the genetic disease porphyria, although this has been questioned. A study of samples of the King's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic, a possible trigger for the disease. The source of the arsenic is not known, {{but it could have been}} a component of medicines or cosmetics. The King may have had a brief episode of disease in 1765, but a longer episode began in the summer of 1788. At the end of the parliamentary session, he went to Cheltenham Spa to recuperate. It was the furthest he had ever been from London—just short of 100miles (150km)—but his condition worsened. In November he became seriously deranged, sometimes speaking for many hours without pause, causing him <b>to</b> <b>foam</b> at the mouth and making his voice hoarse. His doctors were largely at a loss to explain his illness, and spurious stories about his condition spread, such as the claim that he shook hands with a tree in the mistaken belief that it was the King of Prussia. Treatment for mental illness was primitive by modern standards, and the King's doctors, who included Francis Willis, treated the King by forcibly restraining him until he was calm, or applying caustic poultices to draw out [...] "evil humours".|$|E

40|$|International audienceRemarkable {{properties}} {{have emerged}} recently for aqueous foams including ultrastability and responsiveness. Responsive aqueous <b>foams</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>foams</b> {{for which the}} stability can be switched between stable and unstable states with a change in environment or with external stimuli. Responsive foams have been obtained from various foam stabilizers such as surfactants, proteins, polymers and particles and with various stimuli. Different strategies {{have been developed to}} design this type of soft materials. We briefly review the two main approaches used <b>to</b> obtain responsive <b>foams.</b> The first approach is based on the responsiveness of the interfacial layer surrounding the gas bubbles leading <b>to</b> responsive <b>foams.</b> The second one is based on the modifications occurring in the aqueous phase inside the <b>foam</b> liquid channels <b>to</b> tune the <b>foam</b> stability. We will highlight the most sophisticated approaches which use light, temperature and magnetic field leading <b>to</b> switchable <b>foam</b> stability...|$|R

2500|$|The first plastic {{based on}} a {{synthetic}} polymer was made from phenol and formaldehyde, with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented in 1907, by Leo Hendrik Baekeland, a Belgian-born American living in New York state. Baekeland was looking for an insulating shellac to coat wires in electric motors and generators. He found that combining phenol (C6H5OH) and formaldehyde (HCOH) formed a sticky mass and later found that the material could be mixed with wood flour, asbestos, or slate dust to create strong and fire resistant [...] "composite" [...] materials. The new material tended <b>to</b> <b>foam</b> during synthesis, requiring that Baekeland build pressure vessels to force out the bubbles and provide a smooth, uniform product, as he announced in 1909, in {{a meeting of the}} American Chemical Society. Bakelite was originally used for electrical and mechanical parts, coming into widespread use in consumer goods and jewelry in the 1920s. [...] Bakelite was a purely synthetic material, not derived from living matter. It was also an early thermosetting plastic.|$|E

2500|$|The {{conversion}} of dissolved carbon dioxide to gaseous carbon dioxide forms rapidly expanding gas bubbles in the soda, which pushes the beverage contents {{out of the}} container. Gasses, in general, are more soluble in liquids at elevated pressures. Carbonated sodas contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide under pressure. The solution becomes supersaturated with carbon dioxide when the bottle is opened, and the pressure is released. Under these conditions, carbon dioxide begins to precipitate from solution, forming gas bubbles. Normally, this process is relatively slow, because the activation energy for this process is high. The activation energy for a process like bubble nucleation depends on where the bubble forms. It is highest for bubbles that form in the liquid itself (homogeneous nucleation), and lower if the bubble forms on some other surface (heterogeneous nucleation). When the pressure is released from a soda bottle, the bubbles tend to form {{on the sides of}} the bottle. But because they are smooth and clean, the activation energy is still relatively high, and the process is slow. The addition of other nucleation sites provides an alternative pathway for the reaction to occur with lower activation energy, much like a catalyst. For instance dropping grains of salt or sand into the solution lowers the activation energy, and increases the rate of carbon dioxide precipitation. The physical characteristics of Mentos (surface roughness, easy dissolution into the liquid, etc.) have the effect of drastically reducing the activation energy for carbon dioxide bubble formation, so that the nucleation rate becomes exceedingly high. The activation energy for the release of carbon dioxide from Diet Coke by addition of Mentos has been found to be 25 kJ mol−1. This formation of gaseous carbon dioxide within the water, which due to hydrogen bonding and its high surface tension wants to maintain a connected matrix of molecules, causes the water <b>to</b> <b>foam,</b> ultimately generating the [...] "jet"—or [...] "geyser"—or eruption-like nature of the effusion. The foaming is aided by the presence of chemicals like potassium benzoate and aspartame in Diet Coke, and gelatin and gum arabic in the Mentos candy, all which influence the nature of water's surface tension and degree to which it can foam.|$|E

30|$|Naturally, amphiphile {{molecules}} {{produced by}} bacteria in cultivation processes accumulate at gas–liquid interfaces and lead <b>to</b> massive <b>foam</b> formation. The main challenge in cultivating microorganisms producing biosurfactants is {{to overcome this}} severe foam production. In {{the majority of cases}} foaming is handled by the addition of antifoam agents. Unfortunately, this strategy harbors several disadvantages, as antifoam agents are expensive and very hard to remove in downstream processes. The second most common method <b>to</b> cope with <b>foam</b> formation is <b>to</b> disrupt the <b>foam</b> by shear stress or pressure using foam breakers. However, this method is often insufficient and increases the overall costs for the production of biosurfactants. Another, more elegant, way <b>to</b> manage <b>foaming</b> in biosurfactant production processes is <b>to</b> apply <b>foam</b> fractionation, which was already shown by Cooper et al. 1981 (Cooper et al. 1981). This technique inverts the disadvantage into an advantage by using the accumulation of biosurfactants in the foam for in situ product enrichment and recovery. The Surfactin producer Bacillus subtilis is especially suited for the employment of foam fractionation, yielding high values in product recovery and enrichment (Willenbacher et al. 2014). Although this is a possible way <b>to</b> handle <b>foam</b> and <b>to</b> improve product yields, a realization in industrial scale is probably unrealistic in the near future.|$|R
