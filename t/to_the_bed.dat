5|$|Katy and Shell {{explore and}} enter Hector's bedroom, where {{they find a}} circle of salt around the bed. They hear the bell again and trace the sound to Andras's room. When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's {{deformed}} body is revealed; he is tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and gagged. Katy goes to untie him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is they who rang the bell. They quote Dante's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy {{was chosen as the}} next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy. Shell implies that the church's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Bryson's escape, Berdella was arrested on charges pertaining to the sexual assault of Christopher Bryson. He declined to allow officers inside his home, and the search warrant earlier requested was drafted to search his property. Corroborating Bryson's claims to have been restrained and tortured in a second floor bedroom, investigators discovered the bedroom {{on the second floor}} was found to have burnt ropes attached to the posts {{at the foot of the}} bed. Also in the room was an electrical transformer, plugged into a wall, and with wires leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> A metal tray containing syringes, small bottles apparently containing prescription drugs, swabs, and eye drops was also close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Also found in the room were a long iron pipe, various lengths of rope, and leather belts. Investigators also noted that although Bryson's restraints had been tied to posts at each corner of the bed, other posts on the bed had been extensively worn, suggesting that restraints had earlier been tied to these posts, and that the individual or individuals had struggled to free themselves.|$|E

25|$|By {{the third}} day of his capture, Bryson had earned {{sufficient}} trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a regime of tying his hands in front of him after his sexual abuse rather than above his head and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> upon the excuse that his (Berdella's) doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms; he had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on within the room, with the remote control placed between his legs whenever Berdella was out of the room. However, he would later state to investigators that he had thought almost constantly about escaping. The following day, he managed to break free of his restraints by burning through them using a book of matches Berdella had inadvertently left in the room and within his reach when he had left the house to go to his place of work.|$|E

ARMA 17 - 0108 This paper {{presents}} the theoretical formulation and numerical implementation of an anisotropic damage model for materials with intrinsic transverse isotropy, e. g. sedimentary rocks with a <b>bedding</b> plane. <b>The</b> direction dependent mechanical response is captured by utilizing {{four types of}} equivalent strains, for tension and compression, parallel and perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> plane. <b>The</b> model is calibrated against triaxial compression test data, for different confinement and loading orientations. The variations of uniaxial tensile and compressive strengths with the orientation of <b>the</b> loading relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> follow <b>the</b> trends and magnitudes noted in experiments. Anisotropic non-local equivalent strains were used in <b>the</b> formulation <b>to</b> avoid localization and mesh dependence encountered with strain softening. Two different internal length parameters are used <b>to</b> distinguish <b>the</b> non-local effects along and perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding.</b> An arc length control algorithm is used to avoid convergence issues. Results of three-point bending tests confirm that the nonlocal approach indeed eliminates mesh dependency. Results show that the orientation {{and size of the}} damage process zone are direction dependent, and that materials with intrinsic transverse isotropy exhibit mixed fracture propagation modes except when <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> aligns with <b>the</b> loading direction. Further research towards a multiscale hydro-mechanical fracture propagation scheme is undergoing...|$|R

Ross and his partners had made the house a virtual prison; the windows were covered with thick nylon straps forming a mesh, to prevent escape. The two doors to the room where he was held were guarded. His captors also took his shoes and fitted the room with motion detectors. According to Shupe and Darnell's (2006) account of court testimony, Scott demanded that he be allowed to leave, and asked Ross whether he would try to make him change his religious beliefs. Ross was said to have replied that that was what he was paid to do.

Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10p.m. Everyone knelt down and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth's eyes and joined her hands.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, the meso-failure {{mechanism}} and fracture surface of Jinping marble were investigated {{by means of}} scanning electron microscope (SEM) with bending loading system and laser-scanner equipment. The Yantang and Baishan marbles specimens from Jinping II hydropower station were used. Test {{results show that the}} fracture toughness and mechanical behaviors of Yantang marble were basically higher than those of Baishan marble. This is mainly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that Baishan marble contains a large percentage of dolomite and minor mica. Crack propagation path and fracture morphology indicated that the direction of tensile stress has a significant effect on the mechanical behaviors and fracture toughness of Baishan marble. For Yantang and Baishan marbles, a large number of microcracks around the main crack tip were observed when the direction of tensile stress was parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> plane. Conversely, few microcracks occurred when the direction of tensile stress was perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> plane. <b>The</b> presence {{of a large number of}} microcracks at the main crack tip decreased the global fracture toughness of marble. The results of three-point bending tests showed that the average bearing capacity of intact marble is 3. 4 times the notched marble, but the ductility property of the defective marble after peak load is better than that of the intact marble. Hence, large deformation may be generated before failure of intact marbles at Jinping II hydropower station. The fractal dimension of fracture surface was also calculated by the cube covering method. Observational result showed that the largest fractal dimension of Yantang marble is captured when the direction of tensile stress is parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> plane. However, <b>the</b> fractal dimension of fracture surface of Yantang and Baishan marbles with tensile stress vertical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> plane is relatively small. The fractal dimension can also be used <b>to</b> characterize <b>the</b> roughness of fracture surface of rock materials...|$|R
