However, the traditional chromium(III) tanning process is constantly under threat from the pressure of legislation and ever-tightening restrictions require to minimize chromium-containing effluents discharge and chromium-containing wastes production. Recently, the manufacture and use of chromium(III) free tanning agents compounds have been studied intensively. Aluminum, zirconium and titanium compounds {{has been found to}} be an effective alternative to chromium salts. In particular, titanium is abundant in nature, easily obtainable and non-toxic. So, <b>titanium</b> <b>tanning</b> is one of the most promising replacements for chromium tanning in today’s leather industry. In this study we investigated the use of titanium salts as tanning agent for the production of high quality bovine upper leather. The technical feasibility of the innovative titanium tannage process was experimentally explored. Several experimental activities have been performed, carrying out tests of chrome and <b>titanium</b> <b>tanning</b> on two different types of skins to assess the quality of the finished leathers obtained by new titanium tannage compared to the leathers obtained by traditional chrome tannage. The results have shown that the finished leathers are appropriate for different final uses and are comparable to the ones obtained by the conventional chromium process in terms of physical-mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Conventional chrome-tanning {{process is}} {{constantly}} {{under pressure from}} increasingly stringent environmental regulations on discharges of chromiumcontaining effluents and wastes. For this reason, in the past years alternative chrome-free tanning processes have been developed. Among these, <b>titanium</b> <b>tanning</b> {{is one of the}} most promising substitutes for chromium tanning in today’s leather industry. In this study the use of titanyl sulfate masked with citrate was investigated as tanning agent for the production of high-quality bovine upper leather on pilot scale. Preliminary experimental activities were performed to individuate the minimum citrate/titanium mole ratio to ensure a good titanium sulfate solution stability and minimum quantity of salt (sodium chloride) in pickling solution sufficient to depress acidic swelling of the skins. Ti-tanned leathers produced by the developed Titanning process showed comparable physical–mechanical properties to those of traditionally Cr-tanned leathers, used as control, but a lower hydrothermal stability although acceptable. The Ti-tanned leathers complied with the standards for high-quality upper leather exhibiting better dyeability, due to their higher affinity to anionic dyestuffs, and similar softness, fullness, roundness, and hand compared to the control leathers...|$|E

40|$|The {{chromium}} salt tanning system, {{which is still}} the most popular leather tanning procedure, is undercontinuous pressure from environmental groups and international regulations. Therefore, for many years,numerous experiments have been carried out on chromium-free leather production. In this study, newlyproduced synthetic and inorganic chemicals were used as tanning and pre-tanning agents as an alternativeto a chromium tanning agent. This new <b>titanium</b> based <b>tanning</b> agent, obtained from processing wastesfrom the industry of nonferrous metals, was used as a main tanning agent. In addition, an oligomericmelamine-formaldehyde resin and resorcinol type pre-polymer were used as pre-tanning agents for theproduction of chromium-free leathers.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the {{treatment}} of (poly) trauma patients has changed dramatically. The transition to DCS, for example, {{has led to a}} decrease in morbidity and mortality over the past decades, and is an excellent example of how preventive measures have improved the care of these patients. Aside from DCS, other interventions have also improved the care for the injured patient; however, some important issues remain. Musculoskeletal complications, like implant-related infection and compromised fracture healing, are currently the most important causes for a negative outcome in trauma patients overall. These sometimes complex problems lead to impaired limb function even in the hands of experienced trauma surgeons. Furthermore, they place a cost burden on total healthcare expenditure. Better understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of these complications is essential because this can lead to prevention rather than treatment strategies. Chapter 1 gives a historical overview of {{the treatment of}} polytrauma patients followed by an introduction to the problems regarding these complications that we are facing today. The surgical approach, the fixation device used and further, the design of the chosen fracture fixation device and its application can all influence the susceptibility to musculoskeletal complications. As explained in the literature review in Chapter 2, an understanding of the impact of biomechanical stability on fracture healing and infection has evolved over the past decades. It is now realized that fracture stability is of paramount importance not only for achieving fracture union but also for infection prevention and treatment. Furthermore, the influence of the implant on the outcome in fracture care has been described. Over time different models were created, from the dynamic compression plate (DCP), the limited contact DCP (LC-DCP), through to point contact fixator (PC-Fix) and more recently the locking compression plate (LCP). These devices have been developed to improve fracture healing and reduce soft tissue and vascular damage. It has also been found that these devices have quite a different susceptibility to infection, by reducing the area of necrosis in contact with the bone. Chapter 2 further focuses on the differences between the most widely used metal implants today: usually stainless steel, titanium or <b>titanium</b> alloys (<b>TAN).</b> All these materials offer a good combination of desirable mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Finally, with respect to implant-related infections, research focuses on biofilm forming bacteria. Most antimicrobial agents have a limited efficacy against biofilm infections; therefore, novel preventive and therapeutic options are needed. Local delivery systems, such as implant coatings, could be an asset in this field. Chapter 3 describes the clinical studies that retrospectively identified different risk factors for complications after intramedullary treatment of diaphyseal long bone (humerus, femur and tibia) fractures. It is clear that the region of the tibia is especially prone to complications, although it has to be stated that nonunion is also frequent in femoral shaft fractures. Polytrauma patients seem at risk for nonunion after the intramedullary treatment of tibia shaft fractures. Furthermore, statistically significant longer hospitalization periods can be noted for this patient population, especially after the treatment of femoral shaft fractures. Implant-related infection was predominant in the tibia shaft fracture population. Complications in patients with humeral shaft fractures are less frequent. Consequently, preventive measures should focus initially on lower extremity fractures. In Chapter 4 the results are shown of preclinical research using different rabbit models. The objective of the first study was to provide definitive data on the role of implant material and surface topography in the development of infection in a clinically relevant rabbit fracture model. As mentioned in the literature review (Chapter 2), the metals predominantly used in fracture care today are stainless steel, titanium and titanium alloys. The results in this study did not show a statistical significant difference in infection susceptibility between the different metals. The finding that standard titanium had a lower bacterial burden compared to stainless steel, but only when using a high bacterial inoculate, is interesting and indicates that material may not influence the infection risk, but rather the infection severity. In theory the high bacterial load mimics open fracture cases, where the use of titanium implants could be considered a potential benefit. Furthermore, polished titanium implants with the potential to reduce complications associated with tissue adherence are not expected to affect the infection rate, nor the influence on implant stability. The second preclinical study in Chapter 4 focused on improved infection prophylaxis by providing local delivery of antibiotics directly to the tissue-implant interface in a nonfracture rabbit model. The antibiotic of choice was doxycycline as it has a low resistance to the most commonly encountered microorganisms causing implant-related infections, including MRSA. It was incoorporated into a biodegradable Polymer-Lipid Encapsulation MatriX (PLEX) –coating. The PLEX-doxycycline coating provided complete protection against implant-related MSSA infection, and resulted in a significant {{reduction in the number of}} culture positive samples when challenged with a doxycycline-resistant MRSA. Chapter 5 focuses on a clinical preventive model of implant-related infection in high risk patient populations by using an antibiotic-coated implant. At the time of the study, the only available trauma related implant on the European market was a gentamicin-coated intramedullary tibia nail (Expert Tibia Nail (ETN) PROtectTM). In our patient population no implant-related infections occurred after placement of the gentamicin-coated nail. Following this study and a literature search, antibiotic-coated implants seem to be a potential option for prevention of infection in trauma patients. In the future this statement needs to be confirmed by large randomized clinical trials. Chapter 6 discusses the epidemiology of long bone fractures, but also the functional and socio-economic impact of musculoskeletal complications after the treatment of these fractures. Especially in the field of implant-related infections, musculoskeletal trauma research lags behind orthopaedic arthroplasty research. There is a lack of data regarding the definition, functional outcome and healthcare burden of implant-related infections in fracture care. Future clinical research will need to address this issue. Furthermore, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, particularly MRSA, has become a significant global healthcare issue that has also influenced trauma medicine. AMPs could be a possible positive future perspective. Finally, local delivery systems, such as implant coatings and hydrogels, seem to be a potential option for infection prevention and treatment. nrpages: 225 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In today's move to "sustainable production" {{the leather}} industry, {{as well as}} many other {{industries}} is recognized as a polluting one. Traditional chemical operations are polluting because of the levels of inorganic chemical waste. Process chemicals which are not consumed within the reactions necessary to convert collagen to leather are currently discharged to waste. These are usually applied during bulk production, such as inorganic agents from beam house and tanning processes, e. g. lime, sulphide, ammonium salts, sulphuric acid and sodium chloride, mineral tanning agents – mainly Cr(III) and the less common Al(III), Zr(III), Ti(III), Fe(III) salts -, whereas depending on the tanning process and the leather article produced organic chemical waste discharged comprises aldehydic and polyphenolic tanning products, bating enzymes, organic carboxylic acids and excess electrolyte stable synthetic fat liquors. It is rare for chemicals and water to be recovered for re-use from several of these process steps. Moreover, tanners worldwide are required to operate within strict legislative boundaries. Serious drawbacks continuously arise concerning the chrome–tanning process in leather industry and the environmental hazardous consequences of chromium containing effluents. In order to overcome this impediment, a great deal of research has been focused on developing chrome–free tanning methods in the past years, such as <b>titanium</b> <b>tanning.</b> In the present study, Ti–Al tanned bovine leather was characterized by means of SEM microscopy, EDAX elemental analysis, ATR–FTIR spectroscopy, thermogravimetry TGA, and differential scanning calorimetry DSC techniques. ...|$|E
40|$|A review {{across the}} {{periodic}} table of tanning effects of simple inorganic compounds reveals that many elements are capable of being used to make leather. But, if the practical criteria of effectiveness, availability, toxicity and cost are applied, the useflul options reduce to chromium ([III) the benchmark orto titanium (IV) zucomum ([V) iron (II/III) and aluminium ([II) For mainly environmental reasons, alternative tanning agents to chromium are needed, However. none so far investigated match the all round properties achieved with chromium (III) salts. In tanning terms, the chemistry of titanium (IV) {{is dominated by the}} titanyl ion, TiO 2, limiting its reactivity with collagen. An alternative approach to <b>titanium</b> <b>tanning,</b> using metastable titanium (III) salts as possible tanning agents, was investigated in this study. A method to determine the titanium content in leathers was developed. Complexes of Ti (III) were investigated using various spectroscopic techniques, including uv/vis spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, electron nuclear double resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance dispersion spectroscopies. The complexes used in subsequent tanning studies were based on titanium (III) citrate, gluconate and tartrate. However, in comparative trials with chromium (III) salts, the study highlighted that titanium (III) salts were not suitable for tanning collagen. Titanium (III) saks were found to be useflul in the production of semi- metal tamlages. The research was extended to investigate the hydrothermal shrinking of tanned collagen. Techniques such as extended x-ray absorption — fine structure and x-ray absorption near structure were used to investigate the interaction of chromium (III) tanning salts and titanium (III) complexes with collagen. The research demonstrated that the shrinking reaction is independent of the tannage. It involves instead the breaking of hydrogen bonds, rather than the breakdown of the tannin-collagen molecule. From this work, and a reappraisal of older work on the shrinking reaction, a new theory of tanning has been formulated based on co-operating units and the role of crystallinity in stabilising the collagen structure. The influence of the solvent is also discussed...|$|E
