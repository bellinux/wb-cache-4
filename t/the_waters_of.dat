40|$|AbstractThe earthy <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and Negrine are {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} a very large quantity of calcium carbonate on surfaces of the domestic facilities and industrial during their circulation. This deposit has very serious technical consequences. <b>The</b> study <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two sources Hamma and Negrine showed that this water is furring and their hardness is about 59 °F for <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and 56 °F for <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Negrine. In this study we used the chronoamperometric method [1] for: to determine the furring capacity <b>of</b> raw <b>water</b> <b>of</b> each source (Hamma and Negrine) which is characterized by the time of scaling and the residual current. to evaluate the influence of the temperature on the furring capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Negrine. to study the effect of the chemical inhibitor (HEDP) on <b>the</b> furring capacity <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and Negrine. The application of the chronoamperometric method to the temperature of 30 °C on raw <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Hamma gave a time of scaling of 9. 7 min for <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and 13. 5 min for <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Negrine. These values increase with: -the reduction in <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> raw <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and Negrine. the addition of the inhibitor: HEDP with weak concentrations. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> treatment <b>of</b> Hamma and Negrine by the HEDP delays the formation of the tartar starting from the addition of the concentration of 0, 005 mg/L of addition of the HEDP on <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Hamma and 10 μg/L of addition of the HEDP on <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Negrine.
