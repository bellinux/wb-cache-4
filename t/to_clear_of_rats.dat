50|$|Until the Campbell Islands were <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> {{introduced}} <b>rats</b> in 2001, Jacquemart {{was also}} the last refuge of the Campbell snipe, a subspecies of Subantarctic snipe first discovered in 1997 and described in 2009. After the eradication <b>of</b> <b>rats</b> the snipe began to recolonise {{the rest of the}} group, with a small breeding population discovered in 2005 on southern Campbell Island opposite Jacquemart.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the coming}} of Grimgor, the upper levels of Karak Ungor was held by the Night Goblin tribe known as the Red Eyes. The Red Eyes, for many years, had been battling with a foe for the lower reaches of the dwarves hold. These foes were the Skaven of Clan Mor and Clan Moulder. Upon hearing of the Skaven below Grimgor and his Black Orcs quickly joined the battle. Hundreds of Skaven died at the hand of Grimgor and his boyz but this, unsurprisingly, seemed not to matter to the Skaven. Every time that one force was {{destroyed}} and the tunnels <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>rats,</b> new hidden tunnels would be discovered and hundreds more Skaven would leap {{out of the darkness}} to attack the Orcs and Goblins of Grimgor’s army.|$|R

25|$|Campbell Island is a sub Antarctic island 700km {{south of}} New Zealand that became infested with rats in the 19th century. Several endemic birds, {{including}} the Campbell teal and Campbell snipe, only survived on small rocky islets {{just off the}} island, and the populations were perilously low. Several teals were taken into captivity for ex-situ conservation, but once they had bred in captivity there was no-where else to return them to until the island was <b>cleared</b> <b>of</b> <b>rats.</b> The DOC's plan to remove rats from the island {{was one of the}} most ambitious attempted, as the island was so remote, the rat populations had the highest density <b>of</b> <b>rats</b> anywhere in the world, the weather treacherous and, at 113km2, it was the largest island at that point where eradication had been attempted. The poison had to be dropped in the winter, to minimize disturbance to nesting seabirds and reduce the chance of bird strike for the pilots. After several experiments, the eradication began in 2001. In 2003 trackers with dogs were unable to find any rats. Soon after the island was cleared it was possible to return the teals to the island. Snipe have self-reintroduced to the island and have begun breeding.|$|R
