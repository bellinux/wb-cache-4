He signed up with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA) for whom he appeared in a wide range of shows and also in his own one-man engagements. He would sometimes turn up unannounced to perform at hospitals, munition factories, airfields, anti-aircraft posts and other venues where there was an audience of just a few people.|$|E
5|$|Born in Ireland, Daily {{first began}} playing {{baseball}} professionally around the Baltimore area, often receiving more lucrative offers {{to play in}} more prominent leagues, all of which he declined, preferring {{to stay in the}} local area. His reputation, along with actions such as verbally assaulting umpires and fans, forced him to move on to other teams, which landed him in New York City playing for the Metropolitans, which was an all-professional club but had yet to join a major league; they later joined the National League in 1883. He became the team's ace pitcher, winning 38games, including notable victories against Cap Anson's Chicago White Stockings, and most of the other top professional teams in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E

40|$|This paper applies {{univariate}} and panel {{data unit}} root tests to annual panel data for 182 <b>countries</b> over <b>the</b> period 1979 - 2000 {{to examine the}} stationarity properties of per capita energy consumption. The univariate unit root test can only reject the unit root null for 29 per cent of <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 10 per cent level or better without a trend and 37 per cent of <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 10 per cent level or better with a trend. However, it is often argued that unit root tests have low power with short spans of data and therefore failure to reject the unit root null should be treated with caution. When we apply the panel data unit root test we find overwhelming evidence that energy consumption is stationary. We discuss {{the implications of these}} findings for econometric modeling and policy formulation. Energy consumption, Unit roots, Panel data...|$|R
5|$|Florida State's {{defense was}} ranked No. 43 in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{conclusion}} of the regular season. The Seminoles allowed 356.36 yards per game, on average. State's rushing defense was ranked No. 32 (126 ypg), while its passing defense was ranked No. 76 (230.36 ypg). The Seminoles' defensive squad was led by middle linebacker Bradley Jennings, who had 121 tackles during the regular season—the most on the team. Defensive tackle Darnell Dockett also was a standout performer statistically for the Seminoles, leading the team in tackles for loss and setting the single-season and single-game Florida State records in that category.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, a huge {{general strike}} took place across <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{instigation}} of the Belgian Workers' Party {{on the issue}} of voting rights. The system of plural voting, in force since 1893, was extremely unpopular because of its perceived unfairness, but also because the system tended to favor the Catholic Party. Although between 300,000 and 450,000 workers were involved, the strike was ultimately unsuccessful. The party voted in favor ending the strike and taking future action by parliamentary means, on 22 April 1913.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} after the storm, the Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Mounted Police {{operated}} search and rescue missions, while families waited on the beach. The Canadian Red Cross set up headquarters in Escuminac to assist the victims. Due to storm fatalities, 24adults became widows, and 83children lost a father. As a result, the New Brunswick Fishermen's Disaster Fund was created to assist the families. The fund raised $400,000 in a few months from donations from throughout Canada, as well as Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, the latter who was on a tour of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E

5|$|On 9 July 1960, {{there was}} a Force Publique mutiny at Camp Massart at Elizabethville; five or seven Europeans were killed. The army revolt and {{resulting}} rumours caused severe panic across the country, and Belgium despatched troops and the naval Task Group 218.2 to protect its citizens. Belgian troops intervened in Elisabethville and Luluabourg (10 July), Matadi (11 July), Leopoldville (13 July) and elsewhere. There were immediate suspicions that Belgium planned to re-seize the country while doing so. Large numbers of Belgian colonists fled <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, on 11 July, Moise Tshombe declared the independence of Katanga province in the south-east, closely backed by remaining Belgian administrators and soldiers.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to Wales, Beadles played for his local side Newtown during the 1919–20 season, winning the Montgomeryshire & District Football League. The {{following}} year, he moved to Merseyside, where he turned out for amateur team Graysons of Garston of the West Cheshire Association Football League, an amateur side that represented a local shipping company, whilst also working for the company. Beadles often commented on his role at the company to family members, believing he was only employed due to his footballing skills as he would spend most working days making tea. In June 1921, he signed for Liverpool, {{one of the leading}} teams in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, along with teammate Danny Shone.|$|E
5|$|The Allied plan to aid Belgium was the Dyle Plan; {{the cream}} of the Allied forces, which {{included}} the French armoured divisions, would advance to the Dyle river in response to a German invasion. The choice of an established Allied line lay in either reinforcing the Belgians in the east of <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Meuse–Albert Canal line, and holding the Scheldt Estuary, thus linking the French defences in the south with the Belgian forces protecting Ghent and Antwerp, seemed to be the soundest defensive strategy.|$|E

5|$|The Dominican Republic had {{its second}} war for {{independence}} in 1844, which {{was successful in}} obtaining independence from Haiti. Spain reannexed <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> request of its then-dictator, Gen. Pedro Santana (who attempted to benefit personally from the event), in 1861. A third revolt, the War of Restoration, sought independence from the Spanish in 1863. Its leaders used Haiti as a guerrilla base, since the Haitian government feared a Spanish takeover and the restoration of slavery in the occupied territories, and was thus sympathetic to their cause. Their stronghold, however, was the Cibao valley in the northeastern part of Hispaniola.|$|E

5|$|The New York Times printed two {{versions}} of the raids on its front page, one by David Halberstam implicating Nhu for the attacks, and another with the official government version. Sheehan of United Press International also claimed Nhu was responsible for the attacks, and foreign journalists had to smuggle their stories out by asking people leaving <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airport to carry documents for them. At the time, Sheehan and Halberstam were on a Ngô family hit list along with political dissidents because of their exposes of the regime's human rights abuses, and following the raids, they slept at the home of John Mecklin, a U.S. official. They also received information that the Ngos were going to plant bombs in their offices and blame the deaths on the communists.|$|E

On 11 March 1991 it was released from active military service and reverted to reserve status. The next day, while still in the country, the brigade was one of numerous units thought to have been exposed to chemical agents released during the Khamisiyah Pit demolition.

5|$|The ground {{remained}} {{much the}} same until 1928, when the Kop was redesigned and extended to hold 30,000spectators, all standing. A roof was erected as well. Many stadia in England had stands named after the Spion Kop. Anfield's was the largest Kop in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time—it was able to hold more supporters than some entire football grounds. In the same year the topmast of the , {{one of the first}} iron ships, was rescued from the ship breaking yard at nearby Rock Ferry, and was hauled up Everton Valley by a team of horses, to be erected alongside the new Kop. It still stands there, serving as a flag pole.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of numbers}} and {{political}} isolation of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time caused {{the creation of}} a new breed quite distinct from the former English style toy dog as breeders sought to stabilise the remaining toy sized terriers into a standard breed. The resulting contemporary Russian Toy has most of the features of the classic toy terrier, with the addition of some new characteristics. The head is high but not wide, the cheeks are flat and the eyes are round. By 1960, 76 dogs were entered into an exhibition and the first standard for the two Russian Toy varieties was written in 1966 and authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture.|$|E
