5|$|The {{calls of}} the two species are not similar. <b>The</b> <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greater melampitta is a double or triple note, which is slurred and {{repeated}} monotonously, and {{is reminiscent of the}} black pitohui. <b>The</b> <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lesser melampitta are either harsh buzzy notes or chirped whistles, both of which are repeated at intervals.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Siberian accentor is a trisyllabic ti-ti-ti. The male's song, given {{from the}} top of a bush or tree, is a loud, high chirichiriri, {{variously}} described as {{similar to that of the}} Japanese accentor, the dunnock or the black-throated accentor. Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly at dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great spotted {{woodpecker}} is a sharp kik, {{which may}} be repeated as a wooden rattling krrarraarr if the bird is disturbed.

5|$|The yodel is a {{long and}} complex call made only by the male.

5|$|Several novels, {{books and}} poems were {{generated}} {{as a consequence}} of the Klondike gold rush. The writer Jack London incorporated scenes from the gold rush into his novels set in the Klondike, including <b>The</b> <b>Call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wild, a novel about a sledge dog. His colleague, poet Robert W. Service, did not join the rush himself, although he made his home in Dawson City in 1908. Service created well-known poems about the gold rush, among them Songs of a Sourdough, one of the bestselling books of poetry in the first decade of the 20th century, along with his novel, The Trail of '98, which was written by hand on wallpaper in one of Dawson's log cabins. The Canadian historian Pierre Berton grew up in Dawson where his father had been a prospector, and wrote several historical books about the gold rush, such as The Last Great Gold Rush. The experiences of the Irish Micí Mac Gabhann resulted the posthumous work Rotha Mór an tSaoil (translated into English as The Hard Road to Klondike in 1962), a vivid description of the period.|$|E
5|$|The water pipit's song is {{delivered}} from a perch or in flight, {{and consists of}} four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill. <b>The</b> <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water pipit is a single or double sharp “dzip” or similar, slightly harsher than soft sip sip sip of the meadow pipit or the shrill pseep of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin fist flight call is intermediate between the sip of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's feest. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies A. s. coutellii is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.|$|E
5|$|Black drongos {{become active}} very early {{at dawn and}} roost later than many other birds. They feed mainly on insects such as grasshoppers, cicadas, termites, wasps, bees, ants, moths, beetles and dragonflies. They {{sometimes}} fly close to tree branches, attempting to disturb any insects that may be present. They congregate in fields that are being ploughed, picking up exposed caterpillars and beetle grubs. As many as 35 birds have been seen at such congregations. They are also attracted to fires in scrub and grasslands habitats where insects are disturbed. They appear to avoid flies. They associate with common mynas, cattle egrets and other birds that share a similar diet and habitat. Drongos benefit from this association and are more successful in their foraging. There is only partial overlap in the insect prey sought by mynas and drongos although in rare instances the drongos may rob prey from mynas. It is said that they imitate <b>the</b> <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shikra so as to put mynas to flight and then to steal prey. Similar behaviour, using false alarm calls, has been noted in the fork-tailed drongo. There are some cases of the black drongo preying on small birds, reptiles, or maybe even bats. They have also been on occasion seen feeding on fish Flowers of trees such as Erythrina and Bombax may be visited for water and nectar and they are sometimes known to feed on grains. They are only rarely known to take larger arthropods such as scorpions and centipedes. They feed on milkweed butterflies that are often avoided by other predators and are known to feed {{late in the evening}} or night, often on insects attracted to artificial lights.|$|E

Among the Asian genera the Sumatran trogon (Apalharpactes) has <b>the</b> most atypical <b>call</b> <b>of</b> any trogon, research has not yet established whether the closely related Javan trogon has a similar <b>call.</b> <b>The</b> <b>calls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other Asian genus, Harpactes, are remarkably uniform. In addition to the territorial and breeding calls given by males and females during the breeding seasons, trogons have been recorded as having aggression calls given by competing males and alarm calls.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Ethics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 In 1996, {{socio-economic}} {{rights were}} included in <b>the</b> Constitution <b>of</b> South Africa as fundamental human rights. The state is thus compelled to give attention to <b>the</b> protection <b>of</b> people's socioeconomic rights. The question is: Is it <b>the</b> duty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state alone, or does the church also have a calling with regard to socio-economic rights? In this study, <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church with regard to <b>the</b> protection <b>of</b> socio-economic rights in South Africa is researched. Firstly, socio-economic rights as ethical principle are evaluated in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scripture. The conclusion is that socio-economic rights are important human rights that can be grounded as fundamental human rights. Thereafter, <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> socio-economic rights is researched and evaluated. In <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> socio-economic rights, it is grounded in <b>the</b> natural dignity <b>of</b> a human being. However, the Bible teaches that God gave people dignity. <b>The</b> history <b>of</b> socio-economic rights in South Africa is also researched and evaluated. South Africa {{has a long history}} of colonialism, segregation and apartheid, and the church has not always been an effective advocate for socio-economic rights. To understand <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church with regard to socio-economic rights, <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church in society is researched. Views of different church and theological traditions are researched and evaluated. The reformed view focuses on <b>the</b> kingdom <b>of</b> God, and <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church with regard to socio-economic rights is described as worship, fellowship, testimony and service. In conclusion, concrete guidelines of how to be an advocate for socio-economic rights are given to the church. Doctora...|$|R
