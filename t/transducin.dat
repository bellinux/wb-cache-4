25|$|Achromatopsia {{has also}} been called rod monochromacy and total {{congenital}} color blindness. Individuals with the congenital form of this condition show complete absence of cone cell activity via electroretinography at high light levels. There are at least four genetic causes of congenital ACHM, two of which involve cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (ACHM2/ACHM3), a third involves the cone photoreceptor <b>transducin</b> (GNAT2, ACHM4), and the last remains unknown.|$|E
25|$|The known {{causes of}} the {{congenital}} forms of achromatopsia are all due to malfunction of the retinal phototransduction pathway. Specifically, this form of ACHM seems to result from the inability of cone cells to properly respond to light input by hyperpolarizing. Known genetic causes of this are mutations in the cone cell cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels CNGA3 (ACHM2) and CNGB3 (ACHM3) {{as well as the}} cone cell <b>transducin,</b> GNAT2 (ACHM4).|$|E
25|$|As in {{vertebrate}} vision, visual transduction in invertebrates occurs via a G protein-coupled pathway. However, in vertebrates, the G {{protein is}} <b>transducin,</b> while the G protein in invertebrates is Gq (dgq in Drosophila). When rhodopsin (Rh) absorbs a photon of light its chromophore, 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal, is isomerized to all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal. Rh undergoes a conformational change into its active form, metarhodopsin. Metarhodopsin activates Gq, {{which in turn}} activates a phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) known as NorpA.|$|E
40|$|Signaling by heterotrimeric GTP-binding {{proteins}} (G proteins) drives numer-ous cellular processes. The {{number of}} G protein molecules activated by a sin-gle membrane receptor is a determinant of signal amplification, although {{in most cases}} this parameter remains unknown. In retinal rod photoreceptors, a long-lived photoisomerized rhodopsin molecule activates many G protein molecules (<b>transducins),</b> yielding substantial amplification and a large elemen-tary (single-photon) response, before rhodopsin activity is terminated. Here we report that the elementary response in olfactory transduction is ex-tremely small. A ligand-bound odorant receptor has a low probability of activating even one G protein molecule because the odorant dwell-time is very brief. Thus, signal amplification in olfactory transduction appears fundamentally {{different from that of}} phototransduction. Odorants activate specific receptor proteins (1) on the cilia of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and, by way of a G protein (...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPhotolyzed {{rhodopsin}} (R∗) catalyzes GTP-binding to α-transducins (Tα); Tα-GTPs then activate cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). PDE activation {{is arrested}} by ATP in two ways: (i) initial velocity is suppressed, and (ii) PDE velocity rapidly returns to preactivation levels (turnoff). Arrestin (a 48 kDa protein) markedly enhances turnoff while not affecting initial velocity. Arrestin {{in the presence}} of ATP achieves rapid turnoff by directly inhibiting activated PDE, as indicated by its ability to inhibit the direct activation of PDE by Tα-GMP-PNP (guanylyl-imidodiphosphate). Double reciprocal plots reveal a competition between arrestins and activated <b>transducins</b> for sites on PDE. Blocking R∗ phosphorylation blocks initial velocity suppression but does not disturb rapid turnoff. Our data suggest a 2 -fold mechanism for PDE deactivation: (i) formation of Tα. GTPs is suppressed by R∗ phosphorylation, while (ii) activation of PDE by Tα·GTPs is competitively inhibited by arrestins when ATP is present...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} cDNAs for a gene coding for a G protein alpha subunit from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum, cv. VF 36). This gene, named TGA 1, {{was isolated}} using a cDNA of the Arabidopsis thaliana G protein alpha subunit-encoding gene, GPA 1, as a DNA probe. The sequences of four cDNA clones {{indicate that the}} deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of the gene product (TG alpha 1) has 384 aa (44906 Da). The predicted TG alpha 1 protein exhibits similarity to all known G protein alpha subunits. The aa are 84. 6 % identical and 93 % similar (identical and conservative changes) to A. thaliana GP alpha 1, and 34 % identical and 59 % similar to mammalian <b>transducins.</b> Furthermore, it has all of the consensus regions for a GTP-binding protein. Finally, hybridizations of tomato genomic DNA indicate that TGA 1 is a single-copy gene...|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} retinal {{molecular}} pathway defects have been matched to multiple known RP gene mutations. Mutations in the rhodopsin gene, {{which is responsible}} for the majority of autosomal-dominantly inherited RP cases, disrupts the rod-opsin protein essential for translating light into decipherable electrical signals within the phototransduction cascade of the central nervous system. Defects in the activity of this G-protein-coupled receptor are classified into distinct classes that depend on the specific folding abnormality and the resulting molecular pathway defects. The Class I mutant protein's activity is compromised as specific point mutations in the protein-coding amino acid sequence affect the pigment protein's transportation into the outer segment of the eye, where the phototransduction cascade is localized. Additionally, the misfolding of Class II rhodopsin gene mutations disrupts the protein's conjunction with 11-cis-retinal to induce proper chromophore formation. Additional mutants in this pigment-encoding gene affect protein stability, disrupt mRNA integrity post-translationally, and affect the activation rates of <b>transducin</b> and opsin optical proteins.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{molecular}} pathomechanism of ACHM is either {{the inability to}} properly control or respond to altered levels of cGMP. cGMP is particularly important in visual perception as its level controls the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGs). Decreasing the concentration of cGMP results in closure of CNGs and resulting hyperpolarization and cessation of glutamate release. Native retinal CNGs are composed of 2 α- and 2 β-subunits, which are CNGA3 and CNGB3, respectively, in cone cells. When expressed alone, CNGB3 cannot produce functional channels, whereas {{this is not the}} case for CNGA3. Coassembly of CNGA3 and CNGB3 produces channels with altered membrane expression, ion permeability (Na+ vs. K+ and Ca2+), relative efficacy of cAMP/cGMP activation, decreased outward rectification, current flickering, and sensitivity to block by L-cis-diltiazem. Mutations tend to result in the loss of CNGB3 function or gain of function (often increased affinity for cGMP) of CNGA3. cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of the cone cell <b>transducin,</b> GNAT2. Mutations in GNAT2 tend to result in a truncated and, presumably, non-functional protein, thereby preventing alteration of cGMP levels by photons. There is a positive correlation between the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the achromatopsia phenotype.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Two {{cell lines}} derived from ocular tumors of a {{transgenic}} mouse expressing the SV 40 large T antigen {{have been established}} as models of human retinoblastoma. One line, TM, originated from a metastasis, and the other, TE, originated from the primary tumor. The authors compared these two lines with the normal adult mouse eye by analysis of the expression of five photoreceptor cell-specific proteins: IRBP, opsin, rod- and cone-specific <b>transducins,</b> and S-antigen. The authors sought to determine which of these proteins was expressed qualitatively and to examine semi-quantitatively {{for changes in the}} levels of expression in the cell lines. Method. Western blot analysis was used to detect photoreceptor-specific intracellular or secreted proteins. Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells or from mouse adult whole eye. Specific messenger levels in total RNA were determined either by northern hybridization analysis or by a semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), coupled to complementary DNA (cDNA) substrates prepared from total RNA. Results. IRBP was present in the retinoblastoma cell lines and secreted into the medium. Neither S-antigen nor opsin were detectable by immunoblotting. IRBP and cone transduci...|$|R
40|$|The RGS {{proteins}} are GTPase activating {{proteins that}} accelerate the deactivation of G proteins {{in a variety}} of signalling pathways in eukaryotes(1 - 6). RGS 9 deactivates the G proteins (<b>transducins)</b> in the rod and cone phototransduction cascades(7, 8). It is anchored to photoreceptor membranes by the transmembrane protein R 9 AP (RGS 9 anchor protein), which enhances RGS 9 activity up to 70 -fold(9 - 11). If RGS 9 is absent or unable to interact with R 9 AP, there is a substantial delay in the recovery from light responses in mice(4, 12, 13). We identified five unrelated patients with recessive mutations in the genes encoding either RGS 9 or R 9 AP who reported difficulty adapting to sudden changes in luminance levels mediated by cones. Standard visual acuity was normal to moderately subnormal, but the ability to see moving objects, especially with low-contrast, was severely reduced despite full visual fields; we have termed this condition bradyopsia. To our knowledge, these patients represent the first identified humans with a phenotype associated with reduced RGS activity in any organ...|$|R

The sequences of genomic and cDNA clones indicate that GPA 1 has 14 exons, and the deduced amino acid sequence shows that the GPA 1 gene product (GP{alpha} 1) has 383 amino acid residues (44, 582 Da).

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether the human Müller cell line Moorfields/Institute of Ophthalmology-Müller 1 (MIO-M 1) expresses opsins. Methods: The gene expression of opsins was determined by reverse-transcription PCR (RT–PCR). The presence of opsin proteins was determined by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. The light sensitivity of the cells was examined with imaging experiments using the calcium-sensitive dye Fluo- 4. Results: MIO-M 1 cells express glial (glutamine synthase [GLUL], vimentin [VIM], glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein [RLBP 1], glial high-affinity glutamate transporter [SLCA 1], aquaporin- 4 [AQP 4], inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir 4. 1 [Kir 4. 1]), neuronal (Thy- 1 cell surface antigen [THY 1], heavy neurofilament polypeptide [NEFH], microtubule-associated protein 2 [MAP 2], neurogenic differentiation 1 [NEUROD 1], neuronal nuclei [NEUN]), and neural progenitor markers (Nestin [NES], paired-type homeobox transcription factor [PAX 6], neurogenic locus notch homolog 1 [NOTCH 1]). The cells contain mRNA for the following opsins: blue opsin (OPN 1 SW), rhodopsin (OPN 2), panopsin (OPN 3), melanopsin (OPN 4), neuropsin (OPN 5), and peropsin (RRH), {{as well as for}} the <b>transducins</b> (guanine nucleotide binding protein [GNAZ], alpha transducing activity polypeptide 1 [GNAT 1], alpha transducing activity polypeptide 2 [GNAT 2]).

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, we demonstrated that a gene coding for a protein homologous to the alpha subunit of mammalian guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory (G) proteins occurs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene, designated GPA 1, encodes a protein (GP 1 alpha) of 472 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 54, 075. Here we report {{the isolation of}} another G-protein-homologous gene, GPA 2, which encodes an amino acid sequence of 449 amino acid residues with a Mr of 50, 516. The predicted primary structure of the GPA 2 -encoded protein (GP 2 alpha) is homologous to mammalian G proteins [inhibitory and stimulatory G proteins (Gi and Gs, respectively), a G protein of unknown function (Go), and <b>transducins</b> (Gt) ] as well as yeast GP 1 alpha. When aligned with the alpha subunit of Gi (Gi alpha) to obtain maximal homology, GP 2 alpha was found to contain a stretch of 83 additional amino acid residues near the NH 2 terminus. The gene was mapped in chromosome V, close to the centromere. Haploid cells carrying a disrupted GPA 2 gene are viable. Cells carrying a high copy number of plasmid GPA 2 (YEpGPA 2) had markedly elevated levels of cAMP and could suppress a temperature-sensitive mutation of RAS 2. These results suggest that GPA 2 {{may be involved in}} the regulation of cAMP levels in S. cerevisiae...|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{structural}} {{similarity to}} <b>transducin,</b> gustducin was predicted to activate a phosphodiesterase (PDE). Phosphodieterases {{were found in}} taste tissues and their activation was tested in vitro with both gustducin and <b>transducin.</b> This experiment revealed <b>transducin</b> and gustducin were both expressed in taste tissue (1:25 ratio) and that both G proteins are capable of activating retinal PDE. Furthermore, when present with denatonium and quinine, both G proteins can activate taste specific PDEs. This indicated that both gustducin and <b>transducin</b> are important in the signal transduction of denatonium and quinine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transducin</b> is a 3-subunit guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) which {{stimulates the}} {{coupling}} of rhodopsin and cGMP-phoshodiesterase during visual impulses.

50|$|<b>Transducin</b> is {{activated}} by metarhodopsin II, a conformational change in rhodopsin {{caused by the}} absorption of a photon by the rhodopsin moiety retinal. The light causes isomerization of retinal from 11-cis to all-trans. Isomerization causes {{a change in the}} opsin to become metarhodopsin II. When metarhodopsin activates <b>transducin,</b> the guanosine diphosphate (GDP) bound to the α subunit (Tα) is exchanged for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) from the cytoplasm. The α subunit dissociates from the βγ subunits (Tβγ.) Activated <b>transducin</b> α-subunit activates cGMP phosphodiesterase cGMP phosphodiesterase breaks down cGMP, an intracellular second messenger which opens cGMP-gated cation channels. Phosphodiesterase hydrolyzes cGMP to 5’-GMP. Decrease in cGMP concentration leads to decreased opening of cation channels and subsequently, hyperpolarization of the membrane potential.|$|E

50|$|However, the two {{proteins}} {{have similar}} mechanism and capabilities. <b>Transducin</b> removes the inhibition from cGMP Phosphodiesterase, {{which leads to}} the breakdown of cGMP. Similarly, α-gustducin binds the inhibitory subunits of taste cell cAMP Phosphodiesterase which causes a decrease in cAMP levels. Also, the terminal 38 amino acids of α-gustducin and α-transducin are identical. This suggests that gustducin can interact with opsin and opsin-like G-coupled receptors. Conversely, this also suggests that <b>transducin</b> can interact with taste receptors.|$|E

50|$|For deactivation, {{hydrolysis}} of the bound GTP by the Tα {{is necessary}} for Tα deactivation and returning the <b>transducin</b> to its basal from. However, simple hydrolysis of GTP {{may not necessarily be}} enough to deactivate PDE. Tβγ comes into play here again with an important role in PDE deactivation. The addition of Tβγ arrests inhibition of the PDE catalytic moiety because it binds with the Tα-GTP complex. The reassociated form of <b>transducin</b> is not able to bind to PDE any longer. This frees PDE to recouple to photolyzed rhodopsin and return PDE to its initial state to await activation by another GTP bound Tα.|$|E

5000|$|Rhodopsin Kinase is {{involved}} in mammalian rod cells specifically with photo transduction. G coupled-protein receptor kinases are the family that rhodopsin kinase belong to.

Dim flash response is activated in dim light and its ideal to de-activate the rod cell photoreceptor or rhodopsin over time. GRK1 AND GRK7 exist and are isoforms of rhodopsin kinase. Studies have proven that in mice rod cells, GRK1 has competition with arrestin-1 for the binding site of rhodopsin. Arrestin-1 when bound to rhodopsin inhibits signaling and turns off photo-transduction completely. As with any enzyme, rhodopsin kinase has a regulator or inhibitor known as recoverin. In the dark state of the rod cells recoverin inhibits rhodopsin kinase. Specifically, a study has proven that GRK1 acts on the cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin both the second and third loops. The cytoplasmic loops act specifically where <b>transducin</b> binds to rhodopsin so this allows GRK1 and <b>transducin</b> to compete for the binding site on rhodopsin.
