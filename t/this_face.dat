5|$|The east face of {{the eastern}} wing has four bays with canted bay windows, shaped end gables and a central cartouche. In {{the centre of the}} {{northern}} (garden) face is a large bow window, originally Jacobean, which illuminates the chapel; it has stone panels decorated with cartouches below arched stained glass lights. <b>This</b> <b>face</b> otherwise reverses the main façade, with the addition of mezzanine windows.|$|E
5|$|The south (front) face of {{the eastern}} wing has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet at eaves level. The central bay is set forward to form a stone centrepiece around the arched main {{entrance}}, which is flanked by fluted Ionic columns. Immediately above the entrance are doubled tapering pilasters flanking a three-light window, all surmounted by a large cartouche decorated with strapwork. On {{the first floor of}} the central bay is a triple-mullion window, and above the parapet is a coat of arms. Flanking the centrepiece are two bays with diapered brickwork and single-mullion windows. The two ends of the south face are also set forward; they have canted, triple-mullion bay windows and are surmounted above the parapet by shaped gables with attic windows. All the main windows of <b>this</b> <b>face</b> are double transomed.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{is usually}} easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion {{with the common}} firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of <b>this</b> <b>face</b> pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could {{be more difficult to}} distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.|$|E

25|$|The scenes on <b>this</b> <b>face</b> of the calvary are in granite and in {{high relief}} {{and deal with}} Original sin, the Resurrection and The Last Judgement.|$|E
25|$|The eastern face of {{the north}} wing has a {{metallic}} framework of curved metal bars holding sections of stationary louvers. It covers all bays on the upper storeys. There are no windows on the ground level of <b>this</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Facade: The {{outside of}} the church, where the main doors are located. In {{traditional}} medieval design, <b>this</b> <b>faced</b> the west and is called the West End.|$|R
50|$|The Trippet {{stones were}} {{examined}} in 1908 by H. St. George Gray who excavated the nearby Stripple stones in 1905 and found a few flint flakes and an entrance from <b>this</b> <b>facing</b> southwest, directly towards the Trippet stones.|$|R
50|$|Another {{aspect of}} drug {{pollution}} prevention is environmental law and regulation, although <b>this</b> <b>faces</b> problems of enforcement costs, enforcement corruption and negligence (see below), and, where enforcement succeeds, increased costs of doing business. The lobbying of {{pros and cons}} is ongoing.|$|R
25|$|On <b>this</b> <b>face</b> {{we have a}} {{depiction}} of Jesus carrying the cross, Simon of Cyrene helping him. Jesus is surrounded by four executioners. The actions of these soldiers are clearly intended to make Jesus' task of carrying the cross more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Otherwise, v2 lies {{inside the}} face {{outlined}} by v, v1, and v3. Consequently, v2 cannot be adjacent to v4, which lies outside <b>this</b> <b>face.</b> We merge v2 and v4 {{in the same}} manner as v1 and v3 above.|$|E
25|$|The sculptures on <b>this</b> <b>face</b> depict Jesus Christ's {{arrest and}} the Mocking of Jesus ("Christ aux outrages"). The two people {{shown in the}} arrest {{sequence}} who carry phylacterys are almost certainly the priests sent to arrest Jesus. They carry law scrolls and are accompanied by a guard who has a sword tucked into his belt.|$|E
5000|$|The Naval Monument (1967). <b>This</b> <b>faces</b> Brisbane Street {{and is a}} cairn of {{concrete}} bricks on a concrete base and is topped by a metal anchor. A metal plaque on the base records its dedication to the naval servicemen of the Ipswich and West Moreton District.|$|R

6000|$|She {{could say}} that to him, but to herself? Was she {{prepared}} to make a man of him {{at the cost of}} his possible love? <b>This</b> <b>faced</b> her when she was alone with her passionate nature, and she fought it, and with her fists clenched she cried: [...] "Yes, yes, yes!" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{western side}} of the fell stands above the {{enclosed}} valley of the Upper Glenderamackin, looking across to Bannerdale Crags. Souther Fell has two principal tops and each stands above a patch of scree and rock on <b>this</b> <b>face.</b> A footbridge crosses the river just north of Mousthwaite Comb, the only reliable crossing between here and Mungrisdale village.|$|E
25|$|Gentle grass-covered slopes on {{the south}} and east sides of the fell drop to a broad col and to Mosedale, both of which {{separate}} Clough Head from Great Dodd, its neighbour to the south. To the north of the summit the ground drops abruptly down a steep scree-covered and craggy slope which marks the northern end of the Helvellyn range. <b>This</b> <b>face</b> is called Red Screes from the colour of the rock.|$|E
25|$|Both {{faces of}} the cross bear badly {{weathered}} inscriptions which have {{been the source of}} much speculation since the 19th century. One currently favoured theory is that the western face reads BOC LAND, marking the limit of the land owned by Buckland Abbey, though on a 16th-century map depicting the 1240 Perambulation it is recorded as ROOLANDE. <b>This</b> <b>face</b> also has a cross carved on it above the lettering. The eastern face may read SIWARD or SYWARD.|$|E
60|$|The young man, after <b>this,</b> <b>faced</b> him again. “Why, do {{you think}} me such a dunce?” And then as his friend but vaguely protested: “The girl’s all right,” he said—and quite as if this {{judgement}} covered all the ground. It wasn’t {{that there was no}} ground—but {{he knew what he was}} about.|$|R
50|$|Edge cubies {{fit onto}} {{positioning}} lugs on the exteriors of these internal sliding pieces, so that rotating a face makes its edge cubies push the sliding pieces {{around in a}} circle. The interior surfaces that face inward toward the hole drive <b>this</b> <b>face's</b> square piece so that it rotates with the cubies.|$|R
25|$|It is {{informal}} trade {{across borders}} {{that is most}} often important to rural livelihoods and a customs union is unlikely to significantly impact the barriers that <b>this</b> <b>faces</b> and taxes are still being fixed separately by countries. However, the introduction of one-stop border posts being introduced and the reduction in tariff barriers are coming down progressively.|$|R
25|$|The west (lakeside) {{face has}} eight bays, with {{projecting}} wings at each end, which each have triple windows {{to the ground}} floor. The bays on <b>this</b> <b>face</b> have full-height recessed arches and are separated by pilasters. The single-storey Gothic-style porch is set asymmetrically and consists of three arches; above it is a slight gable. To the south (right) of the southern wing is a further recessed wing which {{has been reduced to}} two storeys, with the render removed to expose red brick; it has a two-storey canted bay window.|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern side}} of the fell forms the head of Swindale proper, the upper valley being known as Mosedale. Swindale is a classic U-shaped valley, its profile almost a square section, with a flat base and sheer walls. Selside Pike's eastern slopes fall gently to about the 2,000ft contour and then plunge over a wall of crag to the valley floor. Geordie Greathead Crag is the {{dominant}} feature and below this is the dry tarnbed of Dodd Bottom. Hobgrumble Gill falls down <b>this</b> <b>face</b> in a deep gully, separating Selside Pike from the north east ridge of High Howes. Above the crags the gill runs in a small hanging valley.|$|E
25|$|The western face is {{slightly}} larger and {{higher than the}} other three faces. It is dominated by a depiction of the resurrected Christ which is placed above a large arch with pillars on either side {{in which there is}} a form of altar. This arch interrupts and divides the cornice and to the left of this part of the Calvary there is a stairway leading up to the pedestal's platform. Priests would use this stairway to access the platform and deliver sermons. Another feature of <b>this</b> <b>face</b> of the Calvary is that there is extra space over each buttress so that individual statues can be placed on them.|$|E

25|$|Senators are popularly elected statewide {{every two}} years, with one-third {{beginning}} new six-year terms with each Congress, In this Congress, Class 2 meant their term ended with <b>this</b> Congress, <b>facing</b> re-election in 1990; Class 3 meant their term {{began in the}} last Congress, facing re-election in 1992; and Class 1 meant their term began in <b>this</b> Congress, <b>facing</b> re-election in 1994.|$|R
25|$|The former Wesleyan Methodist Church is a two-storey {{building}} in red brick, {{which is set}} well back from the street. The front façade is gabled, with stone dressings, and is flanked with tall brick pilasters. <b>This</b> <b>face</b> has a recess at ground level containing two adjacent doorways, which have stone surrounds with pilasters and decorative keystones, and semi-circular arched heads with fanlights; the doorways are flanked by two narrow windows. Above the doors is another large arched recess, faced in stone, which contains two large arched windows flanked by pilasters, with a smaller circular window above. There are two stone string courses and a stone cornice. The façade is flanked by circular bays, which have two small windows with semi-circular heads.|$|E
25|$|If a {{polyhedral}} graph {{does not}} contain a triangular face, its dual graph does contain a triangle and is also polyhedral, so one can realize the dual in this way and then realize the original graph as the polar polyhedron of the dual realization. It is also possible to realize any polyhedral graph directly by choosing the outer face to be any face with at most five vertices (something that exists in all polyhedral graphs) and choosing more carefully the fixed shape of <b>this</b> <b>face</b> {{in such a way}} that the Tutte embedding can be lifted, or by using an incremental method instead of Tutte's method to find a liftable planar drawing that does not have equal weights for all the interior edges.|$|E
25|$|On {{the upper}} surface {{we have the}} statue of a {{kneeling}} monk, a depiction of the Virgin Mary, and John the Evangelist. Below the scenes on <b>this</b> <b>face</b> of the calvary comprise blocks of granite carved in high-relief. The first positioned on the left, depicts Pontius Pilate washing his hands as Jesus, held by two soldiers, is brought before him. Next we see the two thieves and Jesus, all three carrying their crosses. On the frieze below we see the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple with Jesus standing on a small stool and two depictions dealing with baptism. The first shows the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist and the second Jesus baptizing the faithful as recounted in John 3, Verse 26. Finally Jesus is shown holding discussions with the elders in the temple.|$|E
