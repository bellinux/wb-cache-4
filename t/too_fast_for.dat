5|$|If {{a spider}} walks under a P. schultzi female's capture web and the {{vertical}} distance {{is less than}} 8centimetres, the P. schultzi often drops onto the prey <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> a human eye to follow. If the P. schultzi misses, it quickly returns up its safety line to its vantage point and looks for another chance - and seldom misses the second time. Most drops cover two to four centimetres, as longer drops are often obstructed by the web.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, bands {{from across the}} United States began to move towards {{what would become the}} glam metal sound. In 1981, Mötley Crüe (from Los Angeles) {{released}} their first album <b>Too</b> <b>Fast</b> <b>for</b> Love, Dokken (also from Los Angeles) released their first Breaking the Chains, and Kix (from western Maryland) released their first album, Kix. In 1982, Night Ranger (from San Francisco) released their initial album Dawn Patrol which reached the top 40 in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The Beaufort was <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> the torpedoes available, so new tactics {{had to be}} {{developed}} and the aircraft was restricted to mine-laying or bombing missions. It was soon grounded for other reasons. After No. 22 Squadron carried out more trials, it began operations on 31 August 1940. On 11 September a torpedo attack succeeded in hitting a 6,000 ton freighter. On 17 September No. 22, 53 and 57 Squadron sank a 1,600 ton freighter in Cherbourg harbour. An E-boat was also destroyed and oil tanks were also set ablaze and burned uncontrollably for several days. The cost was a single Beaufort.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Ayrton Senna joined Hill at Williams. As {{the reigning}} champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill {{retained}} his number '0'. The pre-season betting was that Senna would coast to the title, {{but with the}} banning of electronic driver aids, the Benetton team and Michael Schumacher initially proved more competitive and won the first three races. At the San Marino Grand Prix on 1 May, Senna died after his car went off the road. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season's experience in the top flight. It was widely reported {{at the time that}} the Williams car's steering column had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.|$|E

5000|$|The track {{had been}} {{modified}} for this race {{by the addition}} of the [...] "Scheckter chicane" [...] {{at the bottom of the}} hill entering the esses.

25|$|With its {{original}} mission no longer available, the Livermore lab tried radical new designs that failed. Its first three nuclear tests were fizzles: in 1953, two single-stage fission devices with uranium hydride pits, and in 1954, a two-stage thermonuclear device {{in which the}} secondary heated up prematurely, <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> radiation implosion to work properly.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{was praised}} by its pilots, {{including}} John Salmond, later to become Chief of the Air Staff, its landing speed of 52mph (84km/h) was considered <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> operational use, {{and the engine}} was still too unreliable, being replaced by a 100hp (75kW) Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine. With this engine, speed fell to a less impressive 92mph (148km/h).|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{became the}} first chief to test Funny Cars in a wind tunnel. Other {{innovations}} included equipping dragsters with data recorders, installing a two-stage lockup-style clutch, and a fuel delivery system with two sources.

50|$|Christian {{suggests}} that the universe creates complexity when these Goldilocks conditions are met, that is, when things are not too hot or cold, not <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> or slow. <b>For</b> example, life began not in solids (molecules are stuck together, preventing the right kinds of associations) or gases (molecules move <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> to enable favorable associations) but in liquids such as water which permitted the right kinds of interactions at the right speeds.|$|R
25|$|Particularly troubling was the yaw {{instability}} in certain regimes of flight which produced inertia coupling. The aircraft could develop a sudden yaw and roll which would happen <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> the pilot to correct and would quickly over-stress the aircraft structure to disintegration. It was {{under these conditions}} that North American's chief test pilot, George Welch, was killed while dive testing an early-production F-100A (s/n 52-5764) on 12 October 1954.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, at 0345hrs Alsen {{had come}} within firing {{range of the}} ship that Samsø was chasing and there {{followed}} a running fight which persevered {{as well as the}} rough seas would allow. Samsø had already broken off her chase when Grodtschilling realized the British vessel was <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> him; Grodtschilling sailed to join and support Lolland. By 0500hrs Alsens quarry had gained such a lead on the Alsen that Lütken too gave up the pursuit and turned to join Lolland.|$|E
25|$|During April 1881, {{under the}} command of John William Nicholson, the Advance got away from a near miss when leaving the Grey River at Greymouth under tow of the steam tug Dispatch. The tow ropes were lost and the vessel drifted into the breakwater, moving <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> the anchor to have held her. The sails were raised, but the wind had died away, and the crew lost control of the vessel. The Dispatch, however, managed to take the Advance in tow once again and left her on the flat {{opposite}} the town. Three feet of water had washed aboard, but no major damage was sustained.|$|E
50|$|His {{identity}} as a king {{in a game of}} Chess is revealed all the more when he admits that he can never quite catch up with his spouse, because, like all chess-queens, she moves <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> and <b>for</b> <b>too</b> many squares ahead of him for him to overtake her. Indeed, a more extreme version of this relationship can be seen {{on the opposite side of}} the game, in which the Red King remains asleep throughout the whole story, and the Red Queen runs her famous race.|$|R
60|$|They {{had left}} {{two men in}} the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drank {{a little too much}} brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking sooner than the other, and finding the boat <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> aground <b>for</b> him to stir it, hallooed for the rest who were straggling about, upon which they all soon came to the boat but it was past all their {{strength}} to launch her, the boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand, almost like a quicksand.|$|R

25|$|In March 1910, the Virginia Steamship Company settled claims {{filed by}} {{relatives}} of men {{lost in the}} sinking of the John B. Cowle in the amount of $20,000. Following an investigation and hearings, the United States Steamboat Inspectors at Marquette suspended Captain Rogers and Edward E. Carlton, Pilot, of the John B.

25|$|The Junkers Ju 88 was a German World War II Luftwaffe twin-engined multirole combat aircraft. Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke (JFM) {{designed}} {{the plane in}} the mid-1930s as a so-called Schnellbomber (fast bomber) that would be <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> fighters of its era to intercept. It suffered {{from a number of}} technical problems during its development and early operational periods but {{became one of the most}} versatile combat aircraft of the war. Like a number of other Luftwaffe bombers, it served as a bomber, dive bomber, night fighter, torpedo bomber, reconnaissance aircraft, heavy fighter and at the end of the war, as a flying bomb.|$|E
25|$|On September 29, 2003, Heatley {{was driving}} a Ferrari 360 Modena with Thrashers {{teammate}} Dan Snyder in the passenger seat. Heatley, who was driving between 55–82mph in a 35mph zone, lost control and skidded into a brick pillar and iron fence. Six days later, Snyder died from his injuries. Heatley was charged with vehicular homicide {{as a result of}} the crash. He pleaded guilty to second-degree vehicular homicide, driving <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> conditions, failure to maintain a lane, and speeding. He was sentenced to three years probation and ordered to give 150 speeches on the dangers of speeding, and pay $25,000 to Fulton County for the cost of investigating the crash.|$|E

40|$|We have {{performed}} detailed NLTE spectral synthesis modeling of 2 types of 1 -D hydro models: the very highly parameterized deflagration model W 7, and two delayed detonation models. We find that overall both models do about equally well at fitting well observed SNe Ia near to maximum light. However, the Si II 6150 feature of W 7 is systematically <b>too</b> <b>fast,</b> whereas <b>for</b> the delayed detonation models {{it is also}} somewhat <b>too</b> <b>fast,</b> but significantly better than that of W 7. We find that a parameterized mixed model does the best job of reproducing the Si II 6150 line near maximum light and we study {{the differences in the}} models that lead to better fits to normal SNe Ia.

We conclude that propagating ngers observed {{in the vicinity of}} the AF $ FF threshold eld can only be observed in holding elds where there are metastable states. We argue that this is because relaxation times for antiferroelectric liquid crystals (AFLCs) are <b>too</b> <b>fast</b> (s) <b>for</b> front propagation of stable states into unstable ones.
