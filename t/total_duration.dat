40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} the proportion {{and number of}} cancers occurring in Australia in 2010 attributable to parous women having breastfed for <b>total</b> <b>durations</b> of ≤ 12 months. Methods: We estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of breast cancers (the only cancer site with convincing evidence of causal association) associated with women breastfeeding for ≤ 12 months in total, using standard formulae incorporating breastfeeding prevalence data, relative risks associated with breastfeeding and cancer incidence. We also estimated the proportion change in disease incidence (potential impact fraction [PIF]) that might have occurred under two hypothetical scenarios of women breastfeeding for longer durations. Results: An estimated 235 (1. 7 %) breast cancer cases that occurred in Australian in 2010 {{could be attributed to}} women breastfeeding for <b>total</b> <b>durations</b> of ≤ 12 months. Assuming a hypothetical increase in breastfeeding, we estimated that the number of breast cancers prevented would range from 36 to 51 (prevented fraction = 0. 3 % to 0. 4 %). Conclusions: More than 200 breast cancers were attributable to women breastfeeding for <b>total</b> <b>durations</b> of ≤ 12 months. Implications: Policies to increase breastfeeding duration may help prevent breast cancers in the future...|$|R

5|$|The {{course at}} SFTS {{typically}} {{consisted of two}} streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery. The <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> of 1:04:37.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the final}} year in a consecutive string of three very active seasons, {{although many of the}} storms were weak. It is tied with 1887, 1995, 2010, and 2011 for having the third-most named storms on record. It was also the third-costliest season, behind 2005 and 2017. The season officially began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that conventionally delimit the period during each year in which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. However, Alberto, the first system of the year, developed on May19 – the earliest date of formation since Tropical Storm Ana in 2003. A second tropical cyclone, Beryl, developed later that month. This was the first occurrence of two pre-season named storms in the Atlantic basin since 1951. It moved ashore in North Florida on May29 with winds of 65mph (100km/h), making it the strongest pre-season storm to make landfall in the Atlantic basin. This season marked the first time since 2009 where no tropical cyclones formed in July. Another record was set by Hurricane Nadine later in the season; the system became the fourth-longest-lived tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic, with a <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> of 22.25days. The final storm to form, Tony, dissipated on October25 – however, Hurricane Sandy, which formed before Tony, became extratropical on October 29.|$|E
40|$|In general, {{the goal}} of test {{automation}} is to reduce test time, to decrease the amount of manual labor and to increase the test coverage. In a time-to-market environment, like ASML, {{the primary goal of}} test automation is to minimize the <b>total</b> test <b>duration.</b> The <b>total</b> test <b>duration</b> is the time between test start and the moment that the system is fault free, so including diagnosing and fixing faults. Therefore, the <b>total</b> test <b>duration</b> is not only depending on the test case duration, also the diagnosis and fix duration (the fix-loop) influences the <b>total</b> test <b>duration.</b> Time to market can also be reduced by using a parallel test and fix strategy. In this strategy, available fixes are integrated on the system under test as soon as possible. Applying fixes as soon as possible results in fewer test cases failed in the remainder of the test phase, however the fixes may introduce new faults as well. The influence on <b>total</b> test <b>duration</b> of both applying test automation and aplying a parallel test and fix strategy has been investigated...|$|R

25|$|Acute bronchitis, {{also known}} as a chest cold, is short term {{inflammation}} of the bronchi of the lungs. The most common symptom is a cough. Other symptoms include coughing up mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, fever, and chest discomfort. The infection may last from a few to ten days. The cough may persist for several weeks afterwards with the <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> of symptoms usually around three weeks. Some have symptoms for up to six weeks.|$|E

25|$|Codeine is an opiate used {{to treat}} pain, as a cough medicine, and for diarrhea. It is {{typically}} {{used to treat}} mild to moderate degrees of pain. Greater benefit may occur when combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Evidence does not support its use for acute cough suppression in children or adults. In Europe it is not recommended as a cough medicine in those under twelve years of age. It is generally taken by mouth. It typically starts working {{after half an hour}} with maximum effect at two hours.

In Ravel's own copy of the score, the printed metronome mark of 76 per quarter is crossed out and 66 is substituted. Later editions of the score suggest a tempo of 72. Ravel's own recording from January 1930 starts at around 66 per quarter, slightly slowing down later on to 60–63. Its <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> is 15 minutes 50 seconds.

25|$|Power outage {{duration}} {{is a measure}} of the reliability of supply to the distribution networks. This measure decreased for most regions in Honduras from 2001. However, in 2005, a general increase in the interruption duration happened. The <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> of interruptions per connection (36 hours per year in 2005, compared to 24 hours in 2004, but 135 hours in 1999 in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch) is about twice as high as the average for Latin America and the Caribbean (14 hours per connection in 2005). However, the frequency of such interruptions has been higher in other countries, meaning that Honduras has a few long outages, while other countries have more frequent shorter ones.|$|E

25|$|The {{cultural}} concepts originally {{adopted from}} Beaker {{groups at the}} lower Rhine blended or integrated with local Late Neolithic Culture. For a while the region was set apart from central and eastern Denmark, that evidently related more closely to the early Únětice culture across the Baltic Sea. Before {{the turn of the}} millennium the typical Beaker features had gone, their <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> being 200–300 years at the most. A similar picture of cultural integration is featured among Bell Beakers in central Europe, thus challenging previous theories of Bell Beakers as an elitist or purely super-structural phenomenon. The connection with the East Group Beakers of Únětice had intensified considerably in LN II, thus triggering a new social transformation and innovations in metallurgy that would announce the actual beginning of the Northern Bronze Age.|$|E
25|$|The most {{comprehensive}} early study of binocular rivalry {{was conducted by}} B. B. Breese (1899, 1909). Breese quantified the amount of rivalry by requiring his observers to press keys while observing rivalry for 100-second trials. An observer pressed one key whenever and {{for as long as}} he or she saw one rival stimulus with no trace of the other, and another key whenever and {{for as long as he}} or she saw the other rival stimulus with no trace of the first. This has come to be known as recording periods of exclusive visibility. From the key-press records (Breese's were made on a kymograph drum), Breese was able to quantify rivalry in three ways: the number of periods of exclusive visibility of each stimulus (the rate of rivalry), the <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> of exclusive visibility of each stimulus, and the average duration of each period of rivalry.|$|E
25|$|The {{lengths of}} the neumes were given values by adding up the {{duration}} {{values for the}} separate neume elements, each time following a particular hypothesis concerning the rhythm of Gregoriant chant. Both the syllable lengths and the neume lengths were also expressed {{in relation to the}} <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> of the syllables, resp. neumes for a word (contextual variables). Correlating the various word and neume variables, substantial correlations were found for the word variables 'accented syllable' and 'contextual syllable duration'. Moreover, it could be established that the multiple correlation (R) between the two types of variables reaches its maximum (R is about 0.80) if the neumatic elements are evaluated according to the following rules of duration: (a) neume elements that represent short notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 1 time; (b) neume elements that represent long notes in neumes consisting of at least two notes have duration values of 2 times; (c) neumes consisting of only one note are characterized by flexible duration values (with an average value of 2 times), which take over the duration values of the syllables to match.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to this, all students at University College London, Imperial College London, Bute Medical School (St Andrews), University of Oxford, University of Edinburgh and University of Cambridge study for a BSc/BA {{in addition to}} their medical degrees. These five medical schools have a six-year curriculum, in which students complete a three-year pre-clinical course, which leads to a BSc or BA, followed by a three-year clinical course, which in combination with the BSc or BA leads to a full medical degree. The degree awarded is BA at Oxford and Cambridge (which later becomes an MA), and BSc at the others. At these five medical schools, it is sometimes also possible to spend extra optional year(s) where one can study for an intercalated masters or doctoral degree in addition to the BSc/BA which all students receive, for example, the University of Cambridge offers an MB PhD programme of nine years <b>total</b> <b>duration</b> comprising preclinical training, the intercalated BA (see above), clinical training and within the clinical training period a PhD.
