5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of <b>tissue</b> <b>factor.</b> Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> from damaged tissue. <b>Tissue</b> <b>factor</b> binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates fibrin from fibrinogen, and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, factor XI, factor V and factor VIII, TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits factor Xa).|$|E
5|$|The female hormone estrogen, {{when used}} in the {{combined}} oral contraceptive pill and in perimenopausal hormone replacement therapy, {{has been associated with}} a two- to sixfold increased risk of venous thrombosis. The risk depends on the type of hormones used, the dose of estrogen, and the presence of other thrombophilic risk factors. Various mechanisms, such as deficiency of protein S and <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> pathway inhibitor, are said to be responsible.|$|E
40|$|Connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> (CCN 2), {{a member}} of the CCN family of proteins, is a cysteine-rich matricellular protein. Connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> is not {{normally}} expressed in dermal fibroblasts unless induced. The most potent inducer of connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> thus far identified is transforming growth <b>factor</b> β. Connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor,</b> however, is constitutively overexpressed by fibroblasts present in skin fibrotic lesions, including scleroderma. The overexpression of connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> present in fibrotic lesions contributes to the phenotype of scleroderma in that connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> promotes matrix deposition, and fibroblast adhesion and proliferation. In animal models, whereas either transforming growth factor β or connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> alone produce only a transient fibrotic response, connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> and transforming growth factor β act together to promote sustained fibrosis. Thus the constitutive overexpression of connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> by fibroblasts present in fibrotic lesions would be expected to contribute directly to chronic, persistent fibrosis. This review discusses recent information regarding insights into connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> biology and, using scleroderma as a model system, the part connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> might play in fibrotic disease...|$|R
40|$|Connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor,</b> {{which is}} induced by {{transforming}} growth factor β, {{has been reported}} to mediate the stimulatory actions of transforming growth factor β on type I procollagen synthesis. Connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> is expressed in fibrotic disease such as scleroderma, where it is believed to promote abnormal deposition of collagen. Connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> expression has not been described in normal human skin or cultured skin cells, however. We report here that connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> mRNA is constitutively expressed in normal human skin. In situ hybridization demonstrated that connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> mRNA was expressed in keratinocytes throughout the epidermis and in dermal cells. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that the level of connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> mRNA in the epidermis and dermis of normal human skin was comparable to the level of housekeeping gene 36 B 4. Ultraviolet irradiation (2 minimal erythema dose, UVB/A 2 source) reduced connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> mRNA expression throughout the epidermis and dermis in normal human skin in vivo. Connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> mRNA was reduced (30 %) within 4 h post ultraviolet irradiation, and remained reduced (50 %) 8 – 24 h post ultraviolet. Connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> mRNA and protein were also constitutively highly expressed in normal cultured human skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Ultraviolet irradiation of cultured normal human skin fibroblasts resulted in a time-dependent inhibition of connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> mRNA expression. At 24 h post ultraviolet, connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> mRNA expression was reduced 80 %. Transforming growth factor β 1 rapidly induced connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> mRNA levels (5 -fold within 4 h) in skin fibroblasts, but not keratinocytes, and this induction was attenuated 80 % by ultraviolet irradiation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that ultraviolet irradiation reduced protein binding to the transforming growth factor β/Smad responsiveness elements in the connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> gene promoter, in human skin in vivo and human skin fibroblasts. Constitutive expression of connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> in normal human skin suggests that it is a physiologic regulator of procollagen synthesis. Ultraviolet reduction of connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> expression may contribute to reduced procollagen synthesis observed in ultraviolet-irradiated normal human skin and human skin fibroblasts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{the effect of}} Houttuynia cordata Aetherolea on connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> and adiponectin in a rat model of diabetes mellitus (DM). MethodsDM was induced in rats using streptozotocin (STZ) and high glucose-lipid animal feed. Animals were then treated with Houttuynia cordata Aetherolea for 8 weeks.

5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear <b>tissue</b> <b>factor.</b> Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by <b>tissue</b> <b>factor,</b> which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E

40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} (TGF) - � and {{connective}} <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> may be implicated in extracellular matrix protein deposition in asthma. We have recently reported that TGF- � increased connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> expression in airway smooth muscle cells isolated from patients with asthma. In this study, we examined fibronectin and collagen production and signal transduction pathways after stimulation with TGF- � and connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor.</b> In both asthmatic and nonasthmatic airway smooth muscle cells, TGF- � and connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> {{led to the}} production of fibronectin and collagen I. Fibronectin and collagen expression was extracellular regulated kinase–dependent in both cell types but phosphoinositide- 3 kinase–dependent only in asthmatic airway smooth muscle cells. p 38 was implicated in fibronectin but not collagen expression in both cell types. TGF- � induction of fibronectin and collagen was in part mediated by an autocrine action of connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor.</b> Phosphorylation of SMAD- 2 may represent an additional pathway because this was increased in asthmatic cells. Our results suggest that these two cytokines may be important in the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and that the signal transduction pathways may be different in asthmatic and nonasthmatic cells...|$|R
25|$|The result (in seconds) for a {{prothrombin}} time performed {{on a normal}} individual will {{vary according to the}} type of analytical system employed. This is due to the variations between different types and batches of manufacturer's <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> used in the reagent to perform the test. The INR was devised to standardize the results. Each manufacturer assigns an ISI value (International Sensitivity Index) for any <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> they manufacture. The ISI value indicates how a particular batch of <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> compares to an international reference <b>tissue</b> <b>factor.</b> The ISI is usually between 0.94 and 1.4 for more sensitive and 2.0-3.0 for less sensitive thromboplastins.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> (extrinsic) pathway is {{initiated}} by release of <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> (a specific cellular lipoprotein), {{and can be}} measured by the prothrombin time (PT) test.

50|$|Cell {{division}} {{orientation is}} the direction along {{which the new}} daughter cells are formed. Cell division orientation is important for morphogenesis, cell fate and tissue homeostasis.

25|$|Finally, {{in order}} to {{activate}} the extrinsic / <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> clotting cascade pathway, <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> (also known as factor III) is added and the time the sample takes to clot is measured optically. Some laboratories use a mechanical measurement, which eliminates interferences from lipemic and icteric samples. The prothrombin ratio (aka international normalized ratio) is the prothrombin time for a patient sample divided by the result for control plasma.|$|E
25|$|Any {{inflammatory}} process, such as trauma, {{surgery or}} infection, can cause {{damage to the}} endothelial lining of the vessel's wall. The main mechanism is exposure of <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> to the blood coagulation system. Inflammatory and other stimuli (such as hypercholesterolemia) can lead to changes in gene expression in endothelium producing to a pro-thrombotic state. When this occurs, endothelial cells downregulate substances such as thrombomodulin, which is a key modulator of thrombin activity. The end result is a sustained activation of thrombin and reduced production of protein C and <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> inhibitor, which furthers the pro-thrombotic state.|$|E
40|$|The {{wound healing}} process concludes with {{downregulation}} of fibroblast activity. Clinical observations {{suggest that the}} regenerating epidermis suppresses this activity. An important regulator of fibroblast activity is the fibrogenic cytokine connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor.</b> We hypothesized that epidermal keratinocytes may affect fibroblast activity via this cytokine. We demonstrate keratinocyte-mediated suppression of connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> at both the mRNA and protein levels by around 50 % or more when fibroblasts were cultured in multiwell plates with keratinocyte cultures in accompanying semipermeable cell culture inserts, or stimulated by keratinocyte-conditioned media. Both basal and transforming-growth-factor-β 1 -stimulated levels of connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> were inhibited. A 3 h coculture period with keratinocytes was sufficient to suppress connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> expression by fibroblasts, but the inhibition developed over a time period of around 16 h. The putative keratinocyte-derived factor(s) responsible for these effects {{was found to be}} soluble and stable. By analyzing cytokines secreted by keratinocytes we identified interleukin- 1 α as a potent inhibitor of connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> mRNA expression in fibroblasts. Involvement of this cytokine in keratinocyte-mediated connective <b>tissue</b> growth <b>factor</b> suppression was confirmed by using anti-interleukin- 1 α antibodies. Tumor necrosis factor α or prostaglandins {{did not appear to be}} involved. In conclusion, our results indicate that interleukin- 1 α secretion by keratinocytes provides a mechanism for the downregulation of connective tissue activity during the end-stage of wound healing, when epithelia coverage has developed over the wound area...|$|R

50|$|Radiation {{weighting}} factors that go from physical energy to biological effect {{must not be}} confused with <b>tissue</b> weighting <b>factors.</b> The <b>tissue</b> weighting <b>factors</b> are used to convert an equivalent dose to a given tissue in the body, to an effective radiation dose, a number that provides an estimation of total danger to the whole organism, {{as a result of the}} radiation dose to part of the body.|$|R
25|$|Following {{damage to}} the blood vessel, FVII leaves the {{circulation}} and comes into contact with <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> (TF) expressed on tissue-factor-bearing cells (stromal fibroblasts and leukocytes), forming an activated complex (TF-FVIIa).|$|E
25|$|Following {{activation}} by {{the contact}} factor or <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> pathways, the coagulation cascade is maintained in a prothrombotic state by the continued activation of FVIII and FIX {{to form the}} tenase complex, until it is down-regulated by the anticoagulant pathways.|$|E
25|$|The {{prothrombin}} {{time is the}} time it takes plasma to clot after addition of <b>tissue</b> <b>factor</b> (obtained from animals such as rabbits, or recombinant <b>tissue</b> <b>factor,</b> or from brains of autopsy patients). This measures the quality of the extrinsic pathway (as well as the common pathway) of coagulation. The speed of the extrinsic pathway is greatly affected by levels of functional factor VII in the body. Factor VII has a short half-life and the carboxylation of its glutamate residues requires vitamin K. The {{prothrombin time}} can be prolonged as a result of deficiencies in vitamin K, warfarin therapy, malabsorption, or lack of intestinal colonization by bacteria (such as in newborns). In addition, poor factor VII synthesis (due to liver disease) or increased consumption (in disseminated intravascular coagulation) may prolong the PT.|$|E

25|$|Oral mucosa heals {{faster than}} skin, {{suggesting}} that saliva may have properties that aid wound healing. Saliva contains cell-derived <b>tissue</b> <b>factor,</b> and many compounds that are antibacterial or promote healing. Salivary <b>tissue</b> <b>factor,</b> associated with microvesicles shed from {{cells in the}} mouth, promotes wound healing through the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade. The enzymes lysozyme and peroxidase, defensins, cystatins and an antibody, IgA, are all antibacterial. Thrombospondin and some other components are antiviral. A protease inhibitor, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, is present in saliva and is both antibacterial and antiviral, and a promoter of wound healing. Nitrates that are naturally found in saliva break down into nitric oxide on contact with skin, which will inhibit bacterial growth. Saliva contains growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, VEGF, TGF-β1, leptin, IGF-I, lysophosphatidic acid, hyaluronan and NGF, which all promote healing, although levels of EGF and NGF in humans are much lower than those in rats. In humans, histatins may play a larger role. As well as being growth factors, IGF-I and TGF-α induce antimicrobial peptides. Saliva also contains an analgesic, opiorphin. Licking will also tend to debride the wound and remove gross contamination from the affected area.|$|E
