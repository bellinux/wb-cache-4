5|$|In {{his early}} years, Paul {{served on the}} House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for {{inflation}} and spoke against the banking mismanagement that resulted in <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>crisis.</b> Paul argued {{for a return to}} the gold standard maintained by the US from 1873–1933, and with Senator Jesse Helms convinced the Congress to study the issue. He spoke against the reinstatement of registration for the military draft in 1980, in opposition to President Jimmy Carter and the majority of his fellow Republican members of Congress.|$|E
25|$|While {{not part}} of <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>crisis,</b> many other banks failed. Between 1980 and 1994 more than 1,600 banks insured by the FDIC were closed or {{received}} FDIC financial assistance.|$|E

50|$|Lewis also {{attributed}} <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> {{scandal of}} <b>the</b> 1980s and 1990s to {{the inability of}} inexperienced, provincial, small-town bank managers to compete with Wall Street.

25|$|Some {{commentators}} {{believe that}} a taxpayer-funded government bailout related to mortgages during <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>crisis</b> may have created a moral hazard and acted as encouragement to lenders to make similar higher risk loans during the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis.|$|E

25|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} to 1995, {{not a single}} {{highrise}} structure was built within the downtown freeway loop. Over-speculating, over-building, <b>the</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>crisis,</b> and the early 1980s recession practically destroyed the city economically. In 1989, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center opened in the Arts District of downtown. Dallas celebrated a major landmark during this period, celebrating its 150th anniversary in 1991.|$|E
25|$|On top of {{the budget}} crisis, Bush started his presidential tenure as <b>the</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loans</b> {{industry}} was collapsing.

The collapse of <b>the</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> subsequent government bailout only added to the difficult financial environment that Bush confronted during his presidency.|$|R

25|$|Thompson lobbied Congress {{on behalf}} of the Tennessee Savings and Loan League to pass the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, which {{deregulated}} the savings and loan industry.

25|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 {{allowed the}} {{creation}} of the tax-exempt real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC) special purpose vehicle {{for the express purpose of}} issuing pass-throughs.

25|$|Wilhelm Crinius {{was born}} in Hohenhausen, Kalletal on 2 December 1920. His father, also named Wilhelm, was a master {{craftsman}} and house painter and decorator, his mother née Tölle. Crinius attended the Volksschule, a primary school, in Hohenhausen from 1927 until 1935. In 1935 he started his merchant apprenticeship at <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> bank in Hohenhausen. Parallel to his apprenticeship, he attended the vocational school. He worked at <b>the</b> <b>saving</b> <b>and</b> <b>loans</b> bank in Hohenhausen as an employee from Easter 1938 until November 1938.|$|R
25|$|In many countries, banks {{or similar}} {{financial}} institutions {{are the primary}} originators of mortgages. For banks that are funded from customer deposits, the customer deposits will typically have much shorter terms than residential mortgages. If a bank were to offer large volumes of mortgages at fixed rates but to derive most of its funding from deposits (or other short-term sources of funds), the bank would have an asset–liability mismatch due to interest rate risk: in this case, it would be running {{the risk that the}} interest income from its mortgage portfolio would be less than it needed to pay its depositors. In the United States, some argue that <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>crisis</b> was in part caused by this problem, that the savings and loans companies had short-term deposits and long-term, fixed rate mortgages, and were caught when Paul Volcker raised interest rates in the early 1980s. Therefore, banks and other financial institutions offer adjustable rate mortgages because it reduces risk and matches their sources of funding.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s Dallas was a {{real estate}} hotbed, with the {{increasing}} metropolitan population bringing with it a demand for new housing and office space. Several of Downtown Dallas' largest buildings are the fruit of this boom, but over-speculation, <b>the</b> <b>savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> <b>crisis</b> and an oil bust brought the 80's building boom to an end for Dallas {{as well as its}} city sister Houston. Between the late 1980s and the early 2000s, central Dallas went through a slow period of growth. However, since the early 2000s the central core of Dallas has been enjoying steady and significant growth encompassing both repurposing of older commercial buildings in downtown Dallas into residential and hotel uses as well as the construction of new office and residential towers. The opening of Klyde Warren Park, built across Woodall Rodgers Freeway seamlessly connecting the central Dallas CBD to Uptown/Victory Park, has acted synergistically with the highly successful Dallas Arts District so that both have become catalysts for significant new development in central Dallas.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early to mid-1980s, Dallas {{underwent}} the building boom which produced a distinctive contemporary profile for {{the downtown area}} and a prominent skyline, influenced by nationally acclaimed architects. By the 1980s, when the oil industry mostly relocated to Houston, Dallas was beginning to benefit from a burgeoning technology boom (driven by the growing computer and telecom industries), while continuing to be a center of banking and business. In 1983, voters in Dallas and area cities approved the creation of Dallas Area Rapid Transit to replace the Dallas Transit System. Dallas annexed Audelia in 1981, and Renner in 1983. In 1984, the Dallas Museum of Art moved from Fair Park {{as one of the}} first buildings in downtown's Arts District. Also in 1984, the Republican National Convention was held in Dallas. In 1985, at the peak of the real estate boom, the 72-story Bank of America Plaza (then InterFirst Plaza) opened as the tallest building in Dallas. From the mid-to-late 1980s, many banks, especially in Dallas, collapsed during <b>the</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loan</b> <b>crisis,</b> nearly destroying the city's economy and scrapping plans for hundreds of structures.|$|E
