Methods: The study assessed changes in physical activity, body mass and psychosocial mediators of physical activity from a pseudo-experimental cohort study involving two districts with low socioeconomic status in Oslo, Norway. In 2000, baseline investigation included 2950 30 – 67 -year-olds — 48 % of those invited. At follow-up in 2003 we measured 1776 subjects (67 % of those eligible). A set of theoretically informed strategies targeting individuals, groups and the environment were implemented, tailored towards groups with different psychosocial readiness for change. Net changes (the difference between changes in the intervention and control districts) and results of mediation analyses related {{to the effect of}} the intervention are reported. Results: The increase in physical activity measured by two questionnaires was 9. 5 % (p = 0. 008) and 8. 1 % (p = 0. 02), respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Micro and macroalbuminuria {{are strong}} {{risk factors for}} {{progression}} of nephropathy in patients with hypertension or type 2 diabetes. Early detection of progression to micro and macroalbuminuria may facilitate prevention and treatment of renal diseases. We aimed to develop plasma proteomics classifiers to predict the development of micro or macroalbuminuria in hypertension or type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Patients with hypertension (n =  125) and type 2 diabetes (n =  82) were selected for this case-control study from the Prevention of REnal and Vascular ENd-stage Disease cohort and the Steno Diabetes Center. Cases transitioned from normo to microalbuminuria, or from micro to macroalbuminuria. Controls, matched for age, sex, and baseline albuminuria stage, did not transition. Follow-up was 3. 0  ±  0. 9 years. Plasma proteomics profiles were measured by liquid chromatography-electrospray-trap mass-spectrometry. Classifiers were developed and cross-validated for prediction of <b>transition</b> <b>in</b> albuminuria <b>stage.</b> Improvement <b>in</b> risk prediction was tested {{on top of a}} reference model of baseline albuminuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system intervention. RESULTS: In hypertensive patients, the classifier improved risk prediction for <b>transition</b> <b>in</b> albuminuria <b>stage</b> on top of the reference model (C-index from 0. 69 to 0. 78; P <  0. 01). In type 2 diabetes, the classifier improved risk prediction for transition from micro to macroalbuminuria (C-index from 0. 73 to 0. 80; P =  0. 04). In both diseases, the identified peptides were linked to pathways recognized to contribute to nephropathy, including fibrosis, inflammation, angiogenesis, and mineral metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma proteomics predict the <b>transition</b> <b>in</b> albuminuria <b>stage</b> beyond established renal risk markers in hypertension or type 2 diabetes.

40|$|Objective: Hypertension is an {{important}} cause of end-stage renal disease. Development of microalbuminuria is the first clinical sign of renal dysfunction, progressing to macroalbuminuria and eventually resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Markers that could predict the development of microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria beyond traditional risk markers would allow for earlier intervention and better prevention of ESRD. We investigated in a case-control study whether circulating levels of the micronecrosis marker high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) add to predicting the development of microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria in hypertensive patients and performed a replication study in type 2 diabetic individuals (T 2 DM). Methods: Cases and controls were extracted from a large (N = 8592) general population cohort with long-term follow-up and repeated measurement of albuminuria (PREVEND-study). Cases were defined by <b>transition</b> <b>in</b> albuminuria <b>stage,</b> that is, from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria or from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria (average follow-up 2. 8 years). Controls with stable albuminuria were pair-matched for age, sex, and albuminuria-status. Hs-TnT was measured at baseline in 75 case/control pairs with hypertension and 33 case/control pairs with T 2 DM. Results: Prior to <b>transition</b> <b>in</b> albuminuria, hs-TnT was higher in cases than in controls [6. 6 (3. 1 - 11. 6) vs. 5. 3 (2. 9 - 8. 6) pg/ml, P = 0. 05]. The odds for <b>transition</b> <b>in</b> albuminuria increased significantly per SD increase in hs-TnT [2. 2 (1. 2 - 4. 3), P = 0. 02]. In addition, hs-TnT improved prediction of albuminuria transition, with significant increases in integrated discrimination improvement of 0. 048, P = 0. 02.

40|$|Health {{behavior}} research {{reveals that}} individuals {{vary in their}} general readiness to change their behaviors, {{as well as their}} attitudes and beliefs about that change. Adolescents are an important population for health behavior change interventions because the choices and behaviors early in life can have long-term health impacts. A large (N= 4158), school-based Transtheoretical Model (TTM) randomized trial evaluated two tailored, computer-delivered multiple behavior interventions designed to impact energy balance behaviors, including physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and TV viewing, or substance use, including smoking and alcohol. The study took place over a four-year period, with intervention points during grades six through eight and a follow-up assessment in grade nine. Main outcomes from this study indicated that students in the energy balance intervention effectively initiated and maintained energy balance behaviors in addition to reducing smoking and alcohol acquisition, despite no direct treatment for smoking and alcohol prevention. To better elucidate the process of behavior change, and to inform future interventions on how students at different levels of readiness to change respond to the intervention in relation to a comparison condition, an examination of the patterns and <b>transitions</b> <b>in</b> <b>stage</b> change over time is warranted. ^ Latent transition analysis (LTA), a longitudinal latent variable method that models discrete change and is particularly useful for stage-sequential models, was employed to estimate the stage membership and transition probabilities across time for the five health behaviors.

In addition, {{we looked at the}} GDF- 15 potential in nondiabetic subjects with hypertension (HT). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Case and control subjects were selected from the PREVEND cohort, a large (n = 8, 592), prospective general population study on the natural course of albuminuria, with > 10 years of follow-up and repeated albuminuria measurements. We found 24 T 2 DM and 50 HT case subjects transitioning from normo- to macroalbuminuria and 9 T 2 DM and 25 HT case subjects transitioning from micro- to macroalbuminuria (average follow-up 2. 8 years). Control subjects with stable albuminuria were pair matched for age, sex, albuminuria status, and diabetes duration. GDF- 15 was measured in samples prior to albuminuria transition. RESULTS-Prior to transition, GDF- 15 was significantly higher in case subjects with T 2 DM than in control subjects (median [IQR] 1, 288 pg/mL [885 - 1, 546] vs. 948 pg/mL [660 - 1, 016], P < 0. 001). The odds ratio for <b>transition</b> <b>in</b> albuminuria increased significantly per SD of GDF- 15 (2. 9 [95 % CI 1. 1 - 7. 5], P = 0. 03). GDF- 15 also improved prediction of albuminuria transition, with significant increases in C statistic (from 0. 87 to 0. 92, P = 0. 03) and integrated discrimination improvement (0. 148, P = 0. 001).

Based on these results, topiramate may be an alternative method to reduce the intensity of events in exploding head syndrome...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} study of the early stages of {{unstable}} state evolution of systems with spatial symmetry changes. In contrast to the early time linear theory of unstable evolution described by Cahn, Hilliard, and Cook, we develop a generalized theory that predicts two distinct stages of the early evolution for symmetry breaking phase <b>transitions.</b> <b>In</b> the first <b>stage</b> the dynamics is dominated by symmetry preserving evolution. <b>In</b> the second <b>stage,</b> which shares some characteristics with the Cahn-Hilliard-Cook theory, noise driven fluctuations break the symmetry of the initial phase on a time scale which is large compared to the first stage for systems with long interaction ranges. To test the theory we present the results of numerical simulations of the initial evolution of a long-range antiferromagnetic Ising model quenched into an unstable region. We investigate two types of symmetry breaking <b>transitions</b> <b>in</b> this system: disorder-to-order and order-to-order transitions. For the order-to-order case, the Fourier modes evolve as a linear combination of exponentially growing or decaying terms with different time scales. Comment: 15 pages, 22 figure...|$|R

Therefore, in the calculation of the GCI, pillars are given different weights depending on the per capita income of the nation. The weights used are the values that best explain growth in recent years For example, the sophistication and innovation factors contribute 10% to the final score in factor and efficiency-driven economies, but 30% in innovation-driven economies. Intermediate values are used for economies <b>in</b> <b>transition</b> between <b>stages.</b>|$|R
40|$|Nutrition {{transition}} {{is one of}} the driving forces of the upcoming global epidemic of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. We hypothesized that in previously deprived rapidly changing regions, the progress of the obesity epidemic is clustered per community and that screening with anthropometric school surveys can detect the negative effects of the nutrition <b>transition</b> <b>in</b> its early <b>stages.</b> <b>In</b> 16 different rural and urban communities in Binh Thuan Province, southern Vietnam, anthropometric surveys were conducted in local primary schools. Anthropometry of 2613 children showed a significant difference of the prevalence of wasting, stunting, and overweight between urban and rural communities. During the transition from high stunting rates to overweight, communities pass through an episode with dual burden of both conditions at different pace. Anthropometry of primary school children can reveal intercommunity differences and identify {{the early stages of the}} nutrition transitio...|$|R
40|$|High-pressure torsion {{was used}} for the {{deformation}} processing of high-purity aluminum (4 N-Al), while high-resolution electron-backscatter diffraction {{was used for}} the analysis of evolution of qualitative and quantitative microstructural characteristics. This study reveals a rather full picture of microstructure evolution in the high stacking fault energy fcc material and makes a continuous link between deformation microstructures at low, high and very high strains. Three stages of the microstructure evolution in 4 N-Al at ambient temperature have been found: (i) the first <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the range ∈ eq ≤ 1; (ii) a <b>transition</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the range 1 eq ≤ 8; and (iii) a saturation <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the range ∈ eq 8. <b>In</b> <b>stages</b> (i) and (ii), grain subdivision and typical features of deformation microstructures are found. Starting from stage (ii), formation of small equiaxed (sub) grains surrounded by high-angle boundaries (HABs) is found together with minor increase in the average subgrain size. At stage (iii), recrystallized-like microstructure mostly consisting of the dynamically stable equiaxed subgrains surrounded by HABs dominates the microstructure...|$|R

This framework is used to analyse implementation of a task with a Year 9 class. Cognitive activities engaged in during the task and competencies and technological knowledge required {{to complete the task}} successfully are identified. This framework can be used by teachers, researchers, and curriculum designers to design tasks and predict where in a given task blockages occur, hence allowing advance consideration of scaffolding for in-the-moment classroom decisions...|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Morbidity is self {{reported}} {{at a higher}} rate among the rich than the poor. However, objective measures suggest the contrary. We examined the role of epidemiological <b>transition</b> <b>in</b> wealth related inequalities in self-reported morbidity (SRM). Methods: We analyzed data of two States, Bihar and Kerala, from 60 [th] Round of National Sample Survey (NSS). Bivariate analysis was performed to study the associations between various socio-demographic variables and self-reported morbidity. A prediction model based on hierarchical logistic regression was developed to identify determinants of self-reported morbidity. Results: In Bihar, acute morbidities (26 per 1000) were reported more often than chronic morbidities (19 per 1000) while in Kerala the reverse was true (89 acute and 123 chronic morbidities per 1000 person). In both the s 0 tates, the rate of SRM showed an increasing trend from the poorest to the richest quintiles. The rising gradient in the odds of SRM across increasing socio-economic strata was more pronounced in Bihar [OR (richest) = 2. 52; 1. 85 - 3. 42] as compared to Kerala [OR (richest) = 1. 66; 1. 37 - 2. 0]. Moreover, this gradient was more on account of chronic diseases [OR (richest) = 2. 7; 1. 8 - 4. 0] for Bihar; [OR (richest) = 1. 6; 1. 26 - 2. 0 for Kerala] than the acute diseases [OR (richest) = 1. 82; 1. 1 - 2. 9 for Bihar]; [OR (richest) = 1. 4; 1. 1 - 1. 8 for Kerala]. Interpretation & conclusions: The present analysis shows that the epidemiologic <b>transition</b> results <b>in</b> higher prevalence and reporting of chronic ailments by the rich than the poor. This phenomenon is more evident <b>in</b> the early <b>stages</b> of <b>transition.</b> <b>In</b> later <b>stages</b> of <b>transition,</b> positional objectivity plays an important role to explain wealth related inequalities in SRM...|$|R
