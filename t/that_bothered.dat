A study in Australia found that cattle egrets {{reduced the number of}} flies <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> cattle by pecking them directly off the skin. It was the benefit to stock that prompted ranchers and the Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry to release the species in Hawaii.|$|E

In 1950, she made minor appearances in two critically acclaimed films, The Asphalt Jungle and All About Eve. The parts in the two films were against many of the roles into which she was typecast, that of the dumb blonde. Margot A.

Initially, there was a [...] "wholesome quality" [...] <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> Carter, but as the episode was being filmed, both Carter and Millikan recognized that Allen was right for the part. In addition to the part of Maitreya, several stuntmen were needed for the episode, including doubles for Mulder and Maitreya for their martial art fight scene. Experienced gymnast Dana Heath was hired for several scenes that required Maitreya to execute a series of handstands. Fourteen stuntmen were needed to ride Kawasaki 600s and fire gas-powered machine-guns.|$|E

In September, he had {{an operation}} on the patellar tendon. [...] "He had a chronic wear of the patellar tendon, which generated an inflammatory process <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> him greatly.

500|$|Some {{observers}} thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline. James Berardinelli {{questioned the}} [...] "random amount [...] of rubber nipples and camera angle close-ups of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches." [...] Similar to Batman Forever, this primarily included {{the decision to}} add nipples and enlarged codpieces to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, [...] "I {{had no idea that}} putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from ancient Greek statues, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct." [...] Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt [...] "it wasn't so much the nipples <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn't think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing some of the pictures, it was very unusual." [...] George Clooney joked, [...] "Joel Schumacher told me we never made another Batman film because Batman was gay".

500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> the hell out of me." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have provided praise and criticism on Kakashi's character. Christopher A. Born regards Kakashi's teaching of Team 7 {{to work as a}} team, even if they have to break the rules, to be reinforcing the Confucian values of the [...] "importance of benevolence and reciprocity". IGN noted the duality of Kakashi's serious persona in combat and his laid back, apathetic countenance when dealing with his students, but accepted that {{he is one of the}} most popular characters in the series. They also commented that Kakashi is one of the more popular characters they have seen cosplayed at anime conventions. Active Anime celebrated Kakashi's abilities, noting that he fell into the overall theme of characters hiding detailed personalities and secrets. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews derided Kakashi as a stereotypical [...] "Man of Mystery" [...] seen in other shōnen manga, but praised him as being [...] "much more interesting" [...] than the three main characters, and felt that for all intents and purposes, the show could be renamed simply [...] "Kakashi". Mania Entertainment's Dani Moure likes how Kakashi fits into Team 7 because he is a [...] "hilarious character in that sometimes he doesn't seem all <b>that</b> <b>bothered</b> about things and yet is so masterful of his craft." [...] Chris Beveridge from the site stated that Kakashi is his favorite character from the series because of his personality and praised his fight against Pain, and that after its ending, the character gets [...] "a very humanizing moment", making the episode from the battle stand out. Manga author Yoshihiro Togashi found Kakashi's first battle against his students as one of the first series' moments that impressed him due to how the difference in strength between such characters was shown by just making Kakashi read a book during the fight. IGN ranked him as the 15th greatest anime character of all time, saying that [...] "He's a complex character, with an iconic character design and a laid back attitude that just exudes cool." [...] Amy McNulty from Anime News Network highly praised Kakashi's fight against Obito Uchiha due to its animation and the references to the two fighters' childhoods. In 2014, IGN listed him as the best Naruto character when the series ended.|$|E
