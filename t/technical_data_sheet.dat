40|$|Abstract. Buildings {{constructed}} {{before the}} sixties in Algerian urban areas, are typically low and mid rise multi-storey buildings {{made of stone}} and/or brick masonry walls or infill light steel framing. These types of buildings {{are known to be}} vulnerable to seismic effects. Within this paper, an assessment of such existing structures, using the “Vulnerability Index ” method is presented. This allows a good classification and description of the seismic quality of the structures taking into account both, structural and non structural parameters considered to be ones of the main parameters governing the vulnerability of the structure. A <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> <b>sheet,</b> including all information that might be used in an associated computer program in Delphi is subsequently developed.

30|$|The {{surface of}} 3 M™ESPE™ MDI is {{sandblasted}} with aluminum oxide and cleaned and passivized with an oxidizing acid (<b>Technical</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Sheet,</b> 3 M ESPE) [35]. The surface of Ankylos® is sandblasted and acid etched [64]. Various authors {{have reported that}} surface roughness induces a variety {{of events in the}} course of osteoblast differentiation, spreading and proliferation, production of alkaline phosphatase, collagen, proteoglycans, and osteocalcin, and synthesis of cytokines and growth factors [65 – 67]. Therefore, leading to bone deposition on the surface of these implants, Yan et al. [68] demonstrated that simple surface treatments can turn the titanium surface into a bone-bonding one. With the results of our in vitro study, Marulanda et al.

30|$|Before {{we present}} the {{experimental}} {{results of the}} measured bandwidths in our soft-core controlled system, {{we would like to}} address why experiments are necessary in the first place. One could argue that analytical analysis alone could suffice to determine the feasibility of our system, since the bandwidths and operational frequencies of our embedded system components are already published within their respective <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> <b>sheets.</b> This is true in that such an analysis would result in an upper theoretical bound on what level of system performance is possible. However, this estimate is likely to be overly optimistic and may downplay the realistic result of accelerator throughput degradation in actual implementation.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{encountered}} problems in wine industry is the oxidation of white wine during wine storage in bottle. The key factor involved in this phenomenon is the oxygen transfer. However the oxygen transfer through stopper during wine storage is not well studied. In the field of wine industry, the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) is commonly used {{as a mean to}} evaluate the stopper barrier efficiency [1]. It is now often indicated by some suppliers on <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> <b>sheet.</b> However, this parameter only represents a mass flow, which does not include the thickness of the material and the pressure gradient. Consequently, in literature, no diffusion and permeability values are given for materials used as stopper. Cork stoppers are the most used for wine ageing in bottle. Thus, it is important to better know its kinetics properties, in particular considering oxygen. In this work a manometric method was developed, based on the study of Rabiot and al, 1999 [2]. It aims at measuring the intrinsic oxygen diffusion coefficient of raw cork. This set up consists in two gas compartments separated by the cork disc stuck into a sealed metal ring.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to single out {{sections}} along the final tract of the river Tiber, from the Castel Giubileo breakwater to the estuary, including main feeders, in need of flood defence management interventions and environmental redevelopment. After running through the city of Rome, the Tiber flows downstream through a territory where urban needs coexist with cultural heritage and a particularly riparian ecosystem. For this project it was therefore decided to use bioengineering techniques {{in order to bring}} about the minimum impact on both the environment and the landscape. These can be used to minimise streambank erosion, to prevent flood events and for streambed shaping. Furthermore, they are a valid tool for the restoration of the ecological integrity of the riparian ecosystems and wetlands. The next step was to pinpoint critical zones in need of a new embankment system for the security of Rome’s suburban districts nearby. The final product was the development of a cartographic support of the study area, elaborated with GIS software “Arc Gis 9. 1 ”, listing all the planned works by area as well as the most suitable techniques in accordance with the entity of the problem and the constraints of that zone. In addition, we drew up a <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> <b>sheet</b> for each kind of intervention, pinpointing all the locations along the Tiber where each intervention is planned.

40|$|In {{conservation}} practice, operations {{aiming to}} restore structural functionality of historical buildings are of primary relevance. Partial rebuilding, {{the substitution of}} damaged bricks or blocks and the integration of deteriorated joints are, among others, interventions that require {{the introduction of new}} materials in a heterogeneous and aged masonry system. An appropriate durability of these interventions can only be assured if a deep knowledge of the original materials and of their state of conservation is combined with reliable understanding of the behaviour of new materials introduced. The present paper reports the results of the investigation of four commercial ready-mixed mortars based on NHL binders. The mineralogical composition of each product has been evaluated by XRD and polarization-and- fluorescence microscopy (PFM). The molecular composition of the mixes has also been evaluated by FTIR spectroscopy and the morphological features have been studied by SEM observations.

40|$|In {{our phone}} {{conversation}} this evening, you asked if I would {{provide you with}} a copy of the comments that I wrote regarding concerns with the aerial application of Checkmate products in and around Monterey County. I have since expanded and refined those comments somewhat. Thus, you should note that there are some differences relative to what you may have seen previously. I had an opportunity to review an article in the Friday, September 28, 2007, issue of the Santa Cruz Sentinel, which allegedly lists several of the components (ingredients) in the Checkmate products manufactured by Suterra and proposed or used by the California Secretary of Agriculture for aerial spraying to control the light brown apple moth.

40|$|Abstract Plastic {{lumber and}} {{thermoplastic}} composites are sold as alternatives to wood products. However, many technical standards and scientific studies {{state that the}} two materials cannot be considered {{to have the same}} structural behaviour and strength. Moreover, there are many compositions of thermoplastic-based products and plenty of wood species. How different are their mechanical properties? This study compares the modulus of elasticity and the flexural, compressive, tensile and shear strengths of such materials, as well as the materials' specific mechanical properties. It analyses the properties of wood from the coniferae and dicotyledon species and those of commercialized and experimental thermoplastic-based product formulations. The data were collected from books, scientific papers and manufacturers' websites and <b>technical</b> <b>data</b> <b>sheets,</b> and subsequently compiled and presented in Ashby plots and bar graphs. The high values of the compressive strength and specific compressive and tensile strengths perpendicular to the grain (width direction) shown by the experimental thermoplastic composites compared to wood reveal their great potential for use in compressed elements and in functions where components are compressed or tensioned perpendicularly to the grain. However, the low specific flexural modulus and high density of thermoplastic materials limit their usage in certain civil engineering and building applications...|$|R
