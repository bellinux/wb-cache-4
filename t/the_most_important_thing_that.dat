500|$|Filming {{took place}} {{throughout}} September 2004 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Before filming, ABC {{announced that the}} production would adapt elements from the original 1900 book, rather than the 1939 film. such as the Silver Shoes instead of the Ruby slippers. [...] On August 25, 2004, {{it was announced that}} Hilary Duff, Jessica Simpson, and Ashanti had auditioned for the role of Dorothy Gale, but Ashanti had won the part. When asked about how she felt about working with the Muppets, Ashanti replied, [...] "I love children, and to me, the Muppets are just like little kids." [...] She also stated, [...] "The director had to give me a few pointers and tips for acting with them, but <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I learned was to keep eye contact." [...] Also in August 2004, BBC News reported that Quentin Tarantino would appear in the film.|$|E
500|$|School {{officials}} again {{asked students}} about the sign after Nixon mentioned his visit to Deshler in the victory speech, and this time Cole came forward. She stated {{that she had not}} done so before as she had not written the sign. Reporters interviewed the girl in the principal's office. Cole stated she felt Nixon was the one who could bring the country together again. Being interviewed by reporters from Washington, New York, and Chicago, she indicated, was more fun than sitting in history class. The Toledo Blade investigated the matter, but could not ascertain who made the sign, or what happened to it after Cole discarded it. John Baer, village chief of police, stated, [...] "I think this has to be <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> has ever happened around here." [...] Paul Scharf, editor of the Deshler Flag, stated he did not believe the mystery of the sign's origin or fate would ever be cleared up. Safire stated he was told by Moore that the sign stood out as obviously handmade and not produced by the local Nixon campaign.|$|E

2500|$|For {{people with}} incomes above $250,000, Obama wants {{to reduce their}} {{charitable}} tax deduction from 35 cents for each dollar donated to 28 cents for each dollar donated, to match the level of deductions for people making less than $250,000. In a press conference on March 24, 2009, Obama stated {{that he wanted to}} return to the rate that existed in the Reagan administration. [...] "There's very little evidence that this has a significant impact on charitable giving," [...] said Obama. [...] "I'll tell you what has a significant impact on charitable giving, is a financial crisis and an economy that's contracting. And so <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I can do for charitable giving is to fix the economy, to get banks lending again, to get businesses opening their doors again, to get people back to work again." [...] Thomas L.

2500|$|Muriel's {{participation}} in the Student Christian Movement (SCM) at McGill was a life-changing experience. [...] "Looking back over the years," [...] she told her biographer, [...] "I've felt always {{that the experience of}} the SCM was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> happened to me, probably {{the most important aspect of}} my college life, more important than any of the courses that I took." [...] The SCM conducted small study groups in which students were encouraged to discuss their beliefs freely and come to their own conclusions about how to interpret the Gospels. For Muriel, such discussions were unsettling and painful, yet also exciting. [...] "I had always before treated the Gospel as though its authors had set down day by day events in the life of Jesus as they happened," [...] she said. [...] "To face the implication that nothing was written down until after Jesus died was itself a shock. But this question of free and open discussion, that everything needed to be challenged, to be questioned, to be talked about, that was completely opposite to the authoritarian approach in the church." [...] The SCM study groups fostered independent thinking. [...] "This was the beginning of my adult search for truth," [...] Muriel told her biographer, [...] "and my sense that all things must be open to me." ...|$|E

But when the boy woke {{he did not even}} notice the change; his brain traversed the hours it had lost since he lay down as quickly as you may put on a stopped clock, and with his first tick he was thinking of nothing but the deceiver {{in the back of the}} bed. He raised his head, but could only see that she had crawled under the coverlet to escape his wrath. His mother was asleep. Tommy sat up and peeped over the edge of the bed, then he let his eyes wander round the room; he was looking for the girl's clothes, but they were nowhere to be seen. It is distressing to have to tell that what was in his mind was merely the recovery of his penny. Perhaps as they were Sunday clothes she had hung them up in the wardrobe? He slipped on to the floor and crossed to the wardrobe, but not even the muff could he find. Had she been tired, and gone to bed in them? Very softly he crawled over his mother, and pulling the coverlet off the child's face, got the great shock of his childhood.|$|E

60|$|I {{say this}} is typical of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{happened}} in the Victorian time. For {{the most important thing}} was that nothing happened. The very fuss that was made about minor modifications brings into relief the rigidity with which the main lines of social life were left as they were at the French Revolution. We talk of the French Revolution as something that changed the world; but its most important relation to England is that it did not change England. A student of our history is concerned rather with the effect it did not have than the effect it did. If it be a splendid fate to have survived the Flood, the English oligarchy had that added splendour. But even for the countries in which the Revolution was a convulsion, it was the last convulsion--until that which shakes the world to-day. It gave their character to all the commonwealths, which all talked about progress, and were occupied in marking time. Frenchmen, under all superficial reactions, remained republican in spirit, as they had been when they first wore top-hats. Englishmen, under all superficial reforms, remained oligarchical in spirit, as they had been when they first wore trousers. Only one power might be said to be growing, and that in a plodding and prosaic fashion--the power in the North-East whose name was Prussia. And the English were more and more learning that this growth need cause them no alarm, since the North Germans were their cousins in blood and their brothers in spirit.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the figure}} {{to which these}} {{questions}} attached themselves she had found a convenient description--she thought of it for herself, always, {{as that of a}} girl with a background. The great reality was in the fact that, very soon, after but two or three meetings, the girl with the background, the girl with the crown of old gold and the mourning that was not as the mourning of Boston, but at once more rebellious in its gloom and more frivolous in its frills, had told her she had never seen any one like her. They had met thus as opposed curiosities, and that simple remark of Milly's--if simple it was--became <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> had ever happened to her; it deprived the love-interest, for the time, of actuality and even of pertinence; it moved her first, in short, in a high degree, to gratitude, and then to no small compassion. Yet in respect to this relation at least it was what did prove the key of knowledge; it lighted up as nothing else could do the poor young woman's history. That the potential heiress of all the ages should never have seen any one like a mere typical subscriber, after all, to the [...] "Transcript" [...] was a truth that--in especial as announced with modesty, with humility, with regret--described a situation. It laid upon the elder woman, as to the void to be filled, a weight of responsibility; but in particular it led her to ask whom poor Mildred had then seen, and what range of contacts it had taken to produce such queer surprises. That was really the inquiry that had ended by clearing the air: the key of knowledge was felt to click in the lock from the moment it flashed upon Mrs. Stringham that her friend had been starved for culture. Culture was what she herself represented for her, and it was living up to that principle that would surely prove the great business. She knew, the clever lady, what the principle itself represented, and the limits of her own store; and a certain alarm would have grown upon her if something else hadn't grown faster.|$|E
