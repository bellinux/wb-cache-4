5|$|The ruling dynasty of Greece (the House of Glücksburg) was of German-Danish origin, and Constantine and Sophia {{were seen}} as far <b>too</b> <b>German</b> by the Venizelists, but even though the {{marriage}} of the king to a Greek presented an opportunity to Hellenize the royal family, and counter criticisms {{that it was a}} foreign institution, both Venizelists and Constantinists opposed the match. The Venizelists feared it would give Alexander a means to communicate with his exiled family through Colonel Manos and both sides of the political divide were unhappy at the king marrying a commoner. Although Venizelos was a friend of Petros Manos, the prime minister warned the king that marrying her would be unpopular {{in the eyes of the}} people.|$|E
25|$|With {{the growth}} of industry, radical {{movements}} were also astir. Socialist organizations {{were responsible for the}} assassinations of many public figures, government officials, members of the royal family, and the Tsar himself. Tsar Alexander II was killed by a suicide bomber Ignacy Hryniewiecki in 1881, in a plot with connections to the family of Lenin and other revolutionaries. The Revolution of 1905 initiated here and spread rapidly into the provinces. During World War I, the name Sankt Peterburg was seen to be <b>too</b> <b>German,</b> so the city was renamed Petrograd.|$|E

5000|$|Paramonov {{was going}} on working at the Zoological Museum though he stopped holding the {{director}} post. Germans appointed the zoologist [...] as a director {{because he was a}} volksdeutsche. At the time of Nazi occupation the Austrian entomologist Karl E. Schedl was working at the Ukrainian Zoological Museum <b>too.</b> <b>Germans</b> decided to evacuate the museum because of the Soviet advance, so Nazis declared museum exhibits as war trophies and sent them to Poznań.|$|R
500|$|In 1918, {{as the war}} neared its end, Holst {{finally had}} the {{prospect}} of a job that offered him the chance to serve. The music section of the YMCA's education department needed volunteers to work with British troops stationed in Europe awaiting demobilisation. Morley College and St Paul's Girls' School offered him a year's leave of absence, but there remained one obstacle: the YMCA felt that his surname looked <b>too</b> <b>German</b> to be acceptable in such a role. He formally changed [...] "von Holst" [...] to [...] "Holst" [...] by deed poll in September 1918. He was appointed as the YMCA's musical organiser for the Near East, based in Salonica.|$|E
500|$|The British {{perceived}} him as <b>too</b> <b>German,</b> and in {{the opinion}} of historian Ragnhild Hatton, wrongly assumed that he had a succession of German mistresses. However, in mainland Europe, he was seen as a progressive ruler supportive of the Enlightenment who permitted his critics to publish without risk of severe censorship, and provided sanctuary to Voltaire when the philosopher was exiled from Paris in 1726. European and British sources agree that George was reserved, temperate and financially prudent; George disliked to be in the public light at social events, avoided the royal box at the opera and often travelled incognito to the house of a friend to play cards. Despite some unpopularity, the Protestant George I was seen by most of his subjects as a better alternative to the Roman Catholic Pretender James. William Makepeace Thackeray indicates such ambivalent feelings as he wrote: ...|$|E

In Intermezzo, she {{played the role of}} a young piano accompanist opposite Leslie Howard as a famous violin virtuoso. She arrived in Los Angeles on 6 May 1939, and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence. According to Selznick's son, Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had a few concerns about Ingrid: [...] "She didn't speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded <b>too</b> <b>German,</b> and her eyebrows were too thick." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of [...] {{the rest of the}} 51st (Highland) Division blew the bridges over the Arques and the Eaulne, where the Germans {{promptly}} attacked. The 4th Seaforth and the 1st Black Watch managed to hold on, despite attacks at Arques la Bataille and Martigny, where the artillery repulsed several German advances. The panzer divisions had turned north from Rouen towards Dieppe and captured the Arkforce wireless lorry near Carny on the Durdent river at [...] The river was the next position the 51st Highland Division was to retire to after dark and a reconnaissance by the 1st Lothian found the Germans on the river crossings at Veulettes-sur-Mer close to the coast <b>too.</b> <b>German</b> tanks were reported [...] from divisional headquarters that afternoon and rear parties moving westwards preparatory to the retreat that night, ran into German troops. At [...] , part of the destroyer force that had been giving the division fire support for several days, was damaged by German artillery on the cliffs near St. Valery-en-Caux and [...] was hit while embarking troops from the beach; IX Corps had been cut off from Le Havre.|$|E

6000|$|He {{recalled}} his {{first sight of}} Heinrich at the junction, and how he had laughed {{at the sight of}} his excessive Teutonism. The close-cropped shining fair head surmounted by a yellowish-white corps cap had appeared dodging about among the people upon the platform, and manifestly asking questions. The face had been very pink with the effort of an unaccustomed tongue. The young man had been clad in a suit of white flannel refined by a purple line; his boots were of that greenish yellow leather that only a German student could esteem [...] "chic"; his rucksack was upon his back, and the precious fiddle in its case was carried very carefully in one hand; this same dead fiddle. The other hand held a stick with a carved knob and a pointed end. He had been <b>too</b> <b>German</b> for belief. [...] "Herr Heinrich!" [...] Mr. Britling had said, and straightway the heels had clashed together for a bow, a bow from the waist, a bow that a heedless old lady much burthened with garden produce had greatly disarranged. From first to last amidst our off-hand English ways Herr Heinrich had kept his bow--and always it had been getting disarranged.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{make it look}} {{worse than}} mere {{newspaper}} talk and speeches," [...] Mr. Britling pressed. [...] "Carson, it seems, was lunching with the German Emperor last autumn.

6000|$|The Christmas of 1914 found England, whose {{landscape}} had hitherto {{been almost}} as peaceful and soldierless as Massachusetts, already far gone {{along the path}} of transformation into a country full of soldiers and munition makers and military supplies. The soldiers came first, on the well-known and greatly admired British principle of [...] "first catch your hare" [...] and then build your kitchen. Always before, Christmas had been a time of much gaiety and dressing up and prancing and two-stepping at the Dower House, but this year everything was too uncertain to allow of any gathering of guests. Hugh got leave for the day after Christmas, but Teddy was tied; and Cissie and Letty went off with the small boy to take lodgings near him. The Van der Pants had hoped to see an English Christmas at Matching's Easy, but within three weeks of Christmas Day Mr. Van der Pant found a job {{that he could do}} in Nottingham, and carried off his family. The two small boys cheered their hearts with paper decorations, but the Christmas Tree was condemned as <b>too</b> <b>German,</b> and it was discovered that Santa Claus had suddenly become Old Father Christmas again. The small boys discovered that the price of lead soldiers had risen, and were unable to buy electric torches, on which they had set their hearts. There was to have been a Christmas party at Claverings, but at the last moment Lady Homartyn had to hurry off to an orphan nephew who had been seriously wounded near Ypres, and the light of Claverings was darkened.|$|E

50|$|When Talleyrand became French {{ambassador}} in London in 1830, she accompanied him and felt more comfortable there than in Paris, which she detested {{and where the}} whole Faubourg Saint-Germain made her feel she was a foreigner.

50|$|The sculptures symbolizing {{agriculture}} and war, {{designed by the}} initial architect Raul-Paul Brank, were not approved due to being seemingly <b>too</b> <b>German</b> in appearance, and were remodelled and made more Bulgarian by T.
