5|$|In 1823, Wickliffe {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives and served five {{consecutive}} terms. Again he succeeded his cousin and friend, Ben Hardin. Though a Whig, he disagreed with many of the positions of the party's founder, Henry Clay. When no candidate received a majority of the electoral votes in the 1824 presidential election, the constitution mandated that the election be decided in the House. Wickliffe bucked Clay's advice <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and instead voted for Andrew Jackson, who was the choice of the Kentucky legislature.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic-Republican congressional caucus convened February 25, 1804. Contrary to {{previous}} conventions, the proceedings were open and formal. Afraid that taking vice presidential nominations {{from the floor}} would precipitate divisive oratory, chairman Stephen Bradley called for open balloting for the nomination. New York's George Clinton received a majority with 67 votes; Breckinridge garnered 20 votes, mostly from western delegates, and the remaining votes were scattered among 4 other candidates. Historian James C. Klotter concluded that the solons felt a ticket composed of Jefferson, a Virginian, and Breckinridge, a former Virginian, made little political sense. Breckinridge acceded to the choice; some reports hold that he asked his colleagues not <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> at all. Before the caucus adjourned, a thirteen-man committee was formed to promote {{the election of the}} Democratic-Republican ticket; Breckinridge represented Kentucky on the committee.|$|E

5|$|Formal {{nominations}} {{began the}} following day. Hardin {{felt as though}} he had been cheated and withdrew his candidacy, although some loyal delegates continued <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Delegate John Stockdale Rhea nominated Stone. Stone believed that his agreement with Goebel meant, with Hardin's withdrawal, Goebel would instruct his delegates to vote for Stone, maintaining a unified party. That understanding vanished when another delegate nominated Goebel. Stone was further incensed when all of the Louisville delegation voted for Goebel instead of being split between Stone and Goebel, as the two men had previously agreed. In retaliation, some Stone supporters began to back Hardin. Seeing the breakdown of the Stone-Goebel alliance, Hardin reversed his withdrawal. After numerous ballots, the convention was deadlocked on the night of June 24 with each candidate receiving about one-third of the votes. No deliberations were held on Sunday, June 25, and when the delegates reconvened on Monday, June 26, the hall was filled with police per Redwine's request. Rhea requested that the police be removed to prevent intimidation, but Redwine ruled the motion out of order. Another delegate appealed Redwine's decision, and, in violation of parliamentary rule, Redwine ruled the appeal out of order. Angered by Redwine's obviously biased rulings, delegates for Stone and Hardin then began trying to disrupt the convention by blowing horns, singing, yelling, and standing on chairs. Although voting was attempted, many delegates abstained because they were unable to hear and understand what was going on. When the voting—such as it was—ended, the chair announced that Goebel had a majority of the votes cast, but Goebel sent word to Redwine that he would only accept the nomination if he received an absolute majority of the delegates. Further attempts to vote were likewise disrupted, and the meeting adjourned for the day.|$|E

25|$|To be {{selected}} as the 2008 Republican Party Nominee, a candidate must have received the vote of 1,191 delegates. As of March 4, 2008, McCain had received the pledges of more than 1,191 delegates. Although most of those delegates were not required <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> on September 3, 2008, McCain won the nomination almost unanimously.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the election, there was {{considerable}} controversy among Catholics on how <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b> Some felt that with Kerry's pro-choice stance that Catholics should not <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Kerry.

50|$|The sixth {{straw poll}} on 21 November 1991 {{revealed}} a clear winner. Boutros-Ghali {{was selected by}} a vote of 11-0-4. Chidzero came in second with a vote of 7-2-6. France and Belgium convinced four of Chidzero's supporters <b>to</b> stop <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> stoked by fears that the United States was trying to delay the selection so that a compromise candidate could emerge, while Boutros-Ghali and Chidzero cancelled each other out.|$|R

Gore chose Lieberman over five finalists.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the crucial}} {{questions}} after Obama's speech was what effect (if any) the speech would have on voters {{in terms of their}} overall opinion of Obama and their willingness <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in the remaining Democratic primaries and in the general election. Critical to these questions was the extent to which voters identified Obama with the views of Jeremiah Wright.|$|E
25|$|Democratic nominee John McKeithen {{at first}} warned voters {{that they were}} {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as the party standard-bearer because their participation in a party primary carried with it a loyalty oath to the eventual nominee.

25|$|Hart {{played an}} active role in the race for {{majority}} leader in early 2006. As a top whip for the successful candidacy of Rep. John Boehner (R-OH), she worked <b>to</b> secure <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> in the race. She was one of a handful of GOP members who called for a full set of new leadership elections for whip, conference chair, and other offices below the majority leader position, but that motion narrowly failed the day before the majority leader race. Had this motion passed, Hart may have challenged Rep. Deborah Pryce (R-OH) for House Republican Conference Chairman, the No. 4 leadership spot.|$|R
5000|$|By late April, Cruz and Kasich {{had both}} been {{eliminated}} from getting 1,237 delegates, {{but they still}} {{had a chance to}} accumulate enough delegates to force a contested convention in Cleveland. Realizing this, Cruz and Kasich attempted to focus their efforts in different states, with Cruz challenging Trump head-to-head in Indiana and Kasich challenging Trump head-to-head in Oregon and New Mexico. However, the alliance was tenuous at best, with Kasich telling voters in Indiana the next day <b>to</b> still <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and Cruz downplaying the alliance later in the week; it also met with disapproval from 58% of Indiana voters.|$|R
25|$|The {{different}} {{accounts of}} the conclave (written by the conclavists for the various cardinals) disagree {{on the number of}} votes received by the three papabile; on the first scrutiny. Baumgartner regards as the most accurate the account according 15 votes to della Rovere, 13 to d'Amboise, and 4 to Piccolomini. This was bad news for d'Amboise, who knew that many of his pledged supporters had promised only <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> on the first scrutiny. Therefore, d'Amboise threw his support to Piccolomini.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of October Carafa broke his {{alliance}} with Sforza, as Philip II decided to return the fiefdom Palli Colonnie Marcantonio and ordered the Spanish cardinals to prevent the selection of Gonzaga at all costs. Cardinal d'Este allied himself with Carafa, hoping to win the election, but the vote on 1 December showed this was in vain, with many who had promised <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> not doing so. The French also – without much success – tried to get cardinals Tournon and Suau elected.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{withdrawing}} from the presidential race in July 2011, Norris maintained considerable and, in some cases, increased public support. A poll taken one week after Norris withdrew from the presidential race, showed a large increase in public support for his Presidency if they were given the choice <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> (topping the poll by a considerable margin) with 40 per cent of respondents now saying they would vote Norris {{number one in the}} preferential voting electoral system and 50 per cent saying they would give him a vote.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee's {{delegation}} did {{not attend}} the convention. Edward Rucker, a Tennessean who happened to be in Baltimore, was picked to cast its 15 votes, so that all the states would endorse Van Buren.

50|$|When he ran {{for reelection}} to a third term in 1960, his first and, it would turn out, last attempt at running for office after refusing to sign the Southern Manifesto, he faced staunch {{opposition}} for renomination from his party's still-thriving pro-segregation wing, but he won the primary decisively, 64% vs. 34% for his opponent, Tip Taylor. During the general election itself, polls showed Kefauver's support to be near-nonexistent and it was later said that, on election day, no one outside of Kefauver's family could be found who would admit <b>to</b> having <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Nevertheless, Kefauver swamped his opponent, winning nearly 72% of the vote.|$|R
25|$|Mainwaring {{received}} a letter of support from Labour Party leader George Lansbury, and an appeal from the President, Vice-President and General Secretary of the South Wales Miners' Federation was made for all miners and their families <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> The Labour Party had won easily in a straight fight with Arthur Horner at the previous election, but {{the decision of the}} Liberal Party to fight an energetic campaign (the Liberal candidate was allied with David Lloyd George and opposed to the National Government) was thought to have given the party a scare because Labour had benefited from Liberal votes in 1931. Mainwaring predicted that he would get between 20,000 and 22,000 votes. In the event, Mainwaring won with 14,127 votes, with Horner second having increased his vote compared with 1931.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{contests}} {{took place}} from January 3 to July 14 and elected and allocated 2,286 voting {{delegates to the}} 2012 Republican National Convention in the week of August 27. To become the Republican Party's nominee for the 2012 presidential election a candidate needed a majority of 1,144 delegates <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and plurality in five state delegations. The 2012 race was significantly different from earlier races. Many states switched from their old winner-take-all allocation to proportional allocation. Many remaining winner-take-all states allocated delegates to both the winner of each congressional district and {{the winner of the}} state. The change was made to prolong the race, giving lesser known candidates a chance and making it harder for a frontrunner to secure the majority early. It was also hoped that this change in the election system would energize the base of the party.|$|E
25|$|Robert Kennedy's death {{altered the}} {{dynamics}} of the race. Although Humphrey appeared the prohibitive favorite for the nomination, thanks to his support from the traditional power blocs of the party, he was an unpopular choice with many of the anti-war elements within the party, who identified him with Johnson's controversial position on the Vietnam War. However, Kennedy's delegates failed to unite behind a single candidate who could have prevented Humphrey from getting the nomination. Some of Kennedy's support went to McCarthy, but many of Kennedy's delegates, remembering their bitter primary battles with McCarthy, refused <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Instead, these delegates rallied around the late-starting candidacy of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, a Kennedy supporter in the spring primaries who had presidential ambitions himself. This division of the anti-war votes at the Democratic Convention made it easier for Humphrey to gather the delegates he needed to win the nomination.|$|E
5|$|It {{lasted for}} five months, from 12 February to 12 July 1691. The {{conclave}} became deadlocked after Catholic monarchs opposed {{the election of}} Gregorio Barbarigo, who {{some members of the}} College of Cardinals also viewed as too strict. The conclave only ended in the July when cardinals started to become ill from the heat, and after French cardinals agreed <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> Pignatelli despite <b>him</b> coming from Spanish-controlled Naples.|$|R
50|$|After {{a phenomenal}} {{performance}} in the debates, Long wins the most electors, but does not win enough to win the election, so the election is forced to the United States House of Representatives. After the President chooses not to interfere in the House Vote, Long convinces West Virginia and Pennsylvania <b>to</b> cast their <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> giving him the Presidency.

25|$|A Quinnipiac poll, {{published}} January 21, {{showed him}} trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the leading potential Democratic contender, 46% to 38%, {{which was a}} downturn from two previous polls that showed Christie and Clinton about even, after Christie had gained considerably in the polls against her since March 2013. Peoples' view of his presidential capabilities went down with 35% agreeing and 36% disagreeing {{that he would make}} a good president. This was down from 49% agreeing to 31% disagreeing in a November poll. For those who had heard of the Bridgegate scandal, 50% said this scandal would hurt Christie's presidential hopes, and made 34% of those polled less likely <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> His favorability rating declined to only 33% viewing him generally as favorable with 30% unfavorable. This was down from his highest rating of 47% favorable to 23% unfavorable in December 2013. The poll showed that he had gone from the leading potential Republican candidate in December to a statistical tie with three others.|$|E
25|$|State Delegation Each {{delegation}} {{are made}} up of up to three kinds of delegates. Party members, delegates from the congressional districts and delegates from the state at-large. They can either be bound, meaning that they are legally or morally bound to vote for a candidate for at least the first ballot at the National Convention, or they can be unbound, meaning that they are free to vote for any candidate at the National Convention. Some delegates are only morally bound, meaning that they are allocated to a candidate or elected on his ticket but are not legally bound <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Some delegates are unbound but are elected at their local conventions because they are strong supporters of a candidate. This means that the binding status of a delegate only become of importance if no candidate have reached a majority of delegates before the National Convention. If a candidate suspends his campaign the delegates allocated and/or elected to him may become unbound depending on state rules. Five delegations (#) have been penalized for breaking RNC election guidelines, meaning that their number of delegates have been cut in half and their party leaders have been banned from voting. Ten delegations (†) have chosen to bind their party leaders to the result of the allocating event instead of leaving them unbound.|$|E
25|$|Timothy had again {{been elected}} to the {{legislature}} in 1762, but was not reelected the following year due to an election rigged by Elijah Williams. In November 1762, the Susquehanna Company voted {{him to be a}} part of a committee to meet with the Native American chiefs at Albany to discuss the purchase they had made, which was still disputed. This meeting was set for late March, and Elijah and his supporters took advantage of his absence. At this time, the number of English settlers had increased drastically, and some of them were in favor of splitting the town between the English and Native Americans. Williams called for a town meeting while Timothy was in Albany, and while many of the Native American voters were away on their winter syrup harvest. Timothy heard about this, but was apparently convinced his supporters would reelect him. Williams, however, brought in outsiders <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and used a written ballot, as opposed to the past policy of translating everything into Mahican so that the Mahicans would understand. Even using these extreme tactics, Williams still only won by a three-vote margin. Timothy and his supporters were outraged and demanded an investigation. A petition was sent to Governor Bernard in May with 23 signatures, and Timothy sent another letter in December with 16 signatures. The investigation was delayed until October, and confirmed many of their charges, however the results were allowed to stand.|$|E
50|$|Candidates {{may seek}} <b>to</b> {{encourage}} bullet <b>voting</b> in certain situations. One example is {{where there is}} a Bloc <b>voting</b> election <b>for</b> two seats of the same office, and there are several candidates (say A, B, and C). Voters in such a situation typically have two votes. Candidate A encourages his voters <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> only <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and not use their second vote. If the second <b>vote</b> is cast <b>for</b> B or C, it helps A's opponents. The situation is most pronounced where A is of one party and B and C are of another party. If voters from B and C's party <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> them, while A's partisans cast one <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> A and split their second vote between B and C, A is significantly disadvantaged.|$|R
