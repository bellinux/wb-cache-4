During a race, vehicles can sustain damage from collisions, which can subsequently be repaired at intervals after every two events.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of distance from the target during dominant and non-dominant jab punches, on <b>total</b> response <b>time,</b> repeated jab punch force and anaerobic fatigue of amateur boxers. Data was gathered of the following variables: Biographical data, anthropometric data, <b>total</b> response <b>time,</b> change in <b>total</b> response <b>time,</b> number of punches, peak punch force and peak punch force fatigue resistance index. An exploratory and descriptive research design was used. Twelve male amateur boxers participated in this study. The participants were all either provincially or nationally ranked, between the ages 16 and 22 and in the competitive phase of their training. The data was compared to find statistical significance and it was found from the Wilcoxon ranked sign test that distance does not affect <b>total</b> response <b>time,</b> change in <b>total</b> response <b>time,</b> number of punches and peak punch force fatigue resistance index. However, it was found that distance affects peak punch force. Additionally,it was found using a Spearman rank correlation test that older boxers proved to have statistically significant faster <b>total</b> response <b>times,</b> the boxers that had slower <b>total</b> reponse <b>times</b> proved to have statistically significant less powerful peak punch force, the boxers that had slower <b>total</b> response <b>times</b> proved to have statistically significant larger fatigue resistance index, boxers with larger change in <b>total</b> response <b>time</b> proved to have statistically significant more powerful peak punch force and the boxers with larger peak punch force proved to have statistically significant smaller fatigue resistance index.

5|$|A {{somewhat}} different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of the}} first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the <b>total</b> <b>time</b> for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E
