50|$|<b>Tayras</b> breed year-round, {{with the}} females {{entering}} estrus several times {{each year for}} anything from 3 to 20 days at a time. Unlike some other mustelids, <b>tayras</b> do not exhibit embryonic diapause, and gestation lasts from 63 to 67 days. The female gives birth to from one to three young, which she cares for alone.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} nonhuman animals to project {{individual}} actions {{into the future}} is a hotly debated topic. We describe the caching behaviour of <b>tayras</b> (Eira barbara) based on direct observations in the field, pictures from camera traps and radio telemetry, providing evidence that these mustelids pick and cache unripe fruit for future consumption. This is the first reported case of harvesting of unripe fruits by a nonhuman animal. Ripe fruits are readily taken {{by a variety of}} animals, and <b>tayras</b> might benefit by securing a food source before strong competition takes place. Unripe climacteric fruits need to be harvested when mature to ensure that they continue their ripening process, and <b>tayras</b> accurately choose mature stages of these fruits for caching. <b>Tayras</b> cache both native (sapote) and non-native (plantain) fruits that differ in morphology and developmental timeframes, showing sophisticated cognitive ability that might involve highly developed learning abilities and/or prospective thinking. 6 page(s...|$|R
2500|$|Fauna include jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), gray brocket (Mazama gouazoubira), <b>tayra</b> (Eira barbara), coatis, {{crab-eating fox}} (Cerdocyon thous), [...] black-tufted {{marmoset}} (Callithrix penicillata), gray four-eyed opossum (Philander opossum), opossums, Brazilian squirrel (Sciurus aestuans), South American water rat (Nectomys squamipes), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) pacas, common agoutis, Brazilian guinea pig (Cavia aperea) and tapeti (Sylvilagus brasiliensis).|$|E
2500|$|The white-fronted {{capuchin}} frequently {{travels with}} the common squirrel monkey {{and at other times}} with the tufted capuchin and Venezuelan red howler. The double-toothed kite often accompanies these monkeys, exactly as it does other species of primates. The white-fronted capuchin feels threatened by avian predators, and it is very vigilant around any large bird of prey. In Vichada, Colombia, <b>tayra,</b> Boa constrictor and the ornate hawk-eagle have been seen trying to capture the monkey. After detecting the <b>tayra</b> and Boa constrictor the members of the troop showed little fear and caution, even though these animals threatened the monkeys. The most common behavior after detecting a potential ground predator is [...] "ya-ya" [...] vocalization and branch breaking over the head of the potential predator, similar to the display of the brown woolly monkey. In contrast, after being frightened by a male ornate hawk-eagle the monkeys screamed intensely only once, then hid quietly, some descending to the ground to sneak away.|$|E

50|$|Coati predators include jaguarundis, boa constrictors, foxes, dogs, <b>tayras,</b> ocelots, and jaguars. Large raptors, such as ornate hawk-eagles, black-and-chestnut eagles, and harpy eagles, {{also are}} known to hunt them. White-headed {{capuchin}} monkeys hunt their pups.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tayras</b> are long, slender {{animals with}} an {{appearance}} similar to weasels and martens. They range from 56 to 71 cm in length, not including a 37 to 46 cm long bushy tail, and weigh 2.7 to 7 kg. Males are larger, and slightly more muscular, than females. They have short, dark brown to black fur which is relatively uniform across the body, limbs, and tail, {{except for a}} yellow or orange spot on the chest. The fur {{on the head and}} neck is much paler, typically tan or greyish in color. Albino or yellowish individuals are also known, and are not as rare among <b>tayras</b> as they are amongst other mustelids.|$|R
50|$|The predators for M. bicolor {{include many}} of the same predators for other Meliponini species, such as birds, lizards, spiders, and mammals such as <b>tayras</b> and kinkajous. Since they are a species of stingless bee, {{they do not have a}} great defense against predators.|$|R

50|$|The <b>tayra</b> (Eira barbara), is an {{omnivorous}} animal {{from the}} weasel family, {{native to the}} Americas. It is the only species in the genus Eira.|$|E
50|$|Wild <b>tayra</b> {{populations are}} slowly shrinking, {{especially}} in Mexico, due to habitat destruction for agricultural purposes. The species {{is listed as}} being of Least Concern.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tayras</b> are solitary diurnal animals, {{although}} occasionally active {{during the}} evening or at night. They are opportunistic omnivores, hunting rodents and other small mammals, as well as birds, lizards, and invertebrates, and climbing trees to get fruit and honey. They locate prey primarily by scent, having relatively poor eyesight, and actively chase it once located, rather than stalking or using ambush tactics.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the adult}} potoo likely has few natural predators, {{predation}} of eggs, nestlings and fledging is apparently not uncommon. Adults stay near the nest {{throughout the day}} and rely upon camouflage to protect their offspring. Predators of great potoo nests in Costa Rica have included monkeys such as mantled howlers, Geoffroy's spider monkeys and white-headed capuchins as well as <b>tayras</b> and collared forest falcons.|$|R

50|$|Among the mammals {{protected}} in the reserve are: the mantled howler monkey, the jaguar, the margay, the neotropical otter, the Guayaquil squirrel, the <b>tayra</b> and the white-tailed deer.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{instance of}} caching {{has been observed}} among tayras: a <b>tayra</b> will pick unripe green plantains, which are inedible, and leave them to ripen in a cache, coming back {{a few days later}} to consume the softened pulp.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tayras</b> {{are also}} known as the tolomuco or perico ligero in Central America, motete in Honduras, irara in Brazil, san hol or viejo de monte in the Yucatan Peninsula, and high-woods dog (or {{historically}} chien bois) in Trinidad. The genus name Eira is derived from the indigenous name of the animal in Bolivia and Peru, while barbara means [...] "strange" [...] or [...] "foreign".|$|R
50|$|They are omnivores, preferring small vertebrates, fruits, carrion, insects, {{snakes and}} eggs. They can climb trees easily, where the tail {{is used for}} balance, but they are most often on the ground foraging. Their predators include boas, raptors, hunting cats, and <b>Tayras</b> (Eira barbara). They readily adapt to human presence; like raccoons, they will raid campsites and trash receptacles. They can be tamed easily, and have been {{verified}} experimentally to be quite intelligent.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tayras</b> {{are found}} across most of South America {{east of the}} Andes, except for Uruguay, eastern Brazil, and {{all but the most}} northerly parts of Argentina. They are also found across the whole of Central America, in Mexico as far north as {{southern}} Veracruz, and on the island of Trinidad. They are generally found only in tropical and subtropical forests, although they may cross grasslands at night to move between forest patches, and they also inhabit cultivated plantations and croplands.|$|R
50|$|Mammals include {{maned wolf}} (Chrysocyon brachyurus), pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus), cougar (Puma concolor), {{capybara}} (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), robust capuchin monkey, crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus), bush dog (Speothos venaticus), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), common agouti, paca, <b>tayra</b> (Eira barbara) and neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis).|$|E
5000|$|Tayras are {{playful and}} easily tamed. Indigenous people, who often {{refer to the}} <b>tayra</b> as [...] "cabeza del viejo", or old man's head, due to their {{wrinkled}} facial skin, have kept them as household pets to control vermin. Sometimes, they attack domestic animals, such as chickens.|$|E
50|$|Fauna {{species that}} inhabit the area include the jaguar, Hoffman's two-toed sloth, nine-banded armadillo, Baird's tapir, gray fox, coyote, oncilla, ocelot, red brocket, white-nosed coati, resplendent quetzal, black guan, great curassow, Costa Rican salamander, swallow-tailed kite, emerald toucanet, violet sabrewing, <b>tayra,</b> {{mountain}} thrush, sooty thrush, three-wattled bellbird and the black-faced solitaire.|$|E
50|$|The feet have toes of unequal length with {{tips that}} form a {{strongly}} curved line when held together. The claws are short and curved, but strong, being adapted for climbing and running rather than digging. The pads {{of the feet}} are hairless, but are surrounded by stiff sensory hairs. The head has small, rounded, ears, long whiskers and black eyes with a blue-green shine. Like most other mustelids, <b>tayras</b> possess anal scent glands, {{but these are not}} particularly large, and their secretion is not as pungent as in other species, and is not used in self-defence.|$|R
50|$|Wedge-capped capuchins {{have been}} {{observed}} to give alarm calls if they observe a potential predator. Such predators include jaguars, ocelots, <b>tayras,</b> boa constrictors, caimans, and collared peccaries. In addition, alarm calls {{have been observed}} when the capuchin sees one of several birds, such as hook-billed kites, black vultures, green ibises, rufous-vented chachalacas, harpy eagles, or ornate hawk-eagles. Due to these predators, the wedge-capped capuchin has taken to living in groups; as group size increases, vigilance per animal decreases, though {{it has not yet}} been demonstrated that capuchins in larger groups are any less vulnerable than those in smaller groups.|$|R
50|$|Mating {{may take}} place when two animals {{encounter}} {{each other at}} night. The female usually has two offspring which are born in the burrow, and follow her around when they {{are old enough to}} do so. When out at night, jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) are the greatest danger to the armadillo. When it crosses streams, the armadillo may be seized by a black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) or an anaconda (Eunectes murinus). It can also be killed by <b>tayras</b> (Eira barbara) when several hunt together. During the day, bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) sometimes enter the burrow and pull the armadillo out, eating it beside the entrance.|$|R
