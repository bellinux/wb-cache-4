2500|$|Within {{the body}} of Hawaiian {{architecture}} are various subsets of styles; each are considered typical of particular historical periods. [...] The earliest form of Hawaiian architecture originates from what is called ancient Hawaiidesigns employed {{in the construction of}} village shelters from the simple shacks of outcasts and slaves, huts for the fishermen and canoe builders along the beachfronts, the shelters of the working class makaainana, the elaborate and sacred heiau of kahuna and the palatial thatched homes on raised basalt foundation of the alii. [...] The way a simple grass shack was constructed in ancient Hawaii was telling of who lived in a particular home. [...] The patterns in which dried plants and lumber were fashioned together could identify caste, skill and <b>trade,</b> <b>profession</b> and wealth. [...] Hawaiian architecture previous to the arrival of British explorer Captain James Cook used symbolism to identify religious value of the inhabitants of certain structures. [...] Feather standards called kahili and koa adorned with kapa cloth and crossed at the entrance of certain homes called puloulou indicated places of alii (nobility caste). Kii enclosed within basalt walls indicated the homes of kahuna (priestly caste).|$|E
