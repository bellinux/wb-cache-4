The steady-state whole-body synthesis-secretion (conversion) coefficient to AA equaled 5. 4 × 10 − 3 min− 1, while the conversion rate (coefficient × concentration) equaled 16. 1 μmol/day. This rate exceeds the reported brain AA consumption rate by 27 -fold. As brain and heart cannot synthesize significant AA from circulating LA, liver synthesis is necessary to maintain their homeostatic AA concentrations in the absence of dietary AA.

5000|$|Estradiol was {{discovered}} in 1929, and beginning in 1936, a variety of estradiol esters, such as estradiol benzoate and estradiol dipropionate, were introduced for clinical use. Testosterone esters, such as testosterone propionate and testosterone phenylacetate, were also introduced around this time. In contrast to estradiol and testosterone, progesterone proved more difficult <b>to</b> <b>esterify.</b> In fact, esterification involves the replacement of a hydroxy group with an alkoxy group, and unlike estradiol and testosterone, progesterone does not possess any hydroxy groups, so it is actually not chemically possible <b>to</b> <b>esterify</b> progesterone itself. The first progestogen esters were not introduced until the mid-1950s, and were esters of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone (which, unlike progesterone, has a hydroxy group available for esterification) rather than of progesterone; they included 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (Delalutin, Proluton) and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate (Prodrox).

The group consisted of 19 patients with Lyme arthritis (mean age 47  years) and the control group consisted of 16 healthy individuals (mean age 38  years). Diagnosis of Lyme disease was confirmed by epidemiological anamnesis, clinical manifestation of arthritis and serological examinations. Lipid peroxidation was estimated by the measurement of aldehydes (MDA and 4 -HNE, determined by high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]) and prostaglandin derivatives (, determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry [LC/MS]). MDA and 4 -HNE levels were increased about 2 - 4 -fold in the plasma, while in the urine, the increases were about 2 -fold. More significant increases were noted for the total plasma level, which was enhanced over 4 -fold, and for the urine level, which was increased over 8 -fold. The total plasma level consists of free and esterified form. During infection, the ratio of free <b>to</b> <b>esterified</b> form is significantly smaller compared to healthy people.

However, when using acetyl alcohol as the acyl acceptor, AWAT1 prefers saturated acyl groups, while AWAT2 shows activity with all four acyl-CoAs and performs two times better with unsaturated acyl-CoAs than with saturated ones.

50|$|Certain cells such as {{the human}} {{neutrophil}} may further metabolize 5-(S)-HETE. First, cells use a acyltransferase-dependent acylation reaction <b>to</b> <b>esterify</b> 5(S)-HETE into the phospholipids of cell membranes; this reaction could serve as means for storing 5(S)-HETE for release during subsequent cell stimulation or, alternatively, alter the properties of cell membranes in functionally important ways. Second, cells use a C-20 hydroxylase, cytochrome P450 (probably CYP4F3), to metabolize 5(S)-HETE to 5-(S),20-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoate (5,20-diHETE); since 5,20-diHETE is ~50- to 100-fold weaker than 5(S)-HETE in stimulating cells, this metabolism is proposed to represent a pathway for 5(S)-HETE inactivation. Third, cells, particularly human eosinophils, use ALOX15 to metabolize 5(S)-HETE to 5-(S),15-(S)-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoate (5,15-diHETE); 5,15-diHETE is ~3- to 10-fold weaker than 5(S)-HETE in stimulating cells. And, forth, cells use 12-lipoxygenase (i.e. ALOX12 to metabolize 5(S)-HETE to 5(S),12(S)-diHETE, cyclooxygenase-2 to metabolize 5(S)-HETE to 5-(S),15(R)-diHETE and 5-(S),11(R)-diHETE, and aspirin-treated cyclooxygenase-2 to metabolize 5(S)-HETE to 5-(S), 15(R)-diHETE; these metabolites {{have yet to be}} evaluated for activity.|$|E

40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcribes two genes, ARE 1 and ARE 2, that {{contribute}} disproportionately to the esterification of sterols. Are 2 p {{is the major}} enzyme isoform in a wild-type cell growing aerobically. This likely results {{from a combination of}} differential transcription initiation and transcript stability. By using ARE 1 and ARE 2 promoter fusions to lacZ reporters, we demonstrated that transcriptional initiation from the ARE 1 promoter is significantly reduced compared to that from the ARE 2 promoter. Furthermore, the half-life of the ARE 2 mRNA is approximately 12 times as long as that of the ARE 1 transcript. We present evidence that the primary role of the minor sterol esterification isoform encoded by ARE 1 is <b>to</b> <b>esterify</b> sterol intermediates, whereas the role of the ARE 2 enzyme is <b>to</b> <b>esterify</b> ergosterol, the end product of the pathway. Accordingly, the ARE 1 promoter is upregulated in strains that accumulate ergosterol precursors. Furthermore, ARE 1 and ARE 2 are oppositely regulated by heme. Under heme-deficient growth conditions, ARE 1 was upregulated fivefold while ARE 2 was down-regulated. ARE 2 requires the HAP 1 transcription factor for optimal expression, and both ARE genes are derepressed in a rox 1 (repressor of oxygen) mutant genetic background. We further report that the ARE genes are not subject to end product inhibition; neither ARE 1 nor ARE 2 transcription is altered in an are mutant background, nor does overexpression of either ARE gene alter the response of the ARE-lacZ reporter constructs. Our observations are consistent with an important physiological role for Are 1 p during anaerobic growth when heme is limiting and sterol precursors may accumulate.
