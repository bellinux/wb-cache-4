She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. She seems to be a bit of an outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E

25|$|If the Standard Model is correct, the {{particles}} and forces we observe in our universe exist {{as they do}} because of underlying quantum fields. Quantum fields can have states of differing stability, including 'stable', 'unstable', or 'metastable' (meaning very long-lived but not completely stable). If a more stable vacuum state were able to arise, then existing particles and forces would no longer arise as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe's present state. Different particles or forces would arise from (and be shaped by) whatever new quantum states arose. The world we know depends upon these particles and forces, so if this happened, everything around us, from subatomic particles to galaxies, and all fundamental forces, would be reconstituted into new fundamental particles and forces and structures. The universe would lose all of its present structures and become inhabited by new ones (depending upon the exact states involved) based upon the same quantum fields.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, beavers {{were brought}} from {{northern}} Manitoba in Canada {{to the island}} of Tierra Del Fuego in southern Chile and Argentina, for commercial fur production. However, the project failed and the beavers, ten pairs, were released into the wild. Having no natural predators in their new environment, they quickly spread throughout the island, and to other islands in the region, reaching a number of 100,000 individuals within just 50 years. They are now considered a serious invasive species in the region, due to their massive destruction of forest trees, and efforts are being made for their eradication. The drastically different ecosystem has led to substantial environmental damage, as the ponds created by the beavers have no ecological purpose (wetlands do not form there as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beavers' native territory) {{and there are no}} native, large predators. They have also been found to cross salt water to islands northward; a possible encroachment on the mainland has naturalists highly concerned.|$|E
500|$|Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane {{explained}} that the reason they made a parody of Star Wars in particular was because the show's staff members were huge fans of the films.

Reluctant to release a double album, they re-recorded a shorter version following the completion of the album's final song, [...] "15", with Manson asking the band: [...] "How many minutes do I have left on this CD ?

500|$|The {{title of}} the album was {{revealed}} through the 'Smoking Section' of Rolling Stone magazine on February 2, 2009, where it was also announced that a music video would be filmed for the track [...] "I Want to Kill You Like <b>They</b> <b>Do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Movies". Throughout March, five rough mixes of songs from the album were leaked. In {{an interview with a}} fansite, Chris Vrenna said of the leak: [...] "I hate stealing of music in any form.

[...] I think true fans know that usually songs found online before the record is released are rough mixes, and will wait to hear the music the way the artist intended." [...] "We're from America" [...] was released as a free download on the band's website from March 27, with a one-track digital single released through online retailers on April 7. A CD single was released on April 14, and was exclusively sold at Hot Topic. It peaked at number three on Billboards Hot Singles Sales, spending six weeks on the chart.|$|E
500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] is a midtempo electropop song; {{the song}} {{utilizes}} synthesizers and drum machines in its production. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing, the single {{is set in}} compound time with a moderate beat rate of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of D minor and Kesha's vocal range in the song spans from the note of D3 to the note of D5. Lyrically, [...] "Blah Blah Blah" [...] depicts a woman who would rather have sex than listen to a man speak as the singer finds talkative men annoying; blatant come-ons such as [...] "show me where your dick's at" [...] and [...] "I wanna be naked" [...] leave this literal meaning unambiguous. Kesha herself has been frank about this straightforward interpretation of the lyrics. The lyrics have been interpreted as {{a shot at the}} way men objectify women by speaking about them the way that <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> music industry. [...] " [...] Andrew Burgess of MusicOMH felt that the line [...] "I don't really care where you live at, just turn around boy, let me hit that. Don't be a little bitch with your chit-chat; just show me where your dick's at" [...] was a way of belittling her male peers. Fraser McAlpine of BBC noted that it was cultural progress that a woman can now [...] "sing a song as dirty [...] as her male peers".|$|E
500|$|Orci said getting Nimoy in {{the film}} was important. [...] "Having him sitting around a camp fire sharing his {{memories}} was never gonna cut it" [...] though, and time travel {{was going to be}} included {{in the film}} from the beginning. Kurtzman added, saying the time travel creates jeopardy, unlike other prequels where viewers [...] "know how they all died". The writers acknowledged time travel had been overused in the other series, but it served a good purpose in creating a new set of adventures for the original characters before they could completely do away with it in other films. Abrams selected the Romulans as the villains because they had been featured less than the Klingons in the series, and thought it was [...] "fun" [...] to have them meet Kirk before <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series. Orci and Kurtzman noted it would feel backward to demonize the Klingons again after they had become heroes in later Star Trek series, and the Romulan presence continues Spock's story from his last chronological appearance in [...] "", an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation set in 2368. The episode of the original continuity in which Kirk becomes the first human to ever see a Romulan, [...] "Balance of Terror", served as one of the influences for the film. Orci said it was difficult giving a good explanation for the time travel without being gimmicky, like having Nero specifically seeking to assassinate Kirk.|$|E
