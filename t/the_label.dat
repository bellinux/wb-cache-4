5|$|Key Sounds Label is a Japanese {{independent}} {{record label}} formed in 2001 as {{a brand of}} the publishing company VisualArt's. Key Sounds Label was formed to catalog and release music related to visual novels produced by the brand Key, also under VisualArt's, known for developing such titles as Kanon and Air. Excluding two albums and one single that were released by Key and VisualArt's before the label's formation, the majority of releases on <b>the</b> <b>label</b> all have a basis from one of Key's titles. There are other albums and singles on <b>the</b> <b>label</b> {{not directly related to}} the visual novels, such as two singles by Lia and one album by Riya.

40|$|Two {{different}} types of wrinkles in beer bottle labels are studied namely wrinkling due to <b>the</b> <b>labeling</b> process and wrinkles due to expansion of the paper as consequence of the moisture in <b>the</b> <b>labels.</b> Four problems are considered, namely, the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>labelling</b> process, <b>the</b> formation of wrinkles related to physical qualities of the paper, the spreading of the glue and removal of <b>the</b> <b>labels.</b> An optimal speed was found for <b>the</b> <b>labelling</b> process. <b>The</b> group evaluated {{the importance of the}} distance between the glue strips both for wrinkle constraint and removal of <b>the</b> <b>labels.</b> <b>The</b> group also investigated the influence of the angle between the preferential expansion direction of the paper and the glue strips and showed that the glue strips should be perpendicular to the fibres in the paper...|$|R

40|$|Crowdsourcing marketplaces {{are widely}} used for curating large {{annotated}} datasets by col-lecting labels from multiple annotators. In such scenarios one has to balance the trade-off between {{the accuracy of the}} collected la-bels, the cost of acquiring these <b>labels,</b> and <b>the</b> time taken to finish <b>the</b> <b>labeling</b> task. With <b>the</b> goal of reducing <b>the</b> <b>labeling</b> cost, we introduce the notion of sequential crowd-sourced labeling, where instead of asking for all <b>the</b> <b>labels</b> in one shot we acquire labels from annotators sequentially one at a time. We model it as an epsilon-greedy exploration in a Markov Decision Process with a Bayesian decision theoretic utility function that incor-porates accuracy, cost and time. Experimen-tal results confirm that <b>the</b> proposed sequen-tial <b>labeling</b> procedure can achieve similar ac-curacy at roughly half <b>the</b> <b>labeling</b> cost and at any stage in <b>the</b> <b>labeling</b> process <b>the</b> algo-rithm achieves a higher accuracy compared to randomly asking for <b>the</b> next <b>label.</b> ...|$|R
