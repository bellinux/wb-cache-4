500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Woman is an {{extension}} of Wollstonecraft's arguments in <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Men. In <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Men, as <b>the</b> title suggests, she is concerned with <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> particular men (18th-century British men) while in <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Woman, she is concerned with <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> afforded to [...] "woman", an abstract category. She does not isolate her argument to 18th-century women or British women. The first chapter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Woman addresses <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> natural <b>rights</b> and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds. She answers that since natural rights are given by God, for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin. <b>The</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> Woman thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by political philosophers such as John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> human <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> {{children}} have been established step by step since {{the early part of}} the 20 th century. In 1989, the UN adopted the Convention on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child, in which children were accorded not only <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child but also those <b>rights</b> established in <b>the</b> UN Universal Declaration <b>of</b> Human <b>Rights.</b> In Japan, however, both the government and public opinion maintain a conservative attitude toward the Convention on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child. Hence, the Committee on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child and local Japanese governmental bodies, which obey Convention on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child, carry out important roles for insuring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> children.

In Japan, educational policy and methods of childcare have been altered as a result of these broader changes. For these reasons, the Committee on <b>the</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Child has developed new recommendations for reconstructing the current system in order to protect <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> children which may be threatened by the global social changes produced by this highly competitive environment.

5|$|A major {{reform to}} the Court {{happened}} {{soon after the}} restoration, {{with the introduction of}} a right of appeal to the House of Lords from the Chancery. Before this there had been no records of appeals to the Lords, and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give the Lords jurisdiction over equity matters, except when problems and cases were sent directly to Parliament (as occasionally had been the case). In 1660 the Convention Parliament claimed for itself <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> appellate jurisdiction over equity matters, and also <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> original jurisdiction to hear equity cases at first instance. After disputes which lasted into the next Parliament, this second measure was dropped, but the right to hear equity appeals was confirmed. Horowitz writes that despite these changes, one of the academic certainties is that the problems which had dogged the court for the last two centuries persisted; Observations on the Dilatory and Expensive Proceedings in the Court of Chancery, written in 1701, listed 25 different procedures, areas and situations which contributed to the problems of high fees and slow processes.|$|E
