5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> envelope of the progenitor star. The plateau phase in TypeII-P supernovae is due to a change in the opacity of the exterior layer. The shock wave ionizes <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> atom – resulting in a significant increase in the opacity. This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> cools sufficiently to recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E
5|$|As {{outlined}} in the 3,500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to his opposition to <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> bomb.

5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, like all <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds {{to the large}} and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E

5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a colourless gas, like all <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds {{to the larger}} electronegative chlorine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen chloride}} at low temperatures, similar to <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (pKa = −7) because <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many hydrates HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. Hydrochloric acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 108.58°C at 20.22g HCl per 100g solution; thus hydrochloric acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> halides except hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and boils at −35.1°C. It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise the smallest of <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E

5|$|The {{universal}} {{emergence of}} atomic hydrogen first {{occurred during the}} recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can {{take the form of}} a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. <b>The</b> <b>hydrogen</b> cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Whether the {{information}} Fuchs passed relating to <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> bomb {{would have been}} useful is still debated.

The successful Teller-Ulam design was not devised until 1951.

40|$|Abstract—NMR {{experiments}} {{can provide}} distances between pairs of hydrogens of a protein molecule. The problem of identifying the coordinates of such <b>hydrogens</b> by exploiting <b>the</b> {{information on the}} distances is a Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (MDGP). In a previous work, we defined an artificial backbone of <b>hydrogens</b> related to <b>the</b> protein backbones, where a particular ordering was given to <b>the</b> <b>hydrogens.</b> This ordering allows to formulate the MDGP as a combinatorial optimization problem, to which we refer as the Discretizable MDGP (DMDGP) and that we efficiently solve by an exact algorithm, the Branch and Prune (BP) algorithm.

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water).
