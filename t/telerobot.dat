40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} tests involving either pure telerobotics, or <b>telerobots</b> in conjunction with extravehicular activity, applied {{to some of the}} servicing tasks of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). This research was conducted in a neutral buoyancy environment, using the high fidelity mockup used for astronaut crew training, along with two <b>telerobots</b> developed in the Space Systems Laboratory. These tests showed that current <b>telerobots</b> are capable of a limited subset of tasks required for EVA servicing of HST, and that specific developments in robotic capability are required, particularly in high torque output and positioning in constrained volumes, before the telerobotic systems are capable replacements to EVA. A more immediately promising application is the use of <b>telerobots</b> to enhance and extend the EVA capabilities, by acting as 'assistants' to the EVA crewmen performing the dexterous and high-force tasks...|$|R

40|$|HUB-based {{telerobotics}} is {{the study}} of the design and development of networked <b>telerobots</b> in the HUB environments. In this thesis, collaborative control mechanisms are investigated for more efficient and effective utilization of <b>telerobots</b> in the HUB, compared with conventional networked <b>telerobots.</b> In direct control scheme, an aggregation algorithm is used to integrate multiple control signals from operators for robot control. The aggregation is dynamically adjusted according to operators 2 ̆ 7 performance. In supervisory control scheme, structured collaborative insights management is developed to support innovation idea exchanges and consensus decision-making. In addition, networked agent-based conflict and error prevention is investigated for early conflict/error detections {{to reduce the risk of}} damage. ^ Two cases of HUB-based telerobotic systems are implemented in this work. In case study A, networked <b>telerobots</b> are used for a simulated nuclear plant decommissioning through vision-based hand gesture interface.

40|$|As of 2013, {{almost all}} robots {{have access to}} {{computer}} networks that offer extensive computing, memory, and other resources that can dramatically improve performance.

50|$|The <b>Telerobot</b> has {{undergone}} many changes to its control structure over time. Originally controlled via static html web pages using CGI, work by Dalton saw {{the introduction of}} an augmented reality Java-based interface that met with limited success.

50|$|The current UWA <b>telerobot</b> is an ABB IRB1400 model 6 DOF serial chain robot {{fitted with}} a {{pneumatic}} gripper attachment. The robot runs on a standard ABB S4 Robot Controller linked to a Linux server and which in turn communicates with a second server running ABB's RobComm software and a National Instruments Labview application that was custom written for the task by James Trevelyan with assistance from Perth-based Icon Technologies and students. The robot forms part of the UWA telelabs project.|$|E
50|$|A {{telemanipulator}} (or teleoperator) is {{a device}} that is controlled remotely by a human operator. If such a device {{has the ability to}} perform autonomous work, it is called a <b>telerobot.</b> If the device is completely autonomous, it is called a robot. In simple cases the controlling operator's command actions correspond directly to actions in the device controlled, as for example in a radio controlled model aircraft or a tethered deep submergence vehicle. Where communications delays make direct control impractical (such as a remote planetary rover), or it is desired to reduce operator workload (as in a remotely controlled spy or attack aircraft), the device will not be controlled directly, instead being commanded to follow a specified path. At increasing levels of sophistication the device may operate somewhat independently in matters such as obstacle avoidance, also commonly employed in planetary rovers.|$|E
40|$|Future space {{missions}} in Earth orbit, to the Moon, {{and to other}} distant destinations offer many new opportunities for exploration. But, astronaut time will always be limited and some work will not be feasible or efficient for humans to perform manually. <b>Telerobots,</b> however, can complement human explorers, performing work under remote control from Earth, orbit or nearby habitats. A central challenge, therefore, is to understand how humans and remotely operated robots can be jointly employed to maximize mission performance and success. This presentation {{provides an overview of}} the key issues with using <b>telerobots</b> for human exploration...|$|R
40|$|The United States is {{in trouble}} in space. The costs of the {{proposed}} Space Station Freedom have grown beyond reach, and the present design is obsolete. The trouble has come from imagining {{that there are only}} two alternatives: manned vs. unmanned. Both choices have led us into designs that {{do not appear to be}} practical. On one side, the United States simply does not possess the robotic technology needed to operate or assemble a sophisticated unmanned space station. On the other side, the manned designs that are now under way seem far too costly and dangerous, with all of its thousands of extravehicular activity (EVA) hours. More would be accomplished at far less cost by proceeding in a different way. The design of a space station made of modular, Erector Set-like parts is proposed which is to be assembled using earth-based remotely-controlled binary-tree <b>telerobots.</b> Earth-based workers could be trained to build the station in space using simulators. A small preassembled spacecraft would be launched with a few <b>telerobots,</b> and then, <b>telerobots</b> could be ferried into orbit along with stocks of additional parts. Trained terrestrial workers would remotely assemble a larger station, and materials for additional power and life support systems could be launched. Finally, human scientists and explorers could be sent to the space station. Other aspects of such a space station program are discussed...|$|R

The OMV is examined with respect to both servicing and maintenance. Crew-EVA activities are presented by task and mapped to {{a common set of}} generic crew-EVA primitives to identify high-demand areas for <b>telerobot</b> services. Similarly, a set of <b>telerobot</b> primitives is presented {{that can be used to}} model <b>telerobot</b> actions for alternative <b>telerobot</b> reference configurations. The <b>telerobot</b> primitives are tied to technologies and used for composting <b>telerobot</b> operations for an automated refueling scenario.

30|$|The <b>telerobot</b> {{explores the}} unknown {{disaster}} environment, acquires the environment information, including video information, infrared sensor and ultrasonic sensor information. In this paper, only video information is {{transmitted to the}} teleoperator using our designed wireless link, {{since it is the}} most challenging one. However, it is easy to extend our system to transmit different kinds of information. The <b>telerobot</b> moves around according to the commands of the teleoperator. On the other side, the teleoperator is used to display the video information acquired by the <b>telerobot</b> to end users and send control commands to the <b>telerobot.</b> As shown in Fig. 1, wireless communications between the <b>telerobot</b> and teleoperator may face severe unknown interferences in the ISM band. Hence, it is challenging to transmit the information reliably and quickly, and it is also demanding to control the <b>telerobot</b> precisely and timely under the interferences using conventional static protocols.|$|E

The TELOS Teleoperationsystem allows human supervisory of remote teleoperators even in a time delayed environment. The operation concept defines two main phases. The first phase is either an automatic or operator driven "preparation" phase. It includes off-line, model-based planning facilities as well as sensorsimulation tools to prepare <b>telerobot</b> activities in the fields of servicing or assembly. These facilities are developed and integrated for best operator support during <b>telerobot</b> activity preparation and for the prediction of sensor values, which are necessary to integrate control methods for the remote <b>telerobot.</b> The preparation phase integrates real-time simulation on 3 D computer graphics for operatorbased <b>telerobot</b> programming and visual verification of the <b>telerobot</b> operation sequences.

40|$|<b>Telerobot</b> system {{plays an}} {{important}} role in executing task under hazard environment. As the computer networks such as the Internet are being used as the communication channel of <b>telerobot</b> systems, varying time delay causes the overall system unstable and reduces the performance of transparency. In this paper, we propose twelve operation modes with different control schemes for <b>telerobot</b> on the Internet with time delay. And an optimal operation mode with control scheme is specified for <b>telerobot</b> with time delay, based on the tradeoff between passivity and transparency properties. We experimentally confirm the validity of the proposed optimal mode and control scheme by using a simple one DOF master–slave manipulator system...|$|E
30|$|There are {{two types}} of control {{messages}} (packets check results and channel switching message) needed to be transmitted from the teleoperator to the <b>telerobot.</b> Moreover, the teleoperator needs to control the movements of the <b>telerobot</b> in an unknown environment. Hence, the movement message is also needed to be transmitted from the teleoperator to the <b>telerobot.</b> To reduce the transmission cost of these control information, three kinds of control messages are integrated into a single ACK packet.|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} is presented for selecting an appropriate work-system for performing construction and operations tasks by humans and <b>telerobots.</b> The {{decision to use}} extravehicular activity (EVA) performed by astronauts, extravehicular robotics (EVR), {{or a combination of}} EVA and EVR is determined by the ratio of the marginal costs of EVA, EVR, and IVA.
