5|$|Before the {{university}} opened, the State Legislature amended Cornell's charter on April 24, 1867 to specify alumni elected trustees. However that provision {{did not become}} operative until {{there were at least}} 100 alumni in 1872. Cornell {{was one of the first}} Universities to elect trustees by direct election. (Harvard was probably the first <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> direct election of its Board of Overseers by alumni in 1865.) Cornell's first female trustee was Martha Carey Thomas (class of 1877), who the alumni elected while she was serving as President of Bryn Mawr College.|$|E
5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species {{were found in the}} mountains of the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} the decline include the {{fragmentation}} and loss of open grasslands to scrub or human activities such as the construction of ski resorts, and a longer-term threat comes from global warming which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of invariant characteristics {{is an important}} problem in pattern recognition. Many invariants are known: Hu's moment invariants are invariant <b>to</b> <b>shifts,</b> <b>to</b> changes of scale, and to rotations [Hu 62]; Burkhardt's Fourier descriptors <b>to</b> <b>shifts,</b> <b>to</b> changes of scale and to rotations [Bu 79]; Arbter's Fourier descriptors to affine transformations [Ar 90]; Wang's invariant moments to affine transformations [Wa 77]; the two well-known 5 -points invariants to projective transformations [MZ 92], etc. This paper shows that all these results, which were obtained independently and by different methods, derive from a common basic principle that allows the {{determination of}} new invariants as well...|$|R

If the race had been contested based upon the time it took to complete each stage and their respective sum for each rider, the race would have been won by Carlo Galetti.|$|E
5|$|First {{inhabited}} by native people, Cooper was founded around 1870, {{at the same}} time that Delta County was established. Cooper grew rapidly and it quickly became the center of local events. The city's economy relied primarily on agricultural farming and the shipping of local goods. In the mid-1890s, a railroad line was built through the city, assisting in Cooper's growth. The city continued to grow through the 1910s, and into the early 1920s. In 1926, however, the region's cotton crop failed, devastating the local economy. Many businesses were forced to close, including the railroad, and the city's population plummeted. Although Cooper began to recover during the mid-1930s, many people who left did not return, and the city never fully recovered. The local economy continued to rely on the growing of cotton as the main economy into the 1960s, until it began <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> wheat growing in the early 1970s. The population of Cooper has been on a slow decline since the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The dwindling {{credibility}} of the massive retaliation strategy caused NATO <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> the flexible response strategy. This increased the importance of Banak, {{as it would be}} used to fly in reinforcements in a war situation. In 1962, both RNoAF and NATO proposed that Banak be expanded to full NATO standards. RNoAF planned that Banak should host a detachment of up to six fighters or fighter-bombers and act as a stopover for fighters, transports and helicopters. The airfield was to stockpile supplies, including fuel and ammunition, for one month of war efforts. NATO saw need, in case of a Soviet attack on Finnmark, to deploy two brigades consisting of 10,000 men {{in the course of a}} week and simultaneously host a squadron of tactical aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked verbosity. Although inflection and intonation {{may be less}} rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may {{convey a sense of}} incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> related topics, are often unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|In early July, {{shortly after}} the {{launching}} of Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union, armed resistance began in the German-occupied territory of Serbia, against both the German Army and {{the representatives of the}} German-installed puppet government known as the Commissioner Government. This was a response to appeals from both Joseph Stalin and the Communist International for communist organisations across occupied Europe to draw German troops away from the Eastern Front, and followed a meeting of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party in Belgrade on 4 July. This meeting resolved <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> a general uprising, form Partisan detachments of fighters and commence armed resistance, and call for the populace to rise up against the occupiers throughout Yugoslavia. This also coincided with the departure of the last of the German invasion force that had remained to oversee the transition to occupation. From the appearance of posters and pamphlets urging the population to undertake sabotage, it rapidly turned to attempted and actual sabotage of German propaganda facilities and railway and telephone lines. The first fighting occurred at the village of Bela Crkva on 7 July, when gendarmes tried to disperse a public meeting, and two gendarmes were killed.|$|E
5|$|Gamma: Hyde of the Dark Dimension follows Okabe, and {{is set in}} the gamma attractor field; he {{got there}} when {{attempting}} to undo the changes caused by his friend Luka Urushibara's D-mail in the Steins;Gate game. He discovers that in this world line, he is a Rounder partnered with Moeka Kiryu, and that they have just completed a mission to kill Europol agents who have discovered their identities. He runs to the laboratory <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> the previous world line with a D-mail, but is stopped by Kurisu and Suzuha: Kurisu witnessed Okabe killing the agents, and Suzuha has in this world line traveled back in time to stop Okabe from becoming a dictator, leader of the Rounders, {{and a member of the}} Committee of 300. Kurisu calls the police, but Moeka helps Okabe escape. They visit Mayuri, who is hospitalized, and Okabe learns that they were childhood friends but got separated after the Year 2000 problem occurred, which led to a catastrophy and the death of Mayuri and Okabe's families. Learning that Mayuri has cancer and is not expected to live for much longer, Okabe leaves to clear his head. Moeka questions Luka about Okabe's D-mail, and concludes that the Year 2000 problem likely was caused by SERN. Moeka assures Okabe that they do not have to worry about Kurisu's report, as the Rounders are pressuring the police. She says that they are like family in this world line, since Okabe saved her when she tried to commit suicide, and that she wants to help him even though he is different from the Okabe she knows. They receive their next mission – to take the time machine and its creators to SERN – but they decide to betray SERN, forcefully entering the laboratory prior to the scheduled mission; the other Rounders appear and shoot Okabe, but Moeka manages to send a D-mail that causes a world line shift, away from the gamma attractor field.|$|E

5|$|Now {{the undisputed}} Prince of Achaea, Philip {{sent to the}} Morea as his bailli Guy's brother Louis, Count of Conversano. By this time, the Catalans of Athens had entered a period of decline and civil war, which only {{somewhat}} subsided with the appointment of Matthew of Peralta as vicar-general in 1370. The Enghiens saw a perfect opportunity to reclaim their ancestral inheritance: on 28 March 1370 a third brother, John of Enghien, Count of Lecce, received permission from Queen Joanna I of Naples to gather 1,000 foot and 500 horse for service in Greece, and began arranging for ships to ferry them along the southeastern coasts of Italy. Guy also arranged a truce with the Despot of the Morea so as to concentrate his forces against the Catalans. As Venetian citizens, the Enghiens also approached Venice for aid, which was politely but firmly declined, first in April 1370, and again in February 1371. Undeterred, the Enghiens launched an invasion of Attica in spring 1371, but the campaign failed as the Acropolis resisted and Louis fell ill. The Enghiens retreated, and Guy concluded a truce with the Catalans in August; a marriage between his daughter and heir Maria and Joan de Llúria (probably {{the son of the}} former Catalan vicar-general Roger de Llúria) was initially stipulated in the agreement, but never actually took place. This was to be the last effort by the claimants, for troubles in Italy occupied Guy's brothers, and the looming Ottoman threat forced the Papacy <b>to</b> <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> a policy of supporting the Catalans. Any prospects to regain the Athenian duchy were further impeded by the capture of Megara by the ambitious Nerio I Acciaioli in 1374/5, which barred the land route into Attica to the Enghiens. Guy of Engien died shortly after October 1376. As his daughter Maria was underage and unmarried, the Lordship was governed by his brother Louis as her guardian. Louis arranged Maria's marriage to the Venetian Pietro Cornaro in May 1377. Louis seems to have launched some raids against the Catalans in 1377, but this was overshadowed by the fall of the Duchy of Athens to the Navarrese Company in 1379.|$|E
