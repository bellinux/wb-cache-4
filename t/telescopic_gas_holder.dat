50|$|The Dresden Panometer {{occupies}} a disused <b>telescopic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> in Reick, built in 1879-80. The gasometer is 39 m in height and 54 m in diameter. Buildings {{of this type}} are particularly suitable for panoramic pictures due to their circular shape and ample interior space.|$|E
50|$|Oil-gas enjoyed an {{advantage}} in whaling ports, where it could be based on whale oil. Sir Walter Scott was an early adopter, for Abbotsford, {{and became one of}} the Edinburgh promoters of Taylor & Martineau, where James Milne was their agent. The company had a technological edge, with their manager Tait inventing the <b>telescopic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>holder.</b> John Frederick Daniell discovered a definitive process for oil-gas production, which Taylor & Martineau implemented.|$|E
50|$|The Leipzig Panometer {{occupies}} a disused <b>telescopic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> in Connewitz. The gasometer {{was built in}} 1909, under Hugo Licht, and was in operation until 1977. It has a diameter of 57 m and a total height of 49 m, including the cupola with lantern. From 2002-05 it was renovated to allow the transformation into Asisi's panoramic display. The final step was {{the addition of a}} glass foyer, which connects it to an adjacent gasometer and also contains the restaurant.|$|E
5000|$|Dry-seal <b>gas</b> <b>holders</b> have {{a static}} {{cylindrical}} shell, within which a piston rises and falls. As it moves, a grease seal, tar/oil seal or a sealing membrane which is rolled out and {{in from the}} piston keeps the gas from escaping. The MAN (Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg AG) was introduced in 1915: it was polygonal and used a tar/oil seal. The Klonne dry seal <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> was circular: it used a grease seal. The Dry-seal Wiggins <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> was patented in 1952: it used a flexible curtain that was suspended from the piston. [...] The largest low-pressure <b>gas</b> <b>holders</b> built was the Klonne <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> built in 1938 in Gelsenkirchen. It was 136 m high and 80 m in diameter, which gave it a capacity of [...] There was a MAN type, built in 1934 in Chicago with a capacity of [...]|$|R
25|$|In 2008 Surrey County Cricket Club, tenants of The Oval, {{announced}} plans to redevelop it along the side nearest the <b>gas</b> <b>holders.</b> However, their redevelopment plans were objected to by the Health and Safety Executive because of the proximity to the <b>gas</b> <b>holders</b> and amid fears that they might explode despite not cracking or leaking since construction. This view was supported by London Fire Brigade, who listed the <b>gas</b> <b>holders</b> as a hazardous site. As a result, Surrey considered buying the <b>gas</b> <b>holders</b> and decommissioning them. The objection of the Health and Safety Executive {{was rejected by the}} Secretary of State and planning inspector.|$|R
50|$|Some {{of these}} <b>gas</b> <b>holders</b> have become listed buildings. The <b>gas</b> <b>holders</b> behind King's Cross station in London were {{specially}} dismantled {{when the new}} Channel Tunnel Rail Link was being created, with Gas holder No 8 being re-erected on a nearby site behind St Pancras station {{as part of a}} housing development. It has been fashioned into a park. Most <b>gas</b> <b>holders</b> are no longer used, and a program of dismantling is underway to release the land for reuse.|$|R
50|$|The <b>telescopic</b> <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> {{was first}} invented {{as early as}} 1824, the cup and dip (grip) seal was {{patented}} by Hutchinson in 1833 :the first working example was built in Leeds. The benefits of the greatly increased storage the holders provided for local gas works were soon appreciated, and gas holders were built {{all around the country}} in great quantities {{from the middle of the}} century. The first were the two-lift, column supported type: later they could have four lifts being frame-guided and be retrofitted with an additional flying lift. The large gas holders at King's Cross were built in the 1860s to provide gas storage for a large part of London.|$|E
5000|$|Rigid {{waterless}} <b>gas</b> <b>holders</b> were a {{very early}} design that neither expanded or contracted. There are modern versions of the waterless <b>gas</b> <b>holder,</b> e.g. oil-sealed, grease-sealed and [...] "dry seal" [...] (membrane) types. They consist of a fixed cylinder capped by a moving piston.|$|R
50|$|A <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> {{provided}} {{storage for}} the purified, metered gas. It {{acted as a}} buffer, removing the need for continuous gas production. The weight of the <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> lift (cap) controlled {{the pressure of the}} gas in the mains, and provided back pressure for the gas-making plant.|$|R
50|$|The 2012 Jersey <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> fire {{occurred}} when {{fire broke out}} at a <b>gas</b> <b>holder,</b> owned by Jersey Gas, on Tunnell Street, in Saint Helier, Jersey. The Jersey Fire and Rescue Service brought the fire under-control, and it burnt out during {{the early hours of}} 5 July 2012.|$|R

50|$|The <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> or {{gasometer}} was a tank {{used for}} storage {{of the gas}} and to maintain even pressure in distribution pipes. The <b>gas</b> <b>holder</b> usually consisted of an upturned steel bell contained within a large frame that guided it as it rose and fell depending {{on the amount of}} gas contained.|$|R
