5|$|After World War I, most battleships, {{dreadnought}} and pre-dreadnought alike, were disarmed under <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Washington Naval Treaty.

5|$|Anna Komnene {{described}} the proceedings with very repetitive details, with Bohemond frequently pointing {{out his own}} mistakes and praising the benevolence of Alexios and the Empire; the proceedings must have been rather humiliating for Bohemond.

5|$|As {{the land}} fraud trials reached their conclusion, {{attention}} also {{turned to the}} Southern Pacific Railroad (which had acquired the O in 1887).

50|$|However, {{when the}} President's {{political}} opponents control parliament, the President's dominance can be severely limited, as he must choose a Prime Minister and government who reflect {{the majority in}} parliament, and who will implement <b>the</b> agenda <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parliamentary majority. When parties from opposite ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political spectrum control parliament and the presidency, the power-sharing arrangement is known as cohabitation. Before 2002, Cohabitation was more common, because <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> President was seven years and <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Assembly was five years. Now that <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> President has been shortened to five years, and that the elections are separated by only a few months, this {{is less likely to}} happen.|$|R
