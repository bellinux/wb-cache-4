Observations from the Canopy Horizontal Array Turbulence Study (CHATS) field experiment are analyzed to establish the dependence of the <b>turbulent</b> <b>exchange</b> of momentum, heat, and moisture, as well as kinetic energy on canopy phenological evolution through widely used parameterization models based on 1) dimensionless gradients or 2) turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in the roughness sublayer. Observed vertical turbulent fluxes and gradients of mean wind, temperature, and humidity, as well as velocity variances, are used in combination with empirical dimensionless functions to calculate the <b>turbulent</b> <b>exchange</b> coefficient. The analysis shows that changes in canopy phenology influence the <b>turbulent</b> <b>exchange</b> of all quantities analyzed in this study. The <b>turbulent</b> <b>exchange</b> coefficients of those quantities are twice as large near the canopy top for a leafless canopy than for a full-leaf canopy under unstable and near-neutral conditions. This <b>turbulent</b> <b>exchange</b> coefficient difference {{is related to the}} differing penetration depths of the turbulent eddies organized at the canopy top, which increase for a canopy without leaves. The TKE and dissipation analysis under near-neutral atmospheric conditions additionally shows that TKE exchange increases for a leafless canopy because of reduced TKE dissipation efficiency relative to that when the canopy is in full-leaf stage.

40|$|A single-column chemistry-climate {{model has}} been applied to {{evaluate}} peroxide exchanges measured over a coniferous forest during the BEWA 2000 field campaign, July¿August 2001. Simulations indicate that for suppressed nocturnal turbulent mixing, the H 2 O 2 mixing ratios are sensitive to the representation of sources and sinks, e. g., non-stomatal uptake and chemical transformations, the latter tightly linked to atmosphere¿biosphere NOx exchanges through its control on HO 2 production. Comparison of observed and simulated H 2 O 2 fluxes suggests that the commonly applied method to estimate uptake resistances results in a significant underestimation of the dry deposition flux. By using a very small surface uptake resistance, as observed, the modeled surface fluxes are still too low due to an underestimation of the simulated turbulent transport. Further, a reasonable agreement between simulated and observed methylhydroperoxide and hydroxymethylhydroperoxide mixing ratios in and above the canopy air is observed. Our analysis indicates the important role of daytime as well as nocturnal <b>turbulent</b> <b>exchanges,</b> which control the efficiency of dry deposition and downward transport of peroxides that are chemically produced higher up in the boundary layer. In turn, this chemical production depends on the upward transport of emitted precursor gases and their oxidization products.

Using the first law of thermodynamics, {{the concepts of}} energy loss and head loss are first distinguished. They {{are found to be}} different within one sub-section (main channel or floodplain). Experimental measurements of the head within the main channel and the floodplain are then analyzed for geometries with constant or variable channel width. Results show that head loss differs from one sub-section to another: the classical 1 D hypothesis of unique head loss gradient appears to be erroneous. Using a model that couple 1 D momentum equations, called "Independent Sub-sections Method (ISM) ", head losses are resolved. The relative weights of head losses related to bed friction, <b>turbulent</b> <b>exchanges</b> and mass transfers between sub-sections are estimated. It is shown that water level and the discharge distribution across the channel are influenced by <b>turbulent</b> <b>exchanges</b> for (a) developing flows in straight channels, but only when the flow tends to uniformity; (b) flows in skewed floodplains and symmetrical converging floodplains for small relative flow depth; (c) flows in symmetrical diverging floodplains for small and medium relative depth. Flow parameters are influenced by the momentum flux due to mass exchanges in all non-prismatic geometries for small and medium relative depth, while this flux is negligible for developing flows in straight geometry. The role of an explicit modeling of mass conservation between sub-sections is eventually investigated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This effect is important for parameterization of the interfacial component of gas exchange under low wind speed conditions. From the theoretical standpoint, the mechanism of the turbulence reduction can be explained bythe modification of the “streaks” in the buffer zone near the interface byvisco-elastic properties of the water surface when surfactants are present.

This is of major concern and reduces the confidence in future model projections of high latitude climate. We here employ ideal vertical profiles of temperature and wind from turbulence resolving simulations to perform a priori studies of the first order eddy-viscosity closure scheme employed in the ARPEGE/IFS model. This reveals that the coarse vertical resolution (31 layers) of the model cannot be expected to realistically resolve the Arctic stable boundary layer. The curvature of the Arctic inversion and thus also the vertical <b>turbulent</b> <b>exchange</b> processes cannot be reproduced by the coarse vertical mesh employed.

The main goal was to understand how the energy used in the melting of snow and ice is delivered to the surface. Many meteorological stations were operated simultaneously on the ice cap, at almost all of which profile measurements were made. Cable balloons and radiosondes were used to probe the vertical structure of the boundary layer. It appears that the flow near the surface is katabatic most of the time, with the height of the wind maximum varying between a few metres and a few tens of metres. It is only during the passage of intense storms that the katabatic wind in the melt zone disappears. Global radiation increases significantly with altitude. Surface albedo varies enormously in space and time, with very low values (≈ 0. 1) being found at many places because of the melt out of volcanic ash layers.

Since 70 % of the global surface is covered with water the description how the ocean and atmosphere communicates has a considerable impact. The ocean–atmosphere exchange occurs through transport of momentum (friction) and heat, governed by turbulent eddies. The sea surface is also an important source of turbulence in both directions. The scales of the turbulent eddies cannot be resolved in ocean and climate models. Therefore, the <b>turbulent</b> <b>exchanges</b> have to be related to mean variables, such as wind speed and temperature differences. By using measurements, new methods to describe the air–sea exchange during two specific processes were developed. These processes are the so-called UVCN-regime (Unstable Very Close to Neutral stratification) and swell, i. e. waves which are not produced by the local wind. These processes were included in an ocean model and in a regional atmospheric climate model and the impact was investigated. The UVCN-regime enhances the heat transport significantly during the autumn and winter months in the ocean model. This results in a shallower well-mixed surface layer in the ocean. Wind-following swell reduces the surface friction, which is very important for the atmosphere. Some secondary effects in the climate model are reduced low-level cloud cover and reduced precipitation by more than 10 % over sea areas. Locally and for short periods the impact is large. It is important to include the UVCN-regime and the swell impact in models, to make simulations more reliable...|$|R
