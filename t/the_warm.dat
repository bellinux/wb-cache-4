5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the cold front to progress through <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> sector perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front is cooler than the cool air ahead of <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E

5|$|By early afternoon, the {{low-pressure}} {{area had}} moved east into Nebraska, while <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front had moved northward into southern Minnesota.

All of these factors combined to create very favorable conditions for the development of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.|$|E

A hindcast experiment qualitatively reproduces <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> and decadal　fluctuations of the intermediate water {{that are similar to}} those of observations: <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is significant along the western part of the Okhotsk Sea and subarctic frontal region. The effects of the thermohaline- and　wind-driven ocean circulation on <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> are evaluated from perturbation experiments on thermohaline (turbulent heat and freshwater fluxes) and wind causes, respectively. The thermohaline causes are shown to contribute positively to <b>warming</b> in <b>the</b> Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water (OSIW). The heat budget analysis for the OSIW indicates that <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is related to a decrease in cold and dense shelf water (DSW) flux, which is caused by a decrease in sea ice and surface water freshening. In contrast, the wind cause has a cooling effect in the OSIW through an increase in DSW. In the subarctic frontal region, <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is mainly caused by the wind stress change. The heat budget analysis indicates that <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is related to an increase in the northward advection of <b>the</b> subtropical <b>warm</b> water. These results imply that both thermohaline- and winddriven ocean circulation changes are essential components of <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> in <b>the</b> intermediate water. The atmospheric conditions responsible for <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> are related to a weakened Aleutian low and Siberian high in early and late winter...|$|R

5|$|Polar front {{theory is}} {{attributed}} to Jacob Bjerknes, and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front. The trailing convergence zone {{was referred to as}} the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. A conveyor belt, also referred to as <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> conveyor belt, is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front. The concept of the conveyor belt originated in 1969.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} {{was in an}} unusually low-shear environment for early June as it began tracking northward, which allowed the system to strengthen into Tropical Storm Allison {{on the morning of}} June 3 as it tracked into the Yucatán Channel. Despite the fact that westerly wind shear began to increase, <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> water allowed Allison to gradually strengthen more that afternoon and evening. Late that evening, while between the Yucatán Peninsula and Cuba, Allison developed a circular central dense overcast and became a high-end tropical storm. As the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> waters allowed Allison to strengthen further and it was upgraded to a hurricane on the morning of June 4 while travelling almost due north.|$|E
5|$|The left {{edge of the}} {{conveyor}} belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of stratiform precipitation develops poleward of <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front along {{the conveyor}} belt. Active precipitation poleward of <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is cold enough, the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E
