5|$|To reduce {{rolling and}} {{increase}} stability for aircraft operations, a gyrostabilizer {{produced by the}} American Sperry Gyroscope Company was installed. The installation initially proved unreliable as the Japanese <b>technicians</b> were badly trained by Sperry, but eventually the system proved its worth as the <b>technicians</b> gained experience.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} noise of explosions, the on-duty U.S. <b>technicians</b> rushed {{out the front door}} of their {{operations}} building where they were met by North Vietnamese gunfire. Blanton, the U.S. commander at Lima Site 85, was killed alongside two other U.S. <b>technicians.</b> Those who were not killed retreated to {{the west side of the}} mountain, where they hid on the edge of the cliff. From their hideout, the U.S. <b>technicians</b> fired on the North Vietnamese with their M-16 rifles and hand grenades. At 04:15, in response to the gunfire from the U.S. <b>technicians,</b> Muc ordered Cell 5 to reinforce Cell 3, and they captured the TACAN installation at 04:30 after 45 minutes of fighting. Meanwhile, Cell 4 had great difficulties in their attempt to seize the airstrip, where they were blocked by a Hmong mortar position. Le Ba Chom, the commander of Cell 4, was isolated from the other three soldiers of his cell. To avoid being captured alive by the numerically superior Hmong forces, Chom and his soldiers held onto their position and fought till daybreak.|$|E

5|$|The main {{harvesting}} {{season for}} coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March {{to the end}} of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. <b>Technicians</b> hand-sort the beans to pick out the best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a lower price. The <b>technicians</b> pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E
5|$|The <b>technicians</b> {{wash the}} beans {{several times to}} remove {{the remains of the}} skin and coating and put them out on shaded racks to dry. Cooperative {{employees}} turn the beans regularly as <b>technicians</b> spot and remove bad beans. A longer drying process of up to two weeks in the sun follows (with provision for quick covering in the event of rain), again with constant turning. This last process reduces the water content of the bean from 40 percent to 12 percent.|$|E

5|$|At 21:21 the North Vietnamese {{resumed their}} {{artillery}} attack on Phou Pha Thi, followed by several infantry assaults by the VPA 766th Regiment, which prompted Sullivan {{to order the}} evacuation of six <b>technicians</b> by 08:15 the next morning, from a contingent of 19 U.S. personnel. Starting at 01:00 on 11March, the North Vietnamese moved into their assigned positions in order to launch their attack. About 02:00, a U.S. adviser at the airstrip reported to Secord and CIA officers at Udorn that he heard gunfire on top of Phou Pha Thi, and communication with U.S. <b>technicians</b> at Lima Site 85 was completely cut off. Afterwards, Secord briefed U.S. A-1 Skyraider pilots in Thailand on the situation at Lima Site 85, to familiarize them with friendly positions around the facility, so they could cover the evacuation of U.S. personnel and support the Hmong counterattack.|$|E
5|$|At {{first light}} Air America {{helicopters}} hovered over Lima Site 85 {{to start the}} evacuation, which was covered by USAF A-1 Skyraiders. Immediately, Hmong soldiers and their CIA commanders rushed the TACAN site and shouted to the U.S. <b>technicians</b> that help was coming. In response, the North Vietnamese Special Forces organized a defense around the TACAN site, and hid their dead and wounded comrades under the large rocks which dotted Phou Pha Thi. While U.S. fighter-bombers strafed the TACAN site, the Air America helicopter landed on the airstrip and they picked up two CIA officers, one forward air-controller, and five <b>technicians</b> who hid during the firefight. Later in the day, Air America was able to recover or account for eight of the dead U.S. personnel on Lima Site 85, along {{with a number of}} wounded Hmong soldiers. By midday, Lima Site 85 was fully controlled by the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion, and they held the facility until 14March when they withdrew from the area.|$|E
5|$|By 9March1968, the U.S. {{facility}} {{on top of}} Phou Pha Thi was surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao units. The VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion totalled more than 3,000 men. Despite {{the gravity of the}} situation, Sullivan did not issue an order for the evacuation of U.S. personnel from Phou Pha Thi. At around 18:00 on 10March, Lima Site 85 was subjected to a series of artillery barrages. Under the cover of the artillery bombardment, the North Vietnamese Special Forces sent a small team up the mountain to defuse mines and quick-fuse grenades, and to establish their routes of infiltration. Inside the facility, U.S. <b>technicians</b> immediately grabbed their weapons and ran into trenches and bunkers, thereby abandoning the very equipment which could enable them to call for air support. At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the U.S. <b>technicians</b> returned to their positions.|$|E

5|$|From {{the first}} class of 14 June 1943, until the final class of 16 December 1944, more than 7,000 {{recruits}} were indoctrinated at the Palm Beach station. Approximately, 70 percent of the enlisted women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. Yeoman and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were given the opportunity for training in other fields. Some attended other Navy schools and were trained as motion picture sound <b>technicians,</b> link trainer operators, parachute riggers, and air control operators. Others attended USCG schools and learned to be: cooks, bakers, radioman, pharmacist mates, radio <b>technicians,</b> and motor vehicle drivers.
