5|$|At the 2008 ICF Congress in Rome, a {{new program}} for the championships was approved. This marked the first change in the program since the {{addition}} of the K-4 1000 m women's event at the 2001 championships in Poznań. Men's C-4 500 m, men's K-4 500 m, women's K-4 1000 m events were replaced by C-1 4 × 200 m relay (men only) and K-1 4 × 200 m relay (both men and women). Women's C-1 200 m, C-1 500 m, C-2 200 m and C-2 500 m events were shown as exhibition. Paddleability exhibition events of K-1 200 m LTA (men & women), K-2 200 m TA (mixed), and C-2 200 m LTA (mixed) also took place (LTATA – Legs, <b>Trunks,</b> <b>and</b> Arms or <b>Trunks</b> <b>and</b> Arms; LTA – Legs, <b>Trunks,</b> <b>and</b> Arms; and TA – <b>Trunks</b> <b>and</b> Arms, or Arms). Support for women's Canadian and the paddle ability events were confirmed at an ICF Board of Directors meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 18–20 March 2009. A training camp was held for women's canoe in conjunction with the championships.|$|E
5|$|Kanaks {{living on}} the islands made canoes out of hollowed–out <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> large double–hulled {{outriggers}} with triangular sails, known as pirogues, traditionally used for fishing.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup is a syrup {{usually made}} from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, {{although}} {{it can also be}} made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in the sap in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{this family}} are chiefly known for their {{characteristic}} behaviour; they mostly forage for insect prey on the <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> branches of trees, and often communicate by drumming with their beak, producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance. Some species vary their diet with fruits, bird's eggs and small animals, and some suck sap. They mostly nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree <b>trunks,</b> <b>and</b> their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity-nesting birds. They sometimes come into conflict with man when they make holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops, but perform a useful service by their removal of insect pests on trees.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata in {{all regions}} fix their own webs to solid {{surfaces}} such as rocks and tree <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> boughs, while some other Portia species often fix their webs to pliant stems and leaves {{and on the}} lower branches of trees.|$|E
50|$|KL2 (formerly TA; <b>Trunk</b> <b>and</b> Arms): paddlers {{who have}} {{good use of}} the <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> arms, but limited use of their legs. They are unable to apply {{continuous}} and controlled force to the footboard or seat to propel the boat.|$|R
50|$|KL3 (formerly LTA; Legs, <b>Trunk</b> <b>and</b> Arms): {{this class}} is for paddlers with a {{disability}} who have good use of their legs, <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> arms for paddling, and who can apply force to the foot board or the seat to propel the boat.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{functional}} classes: L3, where athletes use their legs, <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> arms to help paddling; L2, in which athletes use only their <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> arms; and K1, in which athletes only use their arms.Events are always held along straight line courses marked by buoys, 200 metres long. There are both men’s and women’s races, with events for individuals.|$|R
5|$|Treecreepers {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds, brown above and white below. They have thin pointed downcurved bills, which {{they use to}} extricate insects from bark. They have stiff tail feathers, like woodpeckers, which they use to support themselves on vertical tree <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> limbs. One species has been recorded in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Ecologically, {{woodpeckers}} {{help to keep}} trees healthy {{by keeping}} them from suffering mass infestations. The family is noted {{for its ability to}} acquire wood-boring grubs from the <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> branches, whether the timber is alive or dead. Having hammered a hole into the wood, the prey is extracted by use of a long, barbed tongue. Woodpeckers consume beetles that burrow into trees, removing as many as 85 percent of emerald ash borer larvae from individual ash trees.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake {{venture to}} Tree Trunks's (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) house to acquire apple pie. While there, they {{discover}} that Tree Trunks has {{entered into a}} relationship with Mr. Pig (voiced by Ron Lynch). Finn asks Tree Trunks if she {{would be willing to}} make apple pie for Princess Bubblegum's musical concert, to which she agrees. Later at the concert, however, Tree <b>Trunks</b> <b>and</b> Mr. Pig arrive, sans apple pie. During the performance, Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks begin to passionately kiss, which makes the entire audience feel uncomfortable.|$|E

50|$|The fibular artery {{typically}} {{arises from}} the posterior tibial artery. Therefore, the posterior tibial artery proximal to the fibular artery origin is sometimes called the tibial-peroneal trunk or tibial-fibular <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> {{it could be said}} that the popliteal artery bifurcates into the tibial-fibular <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> anterior tibial artery.|$|R

White {{markings}} as follows: blaze on upper part of muzzle, underside of neck, breast and tip of tail, lower legs and feet.|$|R
5|$|Nuthatches are omnivorous, eating mostly insects, {{nuts and}} seeds. They forage for insects hidden in or under bark by {{climbing}} along tree <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> branches, sometimes upside-down. They forage within their territories when breeding, {{but they may}} join mixed feeding flocks at other times. Their habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi, {{along with}} a large variety of spiders and insects, is often found in the dense, large webs of the diplurid Ischnothele karschi (about 15millimetres long), which are {{especially}} abundant in partly cleared secondary bush where rain forests have been cut down, and usually about one metre above the ground. A survey of one area suggested that there is about one P. schultzi per three I. karschi webs. P. schultzi {{is also found in}} its own web and those of other spiders, on tree <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> the walls of buildings, and in leaf litter.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillars and beetles, {{although in}} autumn and winter its diet is supplemented with nuts and seeds. The young are fed mainly on insects, with some seeds, food items mainly being found on tree <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> large branches. The nuthatch can forage when descending trees head first, {{as well as}} when climbing. It readily visits bird tables, eating fatty man-made food items as well as seeds. It is an inveterate hoarder, storing food year-round. Its main natural predator is the Eurasian sparrowhawk.|$|E

Despite its long-standing use, the original <b>Trunk</b> <b>and</b> Link road system was never legislated for and the routes of <b>Trunk</b> Roads <b>and</b> Link Roads were never formally designated by law.|$|R
40|$|Background: Good {{control of}} <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> pelvic {{movements}} {{is necessary for}} well controlled leg movements required to perform activities of daily living. The nature of movement coupling between the <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> pelvis varies and depends {{on the type of}} activity. Children with cerebral palsy often have reduced ability to modulate coupling between the <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> pelvis but movement patterns of the pelvis can be improved by training. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine how pelvis to trunk coupling changed while playing a computer game driven by pelvic rotations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract | PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of distance between <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> desk on forward head posture and muscle activity of neck and shoulder muscles during computer work. METHODS: Twenty subjects who have healthy conditions were asked to perform computer work in two conditions (distance between <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> desk was 0 and 15 cm). Forward head angle was analyzed with a SIMI motion analysis system. Surface electromyography recorded the upper trapezius and splenius capitis muscles. The significance of differences in distance between <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> desk (0 cm and 15 cm) was tested by paired t-test. The alpha level was set at. 05. RESULTS: The results showed that the change of forward head angle was significantly higher during the computer work when the distance between <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> desk was 15 cm than 0 cm. The muscle activity of upper trapezius and splenius capitis was also significantly higher during the computer work when the distance between <b>trunk</b> <b>and</b> desk was 15 cm than 0 cm. †Corresponding Author...|$|R
5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} forages along tree <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> {{branches in}} a similar way to woodpeckers and treecreepers, but does not use its tail for additional support, instead progressing in jerky hops using its strong legs and feet. All nuthatches are distinctive when seeking food because they are able to descend tree trunks head-first and can hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches.|$|E
5|$|These lemurs have {{relatively}} long hindlegs. For gripping tree <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> large branches, they have large {{hands and feet}} with extended pads on the digits, as well as claw-like nails. They have a long tongue which assists obtaining the gum and nectar, {{as well as a}} long caecum, which helps digest gums. Their procumbent (forward-facing) lemuriform toothcomb (formed by the lower incisors and canines) is long and more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces to minimize the accumulation of gum between the teeth.|$|E
5|$|Archosaurs (crocodilians and birds) {{and mammals}} show {{complete}} {{separation of the}} heart into two pumps {{for a total of}} four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently from that of mammals. In crocodilians, there is a small opening, the foramen of Panizza, {{at the base of the}} arterial <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> there is some degree of mixing between the blood in each side of the heart, during a dive underwater; thus, only in birds and mammals are the two streams of blood – those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations – permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier.|$|E

5|$|Ascocoryne sarcoides is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The species name {{is derived from the}} Greek sarkodes (fleshy). Formerly known as Coryne sarcoides, its taxonomical history has been {{complicated}} by the fact that it may adopt both sexual and asexual forms. Colloquially known as jelly drops or the purple jellydisc, this common fungus appears as a gelatinous mass of pinkish or purple-colored discs. Distributed widely in North America, Europe and Asia, A.sarcoides is a saprobic fungus and grows in clusters on the <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> branches of a variety of dead woods. Field studies suggest that colonization by A.sarcoides of the heartwood of black spruce confers some resistance to further infection by rot-causing fungi. A.sarcoides contains the antibiotic compound ascocorynin, shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Gordon Guymer of the Queensland Herbarium {{published}} a taxonomic revision of Brachychiton; he classified B. rupestris {{in the section}} Delabechea along with the related and newly described Proserpine bottle tree. A third species, from southeast Queensland, has been recognised but not yet described. Unique to the section, all three species have bulbous <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> can have large cavities in the vertical wood parenchyma. The genus Brachychiton lies within an Australasian clade within the subfamily Sterculioideae (previously family Sterculiaceae) in a large broadly defined Malvaceae. It is only distantly related to Sterculia, belonging to a different clade within the Sterculioideae.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943, Rommel took {{command of}} the German Army Group B in {{occupied}} France. He also {{took control of the}} Atlantic Wall defenses on the French coasts facing the United Kingdom and during a tour of anti-invasion fortifications Rommel concluded that the defenses would have to be improved, and quickly. He ordered millions of wooden tree <b>trunks</b> <b>and</b> logs to be set against airborne forces. Barbed wire and tripwires were to be strung between the poles. On plans that Rommel sent to his subordinates, the complete system of wooden poles and interconnecting wires was called Luftlandehindernis.|$|E
