40|$|This study {{investigated}} the correlation between dissolved organic matter fluorescence {{and the formation of}} regulated and emerging disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Fulvic acid-like fluorescence in raw and coagulated samples from 8 drinking water treatment plants was strongly correlated with the formation of trihalomethanes, haloacetonitriles, haloketones, <b>trichloronitromethane</b> and chloral hydrate following chlorination (R 2 = 0. 72 - 0. 94). These correlations were stronger than those of UV 254 with all compounds except <b>trichloronitromethane</b> (R 2 = 0. 80 for UV 254 compared to R 2 = 0. 72 for fulvic acid-like fluorescence). Soluble microbial product fluorescence was more correlated than the two protein-like regions with organic nitrogen concentration and nitrogen-containing DBP (N-DBP) formation (e. g., R 2 = 0. 61 for soluble microbial product fluorescence vs. haloacetonitrile formation from chlorination, compared to R 2 = 0. 28 & 0. 56 for two protein regions). However, the linear relationship between organic nitrogen concentration or N-DBP formation potential was stronger for the humic & fulvic acidlike fluorescence regions than these three regions that are usually associated with organic nitrogen and potential N-DBP precursors. The findings of this study can be used to improve monitoring and prediction of DBP production during drinking water treatment under a range of source water conditions...|$|E

However, {{little is known about the}} impact of PS or UV/PS pre-oxidation on downstream formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs). In this study the three antibiotic chloramphenicols (chloramphenicol and two of its analogues [thiamphenicol and florfenicol], referred to collectively as CAPs), which frequently occur in wastewater-impacted source waters used by drinking water treatment plants, were selected as model antibiotic compounds. The formation of carbonaceous and nitrogenous disinfection by-products, including halomethanes, haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes, during chlorination and chloramination preceded by PS and UV/PS was investigated. No significant concentrations of haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes were detected during chlorination. During chloramination chloramphenicol formed a considerable amount of dichloronitromethane (e. g., 3. 44 ± 0. 33 % mol/mol at NH 2 Cl dose = 1 mM) and <b>trichloronitromethane</b> (e. g., 0. 79 ± 0. 07 % mol/mol at NH 2 Cl dose = 1 mM), compared with THM and HAN formation. PS pre-oxidation achieved a statistically significant reduction in trichloromethane formation from chlorination, and in HAN and HNM formation from chloramination. Although UV/PS slightly increased dichloroacetonitrile formation during chloramination, it significantly decreased dichloronitromethane and <b>trichloronitromethane</b> formation during chloramination. Overall, the use of PS and UV/PS has the potential to have contrasting impacts on DBP formation in heavily wastewater-impacted waters, depending on the disinfection method. Hence, their application needs to be carefully balanced against the downstream effect on DBP formation...|$|E

However, the effects of ClO 2 pre-oxidation on disinfection by-product (DBP) formation, especially the highly toxic nitrogenous DBPs, during subsequent chlor (am) ination have not been studied thoroughly. There is also limited information about DBP formation from combined amino acids (AAs), which are more abundant than free AAs in source waters. Many typical DBPs (including representative N-DBPs) have a similar structure of “CX 3 R” (X = H, Cl, Br or I). In the study, tyrosine and forms representing its reactivity in combined AAs (tyrosine tert-butyl ester and Boc-tyrosine) were selected as model precursors. The formation of various regulated and unregulated CX 3 R-type DBPs from ClO 2 pre-oxidation and subsequent chlor (am) ination were studied at a wide-range of ClO 2 and chlor (am) ine doses (ClO 2 /precursors and chlor (am) ine/precursors are at the range of 0 – 2. 5 and 1 – 20 [Mol/Mol], respectively). Chloroform and chloral hydrate (CH) yields increased with chlorine dose, while haloacetonitrile and haloacetamide maximized at median chlorine dose (Cl 2 /Precursors =  10). All DBP yields increased with chloramine dose. ClO 2 pre-oxidation increased chloroform, haloacetonitrile, <b>trichloronitromethane</b> and CH yields during chlorination, but ClO 2 increased chloroform, CH, trichloroacetamide while decreased dichloroacetonitrile and <b>trichloronitromethane</b> yields during chloramination. The overall toxicity of the formed DBPs was evaluated by cytotoxicity index (CTI). ClO 2 pre-oxidation increased CTI from all precursors during post-chlorination while reduced it during post-chloramination. Results imply that ClO 2 is probably more suitable for use in combination with chloramination disinfection, rather than chlorination, in the integrated control of CX 3 R-type DBPs from source waters abundant in AAs...|$|E

Previous research used dimethylamine (DMA) as a model precursor of NDMA, but certain widely used tertiary dimethylamines (e. g. the pharmaceutical ranitidine) show much higher conversion rates to NDMA than DMA. This study investigates the NDMA formation potential of several tertiary amines including pharmaceuticals and herbicides. The reactivity of these molecules with monochloramine (NH 2 Cl) is studied through the formation of NDMA, and other halogenated DBPs such as haloacetonitriles (HANs) and AOX (Adsorbable Organic Halides).

The formation of both haloacetonitriles decreased with increasing pH following chlorination, but formation after chloramination was relatively insensitive to pH change. The highest formation of chloropicrin was from chloramination at pH 7.

The effects of light intensity, nitrate ions, chloride ions, humic acid, and pH on the photochemical degradation of TCNM were investigated under the irradiation of low pressure mercury lamp (λ = 254 [*]nm, 12 [*]W). The photodegradation rate of TCNM was found to increase with increasing the concentration of nitrate ions, chloride ions, humic acid, pH, and light intensity. The photodegradation of TCNM was examined at pH 6. 0 with initial concentrations (C 0) of TCNM at 10. 0 – 200. 0 [*]µg/L. The overall rate of degradation of TCNM was modeled using a pseudofirst-order rate law. Finally, the proposed mechanism involved in the photodegradation of TCNM was also discussed by analysis.

Application of 1 mg/L ClO 2 ahead of chlorination reduced the formation potential for THM by up to 45 % and the formation of HK, HAN and TCNM in most of the samples. The CH formation results were mixed. The formation of CH and HK was enhanced with low doses of Fe(VI) (1 mg/L as Fe), but was greatly reduced at higher doses (20 mg/L Fe).

40|$|During the {{production}} of high quality recycled water by reverse osmosis membrane filtration secondary effluent must be disinfected to limit biofouling on the membrane surface. Advanced Water Treatment Plants in South East Queensland, Australia use disinfectant contact times ranging from 30 min up to 24 h. Disinfectants such as chlorine and chloramines react with effluent organic matter to generate disinfection by-products (DBPs) which could be potentially hazardous to human health if the water is destined for supplementing public water supplies. In this context, secondary effluents are of concern because of their high total organic carbon content which can act as DBP precursors. Also, effluent organic matter may form different DBPs to those formed from natural organic matter during conventional drinking water treatment, either in quantity, identity or simply in the abundance of different DBPs relative to each other. It cannot be assumed per se with certainty that DBP formation will be affected {{in the same way}} by operational changes as in drinking water production. Response surface modelling has been employed in this study at the bench scale to investigate the effect of reaction time (0 - 24 h), pH (5. 5 - 8. 5), temperature (23 - 35 °C), disinfection strategy (chlorine vs chloramines used prior to membrane treatment) and the interaction between these different parameters on DBP formation during disinfection of secondary effluent. The concentration of halogenated DBPs formed during the first 24 h of reaction with the different disinfectants followed the order chlorination ≫ in line-formed monochloramine > pre-formed monochloramine. Contact time with chlorine was the major influencing factor on DBP formation during chlorination, except for the bromine-containing trihalomethanes and dibromoacetonitrile for which pH was more significant. Chlorination at high pH led to an increased formation of chloral hydrate, <b>trichloronitromethane,</b> dibromoacetonitrile and the four trihalomethanes while the opposite effect was observed for the other targeted DBPs. Temperature was identified as the least influencing parameter compared to pH and reaction time for all DBPs in all the disinfection strategies, except for the formation of chloral hydrate where pH and temperature had a similar significance and bromoform that was similarly affected by temperature and reaction time. Chloramines employed at pH 8. 5 reduced the concentration of all studied DBPs compared to pH 5. 5. Furthermore, reaction time was the most significant factor for <b>trichloronitromethane,</b> chloroform, trichloroacetonitrile, dichloroacetonitrile and bromochloroacetonitrile formation while pH was the most influencing factor affecting the formation of the remaining DBPs...|$|E

Factors evaluated include contact time, chlorine dosages, pH, temperature, ammonia concentrations and algae growth stages. increased reaction time, chlorine dosage and temperature improved {{the formation of}} the relatively stable C-DBPs (e. g., THM, HAA, and CH) and TCNM. Formation of dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) followed an increasing and then decreasing pattern with prolonged reaction time and increased chlorine dosages. pH affected DBP formation differently, with THM increasing, HKs decreasing, and other DBPs having maximum concentrations at certain pH values. The addition of ammonia significantly reduced the formation of most DBPs, but TCNM formation was not affected and 1, 1 -dichloropropanone (1, 1 -DCP) formation was higher with the addition of ammonia. Most DBPs increased as the growth period of algal cells increased. Chlorination of algal cells of higher organic nitrogen content generated higher concentrations of N-DBPs (e. g., HANS and TCNM) and CH, comparable DCAA concentration but much lower concentrations of other C-DBPs (e. g., THM, TCAA and HKs) than did natural organic matter (NOM).

The DBPs studied were trihalomethanes (THMs), chloral hydrate (CH), haloacetonitriles (HANs), and <b>trichloronitromethane</b> (TCNM). When the interaction of Fe(VI) and SRNOM was independently examined at pH 7. 0, a decrease was seen in dissolved organic carbon and in the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of NOM. With the model compounds, {{the results showed that}} Fe(VI) pre-oxidation and subsequent chlorination decreased the formation of THMs with most of the compounds except amines and glycine. The effect of Fe(VI) preoxidation on CH and HANs formation from model compounds varied and was dependent on ferrate doses.

Correlations of DBPs formation between SRNOM and model compounds were sought to identify the moieties involved in influencing the formation of DBPs.

40|$|Nitrogenous {{disinfection}} byproducts (N-DBPs) such as haloacetonitriles (HANs) and halonitromethanes (HNMs) {{are formed}} during water chlorination. Preozonation is sometimes applied to control trihalomethane (THM) formation, {{but this may}} risk promoting the formation of HNMs and HANs. The role of ozone {{in the formation of}} HANs and HNMs in natural waters remains unclear. The nitrogen sources involved in HAN and HNM formation during the chloramination of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with and without preozonation were evaluated using N- 15 -labeled monochloramine. The origin of the nitrogen involved in HAN formation was found to depend on the ratio of dissolved organic carbon to nitrogen. In nitrogen-rich solutions HAN nitrogen was mainly from DOM constituents. The formation of IN-labeled dichloroacetontrile (DCAN) accounted for approximately 30 % of the DCAN produced from all hydrophilic acidic and neutral isolates, which have low carbon to nitrogen ratios, while it reached over 50 % for the hydrophobic acidic, basic, and neutral isolates with high carbon to nitrogen ratios. Unlabeled <b>trichloronitromethane</b> (TCNM) accounted for over 90 % of the total TCNM produced from most of the isolates. The remaining less than 10 % of the TCNM was probably generated through an aldehyde pathway. Preozonation reduced DCAN but enhanced the yield of TCNM. The destruction of amino acids and amine structures and subsequent formation of nitro groups by preozonation may help explain the reduced DCAN and increased TCNM formation...|$|E

Of the 28 DBPs, 21 were detected with an average frequency of detection of 50 %. Trihalomethanes (THM 4) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) were the most predominant species, whose median concentration levels were at 10. 53 and 10. 95 mu g L- 1, respectively. Two of four iodinated trihalomethanes (I-THMs) were detected, and the concentration of the I-THMs ranged from under the detection limit to 5. 58 mu g L- 1. The total concentration of haloacetonitriles (HANs) in different water samples ranged from under the limit of detection to 39. 20 mu g L- 1, with a median concentration of 1. 11 mu g L- 1. Two of four halonitromethanes (HNMs) were detected, and the maximum concentrations of chloronitromethane (CNM) and <b>trichloronitromethane</b> (TCNM) were 0. 96 and 0. 28 mu g L- 1, respectively.

40|$|Halonitromethanes (HNMs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} toxic groups of {{disinfection}} by-products. The pH-dependent degradation kinetics and pathways of four HNMs, namely bromonitromethane (BNM), dichloronitromethane (DCNM), dibromonitromethane (DBNM) and <b>trichloronitromethane</b> (TCNM), by ultraviolet (UV) photolysis at 254 nm were studied at pH 3 - 9. The UV photolysis in a dilute aqueous solution followed first-order kinetics. The photolysis rates of all four HNMs were low at pH 3 - 5, while that of TCNM was low at all pHs tested. Nevertheless, the photolysis rates of BNM, DCNM and DBNM increased with increasing pH, showing sharp increases as the pH neared their pK(a) values. The increases were correlated with their pH-dependent molar absorptivities, which were determined by the sizes of their deprotonated fractions. Homolysis was likely to be the major photolysis pathway for all four HNMs to produce halides, nitrite and nitrate at acidic pHs when the HNMs were not deprotonated. At high pHs, however, the conjugation systems of the deprotonated mono- and di-HNMs made heterolysis possibly the dominant pathway for the formation of carbon dioxide, nitrite and halides as major products for di-HNMs, and the formation of nitrite, halides and other unknown organics for mono-HNMs. The UV energy required for a 50 % degradation of deprotonated HNMs in the real water sample was similar to that needed in UV disinfection processes, suggesting the effectiveness of UV photolysis in controlling HNMs that form conjugadon systems at neutral to alkaline pHs.

Seven soil fumigants that are registered in California or are being {{or have been}} considered for registration were used in this study: dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) mixed with chloropicrin (Pic) (79 % DMDS and 21 % Pic), Tri-Con (50 % methyl bromide and 50 % Pic), Midas Gold (33 % methyl iodide [MI] and 67 % Pic), Midas Bronze (50 % MI and 50 % Pic), Midas (MI, active ingredient [a. i. ] 97. 8 %), Pic (a. i. 99 % <b>trichloronitromethane)</b> and Pic-Clor 60 (57 % Pic and 37 % 1, 3 -dichloropropene [1 – 3,D]). Dose-response models were calculated for pathogen mortality after 24 hours of exposure to fumigants. Overall, the tested fumigants achieved good efficacy with dosages below the maximum label rate against the tested pathogens. In this study, Pythium ultimum and citrus nematode were sensitive to all the fumigants and Verticillium dahliae was resistant. For most fumigants, California regulations restrict application rates to less than the maximum (federal) label rate, meaning {{that it is possible}} that the fumigants may not control major plant pathogens. This research provides information on the effectiveness of these alternatives at these lower application rates. The results from this study will help growers optimize application rates for registered fumigants (such as Pic and 1, 3 -D) and will help accelerate the adoption of new fumigants (such as DMDS) if they are registered in California...|$|E
40|$|The {{results from}} this study show how {{different}} precursors affect halonitromethane (HNM) formation as well as how different free chlorine doses can affect HNM speciation. This study shows that the low pressure ultraviolet (LPUV) and free chlorine concurrent exposure can enhance HNM formation. In addition, most previous studies in the literature showed <b>trichloronitromethane</b> (TCNM) forming in greater quantities followed by monochloronitromethane (MCNM) and dichloronitromethane (DCNM). However, {{the results of this study}} show that, in deionized (DI) water matrices, MCNM forms in greater quantities at chlorine to nitrogen (Cl:N) ratios less than 3, while TCNM forms in greater quantities at Cl:N ratios greater than 3. Even so, the increase in TCNM formation did not increase linearly as the Cl:N ratio increased; there was a decreased rate of return when Cl:N ratios were greater than 3. The type of nitrogenous precursors can affect the amount of HNMs formed, with glycine forming a higher amount of total HNMs compared to methylamine (MA) and dimethylamine (DMA). The source of water can also affect which HNM species is formed in greater concentrations. The limited number of real water samples showed that the river waters have higher than normal total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), which are associated with greater nitrogenous precursors and higher HNM formation. Each water source can have different nitrogenous precursors; river waters may have more algal organic matter while wastewater would have higher organic matter and synthetic chemicals. In addition, source waters can have different constituents, such as varying dissolved oxygen (DO) levels and inorganic ions, which might inhibit HNM formation or affect specification. M. S...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{degradation of}} benzoic acid in the UV/chlorine process was investigatedin this research study. The UV/chlorine {{process has been}} recently considered as an efficient and energy-saving advanced oxidation process to generate hydroxyl radicals (HO•) to degrade emerging micropollutants. However, the photolysis of chlorine also forms the chlorine atom (Cl•), which is a strong oxidant with standard reduction potential comparable with that of HO•. The specific roles of HO• and Cl• on micropollutant degradation in the UV/chlorine process at different chlorine dosages, micropullutant concentrations, pH and chloride concentrations were thus investigated and modeled in this study. The steady-state kinetic modeling developed in this study fitted well with the experimental data and showed that the relative contributions of HO• and Cl• to BA degradation were strongly pH-dependent and were 36 % and 64 % at pH 6, 17 % and 83 % at pH 7. 5, 2 % and 98 % at pH 9, respectively, in the UV/chlorine system under the experimental conditions evaluated. The relative contributions of HO• and Cl• changed slightly with the variations of chlorine dosages, BA concentrations and chloride concentrations. This study firstly demonstrated quantitatively the significant contribution of Cl• in the UV/chlorine system for BA degradation. The formation of byproducts including chloroform (TCM), chloral hydrate (CH), dichloropropanone (DCP), trichloropropanone (TCP), trichloroacetonitrile (TCAN), dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) and <b>trichloronitromethane</b> (TCNM) in BA degradation by the UV/chlorine process was also studied. The byproduct formation from phenol, NOM and fulvic acid by the UV/chlorine process was also investigated for comparison. In most cases, statically significant increases in the byproduct formation from chlorination due to the additional UV irradiation are commonly observed. The impacts from UV exposure {{were found to be}} most significant in TCM formation among the five tested common disinfection byproducts. BA was more sensitive to UV addition than was the phenol, NOM and fulvic acid. This difference could be explained by the reactivity with chlorine. The TCM, CH, DCP, TCP and DCAN formation in the NOM water is higher than that in the fulvic acid water, due to their dissimilar compositions...|$|E

Several waters were tested in a pilot scale treatment plant in their ability of forming DBPs after disinfection as well as oxidation. In a further study with the dependence of DBP formation to the water quality and treatment conditions, natural as well as artificial waters were treated under different conditions, leading to the following results: The concentration of the halogenated DBPs formed is increasing by reaction time {{and the amount of}} chlorine. - An elevation of the pH above 9 leads to lower DBP concentrations, which is useless regarding the disinfection potential of chlorine which is decreasing with an increasing pH-value. - Decreasing the pH under 7 also leads to a decreasing amount of DBPs, while there is a shift to halogenated acids and brominated compounds. In case to study the effects of different natural water compounds on DBP formation, different humic acids, proteins, sugars, amino sugars, and amino acids were added to pure and natural water. After chlorination of these water samples the following results were obtained: - There is no effect of sugars and amino sugars on the formation of adsorbale organic halogens (AOX) and DBP. - Proteins are leading to the formation of a high AOX, while the amount of the identified DBPs is quite low. The chemical trace analysis of DBPs formed during the chlorination of drinking water seems more effective in combination with the detection and identification of unknown gentoxic substances. In order to-examine slightly contaminated water by short term gentoxicity tests as well as organic trace analysis an extraction and enrichment of the water ingredients is necessary. Utilizing the method of volume reduction by partial reflux the enrichment of highly volatile compounds is possible. These concentrates can be examined by a gentoxicity test as well as by GC/MS. The method was successfully applied to chlorinated waters from different origins. Gentoxic effects were detected even in waters chlorinated with a chlorine dose of 0, 3 mg/l. (orig.)

40|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to low concentrations of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) {{in drinking water}} {{has been associated with}} increased human-health risks of bladder cancer and adverse reproductive outcomes. In this study, we investigated electrochemical reduction utilizing a resin-impregnated graphite cathode for the degradation of 17 DBPs (i. e. halomethanes, haloacetonitriles, halopropanones, chloral hydrate and <b>trichloronitromethane)</b> at low mu g L- 1 concentration levels. The reduction experiments were potentiostatically controlled at cathode potentials - 700, - 800 and - 900 mV vs Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) during 24 h. At the lowest potential applied (i. e. - 900 mV vs SHE), the disappearance of DBPs from the solution after 24 h of reduction was > 70 %, except for chloroform (32 %), 1, 1 -dichloropropanone (48 %), and chloral hydrate (31 %). Due to the participation of several removal mechanisms (e. g. electrochemical reduction, adsorption, volatilization and/or hydrolysis) {{it was not possible to}} distinguish the removal efkiencies of electrochemical reduction of individual compounds. Adsorption of the more hydrophilic DBPs (i. e. haloacetonitriles, chloral hydrate, and 1, 1 -dichloropropanone) onto the electrode seems to be affected by the cathode polarization, as the removals observed in the open circuit experiments were significantly higher than the ones obtained in electrochemical reduction under the same conditions. The overall efficiency of reduction was estimated based on the analyses of the released Cl-, Br- and I- ions. Nearly complete C-I bond cleavage was achieved at all three potentials applied, and from the theoretically predicted release of I- lions, calculated based on the removed DBPs, 86 +/- 9 to 92 +/- 1 % was measured in the catholyte solution at - 700 to - 900 my vs SHE. Debromination efficiencies obtained were 74 +/- 3, 79 +/- 6 and 68 +/- 4 % at - 700, - 800 and - 900 mV vs SHE, while for C-Cl bond cleavage the obtained values were 69 +/- 1, 72 +/- 1 and 76 +/- 4 %, respectively. Nevertheless, dechlorination efficiencies are to be considered as approximate, since an increase in Cl- concentration was observed in the open circuit experiments due to the hydrolysis of some of the chlorine-containing DBPs. Although the Coulombic efficiencies for DPBs dehalogenation were only 1. 9 +/- 0. 3 (- 900 mV vs SHE) - 4. 1 +/- 0. 2 % (- 7 C 0 mV vs SHE), relatively low energy consumption of the process was observed, estimated at 72 +/- 2 Wh m(- 3) at - 900 mV vs SHE for the concentration range of DBPs in this study (i. e. 65. 3 - 129. 7 mu g L- 1). The study demonstrated that reductive electrochemical treatment has the potential to be a modern remediation technology for the removal of low concentrations of halogenated DBPs in water.
