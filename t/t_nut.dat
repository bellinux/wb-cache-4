40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was carried out with the main {{objective}} of studying Terminalia catappa nut phyto-constituents through GC-MS/MS, {{as well as its}} antibacterial, antifungal activities. Methods: The <b>T.</b> catappa <b>nut</b> collected was shade dried and extracted with ethanol, the obtained ethanol extract was used for the whole study- GC-MS/MS, antimicrobial activity. Results: The results of GC-MS/MS showed 12 peaks. Among the 12 peaks obtained, the highest peak area percent of 48. 58 for Propane, 1, 1 -diethoxy-and 24. 36 % for t-Butyl hydrogen phthalate followed by 3 -Isopropoxy- 1, 1, 1, 7, 7, 7 -hexamethyl- 3, 5, 5 -tris (trimethylsiloxy) tetrasiloxane showing 12. 80 as peak area percent and all the other compound was found to be moderate in peak area percent which was in the range of 3. 52 - 1. 10 except β-l-Arabinopyranoside methyl, and Cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, oct- 3 -en- 2 -yl ester as its peak area percent was very low showing 0. 08 and 0. 13. The antibacterial activity was good with Escherichia coli when compared to Staphylococcus aureus likewise, the antifungal activity was good with Candida albicans on comparison with Aspergillus niger. Conclusion: The naturally occurring non –nutrient plant chemicals called as phytochemicals especially phenolics – a natural antioxidant contained in <b>T.</b> catappa <b>nut</b> would have contributed for its antibacterial, antifungal properties by interfering with the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane and destroying the enzymes required for cellular processes ensuring its therapeutic potential.

Materials and Methods: The secondary metabolites and antioxidant activities were experimented by adopting recommended standard procedures using aqueous extract of <b>T.</b> catappa <b>nut</b> powder 25, 50, 75, 100 mg. Results: The total phenolics content was higher on comparison with flavonoid content. Similarly, among the antioxidant activities, nitric oxide scavenging (257. 33 ± 2. 30 mg/g) as well as reducing power activity (142. 66 ± 6. 11 mg/g) was higher compared with total antioxidant (82. 66 ± 6. 11 mg/g) and metal chelating activity (64. 66 ± 2. 30 mg/g).

The vigor of seedlings (a qualitative assessment {{based on the number}} of vigorous seedlings selected) was enhanced by a good soil water supply during the early nursery stages combined with a higher level of solar-radiation at the nursery site. There was no interaction between the source of seed nut and site of nursery indicating the absence of manifestation of ecological adaptation at the seedlings nursery.

40|$|Nuts {{have been}} a staple food of human being for {{thousands}} of years, providing vital nutrients such as protein and vitamin (He, Florkoski, and Elnab-heeb 1998). The importance of nuts in the human diet today is partly refl ected {{in the fact that}} they are classifi ed as a part of the USDA Food Guide Pyramid’s Meat/Meat Alternative Group. In addi-tion to their nutritional value, scientifi c researches have provided evidence for their contribution to health, such as reducing the risks of heart diseases (Dreher, Maher, and Kearney 1996; Sabate 1993). With a growing awareness of the benefi <b>ts</b> of <b>nut</b> consumption, it is likely that consumption of nuts may increase. Many kinds of nuts are consumed in the United States, such as peanuts, pecans, cashews. Peanuts enjoy the lion’s share of the U. S. nut market, ac-counting for about 80 % of the nut market. The popularity of peanuts are due to various factors, including nutritional attributes and price advantage. Peanuts are a nutritious food, rich in vital nutrients such as protein, vitamins, and benefi cial unsaturated fat. They are a healthy food, with evidence from sci-entifi c research attesting to their effects on reducing heart diseases and diabetes (Jiang et al. 2002) and on lowering weight and cholesterol level (McManus, Antinoro, and Sacks 2001). Furthermore, peanuts are much cheaper than most of the other nuts. Peanuts can be used for various purposes, of which the dominant use in the United States is food use. Domestic food use of peanuts plays such an important role in U. S. demand for peanuts that it is considered to be the primary factor determining U. S. peanut production (Rimal and Fletcher 2002). Domestic food use of peanuts takes many forms. Of the various forms of domestic food use of pea-nuts, snack food is a major form of consumption, accounting for approximately 25 % of the domestic food use of peanuts. This study explores factors infl uencing consumer preference for various types of snack peanuts, aiming to obtain useful informa-tion for food-policy makers to better understand and more thoroughly exploit the snack peanuts market. Such information is urgently needed because snack peanuts have been experiencing a declining trend and a dwindling market share in the past two de-cades...|$|R

The parameters assessed were plant height, stem diameter and leaf production. The results were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The result showed {{that there were no}} significant differences among the treatment at 5 % level of significance.

40|$|Three {{types of}} {{forecasts}} {{of the total}} Australian production of macadamia <b>nuts</b> (<b>t</b> nut-in-shell) have been produced early each year since 2001. The first is a long-term forecast, based on the expected production from the tree census data held by the Australian Macadamia Society, suitably scaled up for missing data and assumed new plantings each year. These long-term forecasts range out to 10 years in the future, and form a basis for industry and market planning. Secondly, a statistical adjustment (termed the climate-adjusted forecast) is made annually for the coming crop. As the name suggests, climatic influences are the dominant factors in this adjustment process, however, other terms such as bienniality of bearing, prices and orchard aging are also incorporated. Thirdly, industry personnel are surveyed early each year, with their estimates integrated into a growers and pest-scouts forecast. Initially conducted on a 'whole-country' basis, these models are now constructed separately for the six main production regions of Australia, with these being combined for national totals. Ensembles or suites of step-forward regression models using biologically-relevant variables have been the major statistical method adopted, however, developing methodologies such as nearest-neighbour techniques, general additive models and random forests are continually being evaluated in parallel. The overall error rates average 14 % for the climate forecasts, and 12 % for the growers' forecasts. These compare with 7. 8 % for USDA almond forecasts (based on extensive early-crop sampling) and 6. 8 % for coconut forecasts in Sri Lanka. However, our somewhatdisappointing results were mainly due {{to a series of}} poor crops attributed to human reasons, which have now been factored into the models.
