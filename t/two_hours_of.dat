5|$|While {{shedding}} {{much of the}} blood's liquid facilitates flight takeoff, the bat {{still has}} added almost 20–30% of its body weight in blood. To take off from the ground, the bat generates extra lift by crouching and flinging itself into the air.

5|$|A {{modicum of}} {{stability}} during his childhood {{was provided by}} his aia (governess), Maria Genoveva do Rêgo e Matos, whom he loved as a mother, and by his aio (supervisor) friar António de Arrábida, who became his mentor. Both {{were in charge of}} Pedro's upbringing and attempted to furnish him with a suitable education. His instruction encompassed a broad array of subjects that included mathematics, political economy, logic, history and geography. He learned to speak and write not only in Portuguese, but also Latin and French. He could translate from English and understood German. Even later on, as an emperor, Pedro would devote at least <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> each day to study and reading.|$|E
5|$|Armed looters were {{observed}} entering the embassy compound {{as the final}} wave departed. The doors of the chancery—the main building of the embassy—were reportedly blown open by rocket-propelled grenades within <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the embassy's evacuation. Somali employees of the embassy—known as foreign service nationals (FSNs)—could not be evacuated. Local banks had been closed {{for some time and}} the embassy was unable to pay the FSNs. The Ambassador left the FSNs with keys to the commissary and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed.|$|E

5|$|Gay {{caused a}} special study {{to be made}} of this action because he {{considered}} it so outstanding. He found that the 3d Battalion suffered 229 battle casualties in the first <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b> <b>Of</b> these, 38 troops were killed and 167 wounded, the remainder were attached South Koreans. The battalion aid station reported treating 130 casualties. Other wounded were treated at the 8th Cavalry aid station. Many men with minor wounds did not ask for medical attention until the battle had ended, and there were only five cases of combat shock in contrast to the eighteen on Hill 518. North Korean mortar fire caused 80 percent of the casualties.|$|E
5|$|He was an Australian {{selector}} from 1967 to 1979. Immediately {{after his}} appointment, he was embroiled in controversy during the First Test against India at Brisbane in 1967–68.

Jennings played <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> Country classics, two of current Country, and two of mixed recordings. During those final two hours, Jennings played artists such as Chuck Berry and Little Richard. The owner reprimanded him each time he aired the recordings, and when he then played two Richard records in a row, the owner fired him.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 2012, {{a special}} {{meeting of the}} Maryland Racing Commission was convened at Laurel Park {{at the request of}} Penny Chenery, who hired {{companies}} to conduct a forensic review of the videotapes of the race.

The Daily Racing Form announced that it would honor the commission's ruling with regard to the running time. With the revised time, Sham also would have broken the old stakes record.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Monitor withdrew, Virginia had {{run aground}} {{at which time}} Commander Jones {{came down from the}} spar deck only to find the gun crews not {{returning}} fire. Jones demanded to know why and was briefed by Lieutenant Eggleston that powder was low and precious and given Monitors resistance to shot after <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> battle, maintained that continued firing at that point would only be a waste of ammunition. Virginia soon managed to break away and headed back towards Norfolk, believing that Monitor had withdrawn from battle. Greene, now in command, did not pursue Virginia and, like Worden, was under orders to stay with and protect Minnesota, an action for which he was later criticized.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{plan was}} for Pillow to push McClernand away and {{take control of}} Wynn's Ferry and Forge Roads, the main routes to Nashville. Buckner was to move his {{division}} across Wynn's Ferry Road and act as rear guard {{for the remainder of}} the army as it withdrew from Fort Donelson and moved east. A lone regiment from Buckner's division—the 30th Tennessee—was designated to stay in the trenches and prevent a Federal pursuit. The attack started well, and after <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> heavy fighting, Pillow's men pushed McClernand's line back and opened the escape route. It was in this attack that Union troops in the West first heard the famous, unnerving rebel yell.|$|E

5|$|The injured Lindwall {{came out}} to bat at 365/7 without a runner to join Hassett, and {{appeared}} to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty. Hassett, who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the day, swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first six of the match. The Australian vice-captain added 53 in the <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> the morning session to reach lunch at 94. The tourists were unhurried and remained patient as they had bowled England out quickly on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result with less than half the playing time elapsed.|$|E
5|$|The {{landings}} initially encountered heavy {{resistance from}} the German 716th Division; the preliminary bombardment proved less effective than had been hoped, and rough weather forced the first wave to be delayed until 07:35. Several assault companies—notably those of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles and The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada—took heavy casualties in the opening minutes of the first wave. Strength of numbers, coordinated fire support from artillery and armoured squadrons, cleared most of the coastal defences within <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> landing. The reserves of the 7th and 8th brigades began deploying at 08:30 (along with the Royal Marines), while the 9th Brigade began its deployment at 11:40.|$|E
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate {{for people who}} reach a hospital alive was estimated at 30% in 1966; more recent estimates place this number at 9%.

Of those who reach the hospital alive but then die, most do so within the first <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> arrival. The sooner a TBI is diagnosed, the higher the {{mortality rate}}; this is likely due to other accompanying injuries that prove fatal.|$|E
