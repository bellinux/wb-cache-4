25|$|The Texas Special was a named {{passenger}} train operated {{jointly by the}} Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad (also known as the MKT or <b>the</b> <b>Katy)</b> and the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway (the Frisco). It was the flagship of both these lines, operating between St. Louis, Missouri, and San Antonio, Texas, from 1915 until 1959, after which time <b>the</b> <b>Katy</b> changed the northern destination from St Louis to Kansas City after the Frisco discontinued service from St. Louis.|$|E
25|$|In 1915 <b>the</b> <b>Katy</b> began {{operating}} the Texas Special from St. Louis to San Antonio via North Jefferson City, Missouri; Parsons, Kansas; McAlester, Oklahoma; Dallas, Fort Worth, and Austin, Texas. This {{was done to}} augment the existing Katy Flyer and Katy Limited trains.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{reviews for}} <b>The</b> <b>Katies</b> (and <b>the</b> [...] "Noggin' Poundin'" [...] single itself) were universally positive, neither Spongebath nor Elektra marketed or {{promoted}} the album effectively, and sales were lackluster.

25|$|When {{constructed}} {{during the}} 1960s, the I-10 Katy from Houston, known as <b>the</b> <b>Katy</b> Freeway, was built with {{six to eight}} lanes wide barring side lanes, being modest by Houston standards because existing traffic demand to the farming area of West Houston was relatively low. As the population and economic activity increased in the area vehicular traffic increased, reaching an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 238,000 vehicles {{just west of the}} West Loop in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{practice}} staged-robbery the previous day, as <b>the</b> <b>Katy</b> No. 2 approached, Reed threw the switch too early.

25|$|From {{the western}} suburb of Katy to downtown, I-10 {{is known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Katy</b> Freeway in Houston. This section was widened in 2008 {{to as many as}} 26total lanes, {{counting}} the six lanes of the access road, which are not limited-access and therefore not technically part of the freeway itself but are directly adjacent. Between the West Beltway and the West Loop, the minimum lane count is 22total lanes. In this section, the width is 24lanes at multiple locations and up to 26lanes east of Gessner Road (12main lanes, eightlanes of access roads, and sixmid-freeway HOT/HOV lanes). From the Fort Bend county line to I-610, there is a minimum of four main lanes in each direction. The maximum number of undivided lanes at any point on the freeway is nine in the eastbound direction approaching Antoine Drive (though this includes one exit-only lane); {{this is one of the}} widest sections of undivided highway in a single direction in the world. The widest right-of-way, , occurs at <b>the</b> <b>Katy</b> Freeway's intersection with Bunker Hill; at that point, the expansion plans called for six main lanes plus two toll lanes in each direction along with 10lanes on the feeder/frontage roads. The actual striping after construction delineates 29lanes, including all 26 of the planned lanes plus an additional lane in each direction to enter or exit the toll lanes and one more turn lane on the eastbound feeder road.|$|E
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the album release, Elektra dropped the band, and <b>the</b> <b>Katies</b> ultimately left Spongebath Records. The band continued to gig and recorded more promising demos with Brent Rawlings, whose brother, Jason, was the drummer for Self.|$|R

25|$|In 2000 {{increased}} {{traffic levels}} and congestion led to plans being approved for widening of the freeway to 16 lanes with {{a capacity for}} 200,000 cars per day. An old railway running along {{the north side of}} the freeway was demolished in 2002 in preparation for construction which began in 2004. The interior two lanes in each direction between SH6 and west I-610, <b>the</b> <b>Katy</b> Freeway Managed Lanes or Katy Tollway, were built as high-occupancy toll lanes and are managed by the Harris County Toll Road Authority. The section just west of SH6 to the Fort Bend–Harris county line opened in late June 2006. Two intersections were rebuilt (Beltway 8 and I-610), toll booths were added, together with landscaping as part of Houston's Highway Beautification Project. Most of the section between Beltway8 and SH6 had been laid by September 2006 and work was completed in October 2008.|$|E
25|$|Like the Gulf Freeway, the North Freeway {{soon became}} congested. The oil {{boom of the}} 1970s {{resulted}} in large-scale residential development along the highway, most notably The Woodlands. Since the corridor was strongly directional, with 65% of peak-hour traffic going in the peak direction, a 9.6-mile (15.4km) contraflow lane for buses and other high-occupancy vehicles (HOV) was implemented later that decade, opening on August 28, 1979 between downtown and Shepherd Drive (exit 56B). The facility, operating during both rush hour periods, occupied the leftmost lane of the other direction, and was separated from the other lanes with a movable pylon every 40 feet (12 m). In 1980, the existing center breakdown lanes were restriped for HOV traffic for about two miles (3km) from {{the north end of}} the contraflow lane. However, off-peak traffic was increasing, and construction began in 1983 on a more permanent reversible transitway in the median. This, the second transitway in Houston (a month after the one on <b>the</b> <b>Katy</b> Freeway), opened on November 23, 1984, replacing the contraflow lane.|$|E

500|$|Two mines, <b>the</b> <b>Katy</b> and the Hope, owned {{serially}} {{by several}} different companies between the mid-1890s and the mid-1920s, contributed to Basin's prosperity.

However, flooding and fires caused both mines to close by 1896; the Glass brothers {{lost control of}} the property, and the mines went idle. Despite {{the ups and downs of}} the local mines and despite several disastrous fires in town, Basin prospered. In 1905, the Basin Reduction Company led by F. Augustus Heinze, who owned mines in Butte, took over the properties left by the Glass brothers and improved them. By then, Basin had a population of 1,500, four rooming houses, a drug store, three hotels, a bath house, three grocery stores, a [...] bank, a newspaper, and 12 saloons.|$|E
