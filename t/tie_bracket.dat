40|$|Orthodontic {{materials}} are evolving. The {{aim was to}} find out how this affects treatment outcomes. Brackets are getting smaller and smaller in the name of esthetics and patient comfort. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out if intrabracket width (the horizontal distance between <b>bracket</b> <b>tie</b> wings) had any effect on maxillary anterior root torque. We also aimed to find out if three common orthodontic archwires were capable of delivering the torque necessary to achieve ideal root torque. A machine was developed to simulate lingual root torque of an upper central incisor. This is the first test of its kind, presumably because intrabracket width is thought to have no effect on torque. It was found that all three archwire groups were capable of delivering the torque needed to accomplish treatment goals. Torque was found in this experiment to be expressed differently in wide and narrow brackets. The wider bracket required less torque in the archwire to produce the same force compared to that in a narrow bracket. The implications of this finding are that orthodontists may need to adjust the torque being placed in archwires based upon the intrabracket width of the brackets they are using...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} deflection forces of orthodontic wires of different alloys engaged into conventional brackets using several ligation types. Stainless steel, conventional superelastic nickel-titanium and thermally activated nickel-titanium archwires <b>tied</b> into conventional <b>brackets</b> by a ring-shaped elastomeric ligature (RSEL), a 8 -shaped elastomeric ligature (8 SEL) and a metal ligature (ML) were tested. A clinical simulation device was created especially for this study and forces were measured with an Instron Universal Testing Machine. For the testing procedure, the block representing the maxillary right central incisor was moved 0. 5 and 1 mm bucco-lingually at a constant speed of 2 mm/min, and the forces released by the wires were recorded, in accordance with the ISO 15841 guidelines. In general, the RSEL showed lighter forces, while 8 SEL and ML showed higher values. At the 0. 5 mm deflection, the 8 SEL presented the greatest force, but at the 1. 0 mm deflection the ML had a statistically similar force. Based on our evaluations, to obtain lighter forces, the thermally activated nickel-titanium wire with the RSEL are recommended, while the steel wire with the 8 SEL or the ML are recommended when larger forces are desired. The ML exhibited the highest force increase with increased deflections, compared with the elastomeric ligatures...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: o objetivo do presente trabalho foi determinar a força de atrito estático entre braquetes de aço inoxidável autoligados com sistema de fechamento resiliente e fios ortodônticos redondos e retangulares do mesmo material. MÉTODOS: empregaram-se 30 braquetes referentes aos caninos superiores divididos em 6 grupos formados por braquetes autoligados Smartclip, In-Ovation R e convencionais Gemini amarrados com ligaduras elásticas. A hipótese testada neste trabalho foi quanto à possibilidade dos braquetes autoligados ativos serem suscetíveis à elevação da força de atrito com o aumento e alteração da secção {{transversal}} dos fios ortodônticos. Os ensaios foram realizados com tração de 30 s em fios de aço inoxidável 0, 020 " e 0, 019 "X 0, 025 " na máquina de ensaios Emic DL 10000, com uma célula de carga de 20 newtons. Cada conjunto braquete/fio foi responsável pela geração de quatro corpos de prova, totalizando 120 leituras. As comparações entre as médias foram realizadas através da Análise de Variância (one way ANOVA) com correções pelo coeficiente de Bonferroni. RESULTADOS E CONCLUSÃO: os braquetes autoligados apresentaram maior força de atrito do que os braquetes convencionais amarrados com ligaduras elásticas. O grupo Smartclip foi o mais efetivo no controle do atrito (p OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the surface friction produced by self-ligating stainless steel brackets equipped with a resilient closure system and compare the friction generated during traction of round and rectangular orthodontic wires made from the same material. METHODS: Thirty maxillary canine brackets were divided into six groups comprising SmartClip and In-Ovation R self-ligating brackets, and conventional Gemini <b>brackets</b> <b>tied</b> with elastomeric ligatures. This investigation tested the hypothesis that self-ligating brackets are susceptible to increases in friction that are commensurate with increases and changes in the cross-section of orthodontic wires. Traction was performed with the aid of thirty segments of 0. 020 " and 0. 019 " x 0. 025 " stainless steel wires in an EMIC DL 10000 testing machine with a 2 N load cell. Each set of bracket/wire generated four samples, totaling 120 readings. Comparisons between means were performed using analysis of variance (one way ANOVA) corrected with the Bonferroni coefficient. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The self-ligating brackets exhibited lower friction than conventional <b>brackets</b> <b>tied</b> with elastomeric ligatures. The SmartClip group was the most effective in controlling friction (p < 0. 01). The hypothesis under test was confirmed to the extent that the traction performed with rectangular 0. 019 " x 0. 025 " cross-section wires resulted in higher friction forces than those observed in the 0. 020 " round wire groups (p< 0. 01).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{resistance}} to sliding of stainless steel passive self-ligating brackets with 0 ° and 2. 5 ° angulations and to compare them to active self-ligating brackets at zero angulation. The hypothesis to be tested was that passive self-ligating brackets produce lower frictional forces than active self-ligating brackets. METHODS: Twenty five 0. 022 x 0. 028 -in slot maxillary canine brackets were divided into 5 groups of 5 brackets: Damon SL II (Ormco, CA, USA) self-ligating bracket and Gemini (3 M/Unitek, CA, USA) conventional bracket with angulation of 0 and 2. 5 ° and a group of Speed 2 (American Orthodontics, WI, USA) active clip self-ligating system with zero angulation. Twenty five segments of stainless steel 0. 020 -in archwire (TP Orthodontics, IN, USA) were tested and each bracket/wire interface was evaluated at 4 successive points during sliding. Overall, 100 frictional values were analyzed by parametric analysis of variance and Bonferroni tests. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Frictional tests were performed with an Emic DL 10000 testing machine (Emic, Brazil) with a load cell of one kilogram. Passive self-ligating brackets produced lower frictional forces than active self-ligating brackets (p < 0. 01). Under angulation, brackets with a slide mechanism produced higher friction than the same brackets under zero angulation (p < 0. 01). Nevertheless, the slide system under angulation produced smaller friction values than conventional <b>brackets</b> <b>tied</b> with elastomeric ligatures in 0 ° tests...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the rate of en-masse space closure with sliding {{mechanics}} between passive self-ligating SmartClip brackets (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) and conventional twin brackets ligated with stainless steel ligatures. Methods: Nineteen patients including 20 arches participated in this prospective trial with 0. 018 -in slot brackets. All patients had first premolar extractions in at least 1 arch, with the second premolar and the first molar distal to the extraction site bonded with SmartClip brackets on 1 side and conventional twin brackets on the other. The sides were alternated with each consecutive patient. Space closure was achieved on 0. 016 X 0. 022 -in stainless steel wires with nickel-titanium coil springs activated 6 to 9 mm. The patients were recalled every 5 weeks until 1 side had closed. The distances from the mesial aspect of the canine bracket to the distal aspect of the first molar bracket were recorded before and after space closure, and an average rate of space closure per month was calculated. Results: Thirteen patients completed the trial (14 arches); the median rates of tooth movement for the SmartClip bracket side (1. 1 mm per month) and the conventional twin bracket side (1. 2 mm per month) were not significantly different (P =. 86).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{frictional}} resistance between self-ligating and conventional <b>brackets</b> <b>tied</b> to {{different types of}} wire. MATERIAL AND METHODS : Abzil Kirium Capelozza (Pattern I) and Easy Clip (Roth prescription) incisor brackets were used. An elastomeric ligature or a ligating wire 0. 10 -in was used to ligate the wire to the Abzil bracket. Three types of orthodontic archwire alloys were assessed: 0. 016 -in NiTi wire, 0. 016 x 0. 021 -in NiTi wire and 0. 019 x 0. 025 -in steel wire. Ten observations were carried out for each bracket-archwire angulation combination. Brackets were mounted in a special appliance, positioned at 90 degrees {{in relation to the}} wire and tested in two angulations. Frictional test was performed in a Universal Testing Machine at 5 mm/min and 10 mm of displacement. The means (MPa) were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey's test set at 5 % of significance. The surfaces of wires and brackets were observed at SEM. RESULTS: Steel-tied brackets (16. 48 &# 177; 8. 31) showed higher means of frictional resistance than elastomeric-tied brackets (4. 29 &# 177; 2. 16) and self-ligating brackets (1. 66 &# 177; 1. 57) (P 0. 05).

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{stainless steel}} archwire static friction in active and passive self-ligating lingual and conventional brackets with second-order angulations. Methods: Two conventional lingual brackets for canines (STb light/Ormco; PSWb/Tecnident), and two self-ligating brackets, one active (In-Ovation L/GAC) {{and the other}} passive (3 D/ Forestadent), were evaluated. A stainless steel archwire was used at 0 °, 3 ° and 5 ° angulations. Metal ligatures, conventional elastic ligatures, and low friction elastic ligatures were also tested. A universal testing machine applied friction between brackets and wires, simulating sliding mechanics, to produce 2 -mm sliding at 3 mm/minute speed. Results: Two-way analysis of variance demonstrated a significant effect {{of the interaction between}} brackets and angulations (p < 0. 001). Tukey test indicated that the highest frictional resistance values were observed at 5 ° angulation for In-Ovation L, PSWb bracket with non conventional ligature, and STb bracket with metal ligature. As for 3 D, PSWb with conventional or metal ligatures, and STb brackets with non conventional ligature, showed significantly lower static frictional resistance with 0 ° angulation. At 0 ° angulation, STb <b>brackets</b> with metal <b>ties,</b> In-Ovation L <b>brackets</b> and 3 D brackets had the lowest frictional resistance. Conclusions: As the angulation increased from 0 ° to 3 °, static friction resistance increased. When angulation increased from 3 ° to 5 °, static friction resistance increased or remained the same. Self-ligating 3 D and In-Ovation L brackets, as well as conventional STb brackets, seem to be the best option when sliding mechanics is used to perform lingual orthodontic treatment...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Two types of Roth prescription mandibular incisor brackets were used: 3 M Unitek Victory stainless steel (SS) brackets (n = 40) and Transcend 6000 polycrystalline alumina (PCA) brackets (n = 40) as well as eighty 0. 019 × 0. 025 " dimension ortho technology SS wires of 50 mm length each. Subsequently, <b>brackets</b> <b>tied</b> with SS wires divided into eight subgroups (n = 10) and were immersed in vinegar (pH = 3. 5 ± 0. 5), Pepsi ® (pH = 2. 46), Colgate Phos-Flur mouth rinse (pH = 5. 1), and artificial saliva (control group pH = 7) for 24 h. Changes in surface morphology under scanning electron microscope × 1000, surface roughness (Ra) with surface profilometer (single bracket and single wire from each subgroup), and frictional resistance using universal testing machine were evaluated. Results: Highest mean (standard deviation) static frictional force of 2. 65 (0. 25) N was recorded in Pepsi ® followed by 2. 57 (0. 25) N, 2. 40 (0. 22) N, and 2. 36 (0. 17) N for Vinegar, Colgate Phos-Flur mouth rinse, and artificial saliva groups, respectively. In a similar order, lesser mean kinetic frictional forces obtained. PCA brackets revealed more surface deterioration and higher frictional force values than SS brackets. A significant positive correlation was observed between frictional forces and bracket slot roughness (r = 0. 861 and 0. 802, respectively, for static and kinetic frictional forces, p < 0. 001 for both) and wire roughness (r = 0. 243 and 0. 242, respectively, for static and kinetic frictional forces, p < 0. 05 for both).
