Numerical studies predicted pulse broadening and spectral cleaning by undulator <b>tapering</b> Pulse broadening was experimentally verified. However, spectral cleanliness degraded with <b>tapering.</b> We have performed first experiments with a <b>tapered</b> undulator and a short seed laser pulse.

It has been found both theoretically and experimentally that the beat length (Lπ) of the proposed <b>tapered</b> MMI coupler with Δn= 5 % is ∼ half that of conventional MMI coupler and the deviation of power imbalance from its minimum value with fabrication tolerances (± ∂w values) for the proposed <b>tapered</b> structure is more than that of other <b>tapered</b> structures...|$|R
5|$|<b>Taper</b> was not Levin's {{only work}} for The Spectator. He wrote {{on a wide}} range of subjects, from a {{campaign}} for the release of three Arabs imprisoned by the British authorities, to supporting publication of the banned novel Lady Chatterley's Lover, and denunciation of the retired Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard. The last led to a secret meeting of more than 20 senior judges to see whether Levin could be prosecuted for criminal libel; there was no prosecution, and his accusations about Goddard's vindictiveness, deceit and bias have relatively recently been claimed to have been justified. In 1959, Gilmour, while remaining as proprietor, stepped down as editor and was succeeded by his deputy, Brian Inglis; Levin took over from Inglis as assistant editor. Later in that year, after the general election victory of another of his bêtes noires, Harold Macmillan, Levin gave up the <b>Taper</b> column, professing himself to be in despair.|$|E

40|$|A {{system for}} {{coupling}} a vascular overflow graft or cannula to a heart pump. A pump pipe outlet {{is provided with}} an external <b>tapered</b> surface which receives {{the end of a}} compressible connula. An annular compression ring with a <b>tapered</b> internal bore surface is arranged about the cannula with the <b>tapered</b> internal surface in a facing relationship to the external <b>tapered</b> surface. The angle of inclination of the <b>tapered</b> surfaces is converging such that the spacing between the <b>tapered</b> surfaces decreases {{from one end of the}} external <b>tapered</b> surface to the other end thereby providing a clamping action of the <b>tapered</b> surface on a cannula which increases as a function of the length of cannula segment between the <b>tapered</b> surfaces. The annular compression ring is disposed within a tubular locking nut which threadedly couples to the pump and provides a compression force for urging the annular ring onto the cannula between the <b>tapered</b> surfaces. The nut has a threaded connection to the pump body. The threaded coupling to the pump body provides a compression force for the annular ring. The annular ring has an annular enclosure space in which excess cannula material from the compression between the <b>tapered</b> surfaces to "bunch up" in the space and serve as an enlarged annular ring segment to assist holding the cannula in place. The clamped cannula provides a seamless joint connection to the pump pipe outlet where the clamping force is uniformly applied to the cannula because of self alignment of the <b>tapered</b> surfaces. The nut can be easily disconnected to replace the pump if necessary...|$|R

5|$|Benzodiazepines, while {{useful in}} the {{management}} of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines.

Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting {{more than a quarter of}} people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Those who are long-term users of benzodiazepines should not be withdrawn rapidly, as severe anxiety and panic may develop, which are known risk factors for relapse into alcohol abuse. <b>Taper</b> regimes of 6–12 months have been found to be the most successful, with reduced intensity of withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{transient}} response and low distortion are both characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick and weighing only 3mg, is thus capable of stopping and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} drive units.

Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts to <b>taper</b> above 10kHz and then falls off severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to toe in the speakers to point directly to the listener.

Compared to the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward.

5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe.

Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore <b>taper</b> controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the effect of the type of <b>tapering</b> on {{anaerobic}} capacity in male young basketball players. This was an experimental research with 12 weeks, developed with 47 basketball players, randomly divided into three groups: linear <b>tapering</b> (LG), <b>tapering</b> by step (SG) and control group (CG).

The findings revealed that anaerobic capacity attenuated from the competitive to <b>tapering</b> phase in LG (p=. 01) and SG (p=. 01), which was not verified for the CG (p=. 29). Significant difference of anaerobic capacity was found between LG and CG (p=. 01), SG and CG (p=. 01) and between LG and SG (p=. 04) in the <b>tapering</b> phase.

40|$|The optimum wire {{shape to}} produce the minimum signal {{propagation}} delay across an RLC line is shown to exhibit a general exponential form. The line inductance makes exponential <b>tapering</b> more attractive for RLC lines than for RC lines. For RLC lines, optimum wire <b>tapering</b> achieves a greater reduction in the signal propagation delay as compared to uniform wire sizing. For RLC lines, exponential <b>tapering</b> outperforms uniform repeater insertion. As technology advances, wire <b>tapering</b> becomes more effective than repeater insertion, since a greater reduction in the propagation delay is achieved. Optimum wire <b>tapering</b> achieves a reduction of 36 % in the propagation delay in long RLC interconnect as compared to uniform repeater insertion. Wire <b>tapering</b> can reduce both the propagation delay and power dissipation. Optimum <b>tapering</b> for minimum propagation delay reduces the propagation delay by 15 % and power dissipation by 16 % for an example circuit. The optimum <b>tapering</b> factor to minimize the transient power dissipation of a circuit is described in this paper. An analytic solution to determine the optimum <b>tapering</b> factor that exhibits an error of less than 2 % is provided. Wire <b>tapering</b> is also shown to reduce the power dissipation of a circuit by up to 65 %. Wire <b>tapering</b> can also improve signal integrity by reducing the inductive noise of the interconnect lines. Wire <b>tapering</b> reduces the effect of impedance mismatch in digital circuits. The difference between the overshoots and undershoots in the signal waveform of an example clock distribution network is decreased by 34 % as compared to a uniformly sized network producing the same signal characteristics. r 2006 Elsevier B.
