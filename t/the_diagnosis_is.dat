5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> often difficult. A history of potential carbon monoxide exposure, such as being exposed to a residential fire, may suggest poisoning, but <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> confirmed by measuring the levels of carbon monoxide in the blood. This can be determined by measuring the amount of carboxyhemoglobin compared {{to the amount of}} hemoglobin in the blood.|$|E
5|$|LEMS usually {{occurs in}} people over 40 years of age, but may occur at any age. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> usually {{confirmed}} with electromyography and blood tests; these also {{distinguish it from}} myasthenia gravis, a related autoimmune neuromuscular disease.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> usually {{confirmed}} by a surgical pathologist, {{taking into account}} the clinical presentation, microscopic findings, and other laboratory tests. It may arise from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).|$|E
30|$|In {{our patient}} <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made at laparoscopy, however on {{reviewing}} <b>the</b> scans <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> could have <b>been</b> made earlier and possible problems anticipated.|$|R
40|$|Histiocytosis X of {{the lung}} is {{associated}} with bone lesions in 4 to 20 %. We report {{a case in which}} <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> missed in spite of repeated bronchoscopies with transbronchial lavage. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> finally established by isotope bone scan, subsequent skeletal CT-scan and bone biopsy. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Prolapse of a {{uterine tube}} {{is a rare}} event after {{hysterectomy}} with adnexal conservation. It has been described in the literature after abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. We report two cases occurring after total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Both patients presented with pelvic pain and vaginal discharge. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> clinically suspected and was investigated using transvaginal ultrasonography. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> may <b>be</b> helped by histopathology. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed by laparoscopy, and both patients were managed laparoscopically without complications.|$|R
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
5|$|Envenomation from a redback spider bite {{produces}} a syndrome known as latrodectism. A {{small but significant}} percentage of people bitten develop significant pain or systemic symptoms. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> made from the clinical condition, often based on the victim being aware of a bite and ideally with identification of the spider. Laboratory tests are rarely needed {{and there is no}} specific test for the venom or latrodectism.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The {{most common}} cause is viruses. In {{children}} rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common. Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through close contact with an individual who is infected. Testing to confirm <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> typically not needed.|$|E
40|$|Of 2, 545 in-patients {{with primary}} lung cancer, {{pathological}} proof of <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> obtained by sputum cytology in 48 %, by bronchoscopy in 32 %, by biopsy from miscellaneous sites in 12 %, and at thoracotomy or necropsy only in 19 %. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made solely on clinical and radiological evidence in 8 %...|$|R
25|$|Symptoms {{may include}} {{abdominal}} pain or vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. As this is nonspecific {{in areas where}} ultrasound <b>is</b> not available <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> often only discovered during surgery to investigate the abnormal symptoms. They are typically diagnosed later {{in the developing world}} than the developed. In about half of cases from a center in the developing world <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> initially missed.|$|R
40|$|A case of Gaucher's disease {{diagnosed}} {{by means}} of fine needle aspiration of the liver and spleen in a 12 -month-old boy with hepatosplenomegaly <b>is</b> presented. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> based on <b>the</b> finding of large, macrophagelike cells with abundant, pale, fibrillary cytoplasm and small nuclei. The patient had no family history of Gaucher's disease, and <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> not suspected clinically...|$|R
5|$|Gout may be {{diagnosed}} and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic acute arthritis {{of the base}} of the great toe (known as podagra). Synovial fluid analysis should be done, however, if <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> in doubt. X-rays, while useful for identifying chronic gout, have little utility in acute attacks.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those with acute or chronic liver disease. Episodes can be triggered by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte problems, or certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of ammonia in the blood, a substance that is normally removed by the liver. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported by blood ammonia levels, an electroencephalogram, or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E
5|$|In adults, <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> {{supported}} {{by the absence of}} classical or structural diseases of the gastrointestinal system. Supportive criteria include a regurgitant that does not taste sour or acidic, is generally odourless, is effortless, or at most preceded by a belching sensation, that there is no retching preceding the regurgitation, and that the act is not associated with nausea or heartburn.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a patient with}} infective endocarditis in whom <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> apparent only on two-dimensional echocardiography. There was no clinical or haematological evidence of active endocarditis and <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made by <b>the</b> demonstration of an abscess cavity and vegetation posterior and lateral to the aortic root, deforming the left atrial cavity. The findings were confirmed by cardiac catheterisation and operation...|$|R
40|$|Two {{patients}} with isolated atresia of the pulmonary veins are described. One patient presented with haemoptysis {{and the other}} with recurrent unilateral chest infections. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> confirmed in both instances by cardiac catheterisation and pulmonary angiography. One patient died one year after <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made and <b>the</b> second child has been stable during a follow up period of three years...|$|R
50|$|Symptoms {{may include}} {{abdominal}} pain or vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. As this is nonspecific {{in areas where}} ultrasound <b>is</b> not available <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> often only discovered during surgery to investigate the abnormal symptoms.

In about half of cases from a center in the developing world <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> initially missed.|$|R
5|$|In {{clinical}} immunology, {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile of patient. Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|Medical imaging is not {{routinely}} {{needed as}} it is expensive and does not typically change how plantar fasciitis is managed. When <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> not clinically apparent, lateral view x-rays of the ankle are the recommended imaging modality to assess for other causes of heel pain such as stress fractures or bone spur development.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{factors include}} being {{overweight}} or a recent increase in weight. Tetracycline may also trigger the condition. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> based on symptoms {{and a high}} intracranial pressure founding during a lumbar puncture with no specific cause found on a brain scan.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case of {{thoracic}} aortic dissection in a 33 -year-old woman. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> difficult, and <b>the</b> right <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made 4 months after the initial clinical manifestation. Aortic dissection was caused by necrosis of the media combined with longstanding arterial hypertension. Surgical intervention was performed timely and was effective. </p...|$|R
30|$|Those {{with class}} V lupus nephritis were given mycophenolate mofetil {{combined}} with corticosteroid since <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made.|$|R
40|$|Three {{children}} with left atrial myxomas are described. All suffered major arterial occlusion with consequent permanent morbidity before <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made and <b>the</b> tumour removed. Each child had had previous small embolic phenomena. In two, <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made by ultrasound. In any {{child who has}} had an arterial embolus without obvious cause, a left atrial myxoma should be considered and looked for by an ultrasonic mitral echogram...|$|R
5|$|Strep throat {{is spread}} by {{respiratory}} droplets from an infected person. It may be spread directly or by touching {{something that has}} droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms. It may also be spread by skin infected with group A strep. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> made {{based on the results}} of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> {{achieved}} with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and blood tests. Treatment is by the timely correction of hormone deficiencies, {{and in many cases}} surgical decompression is required. Many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop pituitary hormone deficiencies and require long-term hormone supplementation. The first case of the disease was recorded in 1898.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> made {{based on}} {{observation}} of the individual's symptoms and family history, and after ruling out secondary causes of tic disorders. In patients with a typical onset and {{a family history of}} tics or obsessive–compulsive disorder, a basic physical and neurological examination may be sufficient.|$|E
5|$|Ellis was {{diagnosed}} with sickle cell anemia at age 17; <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> later changed to sickle cell trait.|$|R
30|$|The diagnoses {{were based}} on {{clinical}} history aided by CT and were sometimes confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Cases where <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> dubious were not treated by the percutaneous drilling method.|$|R
30|$|In {{our case}} of medial clavicular fracture, {{arriving}} at <b>the</b> correct <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> challenging, {{partly due to}} the low incidence and partly because <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> can <b>be</b> confused with sternoclavicular dislocation.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> {{usually made}} on {{electromyography}} (EMG), {{which is one}} of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness. This involves the insertion of small needles into the nerves supplying several muscles, administering small electrical impulses through these needles, and measuring the electrical response of the muscle in question. Two EMG investigations can be characteristic in LEMS: compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and single-fiber examination.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} (85%) {{of cases of}} lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 10–15% of cases occur in {{people who have never}} smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{should be}} suspected {{if any of}} the symptoms associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of diving. In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>is</b> confirmed if the symptoms are relieved by recompression. Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not as good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms.|$|E
40|$|Five {{cases of}} elastofibroma dorsi are described. The {{location}} of the lesions (bilateral in one case) was typi-cal, in the thoracoscapular region. In the first case <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> established by biopsy; in the remaining cases <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> suspected based on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging findings and was confirmed by histopathological study after surgical excision. Although these lesions are benign, histological study is advisable to establish a differen-tial diagnosis with malignant neoplastic processes...|$|R
30|$|Malignancies {{can arise}} in colonic diverticula. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>was</b> made {{based on the}} {{endoscopic}} finding of a tumor within a diverticulum [7]. However, establishing <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> may <b>be</b> complicated by abnormal findings, such as abscess formation, submucosal progression, or diverticulitis [8]. Hence, endoscopic findings may not facilitate establishing <b>the</b> definitive <b>diagnosis,</b> as in <b>the</b> present patient.|$|R
