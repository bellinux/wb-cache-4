Like {{a minute and a}} half through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!" [...] In response, Slayer sent some T-shirts to Amos, which she said was appreciated. Hanneman echoed similar sentiments as King, but noted that a few years later when Slayer was playing a festival before Amos, Amos would allow Slayer to play a full set when the band was late.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} in the United States and Puerto Rico in February 2000. It became very successful with the ballad and tropical and salsa versions setting an airplay record for a Latin single with 23.4 million impressions in those countries. The reaction to the song was intense, and Son by Four was asked to record an English-language version of the track. This version, titled [...] "Purest of Pain", was serviced to English-speaking radio stations in May 2000. The success of the song took by surprise {{the leader of the}} band, Ángel López, who told Billboard magazine: [...] "When they <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> were going to be signed by Columbia for the single, we flipped." [...] A ranchera version was also recorded for the Regional Mexican audience. About the song, López also declared that [...] "has something everybody can relate to. We're adults, we've been all through that [...] The way the song reaches out to people is outstanding." [...] In his album review for AllMusic, Evan C. Gutierrez declared that [...] "A Puro Dolor" [...] set [...] "an impossibly high standard {{for the rest of the}} playlist." ...|$|E
500|$|Oliphant then {{met with}} the Uranium Committee. Samuel K. Allison, a new member of the Committee, was a talented {{experimental}} physicist and a protégé of Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago. Oliphant [...] "came to a meeting", Allison recalls, [...] "and said 'bomb' in no uncertain terms. He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> must concentrate every effort on the bomb, and said we {{had no right to}} work on power plants or anything but the bomb. The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he said, and Britain did not have the money or the manpower, so it was up to us." [...] Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark. Oliphant visited his friend Ernest Lawrence, and also spoke with James Conant and Enrico Fermi. He not only managed to convince the Americans that an atomic bomb was feasible, but also inspired Lawrence to convert his [...] cyclotron into a giant mass spectrometer for isotope separation, a technique Oliphant had pioneered in 1934. Leo Szilard later wrote, [...] "if Congress knew the true history of the atomic energy project, I have no doubt but that it would create a special medal to be given to meddling foreigners for distinguished services, and that Dr Oliphant {{would be the first to}} receive one." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Raining Blood" [...] {{was covered}} by Tori Amos on her 2001 album Strange Little Girls. King has {{admitted}} that he thought the cover was odd: [...] "It took me {{a minute and a}} half to find a spot in the song where I knew where she was. It's so weird. If she had never <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>we</b> would have never known. You could have played it for us and we'd have been like, 'What's that?' Like {{a minute and a half}} through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!'". The band, however, liked the cover enough to send Slayer T-shirts to her. The song was also covered by Malevolent Creation, Chimaira, Vader, Dokaka, Reggie and the Full Effect and Killick Erik Hinds, who covered the entire album on a H'arpeggione. [...] "Raining Blood" [...] was also covered by the New Zealand drum and bass band Concord Dawn on their 2003 album Uprising, and by Nashville, Tennessee band Asschapel on their 7" [...] "Satanation". A medley of [...] "Raining Blood" [...] and [...] "Postmortem" [...] appears on Body Count's 2016 album Bloodlust, preceded by a short monologue by lead singer Ice-T where he names Slayer as both a major influence on Body Count and as one of his favorite bands of all time [...] "and always will be"; a video for Body Count's version was released in August of 2017.|$|E
500|$|The Siege of Rhodes [...] "continued acting 12 {{days without}} {{interruption}} with great applause" [...] {{according to the}} prompter John Downes in his [...] "historical review of the stage" [...] Roscius Anglicanus (1708). This was a remarkable run for the limited potential audience of the time. As four more acclaimed Duke's Company productions [...] "with scenes" [...] followed at Lincoln's Inn Fields {{in the course of}} 1661 (including Hamlet), all highly admired by Pepys, the King's Company had no other recourse than to hastily commission a changeable-scenery playhouse of their own. Bowing to the inevitable just seven months after the opening of Lincoln's Inn Fields, Killigrew and his actors signed orders for a new, even more magnificent, theatre in Bridges Street. This theatre, {{the first step in the}} war of spectacle escalation of the 1660s, was so full when Pepys and his wife went to see an opera there that [...] "they <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> could have no room". The large, yet compact, Restoration playhouses, with audience capacities from 700 (Bridges Street) to upwards of 2,000 (the next house on the same site, the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, finished in 1674), were enormous investments, financed through selling shares in the companies, which were thus bound to make more and more money from ticket sales. Not only the theatres and their technical equipment, but the flats painted for a single performance, the special effects, and the elaborate stage clothes, were extremely expensive. Audiences appreciated both luxury and appropriateness of décor and costume: Pepys was quite capable of going several times to see a play that, as such, he disliked, purely for the pleasure of viewing striking and innovative scenery like [...] "a good scene of a town on fire". The companies struggled to outdo each other in catering to these expensive tastes, with precarious finances and the ever-present consciousness that the investments could literally burn to the ground in a few hours. When the theatre in Bridges Street did burn down in January 1672, with its entire stock of scenery and costumes, it was an economic blow from which the King's Company's never recovered.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1996 the Israeli weekly {{newspaper}} Kol Ha'ir published the personal accounts of {{several members of}} the Israeli artillery battery responsible for the shelling of the Qana camp. The soldiers spoke under condition of anonymity. One acknowledged that they were encouraged by their commander after the attack: [...] "He told us it was war. Come on, the bastards fire at you, what can you do? He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> were firing well and we should keep it up, and that Arabs, you know there are millions of them," [...] Soldier A was quoted as saying. Another artilleryman, Soldier T, was quoted as saying that [...] "no-one spoke about it {{as if it was a}} mistake. We did our job and we are at peace with that. Even 'S' <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> were great and that they were just a bunch of Arabs (in Hebrew, 'arabushim')...How many Arabs are there and how many Jews? A few 'arabushim' die, there is no harm in that." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by another soldier, Soldier Y, who remarked, [...] "it's a war, in a war these things happen...It's just a bunch of Arabs. Why are you taking it so hard?"

2500|$|In 1942, for the First Papers of Surrealism show in New York, surrealists {{called on}} Duchamp {{to design the}} exhibition. He wove a {{three-dimensional}} web of string throughout the rooms of the space, in some cases making {{it almost impossible to}} see the works. Duchamp made a secret arrangement with an associate's son to bring young friends to the opening of the show. When the formally-dressed patrons arrived, they found a dozen children in athletic clothes kicking and passing balls, and skipping rope. When questioned, the children were told to say [...] "Mr. Duchamp <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> could play here".

2500|$|In the Europa League Final against Benfica on 15 May, Chelsea won 2–1. This made Benítez {{only the}} second manager after Giovanni Trapattoni to have won the UEFA Cup/Europa League with two {{different}} teams, and Chelsea became the fourth club to have won all three of UEFA's major club competitions. Defender David Luiz credited Benítez with making critical changes at half time, saying, [...] "He changed some of our positions in the second half. That's why we played better and won the title. He spoke a lot to us to change the intensity." [...] On the winning goal scored by Branislav Ivanović, Juan Mata said, [...] "Rafa <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> had to aim to the far post, because it was Artur's weakest place.

2500|$|The band showed promise but had yet {{to evolve}} into a decent line-up capable of {{fulfilling}} it and spent several years treading water. According to their publisher Charlie Pinder: [...] "They were a band {{that everyone in the}} A community knew about and would go and see every now and then. But they weren’t very good. They had quite good songs; Fran always did write good songs." [...] While on a visit to Scotland, American engineer and producer Niko Bolas, a long-time Neil Young and Rolling Stones associate, tuned into a Travis session on Radio Scotland, and heard something in the band's music which instantly made him travel to Perth to see them. Healy: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> were shit, took us in the studio for four days, and taught us how to play properly, like a band. He was ballsy, rude, and New York pushy. He didn't believe my lyrics and told me to write what I believed in and not tell lies. He was Mary Poppins, he sorted us out." [...] The band recorded a five-song demo, which included the song [...] "All I Want to Do Is Rock".|$|E
2500|$|Cinematographer Adam Greenberg, whose {{previous}} film credits included Three Men and a Baby, La Bamba and Near Dark, {{approached the}} film {{with a unique}} documentary-style technique. Commenting on the initial photography lighting tests, Greenberg remarked, [...] "The first ones were a disaster. They didn't look good at all. I didn't know how to photograph these aliens. It {{was the first time}} I had to deal with this kind of thing. But I have an eye and I learned from these tests." [...] At the Biltmore Hotel, a peculiar situation arose where the ceilings were simply too tall for standard lighting equipment. An ingenious idea was devised by the crew to have six to eight weather balloons sent up and have artificial light bounce off of them to create the proper lighting mood. Greenberg remarked, [...] "I wanted a very rich look from that place, gold and very warm. In the story it is very late after a big party. I wasn't going for any special effect, just nice light from lamps on the tables. The problem was, the hotel management wouldn't let us hang anything from the ceiling. In pre-production they had <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> could hang lights, but I didn't believe them. The ceilings there are very high and very beautiful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oliphant {{met with}} the S-1 Section. Samuel K. Allison was a new {{committee}} member, a talented experimentalist and a protégé of Compton at the University of Chicago. Oliphant [...] "came to a meeting," [...] Allison recalled, [...] "and said 'bomb' in no uncertain terms. He <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> must concentrate every effort on the bomb and said we {{had no right to}} work on power plants or anything but the bomb. The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he said, and Britain did not have the money or the manpower, so it was up to us." [...] Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark. Oliphant then visited his friend Ernest Lawrence to explain the urgency. Lawrence contacted Compton and James B. Conant, who received the final MAUD Report from Thomson on 3 October 1941. Urey and Pegram were sent to the UK to obtain more information. In January 1942, the OSRD was empowered to engage in large engineering projects in addition to research. Without the help of the MAUD Committee the Manhattan Project would have started months behind. Instead they were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb, not whether it was possible. Historian Margaret Gowing noted that [...] "events that change a time scale by only a few months can nevertheless change history." ...|$|E

2500|$|A third helper, a porter, {{had joined}} the two guides, solely to lead the party of five mountaineers down onto the Glacier de Bionnassay in darkness, {{well away from the}} normal route taken by others to reach the Aiguilles de Gouter. This task the porter utterly failed to do, and it was left to Cachat, the guide, to find a {{suitable}} track onto the ice in total darkness. Sunrise found them {{at the edge of the}} glacier, and their useless porter soon departed. Crossing the glacier, they climbed a prominent rock ridge to gain a better view and to ascertain their best route. At first they stared hopelessly at the glaciated slopes towering above them, realising a direct ascent to the summit was impossible. Grove later described it thus: [...] "The ice in all its gaunt blue nakedness [...] raked by showers of grape from overhanging rock". Eventually they determined a sinuous route up through the billowing ice fields and avalanche debris to reach the crest of the ridge running from the Aiguille de Tricot to the summit of their mountain. Cachat led the way, hacking innumerable footholds in the steep ice until, some five hours after leaving the rock promontory, they finally attained the ridge, and found the day well-advanced and the weather deteriorating. Here they rested a while before continuing along the crest with a sheer ice slope dropping to one side and treacherous rocks on the other. By now the weather had changed and a heavy snowfall had begun. The ridge had become more exposed and a strong wind had developed. As each step was cut in the ice, their axes buzzed in the electrically charged air and they were forced to straddle the exposed, razor-sharp ridge as it was now completely impossible to stand. Grove later wrote that their [...] "steel axe-heads gave out something musical in tone, but nevertheless evil to hear, for it <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> were now in the very heart of the thunderstorm".|$|E
2500|$|Artists {{from the}} metal and hard rock {{community}} also paid homage to Jackson. Metallica {{paid tribute to}} Jackson during its encore at the Sonisphere Festival. Honoring Michael Jackson during its July 4 headlining appearance at the event, the band played a portion of 'Beat It' before easing into a riotous cover of Queen's 'Stone Cold Crazy'. Boston hard rockers Extreme performed a cover version of Jacksons's [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] at the Midnight Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas. Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. I think those who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they tried very hard to make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>we</b> were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high." [...] Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave performed a cover version of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] on June 27, 2009, at the Peace & Love festival in Borlänge, Sweden. Steve Vai and Andy Timmons of Danger Danger performed an instrumental version of [...] "Beat It" [...] at the Meinl Guitar Festival 2009 on June 27 in Gutenstetten, Germany. Former Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach commented: [...] "Another angel down... I am very sorry for my friend Jermaine's loss. I lived with Jermaine for three weeks last year (during the filming of the second season of CMT's hit series, 'Gone Country'), and we talked about his brother frequently. He said to me, 'When you cut up my brother, you're cutting up me'. I feel for the Jackson family, because I know all too well how they feel. Unfortunately." [...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television. He made performing seem easy and inspired my generation with his music and his grace. He was one of a kind and will be missed but his music will live forever." [...] Legendary Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen recorded [...] "Beat It" [...] with ex-Judas Priest/Iced Earth frontman Tim [...] "Ripper" [...] Owens on vocals. Guitarist Buckethead wrote a song entitled [...] "The Homing Beacon", inspired by Jackson's 3-D film, Captain EO. Alternative metal band CKY performed [...] "Beat It" [...] for the duration of their [...] "Carver City" [...] Tour.
