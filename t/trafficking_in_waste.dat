We place part of the blame on mobile OSes: they do not expose adequate interfaces through which applications can interact with the network. We propose traffic backfilling, a technique <b>in</b> which delay-tolerant <b>traffic</b> is opportunistically transmitted by the OS using resources left over by the naturally occurring bursts caused by interactive traffic. Backfilling presents a simple interface with two classes of traffic, and grants the OS and network large flexibility to maximize the use of network resources and reduce device energy consumption. Using device traces and network data from a major US carrier, we demonstrate a large opportunity for traffic backfilling...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} {{in the traditional}} cellular architecture. First, each BTS is costly to build and operate. Moore's law helps reduce the size and power of an electrical system, but the supporting facilities of the BTS is not improved as well. Secondly, when more BTS are added to a system to improve its capacity, interference among BTS is more severe as BTS are closer {{to each other and}} more of them are using the same frequency. Thirdly, because users are mobile, the traffic of each BTS fluctuates (called 'tide effect'), and as a result, the average utilization rate of individual BTS is pretty low. However, these processing resources cannot be shared with other BTS. Therefore, all BTS are designed to handle the maximum traffic, not average <b>traffic,</b> resulting <b>in</b> a <b>waste</b> of processing resources and power at idle times.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Traffic</b> {{congestion}} <b>in</b> urban {{cities is}} an increasing problem. Not only does it {{lead to an increase}} in pollution, but the time spent waiting <b>in</b> <b>traffic</b> queues <b>wastes</b> valuable time <b>in</b> addition to causing frustration. A system that can control and manage traffic efficiently is one way that this issue can be reduced. A specific road <b>traffic</b> intersection <b>in</b> South Manchester, UK, was selected for investigation as it experiences high levels of traffic flow through it during the evening peak time. This has led to large queues and long waiting times due to the fixed timings of the traffic lights. This paper explores strategies to better control the traffic flow through it. A model of the selected traffic junction has been built using Witness simulation software. Data for this junction has been obtained partially from observations and mostly from traffic surveys enabling a simulation of the traffic flow. Analysing the results allowed two alternative scenarios to be developed and simulated. Results from one of the scenarios showed noticeable reductions in the average queue waiting times at the traffic junction...|$|R

30|$|Biodegradable waste {{refers to}} the amount of organic matter <b>in</b> <b>waste.</b> Biodegradable waste is {{commonly}} found <b>in</b> municipal solid <b>waste</b> (MSW) where the organic matter <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> ranges from 75 to 85 % in urban MSWs of India. The varying content of organic matter <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> depends on the economic condition of the country from where it is generated (Bandara et al. 2007). Recent decades had seen rapid increase in human population, accelerating economy and urbanization, which have led to an exponential increase <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> generation every year (Gouveia and Prado 2009). According to Gupta and Arora (2016), {{it has been estimated that}} urban India generates approximately 1, 88, 500 tonnes of municipal solid waste per day (68.8 million tonnes per year). The most common and cheap waste disposal technique involves dumping of <b>waste</b> <b>in</b> a specified disposal yard.

The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to understand factors contributing to successes and challenges in community participation especially <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> minimization initiatives; <b>in</b> order to inform policies and contribute to improve the design of the initiative. The objectives of the research are: firstly, to understand the current state of public participation <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> minimization at Emfuleni Local Municipality. Secondly, it is {{to determine the extent of}} willingness of the community to participate <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> minimization initiatives. Thirdly, to determine strategies on how to promote public participation <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> minimization. Fourthly, to identify constraints and challenges of public participation <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> minimization and what kind of support is required for the community to participate <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> minimization initiatives at Emfuleni Local Municipality. Respondents were drawn from fifty households within the community of Bophelong Extension 13, Emfuleni Recycling groups, Waste Management officials, Gauteng Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment stake holder participation unit and <b>Waste</b> Buyers <b>in</b> Vanderbijlpark. The researcher employed mainly a qualitative research design and data was collected through questionnaires and interviews. Quantitative study was done on officials and responses were ranked according to the importance of the factors influencing community participation. The findings of this research indicate that the community is willing to participate <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> minimization initiatives. 42 % of respondents are currently NOT participating <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> minimization initiatives. It was noted that all community respondents promised and are willing to participate <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> minimization strategies. The research further indicates that there is a considerable number of constraints and challenges prohibiting successful community participation <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> minimization. The constraints include lack of knowledge especially regarding composting initiatives to minimize organic waste and the separation of waste, lack of infrastructure to exchange waste for cash, lack of time, lack of transport, lack of political support, lack of starter packs to initiate own waste minimization plant and lack of financial support to ensure that waste minimization initiatives create opportunities for job creation. This study recommends, amongst others, that the community requires support to participate meaningfully <b>in</b> <b>waste</b> minimization initiatives <b>in</b> the form of: awareness and education, infrastructure for reclaimed waste, waste recycling bins, project funding, community involvement and support from the Emfuleni Local Municipality and the private sector.
