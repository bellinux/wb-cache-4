5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E

After two appearances {{the evening of}} June 28, Mansfield, Sam Brody (her attorney and companion), their driver Ronnie Harrison (age 20), and three of Mansfield's children– Miklós, Zoltán and Mariska– departed Biloxi after midnight in a 1966 Buick Electra 225. Their destination was New Orleans, where Mansfield was scheduled to appear on WDSU's Midday Show at noon the next day. At approximately 2:25a.m., on U.S. Highway 90 west of the Rigolets Bridge, the Buick crashed at high speed into the rear of a tractor-trailer that had slowed behind a truck spraying mosquito fogger and that was shrouded in the insecticide fog. The three adults {{in the front seat}} were killed instantly. <b>The</b> <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> were asleep in the rear seat, survived with minor injuries.|$|E

More than 100 captives were taken on an overland journey hundreds of miles north to the Caughnawaga mission village near Montreal, where most of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> survived were adopted by the Mohawk people. Several adults were later redeemed or released in negotiated prisoner exchanges, including the minister, who tried for years without success to ransom his daughter. She became fully assimilated, marrying a Mohawk man. There was an active market in human trafficking of the captive colonists during these years, and communities raised funds to ransom their citizens from Indian captivity.|$|E

5|$|While {{working at}} the {{hardware}} store, Gardiner first played organised sports {{as a member of}} the store's baseball team. Gardiner quickly started playing ice hockey, with the same passion as <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> were born in Canada. As he didn't learn to skate until he was eight-years-old, he couldn't skate very fast and was forced to play as the goaltender. He had tried to play as a forward and defenceman, but was too slow for either position. Playing on Winnipeg's frozen ponds, Gardiner employed an acrobatic style, instead of the nearly-universal stand-up style played in that era, to avoid having his hands and feet frostbitten. He joined the Victorias, a team in the Winnipeg City League, at the age of 13. He recorded a shutout in his first game, but the team was shut out in their following game, so Gardiner was cut. By the age of 14, Gardiner made the intermediate team of the Selkirk Fishermen.|$|E
5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E

Even though your state may not have an anti-bullying law, there are usually many laws that are applicable to dealing with bullying behaviors, including theft, assault, battery, and extortion. Complete the investigation before contacting parents. Complete a thorough investigation of a bullying incident before contacting parents of involved students. Contact the parents of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> was bullied and seek suggestions for reparation before contacting the parents of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> was bullying. When speaking to the parent of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>who</b> bullied, make it clear that: (1) you have conducted an investigation that included getting their <b>child’s</b> account of <b>the</b> incident, and (2) witnesses and physical evidence clearly indicate that their child was bullying.
