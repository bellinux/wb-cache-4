25|$|The Comanches {{arrived in}} San Antonio on March 19. Expecting a council of peace, the 12 chiefs brought women and {{children}} as well as warriors. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> in finery with their faces painted. The delegation had hoped to negotiate a recognition of the Comancheria as the sovereign land of the Comanche. Other chiefs not in attendance, such as Buffalo Hump, warned that the whites could not be trusted.|$|E
25|$|British yeomanry {{were armed}} with a 1908 pattern sword, and Lee–Enfield rifles, unlike their French and German counterparts, who were only {{armed with a}} shorter range carbine. As the war progressed, they were issued with brodie helmets, hand grenades, trench mortars and Hotchkiss light machine guns. Like the {{infantry}}, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> in a karki uniform, with a service dress cap, and instead of infantry webbing, they carried their ammunition in a bandolier. The French cuirassiers, by comparison, would not have looked {{out of place in}} the Napoleonic Wars. Still wearing blue and red uniforms, with breast and back metal plates and plumed brass-steel helmets. While the Germans had a standard field grey uniform their uhlans still wore Polish style czapka helmets tunics with plastron fronts, the hussars frogged jackets, and the cuirassiers steel spiked helmets.|$|E
25|$|In {{his younger}} days, Gan Ning {{was known to}} be very {{energetic}} and eager to behave like a youxia or vigilante. He gathered a group of wayward young men, with him as their chief, and engaged in piracy. They were armed with either bows or crossbows, wore feathers in their hats and tied bells on their bodies. The ringing of the bells alerted people to the presence of Gan Ning and his gang. Gan Ning's plundering and murderous ways earned him infamy throughout Ba Commandery. On land, he and his gang travelled by riding on horses or in chariots in a certain formation; on water, they sailed on light vessels linked together. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> in elaborate and flamboyant garments to attract attention wherever they went. When they stopped at a certain location, they used silk to tie their boats to the jetties; when they were departing, they cut the silk and abandoned it as a display of their extravagance.|$|E

At one point, Madonna removed the robe to reveal another dress with prints of hearts on it, and danced around DeGeneres, who also used props like oversized sunglasses and a leopard print cowboy hat for Madonna. The song was later included in the setlist of the Rebel Heart Tour, performed in a flamenco-style medley with [...] "Into the Groove", [...] "Everybody" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star".

500|$|Conein {{knew that}} if he saw the {{execution}} wounds, {{he would not be able}} to deny that Diem and Nhu had been assassinated. Conein refused to see the proof, realising that having such knowledge would compromise his cover and his safety. He returned to the embassy and submitted his report to Washington. The CIA in Saigon later secured a set of photos of the brothers that left no doubt that they had been executed. The photos were taken at about 10:00, 2 November, showing the dead brothers covered in blood on the floor of an APC. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> in the robes of Roman Catholic priests with their hands tied behind their backs. Their faces were bloodied and bruised and they had been repeatedly stabbed. The images appeared to be genuine, discrediting the generals' claims that the brothers had committed suicide. The pictures were distributed around the world, having been sold to media outlets in Saigon. The caption below a picture published in Time read [...] "'Suicide' with no hands." ...|$|E

(1997) groups of college {{students}} from China and the United States rated strangers from both countries on the [...] "Big Five" [...] personality traits, external traits, and how well <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>dressed.</b> They found that both Chinese and U.S. students rated faces as showing similar levels of agreeableness and extroversion. The people who {{were thought to be}} the most agreeable wore smiles, a facial expression that is recognized around the world. The findings of the research seem to suggest that the trait of agreeableness is attributed to people in a universal way.|$|E

2500|$|The volunteers {{knew they}} were being used in a study {{but they did not}} know when the study would be taking place, so the initial shock of being {{randomly}} arrested one morning and taken to the mock prison put them in a mild state of shock. On arrival, the [...] "prisoners" [...] were stripped, searched, shaved and deloused, which caused a great deal of humiliation. They were then issued uniforms, ID numbers, and escorted to their cells by the volunteer prison guards. The guards themselves were not given any specific instruction or guidelines for the way they were to treat the prisoners besides the fact they were not allowed to use corporal punishment. Instead, the psychologists allowed them to do whatever was needed to keep order in the prison. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> in identical uniforms, wore a whistle around their neck and carried a night stick.|$|E
2500|$|In 1853, Princess Sophie of Bavaria, the domineering {{mother of}} 23-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph, preferring {{to have a}} niece as a daughter-in-law rather than a stranger, {{arranged}} a marriage between her son and her sister Ludovika's eldest daughter, Helene ("Néné"). Although the couple had never met, Franz Joseph's obedience was taken for granted by the archduchess, who was once described as [...] "the only man in the Hofburg" [...] for her authoritarian manner. The Duchess and Helene were invited to journey to the resort of Bad Ischl, Upper Austria to receive his formal proposal of marriage. Fifteen-year-old Sisi accompanied her mother and sister and they traveled from Munich in several coaches. They arrived late as the Duchess, prone to migraine, had to interrupt the journey; the coach with their gala dresses never did arrive. The family was still in mourning {{over the death of}} an aunt so <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> in black and unable to change to more suitable clothing before meeting the young Emperor. While black did not suit eighteen-year-old Helene's dark coloring, it made her younger sister's blonder looks more striking by contrast.|$|E

2500|$|On 29 January 1393, a masked ball, {{which became}} known as the Bal des Ardents ("Ball of the Burning Men") because of the tragedy that ensued, had been {{organized}} by Isabeau of Bavaria to celebrate the wedding of one of her ladies-in-waiting at the Hôtel Saint-Pol. At the suggestion of Huguet de Guisay, the king and four other lords dressed up as wild men and danced about. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>dressed</b> [...] "in costumes of linen cloth sewn onto their bodies and soaked in resinous wax or pitch to hold a covering of frazzled hemp, so that they appeared shaggy & hairy from head to foot". [...] At the suggestion of one Yvain de Foix, the king commanded that the torch-bearers were to stand {{at the side of the}} room. Nonetheless, the king's brother Louis I, Duke of Orléans, who had arrived late, approached with a lighted torch in order to discover the identity of the masqueraders, and he set one of them on fire. There was panic as the fire spread. The Duchess of Berry threw the train of her gown over the king. Several knights who tried to put out the flames were severely burned. Four of the wild men perished: Charles de Poitiers, son of the Count of Valentinois; Huguet de Guisay; Yvain de Foix; and the Count of Joigny. Another [...] Jean, son of the Lord of Nantouillet [...] saved himself by jumping into a dishwater tub.|$|E
