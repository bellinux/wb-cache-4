5|$|Bridgwater {{became the}} first town in Britain <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> the {{government}} to ban slavery, in 1785. In 1896, the trade unionists of Bridgwater's brick and tile industry were involved a number of strikes. The Salisbury government sent troops to the town to clear the barricades by force after {{the reading of the}} Riot Act.|$|E
5|$|Historian Steven Boyd {{argued that}} the {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion prompted anti-Federalist westerners to finally accept the Constitution and to seek change by voting for Republicans rather than resisting the government. Federalists, for their part, came to accept the public's role in governance and no longer challenged the freedom of assembly and the right <b>to</b> <b>petition.</b>|$|E
5|$|In two 1960s {{decisions}} collectively {{known as}} forming the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, the Court {{established that the}} right <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> prohibited the application of antitrust law to statements made by private entities before public bodies: a monopolist may freely go before the city council and encourage the denial of its competitor's building permit without being subject to Sherman Act liability.|$|E

50|$|The law as <b>to</b> <b>{{petition}}s</b> {{of right}} applied to Ireland {{but not to}} Scotland, and a right to present such a petition was also thought to exist in colonies whose law {{was based on the}} common law of England. Ultimately, in many colonies legislation was passed with respect to claims against the government which made it unnecessary to resort <b>to</b> a <b>petition</b> of right.|$|R

5|$|The Lowell female textile workers {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> the Massachusetts Legislature {{and legislative}} committee hearings became an annual event. Although the initial {{push for a}} ten-hour workday was unsuccessful, the LFLRA continued to grow, affiliating with the New England Workingmen's Association and publishing articles in that organization's Voice of Industry, a pro-labor newspaper. This direct pressure forced the Board of Directors of Lowell's textile mills to reduce the workday by 30 minutes in 1847. The FLRA's organizing efforts spilled over into other nearby towns. In 1847, New Hampshire became {{the first state to}} pass a law for a ten-hour workday, although there was no enforcement and workers were often requested to work longer days. By 1848, the LFLRA dissolved as a labor reform organization. Lowell textile workers continued <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> and pressure for improved working conditions, and in 1853, the Lowell corporations reduced the workday to eleven hours.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1300, the port {{exported}} wheat, peas and beans to Ireland, France and Spain, and by 1400 was also exporting cloth from Somerset and the adjoining counties. By 1500 {{it was the}} largest port in Somerset, later becoming the fifth largest in England, until eclipsed by Bristol in the 18th century. In its heyday, imports included wine, grain, fish, hemp, coal and timber. Exports included wheat, wool, cloth, cement, bricks and tiles. Unlike Bristol, Bridgwater was never involved in the slave trade and, in 1797, was the first town in Britain <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> the government to ban it.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the trial}} judge had criticized the police investigation, Essex Police held an {{internal}} inquiry, conducted by Detective Chief Superintendent Dickinson. Bamber alleged this report confirmed that evidence had been withheld by the police, so he made a formal complaint, which was investigated in 1991 by the City of London Police. This process uncovered more documentation, which Bamber used <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> the Home Secretary in September 1993 for a referral back to the Court of Appeal, refused in July 1994.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his rule, Basiliscus showed his support for the Miaphysites. Zacharias Scholasticus reports how a group of Egyptian Miaphysite monks, having heard of Emperor Leo's death, had moved from Alexandria to Constantinople <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> Zeno in favour of Timothy, but at their arrival in the capital, they found the newly elected Basiliscus instead. The Magister Officiorum Theoctistus, the former physician of Basiliscus, was the brother of one of the monks, so the delegation obtained an audience with Basiliscus, and, with the support of Theoctistus and of the Empress, they convinced Basiliscus to recall from exile the banished Miaphysite Patriarchs.|$|E

5|$|Madison {{was deeply}} {{read in the}} history of {{government}} and used a range of sources in composing the amendments. The English Magna Carta of 1215 inspired the right <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> and to trial by jury, for example, while the English Bill of Rights of 1689 provided an early precedent for the right {{to keep and bear arms}} (although this applied only to Protestants) and prohibited cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|On 6 and 7 May 1945, Navy divers {{attempted}} {{to enter the}} wreck to recover the captain's safe and the papers within, but failed. Recreational divers first visited the site in 1953. In 1960 a recreational diver brought up a body from the wreck. This provoked former navy admirals and clergy <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> the US government for restrictions on disturbing the dead. The German crewman was buried with full military honors in Newport, Rhode Island. At least two recreational divers have died from exploring the wreckage.|$|E

5|$|The Free Press Clause protects {{publication}} of information and opinions, and applies {{to a wide variety}} of media. In Near v. Minnesota (1931) and New York Times v. United States (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected against prior restraintâ€”pre-publication censorshipâ€”in almost all cases. The Petition Clause protects the right <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> all branches and agencies of government for action. In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause, the Court has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of association.|$|E

5|$|An {{agreement}} was reached in 1984 between the Grand County Commission and the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) to balance the conflicting public demands to retire and preserve the aging bridge.

Grand County agreed <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> to have the bridge {{be included in the}} National Register of Historic Places, assume maintenance and guarantee the bridge would be preserved. The nomination was approved and the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1984.

5|$|As {{the merger}} of the AFL and NFL became {{effective}} in 1970, the unions agreed to meet {{for the first time}} in January of that year. The NFL players wanted Ed Meadorâ€”who was the president-elect of the NFLPA prior to the mergerâ€”to become president of the newly combined association while the AFL players wanted Jack Kemp. The compromise was John Mackey of the Baltimore Colts, an NFL team before the merger, which was grouped with former AFL teams in the American Football Conference. The AFL players agreed to Mackey's election on the condition that former AFL player Alan Miller would become general counsel. Though the NFL owners were open to recognizing the union, their representatives requested lawyers not be present during negotiations, something the players were unwilling to agree to. This prompted the players <b>to</b> <b>petition</b> the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for union certification.|$|E
