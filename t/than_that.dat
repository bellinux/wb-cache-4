5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– lower <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of iodine (2.66) {{and the same}} as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted {{to be on the}} hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That would be consistent with the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of hydrogen (2.2). The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E

Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the above}} formulations, most silver {{compounds}} have significant covalent character {{due to the}} small size and high first ionization energy (730.8kJ/mol) of silver. Furthermore, silver's Pauling electronegativity of 1.93 is higher <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of lead (1.87), and its electron affinity of 125.6kJ/mol is much higher <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of hydrogen (72.8kJ/mol) and not much less <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of oxygen (141.0kJ/mol). Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable organometallic compounds, forming linear complexes showing very low coordination numbers like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide as well as Zintl phases like the post-transition metals. Unlike the preceding transition metals, the +1 oxidation state of silver is stable {{even in the absence}} of π-acceptor ligands.|$|E

5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E
