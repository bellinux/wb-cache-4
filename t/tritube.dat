30|$|After {{instrumentation}} and stabilization, a {{trial of}} EVA using a 4.4  mm outer diameter, cuffed intratracheal catheter (<b>Tritube)</b> was performed to assure proper function {{of the system and}} determine hemodynamic effects in normovolemia in six of the subjects. The <b>Tritube</b> has three lumens: a 2.3  mm internal diameter lumen for ventilation, a distal port for monitoring intratracheal pressure, and a lumen for inflation/deflation of the cuff (Fig.  1). The <b>Tritube</b> was inserted through the endotracheal tube and the distal tip positioned above the tracheal origin of the right upper (cranial) lobe bronchus with bronchoscopic guidance. The <b>Tritube</b> was marked to assure equal depth of placement each time, and the inflated cuff created a closed system. Ventilation was initiated with an automated Ventrain device. During inspiration, the device delivers a constant rate of gas flow until the pressure measured {{at the end of the}} <b>Tritube</b> reaches a limit set by the user. The user also sets the ratio of inspiratory to expiratory times and the desired level of end-expiratory pressure. The EVA ventilator assists expiratory flow by producing a linear decline in intratracheal pressure until reaching the target end-expiratory pressure (Fig. 1). To confirm that the desired levels of negative end-expiratory pressure could be achieved, the target was progressively reduced from +[*] 4 to −[*] 8  cmH 2 O with minute ventilation kept constant. Each step lasted for ~[*] 8  min with FiO 2 of 1.0, and arterial blood gases measured. Afterward, the <b>Tritube</b> was removed, and conventional positive pressure ventilation with 4  cmH 20 PEEP resumed.|$|E
30|$|This {{study is}} a {{preliminary}} evaluation of a newly automated ventilation device. Theoretically, a clinical application for EVA might be for temporary use during hemorrhagic shock before resuscitation. If technical improvements allow, a clinician could quickly place the <b>Tritube</b> catheter into an endotracheal tube and temporarily use EVA. As soon as hemodynamic crisis resolves or the patient begins to make spontaneous breathing efforts, the catheter could be removed, and conventional ventilation resumed. However, {{it is essential to}} consider that despite the compelling physiologic rationale, other negative pressure ventilation strategies were not efficacious in clinical trials [21].|$|E
30|$|During {{conventional}} positive pressure ventilation, 40  ml/kg {{of blood}} was withdrawn from all eight subjects into heparinized bags over 30  min. Half the subjects continued on conventional positive pressure ventilation (9  cm 3 /kg, rate 12 – 13) with 0  cmH 20 PEEP, FiO 2 1.0. The other four subjects {{were placed on}} EVA after reinsertion of the <b>Tritube.</b> In the four subjects on EVA, the end-expiratory pressure was progressively reduced over 10  min to −[*] 8  cmH 2 O. One of the four EVA subjects had the end-expiratory pressure reduced to −[*] 10  cmH 20. During EVA, FiO 2 was kept at 1.0 and minute ventilation was adjusted by varying the peak inspiratory pressure, inspiratory flow rate, and the inspiratory to expiratory ratio. EVA was adjusted to continue the same minute ventilation used during conventional ventilation. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed at baseline (pre-hemorrhage), the end of hemorrhage (0 time, during conventional ventilation for both groups), and then at 20 -min intervals during shock. After 60  min, all subjects underwent a 20 -min resuscitation {{with a combination of}} shed blood and 5  cm 3 /kg of warmed lactated Ringers solution. Following resuscitation, the <b>Tritube</b> was removed in those receiving ventilation with EVA. For all animals, a recruitment maneuver of 40  cmH 20 for 10  s was performed, and conventional positive pressure ventilation with 4  cmH 20 PEEP and FiO 2 0.40 continued for another 90  min. Upon conclusion of the protocol, animals were euthanized with intravenous potassium chloride while deeply anesthetized.|$|E
