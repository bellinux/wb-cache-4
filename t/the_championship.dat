5|$|CMLL {{appeared}} to waver about the winner becoming the champion or just joining Stuka and Metro for a title match. CMLL's website indicated Delta won <b>the</b> <b>championship,</b> but Delta's team did not wear <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> belts {{prior to their}} first title match. Concurrent with the poll, CMLL started running an eight-team, three-week tournament to find new challengers for the new champions. Guadalajara regulars Palacio Negro, and Metal Blanco made their Mexico City debuts and qualified for the finals alongside Sagrado, but the team of Rush and the two poll losers, Ángel de Oro and Diamante, won the tournament and {{would go on to}} win <b>the</b> <b>championship.</b>|$|E
5|$|CMLL {{has been}} forced to declare <b>the</b> <b>{{champion}}ship</b> vacant four times.

In the case of Cien Caras, Steel, and Héctor Garza, their departures from the company were so sudden and unexpected that no plans were in place and CMLL had to organize a tournament to determine the next champion. In Máximo Sexy's case he was fired from the company while still the champion, causing <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> to be vacated as a result.|$|E

5|$|Guerrero Maya Jr. is {{the only}} wrestler to have two {{documented}} title reigns during the CMLL-era, as he previously held the titles with Delta. No team has held <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> more than once after it was brought back in 2000, but records indicate that team of Kung Fu and Kato Kung Lee held <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> {{on at least two}} separate occasions, possibly more. The current champions are also the shortest reigning champions of the modern age, , second to only to Namajague and Okumura's reign of 245 days, but will surpass that if they remain champions until August 28, 2017. Los Bombardieros reign is the longest of the modern age, 1,708 days although there were extended periods of time where <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> went undefended. Black Terry, who was 64 {{years old at the time}} of his title victory, is the oldest person to win the Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship.

The first champion, El Texano Jr., held the title for the shortest reign between August and December 2010, a total of 124 days. <b>The</b> <b>championship</b> has been vacated twice, first in 2011 when then-champion Shocker suffered a knee injury and was forced to give up <b>the</b> <b>championship.</b> In early 2015, CMLL vacated <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> once more, this time because champion Diamante Azul had not appeared at CMLL shows for several months. Current champion Hechicero was the first champion to defend <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> at a non-CMLL event as he defeated Caifan on November 27, 2016 in the main event of Lucha Memes Chairo 6 in Naucalpan, State of Mexico. Of all the champions El Texano Jr. and Shocker are the only champions to never have a successful championship defense. Diamante Azul's 628 day reign from 2013 to 2015 saw Diamante Azul successfully defend <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> five times, the most of any champion.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> was vacated after then-champion El Pantera lost <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> to Super Delfin {{while on}} tour in Japan. Pantera left CMLL for AAA after the tour, and lost {{a match to}} Super Delfin in Japan, {{intending}} to surrender <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> to him. CMLL knew that Pantera was leaving and nullified <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> change, choosing not to vacate the title rather than recognizing the title change. CMLL put together a 16-man tournament to crown a new champion, and Máscara Mágica defeated El Felino in the final to become the seventh official CMLL World Welterweight Champion. Máscara Mágica would later defeat Super Delfin {{to put an end}} to any questions about the lineage of <b>the</b> <b>championship.</b> In 1998 the Mexican National Welterweight Championship was returned to CMLL, making it a tertiary title behind the CMLL and NWA branded world championships. In 2010 CMLL returned the NWA World Welterweight Championship to the NWA but immediately replaced it with the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship. In early 2015then-champion Máscara Dorada signed a contract to work for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) for a year, with CMLL allowing him to take <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> with him to Japan.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the six-man tag team match became {{very popular in}} Mexico, {{to the point where}} that match format is the most {{prevalent}} format in Lucha Libre today. The Universal Wrestling Association created the UWA World Trios Championship in 1984 and the Boxing and Wrestling Commission created the Mexican National Trios Championship in 1985, making it only the second Trios championship in Mexico. Control of <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> was given to EMLL, the UWA's main rival at the time, with the commission retaining oversight and approval of <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> matches. In 1993 then champions Los Infernales ("The Infernal Ones"; MS-1, Pirata Morgan, and El Satánico) left EMLL to join AAA, taking the trios championship with them after approval by the commission. In the late 1990s <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> was not promoted on a regular basis by AAA and appeared inactive until the champions, Blue Panther, Fuerza Guerrera, and El Signo, joined CMLL in 2001 and lost <b>the</b> <b>championship</b> to a CMLL team.
