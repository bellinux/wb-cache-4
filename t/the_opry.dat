25|$|After leaving <b>the</b> <b>Opry,</b> Acuff {{spent several}} years touring the Western United States, {{although}} demand for his appearances dwindled {{with the lack of}} national exposure and the rise of musicians such as Ernest Tubb and Eddy Arnold, who were more popular with younger audiences. He eventually returned to <b>the</b> <b>Opry,</b> although by the 1960s, his record sales had dropped off considerably. After nearly losing his life in an automobile accident outside of Sparta, Tennessee, in 1965, Acuff pondered retiring, making only token appearances on <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> stage and similar shows, and occasionally performing duos with long-time bandmate Bashful Brother Oswald.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in November 1999, <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> {{was held}} at Ryman Auditorium for three months, {{partly due to the}} ongoing {{construction}} of Opry Mills. <b>The</b> <b>Opry</b> has returned to the Ryman for the three winter months every year since, allowing the show to acknowledge its roots while also taking advantage of a smaller venue during an off-peak season for tourism. While still officially the Grand Ole Opry, the shows there are billed as Opry At The Ryman. From 2002 to 2014, a traveling version of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular took up residence at the Grand Ole Opry House each holiday season while <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> was away. It was replaced by Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical beginning in 2015.|$|E

25|$|In May 2010, <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> House was flooded, {{along with}} much of Nashville, due to the Cumberland River {{overflowing}} its banks. While repairs were made, <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> itself remained uninterrupted. Over {{the course of the}} summer of 2010, the broadcast temporarily originated from alternate venues in Nashville, with Ryman Auditorium hosting the majority of the shows. Other venues included the TPAC War Memorial Auditorium, another former Opry home; TPAC's Andrew Jackson Hall; Nashville Municipal Auditorium; Allen Arena at Lipscomb University; and the Two Rivers Baptist Church.|$|E
25|$|On August 30, 1991, West was {{scheduled}} to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. Shortly after leaving her apartment at Nashville's Wessex Towers, West's car, a Chrysler New Yorker that Kenny Rogers had given her following {{the loss of her}} possessions at the IRS auction, stalled in front of the old Belle Meade theater on Harding Road. West's 81-year-old neighbor, George Thackston, spotted her {{on the side of the}} road and offered to drive her to <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> for her scheduled appearance. Frantic about getting to <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> on time, West had urged Thackston to speed.|$|E

25|$|Membership in <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> {{remains one}} of country music's {{crowning}} achievements. Such country music legends as Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Marty Robbins, Roy Acuff, the Carter family, Bill Monroe, Ernest Tubb, Kitty Wells, and Minnie Pearl became regulars on the Opry's stage. In recent decades, <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> has hosted such contemporary country stars as Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks, Reba McEntire, Josh Turner, Carrie Underwood, Brad Paisley, Rascal Flatts, Dierks Bentley, Little Big Town, Blake Shelton, Chris Young, and Ricky Skaggs. Since 1974, the show has been broadcast from the Grand Ole Opry House east of downtown Nashville, with an annual three-month winter foray back to the Ryman since 1999. Performances have been sporadically televised {{in addition to the}} radio programs.|$|E
25|$|The Ryman Auditorium {{was home}} to <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> until 1974. By the late 1960s, National Life & Accident desired a new, larger and more modern home for the long-running radio show. Ryman Auditorium, already 51 {{years old at the}} time <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> moved there, was {{beginning}} to suffer from disrepair as the downtown neighborhood around it fell victim to increasing urban decay. Despite these shortcomings, the show's popularity was increasing and its weekly crowds were outgrowing the 3,000-seat venue. The Oprys operators were seeking to build a new air-conditioned theatre with a greater capacity, ample parking, and the ability to easily serve as a television production facility. The ideal location would be in a less urbanized area of town, providing visitors a more controlled, safer, and more enjoyable experience.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Opry</b> House (March 28, 1929) was {{the first}} time in which Mickey wore his white gloves. Mickey wears them in almost all of his {{subsequent}} appearances and many other characters followed suit. The three lines on the back of Mickey's gloves represent darts in the gloves' fabric extending from between the digits of the hand, typical of glove design of the era.|$|E

5000|$|The McGee Brothers {{continued}} performing {{throughout the}} 1950s, {{both as a}} duo and occasionally as solo acts. During the folk revival of the late 1950s, the McGees were [...] "rediscovered", and experienced a brief resurgence in popularity. Folk song enthusiast Mike Seeger managed to reunite them with Arthur Smith in 1957, and the trio made several recordings. [...] The trio played at various folk music festivals throughout the 1960s, including a well-received performance at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. By the 1970s, the McGees were again playing primarily as a duo. They performed at <b>the</b> <b>Opry's</b> last Ryman Auditorium show on March 15, 1974, and as <b>the</b> <b>Opry's</b> senior members, {{were among the first}} acts to play at the show's new Opryland venue the following Saturday night. [...] Journalist Garrison Keillor, covering <b>the</b> <b>Opry's</b> move for <b>the</b> New Yorker, described the McGee Brothers' performance thus:It was the acoustic moment of the show, when the skies cleared and the weeping steels were silent and out of the clear blue came a little ole guitar duet. Stunning and simple, and so good after all the sound I'd hear that week...|$|R
25|$|In {{a bid to}} {{find more}} steady work, Kirby moved to Knoxville, Tennessee in 1934. Taking the stage name Pete Kirby, he played {{resonator}} guitar with local bands, among them Roy Acuff's Crazy Tennesseans, later to become the Smoky Mountain Boys. Acuff joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1938, and Kirby joined <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> with Acuff's band on New Year's Day 1939.|$|E
25|$|In April 1963 Opry {{management}} made a {{rule that}} members had to perform on at least 26 shows a year to keep their membership active. WSM dropped the number of required performances to 20 in January 1964; in 2000 the minimum number of Opry performances was at 12. The minimum number of performances has reduced over the years, but artists offered membership are expected to show a dedication to <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> with frequent attendance.|$|E
25|$|Nashville {{was once}} home of {{television}} {{shows such as}} Hee Haw and Pop! Goes the Country, as well as The Nashville Network and later, RFD-TV.

The show was well {{received}} by fans, performers, and management alike, and so the decision was made to host the Oprys regular shows there on January 15 & 16, 1999 as part of the celebration to commemorate 25 years at the new venue.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Martha White Foods {{sponsored}} the band's regular early morning radio shows on WSM in Nashville, where the duo sang the company's catchy bluegrass jingle written by Pat Twitty. About this time, country music television shows, on which Flatt and Scruggs appeared regularly, went into syndication, vastly increasing the group's exposure. Despite the groups increasing popularity and fan mail, WSM {{did not allow}} Flatt and Scruggs to become members of the Grand Ole Opry at first. According to Tennessean writer Peter Cooper, Bill Monroe was in opposition and worked {{behind the scenes to}} keep Flatt and Scruggs off <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> to the extent of having petitions made against their membership. In 1955 Martha White Foods' CEO Cohen E. Williams intervened by threatening to pull all of his advertising from WSM unless the band appeared on <b>the</b> <b>Opry</b> in the segment sponsored by his company. As years went by, the band became synonymous with Martha White {{to the extent that the}} advertising jingle itself became a hit, and the band rarely played a concert without it. Fans shouted requests for them to play it, even at Carnegie Hall.|$|E
25|$|Wills and His Texas Playboys {{began their}} first {{cross-country}} tour in November 1944, and {{appeared at the}} Grand Ole Opry on December 30, 1944.

Wills' band at the time consisted of two fiddlers, two bass fiddles, two electric guitars, an amplified electric steel guitar, and a trumpet, as well as the noted drums, which belonged to Wills' then drummer, who played in the Dixieland style.|$|E
50|$|Brasfield was {{recruited}} by George D. Hay for <b>the</b> Grand Ole <b>Opry</b> in 1944. With his trademark baggy suit, battered hat and rubbery face, {{he could make}} audiences laugh before he spoke a word. He soon became the primary comic on The Prince Albert Show, <b>the</b> <b>Opry’s</b> NBC Radio broadcast, playing off the show’s host, Red Foley. Assuming {{the role of a}} hapless hayseed, he often poked fun at country life - always with good humor.|$|R

25|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} factor in drawing {{visitors}} to Nashville is {{its association with}} country music. Many visitors to Nashville attend live performances of the Grand Ole Opry, the world's longest-running live radio show. The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum is another major attraction relating to the popularity of country music.

25|$|Following the {{departure}} of <b>the</b> <b>Opry,</b> Ryman Auditorium sat mostly vacant and decaying for twenty years. An initial effort by National Life & Accident {{to tear down the}} Ryman and use its bricks to build a chapel at Opryland USA was met with resounding resistance from the public, including the influential musicians of the time. The plans were abandoned, and the building remained standing with an uncertain future. Despite the absence of performances, the building still held such significance as an attraction that it would remain open for tours.|$|E
5000|$|Music {{entrepreneurs}} such as Roy Acuff (1903-1992) made Nashville {{the country}} music capital after World War II.
