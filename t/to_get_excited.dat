500|$|After {{finishing}} the album, Townsend stated {{the project was}} [...] "punishing" [...] and an [...] "absolute nightmare to complete" [...] due to amount of material against tight schedules. He also described the hardship of the project by telling [...] "if he {{was ever going to}} start drinking , the last months would have been it", but now [...] "he's starting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> again". Later, [...] "after the chaos of finishing it had subsided", Townsend stated he is really satisfied with the result.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with NME in 2014 whilst promoting his solo debut album Everyday Robots, Damon Albarn hinted at a collaborative project with Gallagher. Despite the years of animosity during Blur and Oasis' respective heyday, Albarn said: [...] "We’re talking. It’s not anything <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about yet. I mean, he’s doing his thing. He’s finishing a new record. I’ve got my record coming out, but the principle of us making music together is something, you know. It {{would be fair to}} say, we have discussed it at least once." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Canning of IGN {{did not think}} there was anything [...] "terrible" [...] about the episode, {{but he did not}} think there was anything <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about, either. Canning thought {{there were a number of}} throwaway jokes in the episode that he felt worked well, [...] "but the episode as a whole failed to grab me. As stated, there are a number of episodes that already fit this mold, and most of those are far superior." [...] Daniel Aughey of TV Guide thought the episode provided a [...] "healthy balance" [...] of humor, story and heart. [...] "Exactly what makes a great Simpsons episode!" [...] Aughey would have liked to see Homer's storyline explored as an A story in its own episode rather than cut short as a C story.|$|E
500|$|Hardcore Gamer Edward Dang was {{positive}} to the game, {{and hoped that}} {{it would lead to}} virtual reality releases of complete Danganronpa games. Jordan Devore at Destructoid thought that the game did not look exciting based on off-screen footage, but noted that this often is the case for virtual reality games, and thought that it [...] "could be the start of something neat". Chris Carter, also writing for Destructoid, enjoyed the game and called it worth playing, but not something <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> over due to its short length. Aki Otsuki at 4Gamer.net recommended the game, and said that experiencing the punishment sequence in virtual reality was horrifying. Famitsu liked the immersion given by the virtual reality and the 360-degree movements. Hiroaki Mabuchi at IGN Japan said that the new environment graphics were a great reproduction of their Trigger Happy Havoc counterparts, and that the mysterious atmosphere suited Danganronpa well.|$|E
500|$|Graphically, Wave Race 64 {{was praised}} for its fluid animations, {{realistic}} physics, clean waters, and textured polygons. IGN's Doug Perry commented, [...] "The {{way in which}} jetskis cut into the ocean's surface, lift off ramps, bounce into and off oncoming waves, or slide on icy surfaces is not only believable and engaging, but simply unparalleled." [...] Writing for The Electric Playground, Victor Lucas highlighted the game's distinct environments, saying that each course offers players something <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about. He also gave high marks to the game's satisfying sound effects, particularly when players submerge under the waves, but described the music as [...] "undeniably shallow". GamePro agreed, describing the music as juvenile and the announcer's voice as irritating. In contrast, AllGame's Jonti Davies felt that the game's [...] "cheesy" [...] and [...] "distinctly '80s theme" [...] soundtrack combined with the announcer's [...] "hyperexcited cries" [...] gives the game a light and arcade feel.|$|E

500|$|Carter, Duchovny and Anderson {{celebrated the}} 20th {{anniversary of the}} series at a July 18, 2013 panel at the San Diego Comic-Con hosted by TV Guide. During the discussion, Anderson {{discussed}} Scully's influence on female fans, relating {{that a number of}} women have informed her that they entered into careers in physics because of the character. Anderson also indicated that she was not in favor of an X-Files miniseries, and Duchovny ruled out working with her on an unrelated project, but both expressed willingness to do a third feature film. Carter was more reserved at the idea, stating, [...] "You need a reason <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about going on and doing it again." [...] The series attained a degree of historical importance, as well. On July 16, 2008, Carter and Spotnitz donated several props from the series and new film to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Some of the items included the original pilot script and the [...] "I Want to Believe" [...] poster from Mulder's office.|$|E
500|$|Daniel Montesinos-Donaghy of Den of Geek stated [...] "After the {{excellent}} pilot episode, 'Day One' {{is both a}} step forward and a step backward. As silly as {{the idea of a}} nymphomaniac extra-terrestrial gas is, the cast throw themselves into it with aplomb, quipping their way to the relatively gripping conclusion." [...] Patrick Holm of Total Sci-Fi felt that the second episode [...] "equates the word 'adult' with sex and swearing – more of a playground definition than a serious drama. In the conclusion of his review, Jonathan Capps of Noise to Signal felt that the episode was [...] "certainly nothing <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about, but I think it won't be too indicative of later episodes, as we're still getting to know these characters, and that has to take the fore in the first few episodes. However, Chris' [...] painfully simplistic, heavy-handed and often clichéd interpretation of sci-fi (some of Jack's techno-babble is frankly embarrassing) could prove to be a worrying factor later in the series." [...] A reviewer of TV Fodder felt [...] "Day One" [...] was a [...] "great second episode", adding [...] "there doesn't seem to be anything I don't like about this show".|$|E
500|$|For the PlayStation version, IGN's David Zdyrko cited that [...] "Many of {{the games}} are quite enjoyable, {{but the truth of}} the matter is that it never quite matches the thrill of the real thing" [...] and criticized on how [...] "the visuals are very bland on the whole. It has low-resolution backgrounds, and pretty much nothing at all <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about". He also called the music [...] "boring and {{completely}} uninspiring". Allgame editor Matt Grandstaff commended the card games, as they [...] "require a fair amount of strategy, and thus remain entertaining" [...] and that [...] "the look and feel of Caesars Palace 2000 recaptures the feel of one of the most successful casinos of all-time". He stated that the game [...] "is definitely not about the looks" [...] but [...] "does an admirable job recreating the casino experience". Grandstaff felt that the game [...] "has the sound of a real casino. From background clatter to the voices of the dealer, this is Caesar's Palace". He noted that players [...] "will enjoy sitting through hours of card games" [...] but to [...] "Avoid the slots". Grandstaff also commented that the strategy book that comes with the game [...] "should be packed on any trip to Vegas".|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film 2.5 out of 4, saying [...] "This isn't a great heist movie {{for a lot}} of reasons, {{beginning}} with the stupidity of its heist plan and the impossibility of these characters ever being successful at anything more complex than standing in line," [...] but appreciated that the comedy did not [...] "go heavy on the excremental, the masturbatory and symphonies of four-letter words", calling it [...] "funny in an innocent screwball kind of way." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum called the film [...] "overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky," [...] and praised Murphy, saying [...] "when Murphy is on screen, his comedic vigor... gooses the movie's energy level... but whenever Murphy wanders off, the movie's pulse rate drops. Tower Heist is in effect two movies: One belongs to Murphy, the other {{to the rest of the}} cast." [...] Time Out Londons Trevor Johnston said that [...] "though it's hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> by this amiable potboiler, Tower Heist is so at home with its limitations it's equally hard to dislike," [...] but criticized the finale [...] "which might have been a bit more tense had we been able to take it remotely seriously." [...] Conversely, Time Out New Yorks David Fear gave it 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "one nail-biting moment and some much-missed Murphy mouthiness won't keep you from feeling like you're the one being ripped off." ...|$|E
500|$|Side B of {{the album}} begins with [...] "Psycho Therapy", which was written by both Johnny and Dee Dee; the song has since grown {{into one of the}} most popular Ramones' song. Dee Dee recalled: [...] "I knew we needed a real 'Ramones song' for the album, and I knew [...] was {{depressed}} about how things were going. He needed that song <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about the band again." [...] The next track is another cover song, [...] "Time Has Come Today", which was originally recorded by the soul music group The Chambers Brothers. The Ramones' version of the song featured a psychedelic rock influence, and was said by Eddy to have more of a [...] "garage" [...] feel to it, as compared to the original. [...] "My-My Kind of a Girl" [...] was directed specifically toward the band's female fandom. The lyrics were written by Joey about meeting a girl on 8th Street in Manhattan and wanting to spend his life with her. In Vanity Fair, the song was regarded as [...] a [...] "lingering affection for Phil Spector's pop grandeur." [...] Dee Dee's [...] "Time Bomb", which was track number eleven, was said by True to be [...] "more ridiculous than frightening." [...] The album concludes with [...] "Everytime I Eat Vegetables It Makes Me Think of You", which was said by author Todd Anderson to be a [...] "sing along." ...|$|E
500|$|Kneale's concept {{concerned}} [...] "the {{world of}} the future, {{and a way of}} keeping the population happy without being active". According to Kneale, the notion for the play came from the [...] "worldwide dread of populations exploding out of all control" [...] leading him to devise a world where pornography hooks the population [...] "on a substitute for sex rather than the real thing and so keeping the population down". Kneale was also influenced by the dropout counterculture of the late 1960s, recalling [...] "I didn't like the Sixties at all because of the whole thing of 'let it all hang out' and let's stop thinking [...] which was the all too frequent theme of the Sixties which I hated". Dissatisfaction with the youth culture of the time was a preoccupation of Kneale's—in the mid-sixties he had worked on The Big, Big, Giggle, an unmade script about a teenage suicide cult, and following The Year of the Sex Olympics he returned to the theme of youth out of control in his 1969 play Bam! Pow! Zapp!, and in the fourth and final Quatermass serial in 1979. Many cultural icons of the youth movement, including members of The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Monty Python, were fans of Kneale's work. For The Year of the Sex Olympics Kneale extrapolated the possible consequences of the youth movement's desire for freedom from [...] "traditional" [...] cultural inhibitions, asking as the academic John R. Cook puts it, [...] "In a world of no limits, will the result quickly be apathy if there is nothing any more <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about, nothing precious or illicit to fight for in the teeth of the censor?".|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} twelve, Marcus {{would have}} been ready for {{secondary}} education, under the grammatici. Two of his teachers at this age are known: Andro, a [...] "geometrician and musician"; and Diognetus, a painting-master. Marcus thought of Diognetus {{as more than a}} mere painter, however. He seems to have introduced Marcus to the philosophic way of life. Marcus writes that Diognetus taught him [...] "to avoid passing enthusiasms; to distrust the stories of miracle-workers and impostors about incantations and exorcism of spirits and such things; not to go cock-fighting or <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about such sports; to put up with outspokenness; and to become familiar with philosophy" [...] and [...] "to write philosophical dialogues in my boyhood". In April 132, at the behest of Diognetus, Marcus took up the dress and habits of the philosopher: he studied while wearing a rough Greek cloak, and would sleep on the ground until his mother convinced him to sleep on a bed.|$|E
2500|$|Jay Merrick of The Independent {{said that}} [...] " [...] sculptural power {{lies in its}} ability to suggest an {{unfinished}} form in the process of becoming something else", describing how its artistic riskiness elevated it above the banal artworks of the public art movement that have been built elsewhere in Britain's towns and cities. Merrick was of the opinion that it would be either loved or hated, being a design which is [...] "beautifully fractious, and not quite knowable". Jonathan Glancey of The Guardian described Orbit as [...] "Olympian in ambition" [...] and a [...] "fusion between striking art and daring engineering", and said that, the Aquatics Centre apart, it represented the architecturally striking Joker in the pack, given {{that the rest of the}} landscaping and architecture for the Games [...] "promises little <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> about". He believed it would become a [...] "genuine eyecatcher" [...] for the Olympics television coverage, with its extraordinary form being a [...] "strange and enticing marriage of sorts" [...] between the Eiffel Tower and the un-built early Soviet era Tatlin's Tower, with the biblical Tower of Babel as [...] "best man".|$|E

[...] On February 15, 2014, during the NBA All-Star Weekend festivities at Sprite's NBA All-Star concert at the House of Blues in New Orleans, Lil Wayne appeared as a special guest during Drake's set and performed various hits. Wayne and Drake then broke the news that Tha Carter V is set to be released on May 5, 2014. However, on March 27, 2014, Wayne's manager Cortez Bryant, would announce the album had been delayed.|$|E

2500|$|When Milner was 10 years old, {{he joined}} the Leeds United Academy after being spotted by a scout while playing for Westbrook Juniors in Horsforth. At the academy, Milner played against contemporaries from other clubs in the north, {{including}} future Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney. His role model was Leeds-born Alan Smith, who was then a Leeds United striker. Milner believed playing with Smith put him through a learning curve, as Smith had done what Milner aspired to do; that is, {{to come through the}} academy and play for the first team. Having made good progress at the Academy, Milner was taken on as a trainee after leaving school. However, his father insisted that he attend college once a week to continue his education. Milner remarked later {{that he did not want}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> and think that he had [...] "made it". He also said he could hardly believe he was playing alongside first-team Leeds players such as David Batty and Olivier Dacourt. He continued to excel in the youth team, and played for England at under-15 and under-17 levels. He helped the England under-17 team win the 2002 Nationwide summer tournament against Italy, Czech Republic and Brazil, scoring a goal against the latter. Milner claims to have never consumed alcohol throughout his life, despite pressures from those around him when he was growing up.|$|E
2500|$|Dom Pérignon was {{a staunch}} {{advocate}} of aggressive pruning, dictating that vines should grow {{no higher than}} [...] and produce small yields. Harvesting was to be done early in the morning, when it was very cool, and every care was {{to be taken to}} keep the grapes intact. Grapes that were bruised or broken were rejected. Mules and donkeys were favored over horses to transport the grapes to the press houses since they were less likely <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>excited</b> and possibly damage the grapes. Dom Pérignon desired the grapes to be pressed as quickly and efficiently as possible to minimize the possibility of the grapeskins leaching into the juice. A distinction was made between the different levels of pressings. The first press, done completely by the weight of the grapes on top of each other, produced the highest quality wine, known as the vin de goutte. The second and third pressings, done with weight being applied, produced wine of good but not exceptional quality. The fourth and fifth pressings, the vin de taille and vins de pressoir, were of darker colors and would not be used at all. In addition to adding the pinkish/grey coloring, Dom Pérignon knew that the skins imparted different flavoring and coarser textures than he wanted in his high quality wines. His emphasis on limiting skin contact helped the Abbey of Hautvillers to produce truly white wine from red wine grapes.|$|E
