Ross was {{responsible}} for prohibiting David Banner from his lab work after learning of his dangerous experiments. Elliott felt his performance was similar to his portrayal of Basil L. Plumley in We Were Soldiers. Elliott accepted the role without reading the script, being simply <b>too</b> <b>excited</b> to work with Ang Lee. In addition Elliot also researched Hulk comic books for the part.|$|E
5|$|Linden's long tenure {{with the}} Canucks (Linden holds second most games played in {{franchise}} history at 1,140), deep attachment {{to the city of}} Vancouver and history of charitable community service and involvement have {{made him one of the}} most beloved and respected players among fans {{in franchise history}}. His 2001 return to the Canucks was an emotional event for fans and players alike, with Linden admitting that he was <b>too</b> <b>excited</b> to sleep the night before his first game back. He is still often referred to affectionately as 'Captain Canuck', despite not having captained the team since 1997. On April 5, 2008, the Canucks' final game of the 2007–08 season, the Vancouver crowd gave Linden a standing ovation before the start of the third period. Once the game ended, the crowd again rose to their feet in recognition of Linden.|$|E

His uncle was the World War II general Otto Hitzfeld.|$|E

The Canadiens stocked their team with francophone stars including Newsy Lalonde, Georges Poulin and Didier Pitre. Before being allowed to play, Pitre had to resolve a lawsuit with the Montreal Nationals, to whom he was already under contract.|$|E

Massa stated that the race win was lost [...] "because of traffic", while teammate Räikkönen stated he was [...] "much happier with the car", as {{he became the first}} Finn to win the race. Kubica was a lonely fourth, with Fisichella, Heidfeld, Alonso and Button rounding out the points.

500|$|Leopold's physician-in-ordinary, Christian Stockmar (later, as Baron Stockmar, {{advisor to}} both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert), wrote {{that in the}} first six months of the marriage, he had never seen Charlotte wear {{anything}} that was not simple and in good taste. [...] He also noted that she was much more calm and in control of herself than she used to be, and attributed this to Leopold's influence. [...] Leopold wrote later, [...] "Except when I went out to shoot, we were together always, and we could be together, we did not tire."

500|$|Before {{beginning}} work, {{the development}} team commissioned {{two pieces of}} music that they felt would inspire the right emotional tone for the game to guide their efforts. They created a number of prototypes, including concepts focused on growing flowers and based around human consciousness. The team decided that a prototype centered on petals floating in the wind best captured the emotions they wanted to evoke. They made keeping the player in a peaceful emotional state their design focus, and removed elements that frustrated players such as petal collection requirements to unlock levels and game mechanics that were too traditional and made the players <b>too</b> <b>excited.</b> The team tried to not place any barriers in the levels, allowing the player to go anywhere in an open world, but realized that without a few guidelines, such as the camera focusing on new flowers or segmenting the levels, players became confused and frustrated. Chen described the process as [...] "almost like we wanted to throw away the traditional game design, but we end up picking up all the pieces we threw away and putting them back because we know those are actually needed to deliver a good guided experience". The overall development time was two years, but the team spent three quarters of {{that time in the}} prototyping stage. After deciding on the game elements, Flower was produced in only six months.|$|E

Playing the guitar-shaped keyboard, she flubbed her line once and admitted it right away — 'I'm getting <b>too</b> <b>excited</b> (that) I forgot my lines,' she said — but the moment made the experience personal." [...] On the second night of Gaga's show in the Philippines, she addressed the controversy directly before a slow-tempo version of [...] "Hair". While playing the piano she stated that she is aware of the issues around her image and music, she emphasized that she respects all kinds of religion, people and culture – including Filipino culture. She also said that she respects that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but stressed [...] "What I don’t respect is homophobia and hatred…I reject intolerance to the gay community." [...] This drew cheers from the audience. She {{went on to say that}} she is aware some are using her name to spread hatred but intended to counter this by continuing to spread [...] "positivity" [...] in her own way.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no further}} attempt at {{conversation}} after this. The near presence of large game was <b>too</b> <b>exciting,</b> so that merely {{a word of}} advice, direction, or inquiry, passed as the party advanced rapidly--one {{or two of the}} most active going before as pioneers.|$|R

In mid-January 1954, the Pittsburgh Pirates held a workout for incoming rookies and younger players, in which Koback took part.

Upon landing and getting off the helicopter, Joplin was approached by reporters asking her questions. She deferred them to Caserta as she was <b>too</b> <b>excited</b> to speak. Initially Joplin was eager to get on the stage and perform, but was repeatedly delayed as bands were contractually obliged to perform ahead of Joplin.

2500|$|On November 21, 2011, the U.S. {{government}} filed {{a lawsuit}} in Federal District Court in California against Hammer to obtain a court judgment on his unpaid taxes for years 1996 and 1997.

Hammer owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $779,585 in back taxes from his earnings dating back to 1996–1997 - during the years Hammer was believed to be facing his worst financial problems.

However, the District Court ruled against Hammer.

2500|$|The {{pilot was}} filmed at Stage 8 of Desilu Cahuenga studios, the same studio where The Dick Van Dyke Show was filmed (this {{was seen by}} the crew as a good omen), and was {{recorded}} at Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood. The pilot was first screened {{to a group of}} two dozen NBC executives in Burbank, California in early 1989. It didn't yield the explosion of laughter garnered by the pilots for the decade's previous NBC successes like The Cosby Show and The Golden Girls. Brandon Tartikoff, was not convinced that the show would work. A Jewish man from New York himself, Tartikoff characterized it as [...] "Too New York, too Jewish". Test audiences were even harsher. NBC's practice at the time was to recruit 400 households by phone to ask them to evaluate pilots it aired on an unused channel on its cable system. An NBC research department memo summarized the pilot's performance among the respondents as [...] "Weak", which Littlefield called [...] "a dagger to the heart". Comments included, [...] "You can't get <b>too</b> <b>excited</b> about two guys going to the laundromat"; [...] "Jerry's loser friend George isn't a forceful character"; [...] "Jerry needs a stronger supporting cast"; and [...] "Why are they interrupting the stand-up for these stupid stories?"
