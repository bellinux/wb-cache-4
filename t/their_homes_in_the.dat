5|$|The {{violence}} was worse in Huế, where {{the approach of}} government forces was met by the beating of Buddhist drums and cymbals to alert the populace. The townsfolk left <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of the night}} in an attempt to defend the city's pagodas. At Từ Đàm, the temple of Buddhist protest leader Thích Trí Quang, monks attempted to burn the coffin of a monk who had self-immolated recently. Government soldiers, firing M1 rifles, overran the pagoda and confiscated the coffin. They demolished a statue of Gautama Buddha and looted and vandalized the pagoda. They then set off an explosion, leveling much of the pagoda. Many Buddhists were shot, beheaded, confiscated, and clubbed to death.|$|E
5|$|That night Morgan's men camped at Frakes' Mill {{just north}} of Mauckport. They found the area deserted, as all the civilians had fled <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> house where Morgan stayed, the table was set with supper which {{he and his men}} ate before resting for the night. Morgan's men tapped the {{telegraph}} lines again and began sending false reports that they were headed for New Albany. The disinformation dissuaded New Albany's Legion leaders from sending the large number of reinforcements to Corydon that they had been organizing. The next morning the Confederates resumed their march northward. As they passed up a county road, a shot was fired killing a soldier. The scouts opened fired on a nearby house from which they assumed the shot had come, killing a Lutheran minister and wounding his son.|$|E
5|$|Along the Kanto Plain near Tokyo, Thad wrecked 22houses, damaged 31 bridges, damaged {{roads in}} 145places, and flooded 27rivers. According to police reports, five {{individuals}} drowned and six others were initially reported missing in Suzaka, because of flooding {{from the nearby}} Ayu River that crushed houses along the bank. In Akita, a fishing boat with nine people aboard was capsized by strong winds; all nine were rendered as missing by police. Elsewhere, one person {{was killed by a}} falling tree and a fisherman drowned when his boat overturned. In the Ibaraki Province, just north of Tokyo, officials ordered the evacuation of 5,000dwellings in the city of Ryugasaki, 2,500 of which were flooded. After the nearby Kogai River threatened to overflow their banks, over 1,000families were evacuated. Another 4,000families were evacuated in Fujishiro, though by August25, the majority of the evacuated had returned to <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> island of Hokkaido, air service was suspended; damage was severe in the area.

5|$|In {{the time}} after myth, most gods {{were said to}} be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world. Temples were their main means of contact with humanity. Each day, it was believed, the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples, <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human world. There they {{inhabited}} the cult images, the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals. This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth. As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities, the god in a city's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region. Deities' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over. Many gods had more than one cult center, and their local ties changed over time. They could establish themselves in new cities, or their range of influence could contract. Therefore, a given deity's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin. The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity. When kings from Thebes took control of the country at start of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC), they elevated Thebes' patron gods—first the war god Montu and then Amun—to national prominence.|$|E
