5|$|The next match, between The Big Boss Man and Nailz, was a nightstick on a pole match. A nightstick was {{suspended}} above {{the ring and}} {{could be used as}} a weapon once it was retrieved. Nailz began the match by attempting to get the nightstick, but Boss Man stopped him. Nailz choked Boss Man before making another unsuccessful attempt <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> pole and obtain the nightstick. Boss Man punched Nailz and then tried <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> pole. Nailz stopped him, performed a back body drop, and choked Boss Man again. Boss Man regained control but missed a splash, which gave Nailz another chance to retrieve the nightstick. Both men clotheslined each other, but Boss Man recovered first and got the nightstick. He hit Nailz with it, but Nailz took it and used it against Boss Man. Boss Man performed the Boss Man slam, his finishing move, before pinning Nailz to win the match.|$|E
5|$|The {{slopes of}} Licancabur are {{unstable}} {{and prone to}} rock falls. Some of the instability {{may be due to}} earthquakes, snow, wind or geothermal effects (resulting in thermal stress), and it frustrated a 1920s attempt by a Chuquicamata engineer <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> mountain.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{mountain}}eers dressed in Alpine costumes used <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> mountain in early years, and eight divers {{between the ages}} 17 and 24 would dive off the waterfall. In the second season, all eight were Canadians who had competed in major diving competitions. Their schedule was six shows a day on every other day. The dive is 58 feet, and the pool is 13 feet deep in the centre and only 7 feet deep at the edges. At {{the end of the}} dive, they were descending at 40 miles per hour.|$|E

According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> stage.|$|E
5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior.

Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E

5|$|The Queen's Diamond Jubilee {{procession}} on 22 June 1897 {{followed a}} route six miles long through London and included troops {{from all over}} the empire. The procession paused for an open-air service of thanksgiving held outside St Paul's Cathedral, throughout which Victoria sat in her open carriage, to avoid her having <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> steps to enter the building. The celebration was marked by vast crowds of spectators and great outpourings of affection for the 78-year-old Queen.|$|E
5|$|The {{first person}} <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> {{mountain}} was Thomas Gerdine, {{along with a}} group of United States Geological Survey scientists, Sam Strom, A. H. Dubor, and Darcy Bard, in 1897. The volcano is also available to skiers. To reach the mountain itself, it takes 5 miles of walking along the White Chuck River Trail (Forest Service Trail No. 643) and up the Sitkum Glacier. The trail is reached via Forest Service Road No. 23. Mainly, the slopes consist of black diamonds for both the ascent and descent.|$|E
5|$|The troops {{tasked with}} {{isolating}} Fort Lahtzanit began crossing the canal in dinghies at 2:15p.m.. Ten minutes later {{they reached the}} east bank and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> sand wall. They succeeded in attracting Israeli fire, thereby facilitating the main assault force in its mission to attack the fort later on. The troops tasked with isolating the fort from the east reached and occupied a firing ramp prepared for tanks, and raised the Egyptian flag over it. This severely demoralized the Israeli soldiers inside Fort Lahtzanit. Soon after the Sa'iqa company (less one platoon) arrived at the firing ramp as well.|$|E

5|$|A.J. Styles {{went on to}} Destination X {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship in an Ultimate X Challenge match. An Ultimate X Challenge match has three stages. Stage one {{involves}} the four men being paired up into two tag teams and having a standard tag team match, with {{the person who is}} pinned being eliminated from the bout. Then it becomes a standard match involving three people, with the one being pinned in that phase being eliminated from the match. The final two then fight <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> ropes and retrieve the championship that hangs in the middle. The participants were announced for the match on the March 11 episode of Impact!, with Elix Skipper and Ron Killings being added to face Styles. The final participant was determined in a match that pitted Christopher Daniels against Chris Sabin, which Daniels won. Styles would lose the championship to Daniels at the event.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast Hepburn in The Little Minister (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, {{in an attempt to}} repeat the success of Little Women. There was no such recurrence, and the picture was a {{commercial}} failure. The romantic drama Break of Hearts (1935) with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money. After three forgettable films, success returned to Hepburn with Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> social ladder. Hepburn loved the book and was delighted to be offered the role. The film was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination. She received the second most votes, after winner Bette Davis.|$|E
5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E

5|$|Hazel and Augustus {{arrive in}} Amsterdam and are {{presented}} with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner without Van Houten knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers {{to a piece of}} fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the Anne Frank House, where Hazel struggles <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> house's many stairs. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, a six-foot slab of {{fiberglass}} {{from the}} imitation wax {{at the top}} of the candle was knocked loose by 50 mile-per-hour winds during a storm. Nobody was injured. James Pruznick, a filmmaker from Pohatcong Township, New Jersey, made a documentary film in 2004 focused on that year's assembly of the Peace Candle, as well as interviews with politicians, artists, merchants and construction workers about the history of the structure. It was first screened in December 2004 and made available subsequently on VHS and DVD. In October 2008, fear grew that the Peace Candle would no longer be erected when Easton employees who previously volunteer <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> Peace Candle structure no longer wished to assemble it. Those fears were put to rest the next month, however, when the trade union Lehigh Valley Erectors Inc. volunteered to put the candle up.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} to the editor in Aftenposten on 17 June, {{submitted}} by Robert M. Steen, it was suggested that reaching the ledge would be a suitable challenge for the mountaineering association Norsk Tindeklub. The newspaper contacted the club, and offered to cover all expenses. The club sent Boye Schlytter and Henning Tønsberg to Bergen, where they joined forces with police officer Hermann Heggenes and photographer and firefighter Alf Adriansen. The expedition was led by Balchen, arriving with the BSD vessel Vulcanus. Arne Næss, Jr. had just used bolts <b>to</b> <b>climb</b> <b>the</b> Dolomites, and these had been lent to Tønsberg. As such, it was the first time bolts were used for climbing in Norway.|$|E
