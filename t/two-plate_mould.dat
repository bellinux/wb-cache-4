A SEBS-based thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) was moulded over polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) to produce a hybrid microfluidic structure with an aspect ratio of 2. The process chain implemented micro-milling for fabricating micro-structured tool inserts, and mu IM and micro-overmoulding was used for replication. A <b>two-plate</b> <b>mould</b> was used for moulding the substrate, whilst a three-plate mould with a replaceable insert was used for TPE overmoulding. The presented application was an interconnect system for a microfluidic device, which enabled direct fitting of standard tubes into microfluidic substrates. A leakage test showed that the interconnection was leak-proof within a range of flow rates between 0. 32 and 0. 62 ml min(- 1) ...|$|E
