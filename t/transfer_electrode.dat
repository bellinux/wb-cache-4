Surprisingly, genes for putative cell-electrode connections, such as outer-surface cytochromes and pili, which are highly expressed in current-producing biofilms, were not highly expressed in current-consuming biofilms.

The slow step may be partial removal of AN from the solvated Cu (I) ion prior to electron <b>transfer.</b> <b>Electrode</b> processes are faster in chloride ions than in sulfate ion solutions. Reduction of Cu (I) in AN−H 2 O is quite slow on glassy carbon. Adsorption of AN on platinum and carbon influences the processes.

For cases involving Fe and Co unusually large values of enthalpies (ΔH‡ exp) and entropies (ΔS‡exp) of activation as well as values of electrode half-reaction entropies (ΔS Orc) are determined from measurements of the temperature dependence of electrochemical rate constants (ks,h) and formal electrode potentials (EO′). This work examines the possibility that these anomolous parameters reflect the influence of either coupled inner- and outer-shell reorganizations or spin multiplicity changes that accompany electron <b>transfer.</b> <b>Electrode</b> half-reaction entropies, ΔSO rc are measured for four M(tacn) 23 +/ 2 + (M = Fe, Ni, Co, Ru; tacn = 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane) redox couples as a function of solvent and electrolyte type and concentration. These couples undergo differing amounts of inner-shell reorganization as a result of electron transfer and thereby serve to probe the possibility of coupling between inner and outer-shell reorganizations. Values of ΔSOrc are observed to be metal dependent and are shown to arise primarily from vibrational and electronic contributions to intramolecular entropy. Entropy measurements are referenced to the Ru 3 +/ 2 + couple, which is characterized by small inner-shell reorganization and should be controlled mostly by outer-shell effects. Values of Δ(ΔSOrc) M-Ru obtained from data in seven solvents are roughly solvent independent indicating that, if inner- and outer-shell reorganizations are coupled during electron transfer, this fact is not reflected in the solvent dependence of ΔS Orc. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology {{makes it possible}} to manufacture the miniaturized fuel cell systems for application in portable electronic devices. The majority of research on micro-scale fuel cells is aimed at micro-power applications. There are many new miniaturized applications which can only be realized if a higher energy density power source is available compared to button cells and other small batteries. In small-scale applications, the fuel cell should be exceptionally small and have highest energy density. One way to achieve these requirements is to reduce the thickness of the cell (compacted-design) for increasing the volumetric power density of a fuel cell power supply. A novel, simple to construct, air-breathing micro-structured PEM fuel cell which work in still or slowly moving air has been developed. The novel geometry enables optimum air access to the cathode without the need for pumps, fans or similar devices.

The potential application {{in the near}} future {{is likely to be a}} sustainable process for waste water treatment, stand-alone sensors for long-term operations in low accessibility regions, mobile robot/sensor platforms and renewable energy systems. Conductive materials inside anode and cathode chambers of MFC, assume a fundamental key point for the overall MFC performance. Electrode materials vary in their physical and chemical properties, thus, they also vary in their impact on microbial selection attachment, electron <b>transfer,</b> <b>electrode</b> resistance and the rate of electrode surface reaction. Therefore, in order to promote electrons transfer, the electrode materials should have the following properties: good electrical conductivity, strong biocompatibility, chemical stability and high anti-corrosion, large surface area and adequate mechanical force. In this way, to render MFCs into a cost-effective and energy sustainable technology, efforts have been done to increase power generation. In this respect, focus on low cost commercial materials and up-grade of electrode surface characteristics, in terms of electrical conductivity and morphology structure represent a high challenging task. For this reason, in this work commercial carbon felt has been used as anode electrode after satisfactory pre-treatments. Acid treatment by HNO 3 soaking and polyaniline deposition have been made on carbon felt before to test in MFC. Tests have been conducted by a two-compartment laboratory prototype of MFC under the same operation conditions using Saccaromyces cerevisiae as active microorganisms, varying only the anode electrode: 1) Carbon felt, 2) Carbon felt previously treated by HNO 3 and 3) Carbon felt with PANI depositions. Electrochemical experiments were carried out to determine how the nitric acid and PANI depositions affected the performance of carbon felt material. Results obtained using Linear Sweep Voltammetry technique shows an increase of performance in terms of power density for both pre-treatment processes. Commercial carbon felt material showed a power density of 12 mW L- 1, while carbon felt treated by HNO 3 and PANI depositions showed a power density of 32 mW L- 1 and 35 mW L- 1, respectively. The increase of the performance of carbon felt material by HNO 3 soaking, can be related to an increases of the surface roughness which favour the adhesion of microorganisms, while taking into account the electro-catalytic properties of polyaniline surface, improvement of current generation seems be due to the increase of the carbon source oxidation.
