5|$|As {{cinematic}} {{director of}} The Battle for Middle-earth II, Richard Taylor {{was responsible for}} designing the game's opening and closing sequences, as well as campaign and mission introductions and endings. As the first Electronic Arts video game to be given free rein on material from The Lord of the Rings universe, several lands, characters, and creatures from the books appear visually {{for the first time}} in the game's cut scenes. Taylor considered it essential to use good graphical and audio combinations when telling a story, and he was pleased to have Weaving on <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>as</b> the primary storyteller.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{producing}} electricity, the dam {{is intended}} to increase the Yangtze River's shipping capacity and reduce the potential for floods downstream by providing flood storage space. China regards <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>as</b> monumental {{as well as a}} success socially and economically, with the design of state-of-the-art large turbines, and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions. However, the dam flooded archaeological and cultural sites and displaced some 1.3million people, and is causing significant ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides. The dam has been controversial both domestically and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Bomis created Nupedia {{as a free}} online {{encyclopedia}} (with content {{submitted by}} experts) {{but it had a}} tedious, slow review process. Wikipedia was initially launched by Bomis to provide content for Nupedia, and was a for-profit venture (a Bomis subsidiary) through the end of 2002. As the costs of Wikipedia rose with its popularity, Bomis' revenues declined as result of the dot-com crash. Since Wikipedia was a drain on Bomis' resources, Wales and philosophy graduate student Larry Sanger decided to fund <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>as</b> a charity; Sanger was laid off from Bomis in 2002. Nupedia content was merged into Wikipedia, and it ceased in 2003.|$|E

5|$|Castro was {{initially}} disappointed with <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>as</b> {{he did not}} want to solely imitate José's vocals, Ferrer's absence and his desire to record Jose's lesser known songs. According to Castro, it was the decisions of the executive producers of his record label, Universal Music Latino, to only have Botija produce the album and to record José José's more recognized songs. He later retracted his statement, commending Botija and referred to the disc as his best, only lamenting he could not record José's lesser known songs. José expressed satisfaction with the result.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Westside MAX {{project began}} in 1993. In November 1996, Hillsboro and TriMet named the yet-to-be-completed {{station at the}} western end of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>as</b> the Mark O. Hatfield Government Center Station. Hatfield was {{retiring}} from 30 years as U.S. Senator and previously used his political clout as Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee to ensure funding for the project. In June 1998, after completion of the station but prior to its opening, government officials held a dedication ceremony at the station. Retired U. S. Senator Mark Hatfield was in attendance as the station was officially dedicated in his honor.|$|E
5|$|David Rockefeller, {{president}} of Chase Manhattan Bank, who envisioned a World Trade Center for lower Manhattan, realizing he needed public funding {{in order to}} construct the massive project, approached Tobin. Although many questioned the Port Authority's entry into the real estate market, Tobin saw <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>as</b> a way to enhance the agency's power and prestige, and agreed to the project. The Port Authority was the overseer of the World Trade Center, hiring the architect Minoru Yamasaki and engineer Leslie Robertson.|$|E

5|$|However, a {{shortage}} of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in <b>the</b> <b>project.</b> <b>As</b> a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project {{in its current form}} was officially abandoned, and a PHP5.4 release was prepared containing most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP6, such as traits and closure re-binding. Initial hopes were that a new plan would be formed for Unicode integration, but as of 2014 none had been adopted.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee had {{suggested}} to Mary Watts that public funds be raised {{to complete the}} memorial, but she objected and promised to complete the 120 tablets at her own cost or provide funds in her will to do so. However, in 1910 she told the Committee that {{she was unable to}} fund <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> <b>as</b> she was devoting her time and money to the Watts Mortuary Chapel and the Watts Gallery in Compton. Work to fill the three empty rows of the memorial was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, 20th Century Fox optioned {{the rights}} from Marvel Enterprises, and Chris Columbus {{was chosen to}} direct the film. In 1998, Marvel was facing bankruptcy. During this time 20th Century Fox allowed the option to expire, so Disney began {{negotiations}} in order to acquire the rights. In 1999, the negotiations failed to work out so Marvel set the project up with Columbia Pictures. During this time, Chris Columbus and Carlo Carlei co-wrote a script together, before Mark Steven Johnson got signed to write the screenplay. By 2000, Sony decided to cancel <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> <b>as</b> the two companies reportedly could not {{come to an agreement}} over Internet rights.|$|E

5|$|Mendes was {{approached}} {{to direct the}} film {{after the release of}} Quantum of Solace in 2008. Development was suspended when MGM encountered financial troubles and did not resume until December 2010; during this time, Mendes remained attached to <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>as</b> a consultant. The original screenwriter, Peter Morgan, left the project during the suspension. When production resumed, Logan, Purvis, and Wade continued writing what became {{the final version of the}} script. Filming began in November 2011 and primarily took place in the United Kingdom, with smaller portions shot in China and Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scientists}} criticized <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>as</b> being potentially unsafe for {{the local}} wildlife and the Inupiat people living near the designated area, who were not officially told of the plan until March 1960. Additionally, {{it turned out that}} the harbor would be ice-bound for nine months out of the year. In the end, due to the financial infeasibility of the project and the concerns over radiation-related health issues, the project was abandoned in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Technical {{difficulties}} {{included the}} very high transistor counts needed to support the wide instruction words and the large caches. There were also structural problems within <b>the</b> <b>project,</b> <b>as</b> the {{two parts of the}} joint team used different methodologies and had slightly different priorities. Since Merced was the first EPIC processor, the development effort encountered more unanticipated problems than the team was accustomed to. In addition, the EPIC concept depends on compiler capabilities that had never been implemented before, so more research was needed.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} {{blamed the}} failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics {{company had been}} severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to <b>the</b> <b>project</b> (<b>as</b> it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.|$|E
