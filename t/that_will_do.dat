Its time, goes the argument of many scholars, for versions <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> for a contemporary English-speaking public what has been done for much of the world where Shakespeare is performed in the native language of the audience—make every word intelligible.|$|E

500|$|During the 1892 campaign, Tillman {{called for}} the defeat in the Democratic primary for the {{legislature}} {{of most of the}} men elected as his supporters, urging the selection of more loyal men. Tillman urged the voters, [...] "turn out this cattle, these driftwood legislators, and send me a legislature <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> what I say, and I'll show you reform." [...] South Carolinians dutifully voted out their representatives as Tillman requested. Although no primary for governor was permitted, the delegates to the nominating convention were elected by the Democratic voters, and Tillman won an overwhelming victory over Sheppard, who took only four of thirty-five counties. The convention was mostly Tillmanite, and gave the governor an easy triumph. The Conservatives had agreed not to bolt the party, and Tillman won uncontested re-election.|$|E
500|$|After England had amassed 496 in {{the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/68 with Bradman one of the {{dismissed}} batsmen. Harvey, {{the youngest member of}} the squad, joined cavalier all-rounder Keith Miller. Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Upon arriving in the middle, Miller greeted him cheerfully and said to Harvey, [...] "OK, mate, get up the other end. [...] I'll take the bowling for a while until you get yourself organised." [...] Harvey said, [...] "Mate, <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> me." [...] I couldn't get up the other end quick enough.

2500|$|In Norse mythology, Naglfar or Naglfari (Old Norse [...] "nail goer") is a boat made {{entirely from}} the fingernails and toenails of the dead. During {{the events of}} Ragnarök, Naglfar is foretold to sail to Vígríðr, {{ferrying}} hordes <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> battle with the gods. Naglfar is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. The boat itself has been connected by scholars with a larger pattern of ritual hair and nail disposal among Indo-Europeans, stemming from Proto-Indo-European custom, {{and it may be}} depicted on the Tullstorp Runestone in Scania, Sweden.|$|E

2500|$|Classical Hindu texts {{strongly}} condemn abortion. The British Broadcasting Corporation writes, [...] "When considering abortion, the Hindu way is {{to choose}} the action <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> least harm to all involved: the mother and father, the foetus and society." [...] The BBC goes on to state, [...] "In practice, however, abortion is practiced in Hindu culture in India, because the religious ban on abortion is sometimes overruled by the cultural preference for sons. This can lead to abortion to prevent the birth of girl babies, which is called 'female foeticide'." [...] Hindu scholars and women's rights advocates have supported bans on sex-selective abortions. Some Hindus support abortion {{in cases where the}} mother's life is at imminent risk or when the fetus has a life-threatening developmental anomaly.|$|E
2500|$|Grievers {{can make}} meaning of death through philanthropic {{services}} such as charities, foundations, and organizations. Meaning-making through philanthropy can create financial support, social support, emotional support, and helps create positive results from the negative experience of the death. For example, one couple that lost a child described how they developed [...] "Nora's Project" [...] after their daughter with a disability died, {{in order to help}} provide wheelchairs for children with disabilities around the world. The mother said: [...] "With Nora's Project, I am also healing. I am able to turn something that was horrific, the way she died, into something <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> good in the world". Like this mother, it is common for individuals to want to create or do something positive for others. Philanthropy helps people make meaning by continuously and altruistically honoring a life while simultaneously helping others going through a similar experience.|$|E

Alan Betrock of Rock Marketplace wrote: [...] "The new Kinks record has to bring smiles onto a lot of faces. ... 'Sitting in the Midday Sun' sounds like it could have come right off of Village Green and melodically and lyrically is quite fine." [...] Reception in the UK was mixed. Melody Maker praised [...] "Sitting in the Midday Sun", noting its [...] "lazy summer sound," [...] and calling it [...] "another winning tune from Raymond Douglas Davies and the boys." [...] New Musical Express was mixed: [...] "One of those lightweight singles The Kinks put out when they're waiting for Ray Davies to come up with something truly remarkable.
