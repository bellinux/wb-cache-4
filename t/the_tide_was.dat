5|$|By noon, Knyphausen and his Hessians {{restarted}} their advance. As soon as <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> high enough, Mathew and his troops, {{accompanied by}} Howe, were ferried across the Harlem River. They landed under heavy {{fire from the}} American artillery on the Manhattan shore. The British troops charged up the hillside and dispersed the Americans until they reached a redoubt defended by some Pennsylvania Volunteer companies. After brief fighting, the Americans turned and ran towards the fort.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} years of the war, <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> in favour of the regency, until, in the summer of 1342, Kantakouzenos was forced to flee to the court of Stefan Dušan of Serbia. However, from 1343 onwards, with the aid of his friend, Umur Beg of Aydin, Kantakouzenos began to reverse the situation. With the initial support of Stefan Dušan, Kantakouzenos regained much of Macedonia, and despite his failure to take Thessalonica, his Turkish allies enabled him to return to his old stronghold of Didymoteicho in Thrace. Gradually, Apokaukos's {{supporters}} abandoned him, including his son Manuel, who deserted his post at Adrianople and went over to the Kantakouzenos camp.|$|E
5|$|The only warship {{reported}} wrecked on the Doom Bar was , a 12-gun schooner. The Whiting {{was originally}} a cargo ship named Arrow, which travelled from the United States to France; she {{was captured by}} the Royal Navy on 8 May 1812 and renamed. On 15 September 1816, she ran aground on the Doom Bar as <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> ebbing and the wind was from an unfavourable direction offering little assistance. According to court-martial transcripts, an attempt to move her was made at the next high tide, but she was taking on water and {{it was impossible to}} save her.|$|E
50|$|The way to {{determine}} {{the direction of the}} tidal flow at the narrows is to observe the direction in which <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> flowing. If <b>the</b> tidal flow is heading toward theJervis Inlet then <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>is</b> going out (low <b>tide).</b> But if <b>the</b> flow is moving toward Princess Louisa Inlet <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> it <b>is</b> coming in (high tide).|$|R

5|$|Alabama {{received}} Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, which {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback. Because of the touchback, Alabama's first drive of the quarter started at its 20-yard line. The first play of that drive resulted in a five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech. Alexander then was tackled for a one-yard loss. On second down, Zow threw an incomplete pass, but on third down he completed a 34-yard throw to Alexander, who earned a first down at the Tech 42-yard line. On the first play in Alabama territory, Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty. Zow then threw two incomplete passes, and on third down he was sacked by the Tech defense at the Hokie 41-yard line. Because <b>the</b> <b>Tide</b> <b>was</b> trailing Tech by four scores, Alabama head coach Mike DuBose ordered his offense to try to convert the fourth down rather than punt. Zow's pass flew incomplete, and Alabama turned the ball over on downs.|$|E
5|$|Early on 23 February Willaumez sailed again, {{taking his}} fleet southwards towards the Pertuis d'Antioche near Rochefort after sending the {{schooner}} Magpye into Lorient with orders for Troude {{to follow him}} to the rendezvous. Troude found that <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> too low to sail at once, and so sent a squadron of three frigates ahead, {{under the command of}} Commodore Pierre Roch Jurien. These frigates were the 40-gun Italienne, Calypso and Cybèle, which sailed together on the evening of 23 February southwards in the direction of Belle Île. Their departure had been observed by Beresford's force, which remained off Lorient to watch Troude but sent the 38-gun frigate HMS Amelia under Captain Frederick Paul Irby and 18-gun brig-sloop HMS Doterel under Commander Anthony Abdy in pursuit.|$|E
5|$|The Lucera, {{trying the}} same evasive tactic, {{was the next}} galley attacked; a Dutch galleot, which drove under full sail managed to ram her. The galley was struck between the {{mainmast}} and stern, with a blow which carried away the assailant's own bowsprit, but in return completely demolished {{the stern of the}} galley. Vice-Admiral Cant came up once more in the Half-moon, and finished Lucera (Morning Star) off by ramming, tearing the galley apart. Meanwhile, Victory and two States' galleots were chasing two galleys; San Juan and Jacinto who were already in a sinking state. With nowhere to escape and the gale blowing against them, the only option was for the respective commanders to run them aground near Nieuwpoort. In the end, both galleys succeeded in reaching the safety of Niewpoort. Another galley managed to evade the Dutch and English long enough but it too ended up being wrecked on the French coast near Calais. The galley San Luis, which bore Spinola himself and his thirty-six pay chests, attempted to reach Dunkirk, but as <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> low, she was forced to wait beyond a sandbank. Ten Dutch ships fell upon San Luis, but Spinola succeeded in sailing between the Dutch vessels and reached Dunkirk. With this the battle had ended and a Dutch blockade formed to prevent Spinola's escape.|$|E

25|$|On 18 August 1816, Whiting, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant John Jackson, was ordered to leave Plymouth and sail around Land's End to the Irish Sea to counter {{smuggling}} in the area. On 15 September 1816, to escape a gale, Jackson took his vessel into harbour at Padstow on the north coast of Cornwall. The wind dropped as they came around Stepper Point, and the ship ran aground on the Doom Bar as <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> ebbing, stranding her.|$|E
25|$|In spring 1918, <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> {{turned against}} the Ottomans when British forces {{were able to take}} control of some key points on the railway along the Yarmouk River, and cut off the Haifa {{extension}} {{from the rest of the}} Hejaz railway. When defeated in September 1918, the Turks quickly destroyed any railway infrastructure and rolling stock they could, so that it would not fall into British hands.

A few hours later of the next day almost 1,000 English soldiers and sailors were landed safely after Spanish sentries were surprised and killed. They also avoided the poisoned tip stakes which the Spanish had put up. The English troops formed themselves up into attack columns and by wading through the surf as <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> out they were able to bypass the outer defences; Drake meanwhile organized a naval diversion.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 Alabama Crimson Tide {{football}} team represented the University of Alabama for the 2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season {{trying to improve}} from a 10–2 record in the 2005 season. <b>The</b> <b>Tide</b> <b>was</b> led by head coach Mike Shula entering his fourth year at Alabama.

Following the loss Shula was fired as head coach and defensive coordinator Joe Kines served as interim head coach for the bowl game.|$|E
25|$|Taeping {{arrived at}} Gravesend some 55 minutes before Ariel, but {{that gave her}} no {{advantage}} as both ships then {{had to wait for}} the tide to rise sufficiently. Ariel then had the shorter distance to go - arriving outside East India Dock gates at 9:00 pm, but <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> still too low for the gates to open. Taeping carried on up-river to London Docks. Here, unlike the entrance to the East India Dock, there was an inner and outer set of gates. Taeping's shallower draft allowed her through the outer gates, then they topped up the lock from the dock basin. She passed through at 9:47 pm. Ariel entered East India Dock at 10:15 pm.|$|E

25|$|Commius, Caesar's Atrebatian ally, later {{switched}} sides, {{fighting in}} Vercingetorix's rebellion. After {{a number of}} unsuccessful engagements with Caesar's forces, he cut his losses and fled to Britain. Sextus Julius Frontinus, in his Strategemata, describes how Commius and his followers, with Caesar in pursuit, boarded their ships. Although <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> out and the ships still beached, Commius ordered the sails raised. Caesar, still some distance away, assumed the ships were afloat and called off the pursuit. Archaeologist John Creighton believes that this anecdote was a legend, and that Commius was sent to Britain as a friendly king {{as part of his}} truce with Mark Antony. Commius established a dynasty in the Hampshire area, known from coins of Gallo-Belgic type. Verica, the king whose exile prompted Claudius's conquest of AD 43, styled himself a son of Commius.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the column}} of General Abercromby made very slow {{progress}} along the beach, mostly because <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> coming in again, which narrowed {{the beach to}} a very small band, consisting of loose sand. The troops and horses were suffering severely from fatigue and thirst. In {{the course of the}} afternoon they were observed by the French who brought up sharpshooters at first, who caused a number of casualties, especially of the officers. The French sent more and more substantial reinforcements through the dunes and eventually General Vandamme brought up a substantial cavalry force which he led personally in a charge against the British horse-artillery batteries that temporarily fell into French hands. This cavalry attack was eventually repulsed by a counter-attack led by Lord Paget, who drove the French {{all the way back to}} Egmond aan Zee.|$|E
25|$|For now, Maryland {{remained}} a slave state, but <b>the</b> <b>tide</b> <b>was</b> turning. In 1863 and 1864 {{growing numbers of}} Maryland slaves simply left their plantations to join the Union Army, accepting the promise of military service in return for freedom. One effect of this was to bring slave auctions to an end, as any slave could avoid sale, and win their freedom, by simply offering to join the army. In 1863 Crisfield was defeated in local elections by the abolitionist candidate John Cresswell, amid allegations of vote-rigging by the army. In Somerset County, Maryland, Cresswell outpolled Crisfield {{by a margin of}} 6,742 votes to 5,482, with Union soldiers effectively deciding the vote in favor of Cresswell. The Civil War was not yet over, but slavery in Maryland had at last run its course. The abolitionists had almost won.|$|E
