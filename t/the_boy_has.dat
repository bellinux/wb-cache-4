5|$|In 1842 England, a {{young boy}} builds a snowman, but refuses {{to play with the}} other children. The snowman starts {{speaking}} to the boy, repeating his assertions that the other children are silly. Fifty years later, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> grown up to be Dr. Walter Simeon, proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute. He hires men to collect samples of snow, which he places in a large snow-filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated snowmen. The Doctor, still despondent after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams, has parked his TARDIS above Victorian London among the clouds. He uses his allies Vastra, Jenny, and Strax to keep people away from him. They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|The player character, a boy scout, has {{approached}} a mansion {{looking for work}} during Bob a Job week. The door is answered by an old man wearing horn-rimmed glasses—the owner of the mansion. The man, a mad scientist, expresses surprise that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> managed {{to get past the}} guards and booby traps in the mansion's grounds. As the boy scout explains the reason for his visit, the scientist collapses, asking for his pills. At this point the game begins. The player must gather the 16 keys needed to unlock the safe and retrieve the scientist's pills before he passes away. During play the boy scout must negotiate the mansion's rooms, avoiding hazards and the mansion's staff, who have been told to protect the inventions within the mansion, using lethal force if necessary. The staff are unaware of the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should they come into contact.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by one of the men who pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E

25|$|For 2016, British {{clothing}} and food company Marks & Spencer launched an integrated marketing campaign {{centered on a}} modern interpretation of Mrs. Claus. The campaign included a three-minute ad released on 11 November 2016 which sees Mrs. Claus receiving {{a letter from a}} seven-year-old child asking for help with a gift for his older sister, whom <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> a difficult relationship with.|$|E
25|$|Philip Cairns (born 1 September 1973) {{disappeared}} on {{the afternoon}} of 23 October 1986 while walking back to school in south Dublin, Ireland. The 13-year-old schoolboy left his home in Ballyroan to return to school, but has not been seen since. A large-scale investigation was carried out but no trace of <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> ever been found. His disappearance is now treated as a high-profile child murder case, the only similar incident in Ireland being the murder of Robert Holohan in January 2005. It {{is one of the most}} high-profile disappearances in recent Irish history.|$|E

25|$|In {{one scene}} Hassan is {{attacked}} {{and it is}} suggested that he is raped. The filmmakers wanted Ahmad to take off his pants for the shooting, but his father refused to let him do that. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> said that he would never have taken the role had he known Hassan would be raped. Reports vary on whether he and his family were properly informed in advance. The scene has now been depicted in a less harrowing manner than originally planned, and there is no nudity in it. Nevertheless, a body double was used to show the boy's pants being tugged slightly down.|$|E
25|$|Phaedrus {{believes}} {{that one of}} the greatest goods given is the relationship between lover and boy. This relationship brings guidance and love into the boy’s life. Because <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> a lover as such a valuable role model, he is on his best behavior to not get caught in something shameful. To get caught in something shameful would be like letting down his lover, therefore the boy is consistently acting his best. The absence of shame makes room for a sense of pride to come in; pride from the wealthy feeling of impressing one's own lover. Impressing one's own lover brings more learning and guidance into the boy's life.|$|E
25|$|All of Alger's novels {{have similar}} plots: a boy struggles to escape poverty through {{hard work and}} clean living. However, {{it is not always}} the hard work and clean living that rescue the boy from his situation, but rather a wealthy older gentleman, who admires the boy as a result of some {{extraordinary}} act of bravery or honesty that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> performed. For example, the boy rescues a child from an overturned carriage or finds and returns the man's stolen watch. Often the older man takes the boy into his home as a ward or companion and helps him find a better job, sometimes replacing a less honest or less industrious boy.|$|E

25|$|A {{crucial point}} in the {{dialogue}} is when Socrates tells Meno {{that there is no}} such thing as teaching, only recollection of knowledge from past lives, or anamnesis. Socrates claims that he can demonstrate this by showing that one of Meno's servants, a slave boy, knows geometric principles though he is uneducated. Socrates states that he will teach the boy nothing, only ask him questions to assist the process of recollection. Socrates proceeds to ask the slave boy a series of questions about the size and length of lines and squares, using visual diagrams to aid the boy in understanding the questions. The crucial point to this part of the dialogue is that, though <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> no training, he knows the correct answers to the questions – he intrinsically knows the Pythagorean proposition.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{follows a}} young boy called Duny born {{on the island of}} Gont, nicknamed [...] "Sparrowhawk". Discovering that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> great power in him, his aunt trains him in magic. When his village is {{attacked}} by Kargish invaders Duny uses his power to summon a fog to conceal his village. Hearing of this, the powerful mage Ogion takes him as an apprentice, giving him his [...] "true name"—Ged. Ogion tries to teach Ged about the [...] "equilibrium", the concept that magic can upset the natural order of the world if used improperly. In an attempt to impress a girl he meets, Ged searches Ogion's spell-books and inadvertently summons a strange shadow, which is banished by Ogion. Sensing Ged's impatience to learn, Ogion sends Ged to attend a school for wizards on the island of Roke.|$|E
500|$|In Los Angeles in 1928, {{single mother}} Christine Collins (Jolie) returns home to {{discover}} her nine-year-old son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith), is missing. Reverend Gustav Briegleb (Malkovich) publicizes Christine's plight and rails against the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for its incompetence, corruption and the extrajudicial punishment meted out by its [...] "Gun Squad" [...] led by Chief James E. Davis (Feore). Several months after Walter's disappearance, the LAPD tells Christine that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> been found alive. Believing the positive publicity will negate recent {{criticism of the}} department, the LAPD organizes a public reunion. Although [...] "Walter" [...] (Devon Conti) claims he is Christine's son, she says he is not. Captain J. J.

500|$|At {{a meeting}} between Follmer and Regali, Follmer says he is {{finished}} consorting with him, but Regali reminds him he was being bribed, and threatens to blackmail him. In the meantime, Mimms tells Scully that he first noticed the case of Luke Doggett when he read it in a newspaper. He further states that he lied about his name {{so that he could}} help solve the case. At the end, he still pushes that Regali is the real murderer of Doggett's son, and not him. Later on, Doggett approaches Regali. Regali tells him a [...] "hypothetical" [...] story about how a pedophile took a young boy to his home. A [...] "businessman" [...] then walked in on the incident, realized that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> seen his face, and feared that the boy might associate him with the crime. The businessman then found a solution to the boy seeing his face: he murdered him. Regali then walks away and Doggett, filled with rage, unholsters his gun and follows. But a gunshot rings out and when Doggett gets outside, he sees Regali has been killed by Follmer. Later, Doggett and Barbara scatter Luke's ashes into the ocean, finally achieving the release he has sought.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 10, 1910. It states: [...] "The play deals with Will Allen, a country lad, who is unhappy at home, owing {{to the fact that}} he is a studious little chap and prefers his books to farm work, which incurs the displeasure and enmity of his stepfather, a rough and surly farmer, to whom book learning does not appeal. Will runs away from home, and although his mother keeps a light in the window, hoping to guide her boy home, he never returns. Twenty years later, when <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> made a place for himself in the world as a successful lawyer, he goes back to the farm, only to find that his little mother, who has been left a widow, has gone away, whither, no one knows. The mother, in the meantime, being left alone in the world, goes to the city and there supports herself by dressmaking. While shopping in a department store she is unjustly accused of shoplifting. The only person who believes in her innocence is a salesgirl, who is discharged for her presumption and daring to correct her superiors. The girl, in her efforts to help the friendless old lady, enlists the aid of Will, whom she knows to be a lawyer of great ability. Will is about to refuse the case, as the dry goods company is a client of his, when the girl describes the lonely old lady, and begs him for the sake of his mother to befriend her. Will consents. Will's clear statement of the case to the judge, together with May's testimony, frees the mother. When her counsel approaches to offer his congratulations, mutual recognition results." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} about {{a little boy who}} leaves his home with his dog to shop for food items for his mother, and {{attempts}} to remember the list of things she wanted him to buy. [...] The original request from his mother is [...] "six farm eggs, a cake for tea, a pound of pears, and don't forget the bacon." [...] Along with the dog, he is accompanied on his trip by a butterfly. In order to avoid forgetting items, the boy recites his mother's list to himself. Throughout his trip to the store, the boy sees items along the way that play tricks with his memory, and items on his list one-by-one become substituted with other goods. [...] "Six farm eggs" [...] initially becomes [...] "Six fat legs" [...] then [...] "Six clothes pegs", and [...] "A cake for tea" [...] initially becomes [...] "A cape for me" [...] then [...] "A rake for leaves", and [...] "A pound of pears" [...] initially becomes [...] "A flight of stairs" [...] then [...] "A pile of chairs". By the end of his trip, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> forgotten the initial items requested, and supplants them in his mind with [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, a pile of chairs, and don't forget the bacon". Then he goes to the junk shop and says to a merchant there, [...] "Six clothes pegs, a rake for leaves, and a pile of chairs please!". The merchant in the junk shop assists the boy in compiling to this odd list. While travelling back to his home, he remembers the original items and corrects his mistakes. Then on the way home, he says to himself, [...] "Six farm eggs, a cake for tea, and a pound of pears". However, he still forgets to acquire bacon when he gets home. And finally, he says, [...] "I FORGOT THE BACON!". Finally, the final panel depicts the child carrying a basket and a coin purse, taking his dog attached to a leash, and do an en route; probably to purchase the bacon which he forgot.|$|E

2500|$|She {{eventually}} converses with Daxus, {{who tells}} {{her that the}} boy is his son, but she does [...] not believe him.

He also tells her that <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>has</b> a tracking device embedded in him ("so hot he's nearly radioactive"), that they can track him easily and he has only 8 hours to live. In the meantime, Nerva reveals to Violet that the antigens in Six's blood are actually deadly to humans. Furthermore, Daxus clarifies that the boy is his clone, his previous claim to her being a ruse to earn her sympathy. Since the hemophages are nearly exterminated, the Archministry intends to engineer a new plague to maintain its power. When he refuses to give her the cure, Violet escapes with Six and lets him spend his last moments at a playground. Daxus arrives, shoots Violet, and takes Six's body for dissection.|$|E
2500|$|Tinker Bell is Peter Pan's fairy. She is {{described}} as a common fairy who mends pots and kettles and, though she is sometimes ill-behaved and vindictive, at other times she is helpful and kind to Peter (for whom she has romantic feelings).
