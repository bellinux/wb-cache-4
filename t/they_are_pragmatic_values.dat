40|$|Partial types for the -calculus were {{introduced}} by Thatte in 1988 [8] {{as a means}} of typing objects that are not typable with simple types, such as heterogeneous lists and persistent data. In that paper he showed that type inference for partial types was semidecidable. Decidability remained open until quite recently, when O'Keefe and Wand [5] gave an exponential time algorithm for type inference. In this paper we give an O(n 3) algorithm. Our algorithm constructs a certain finite automaton that represents a canonical solution to a given set of type constraints. Moreover, the construction works equally well for recursive types; this solves an open problem stated in [5]. 1 Introduction Partial types for the pure -calculus {{were introduced}} by Thatte in 1988 [8] as a way to type certain -terms that are untypable in the simply-typed -calculus. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> of substantial <b>pragmatic</b> <b>value,</b> since they allow the Computer Science Department, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.

We argue that a classical model of university should necessarily go {{through a series of}} changes due to many objective reasons. Contemporary epistemology is symbolizing renaissance.

We bring to the attention different educational models such as: a model of world-class university, an elitist model, a mass model, a two-level model, a networking model, a university of the third age.

40|$|Recently, schema-based program {{transformation}} and synthesis techniques {{have received a}} lot of attention, especially at LOPSTR. It seems that schema-based techniques often fall into one of two categories: either <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>pragmatic,</b> designed for carrying out real program transformation or synthesis operations, but lacking the logical basis that they need to ensure that they really do synthesise/transform programs correctly, or <b>they</b> <b>are</b> rigorous, with strong theoretical foundations, but their use generates proof obligations which are difficult to satisfy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Charles Darwin's "The Origin of the Species" (1859) {{has been}} {{appointed}} by a hundred Norwegian scholars {{as the most important}} scientific work of modern age. This has evoked debate about the significance of Darwin's thoughts today. The current work is an attempt to study darwinism's cultural environment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two works on cultural history has been studied, Oswald Spengler's "The Decline of the West" (1923) and Egon Friedell's "A Cultural History of our Age" (1933). Both are written in a time when darwinism <b>was</b> widely debated. <b>They</b> have <b>been</b> studied in the same holistic attitude as their authors hold. RESULTS: Spengler presume that scientific results are governed by culture. The Western mentality is to look for lasting truths, either religious or scientific. Modern scientific discoveries are presumed to be objective, arguing that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>pragmatic.</b> However <b>they</b> spring from a principle of cause-and-effect that tells only half the truth about human life. In German philosophy before the Second World War, such principles where being judged as insufficient for scientific progress. The struggle for survival has been described in Shakespeare’s dramas. While Shakespeare believed in destiny, Darwin trusted reason. Both are mere beliefs, according to Spengler. INTERPRETATION: The study discusses the uncertainties of scientific theory and experiments, and comments on to which extent an objective science without any cultural bias is possible. A conclusion is drawn that a secular science is limited to describing nature and can not describe its origin or destination...|$|R
40|$|Translation of {{research}} into clinical practice remains a barrier, with inconsistent adoption of effective treatments and useful tests. Clinical decision rules (CDRs) integrate information from several clinical or laboratory findings to provide quantitative estimates of {{risk for a}} diagnosis or clinical outcome. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> increasingly {{reported in the literature}} and have the potential to provide a bridge that helps translate findings from original research studies into clinical practice. Unlike formal aids for shared deci-sion making, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>pragmatic</b> solutions that provide discrete quantitative data to aid clinicians and patients in decision making. These quantitative data can help inform the informal episodes of shared decision making that frequently take place at the point of care. Methods used to develop CDRs include expert opinion, multivari-ate models, point scores, and classification and regres-sion trees. Desirable CDRs are valid (make accurate predictions of risk), relevant (have been shown to improve patient-oriented outcomes), are easy to use at the point of care, are acceptable (with good face validity and trans-parency of recommendations), and are situated in the clinical context. The latter means that the rule places patients in risk groups that are clinically useful (i. e., below the test threshold or above the treatment threshold) and does so in adequate numbers {{to make use of the}} CDR a worthwhile investment in time.

However, to realise these goals significant challenges in image and data processing need to be overcome. The standard methods in radio interferometry for reconstructing images, such as CLEAN and its variants, have served the community well over the last few decades and have survived largely because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>pragmatic.</b> However, <b>they</b> produce reconstructed interferometric images that are limited in quality and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not scalable for big data. In this work we apply and evaluate alternative interferometric reconstruction methods that make use of state-of-the-art sparse image reconstruction algorithms motivated by compressive sensing, which have been implemented in the PURIFY software package. In particular, we implement and apply the proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (P-ADMM) algorithm presented in a recent article. First, we assess the impact of the interpolation kernel used to perform gridding and degridding on sparse image reconstruction. We find that the Kaiser-Bessel interpolation kernel performs as well as prolate spheroidal wave functions, while providing a computational saving and an analytic form. Second, we apply PURIFY to real interferometric observations from the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We find that for all observations PURIFY outperforms CLEAN, where in some cases PURIFY provides an improvement in dynamic range by over an order of magnitude. Third, we discuss how images reconstructed by PURIFY exhibit addition advantages over those recovered by CLEAN.
