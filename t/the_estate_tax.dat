During the economic recovery from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, Ryan supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the Treasury to purchase toxic assets from banks and other financial institutions, and the auto industry bailout; Ryan opposed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which expanded consumer protections regarding credit card plans, and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which strengthened financial regulation.|$|E

40|$|Historically, <b>the</b> federal <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> {{provided}} a credit for state <b>estate</b> and inheritance <b>taxes.</b> This credit, which offset dollar-for-dollar up to 16 percent of an estate’s value against federal taxes, gave states a strong incentive to impose estate or inheritance taxes: states could raise revenue without increasing the net tax burden on their citizens. As a result, all 50 {{states and the}} District of Columbia had such taxes directly linked to the maximum value of the credit. The 2001 tax act phased out the credit and replaced it in 2005 with a less-valuable deduction. States responded in three different ways. Some simply repealed their <b>estate</b> <b>taxes.</b> Others decoupled from the federal law, either establishing a stand-alone tax or explicitly linking their taxes to the 2001 law. But most states did nothing, effectively eliminating their <b>estate</b> <b>taxes</b> but leaving in place the legislation that set their <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> equal to <b>the</b> federal credit. If the 2001 – 10 tax cuts expire as scheduled on January 1, 2013, <b>the</b> federal <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> will revert to its 2001 status, bringing back the credit and, with it, <b>the</b> <b>estate</b> <b>taxes</b> of <b>the</b> latter group of states.

40|$|Did {{the mass}} media report in a {{different}} way about <b>the</b> real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> before <b>the</b> Swedish national election 2006 than they did after the election? If there were differences, what could be the cause? This study aims to answer these questions by using a quantitative analysis of articles about <b>the</b> real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> published in <b>the</b> Dagens Nyheter (DN), the biggest morning daily.   The summer before the election, the ‘Alliance’, (the non-socialist coalition, launched an election promise to abolish <b>the</b> real <b>estate</b> <b>tax.</b> Instead they planned to introduce a low community charge. The Alliance won the election and formed a government to implement their election promise.   The analysis was made on all the published articles in DN that covered <b>the</b> real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> issue. In total there were 43 such articles. These where all published between the launch of the campaign promise until the electionday and a month before the proposal was launched 19 / 9 2007, until the proposal was implemented in 2008.   The study results in three interesting conclusions. After the election, when the election promise was about to become political reality, DN reported more negatively about this specific issue. The genre of the articles varied heavily before and after the election. Before the election more news articles where published than after the election and the letters-to-the-editor about <b>the</b> real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> were published almost only before the election. This study also treats the intresting phenomenon that the Alliance, before the election, had the power to define their election promise but after the election they seem to have lost this power and instead <b>the</b> real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> question was defined by the media. The Alliance claimed that they would  ”abolish <b>the</b> real <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> and introduce a low community charge” and DN used this definition in their newspaper.
