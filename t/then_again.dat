5|$|Although both {{shows are}} set in the same hospital, the Casualty set in Bristol was not large enough to {{encompass}} the surgical ward and operating theatre required for Holby City, so the series was produced at the BBC's Elstree Studios in north London. As a result, some crossover scenes had to be shot twice, first on the Casualty set and <b>then</b> <b>again</b> at Elstree, with cast members travelling between the two locations. McHale wrote the series' first episode, and served as the show's lead writer. Holby City premiered on 12 January 1999 on BBC One. Its first series ran for nine episodes of 50 minutes in length, which were broadcast first in the 8.10pm, then 8pm timeslot on Tuesdays.|$|E

Although American troops delivered an unexpected check to the British at Harlem Heights in mid-September, Howe defeated Washington in battle again at White Plains and <b>then</b> <b>again</b> at Fort Washington. Because of these defeats, Washington and the army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.|$|E
