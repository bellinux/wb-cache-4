25|$|Indian Point began dry cask {{storage of}} {{spent fuel rods}} in 2008, which is a safe and {{environmentally}} sound option according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

25|$|PYRO-A is a {{means of}} {{separating}} actinides (elements within the actinide family, generally heavier than U-235) from non-actinides. <b>The</b> <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> is placed in an anode basket which is immersed in a molten salt electrolyte.

Many of the fission products (such as caesium, zirconium and strontium) remain in the salt. As alternatives to the molten cadmium electrode it is possible to use a molten bismuth cathode, or a solid aluminium cathode.|$|E
25|$|On 8 November workers did enter reactor-building no. 4, and {{inspected}} {{the place to}} {{determine the cause of}} the hydrogen-blast on 15 March 2011.

These findings did not support earlier assumptions that the hydrogen in the blast originated from <b>the</b> <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> pool of reactor 4, but instead proved that the explosion was caused by hydrogen from the number 3 reactor, after the valves were opened.
