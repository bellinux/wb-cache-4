5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>than</b> any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

Gerðr refuses; she says that she will not endure the {{coercion}} of any man, and says that if Gymir encounters Skírnir then a battle can be expected. Skírnir again reminds Gerðr of his blade and predicts that Gerðr's jötunn father will meet his doom with it. Skírnir warns Gerðr that he will strike her with his Gambanteinn, a wand, that it will tame her to his desires, and says that she will never again be seen by [...] "the sons of men".

The film {{includes}} the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover someone more important <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>than</b> you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – you care about your child more than you care about yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{and after}} the {{publication}} of the score in 1922, scholars questioned the work's authenticity, and its attribution to Monteverdi continued to be in some doubt until the 1950s. The Italian musicologist Giacomo Benvenuti maintained, {{on the basis of a}} 1942 performance in Milan, that the work was simply not good enough to be by Monteverdi. Apart from the stylistic differences between Il ritorno and Monteverdi's other surviving late opera, L'incoronazione di Poppea, the main issue which raised doubts was the series of discrepancies between the score and the libretto. However, much of the uncertainty concerning the attribution was resolved through the discovery of contemporary documents, all confirming Monteverdi's role as the composer. These documents include a letter from the unknown librettist of Le nozze d'Enea in Lavinia, which discusses Monteverdi's setting of Il ritorno. There is also Badoaro's preface to the Il ritorno libretto, addressed to the composer, which includes the wording [...] "I can firmly state that my Ulysses is more indebted <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>than</b> ever was the real Ulysses to the ever-gracious Minerva". A 1644 letter from Badoaro to Michelangelo Torcigliani contains the statement [...] "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria was embellished with the music of Claudio Monteverdi, a man of great fame and enduring name". Finally, a 1640 booklet entitled Le Glorie della Musica indicates the Badoaro-Monteverdi pairing as the creators of the opera. In the view of conductor and instrumentalist Sergio Vartolo, these findings establish Monteverdi as the principal composer [...] "beyond a shadow of a doubt". Although parts of the music may be by other hands, there is no doubt that the work is substantially Monteverdi's and remains close to his original conception.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{starting}} the actual reading, {{the reader will}} typically try to elicit cooperation from the subject, saying something such as, [...] "I often see images that are a bit unclear and which may sometimes mean more <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>than</b> to me; if you help, we can together uncover new things about you." [...] One of the most crucial elements of a convincing cold reading is a subject eager to make connections or reinterpret vague statements {{in any way that}} will help the reader appear to make specific predictions or intuitions. While the reader will do most of the talking, it is the subject who provides the meaning.|$|E

2500|$|Generally {{the use of}} both a {{ring and}} a halter, and {{management}} of the bull by two people, is the preferred method today for controlling the bull. [...] Typically, a bull was led by a wooden staff with a steel end that snapped into the ring. A long rigid steel or wooden bull staff locked into the ring could also be used to push a bull out of a pen without requiring the handler to enter the pen for cleaning or feeding. Because of the risk that the bull may drive the staff into the handler if the bull misbehaves many handlers prefer to avoid their use nowadays. [...] One current veterinary text still recommends the use of a staff in addition to the halter: Many handlers rely on a nose ring to control a bull. [...] But a ring in his nose is no good unless you have a bull staff and use it. [...] A bull staff is a pole with a snap in the end that clips to the bull ring. [...] Leading a bull with a staff gives you a lot more handling power as the bull can't get any closer <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>than</b> the length of the staff allows. Leading him only by a chain in the ring lets him run over you at will.|$|E

2500|$|Seemingly finding {{parenting}} difficult, Henry Sr. mostly bonded {{with his}} son through their mutual fascination with history. After {{the death of his}} wife Anna from influenza, the gulf between father and son grew {{to the point where they}} rarely spoke. Henry claims that he taught his son [...] "self reliance" [...] this way, while Indiana felt that his father simply cared more about his intellectual pursuits than he did about his own son, saying [...] "What you taught me, was that I was less important <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>than</b> some people who'd been dead for 500 years in another country." [...] To Indiana's constant exasperation, Henry refers to his son only as [...] "Junior" [...] (ironically, Indiana does the same thing to his own son), until the end of The Last Crusade when he finally calls him [...] "Indiana". As he was not a hands-on father, Indiana resented his father's aloof, distant nature, which may have influenced his own inability to settle down and start a family for much of his life, and also resented his father's lifelong pursuit of the quest for the Holy Grail. When Henry explains that the search for the Grail is [...] "a race against evil", Indy lashes out at him: [...] "This is an obsession, Dad! I never understood it! Never!" [...] Because of aloofness as a father, Indy embraced his father's friend Marcus Brody as a father figure and role model. Another factor which deteriorated Indiana and Henry's relationship was Indiana going off to enlist in the Belgian Army for World War I in 1916 without his father's consent, and the two went three years without seeing each other.|$|E
