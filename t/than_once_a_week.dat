25|$|Continuity {{of water}} supply is poor in most Yemeni cities. For example, in Taiz, the {{frequency}} of the public piped water delivery is only once about every 40days. More and more people have to rely on more costly water provided by private wells supplying water tankers. The quality of this water is questionable because these tankers have often been used for other purposes without appropriate cleaning. According to the Ministry of Water and Environment, 15 of 23 urban water utilities provided water every day for between 12 and 24 hours in 2007. These data do not differentiate between utilities with continuous supply and those with intermittent supply of a “moderate” sort (more than 12 hours daily water supply). The 15 cities thus include Sana’a and Aden that provide intermittent water supply. Four other towns provided water on a daily basis, but less than 12 hours per day. The city of Ibb and the town of Bajil provide water only once a week. And the utilities in Taiz and Mahwit provided water only less <b>than</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> in 2007. However, there are potentially conflicting reports about the continuity of supply. For example, the Ministry reported that water was being provided on a daily basis in Amran in 2007. However, 100% of the respondents to a household survey in the same town in 2008 indicated that they received water only once a week or even once a month.|$|E

2500|$|The OLPC {{project has}} also been criticized for {{allegedly}} adopting a [...] "one-shot" [...] deployment approach {{with little or no}} technical support or teacher training, and for neglecting pilot programs and formal assessment of outcomes in favor of quick deployment. Some authors attribute this unconventional approach to the OLPC promoters' alleged focus on constructivist education and 'digital utopianism'. Mark Warschauer, a Professor of University of California at Irvine and Morgan Ames, at the time of writing, a PhD candidate at Stanford University, have pointed out that the laptop by itself does not completely fill the need of students in underprivileged countries. The [...] "children’s machines", as they have been called, have been deployed to several countries, for example Uruguay, Peru, and in the US, Alabama, but after a relatively short time, their usage has declined considerably, sometimes because of hardware problems or breakage, in some cases, as high as 27% to 59% within the first two years, and sometimes {{due to a lack of}} knowledge on the part of the users on how to take full advantage of the machine. However, another factor has recently been acknowledged; a lack of a direct relation to the pedagogy needed in the local context to be truly effective. Uruguay reports that only 21.5% of teachers use the laptop in the classroom on a daily basis, and 25% report using it less <b>than</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> In Alabama, 80.3% of students say they never or seldom use the computer for class work, and Peru, teachers report that in the first few months, 68.9% use the laptop three times per week, but after two months, only 40% report such usage. Those of a low socio-economic level tend to not be able to effectively use the laptop for educational purposes on their own, but with scaffolding and mentoring from teachers, the machine can become more useful. According to one of the returning OLPC executives, Walter Bender, the approach needs to be more holistic, combining technology with a prolonged community effort, teacher training and local educational efforts and insights.|$|E

50|$|Gay males' {{desire for}} a sexual partner stems from a male's {{physical}} attractiveness and features and signs of youth. They also favour sexual activities as the fundamental component of a gay relationship. Research by Blumstein and Schwartz depicts that gay men had higher levels of sexual frequencies in comparison to lesbian women throughout all stages of their relationship. Supporting this, it was also found that white homosexual male couples reported higher levels (47%) of copulating more <b>than</b> <b>once</b> in <b>a</b> <b>week</b> compared to lesbians (32%). This was also found amongst gay Black homosexual couples reporting 65% amongst males and 56% amongst females. During {{the first two years}} of a gay couples relationship, two-thirds of gay couples had sexual intercourse three of more times <b>a</b> <b>week</b> compared to lesbian couples in a two-year relationship. Even so, during a ten-year relationship 11% of gay couples copulated compared to 1% of lesbian couples signifying that gay couples have higher frequencies of sex. Given that males desire higher levels of sex in comparison to females, it is thus, common to find that gay males, in comparison to heterosexuals and lesbians, have the highest frequencies of sex across all stages of their relationships. Thus, this signifies that gay couples encounter in higher levels of sexual intercourse.|$|R

It is aimed to provide source to researchers and relevant institutions {{who are willing to}} guide the future sectoral initiatives and conduct more extensive research on seafood consumer habits. In this context, the research population was determined according to their distance to the sea and their populations by purposive sampling method. 43 % of total 400 survey was conducted in Ankara, 36 % in İzmir and 21 % in Adana by face to face interviews. According to the survey results, 6 % of respondents never consume seafood, 25 % <b>once</b> <b>a</b> month, 28 % once every two weeks, and 42 % consume <b>once</b> and more <b>than</b> <b>once</b> in <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> The most seafood consumption frequency was identified in Izmir. Nearly 90 % of consumers in the entire regions prefer to consume seafood in fresh type. According to the answers of all consumers 4 major factors affecting seafood consumption preferences and habits in a negative way were "high price, cannot be easily found in the market, not recognition of seafood varieties and disfavor of the flavor of seafood". The relationship between frequency of seafood consumption and education level of consumer’s variables is determined as linear and strong but the relationship between consumer age and seafood consumption frequency is determined as reverse.   On the factors affecting choice of seafood consumption in a positive way, 71 % of consumers stated the beneficial to health perception and taste of seafood as the most important reason for their preference. Therefore, the relationship between consumption trend and beneficial to health perception of seafood is determined as linear and strong.

This observation led the researcher to conduct the study about the influence of computer games on the social skills of the BSIT first year students of Pangasinan State University, Bayambang Campus, during school year 2012 - 2013. This study determined the profile of the 115 BSIT first year students according to: preferred computer games and frequency of playing. It investigated the level of social skills among playing and non-playing gamers. This study used the descriptive-comparative method of research. It was found out that crossfire was the most preferred computer game played at least <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Computer gamers had lower social skills than non-computer gamers. Gamers have more negative social behaviors compared to non-gamers and there is a negative effect of playing computer games on the level of social skills among first year students.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{identify}} methods of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of occupational therapy services to children with developmental coordination disorder and their families. A method of applying the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV diagnostic criteria for developmental coordination disorder in a clinical setting is described. This process found that the majority (69 %) of referrals were inappropriate. These included children whose difficulties could not be attributed to coordination as they scored above the fifteenth percentile on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (28 %), children with general learning difficulties (21 %) and other medical conditions (10 %). The {{similarities and differences between}} parent, teacher and child views of the impact of developmental coordination disorder on activities of daily living are assessed. Whilst parents, teachers and children all expressed concerns about schoolwork the children's concerns give us much more information about self-care, play and leisure tasks such as dressing, using cutlery, playing sports and riding a bike. A pilot trial is conducted which reflects child and parent/carer identified goals. It also explores how to measure the effectiveness of group occupational therapy intervention using a goal- orientated approach and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure proved an effective tool when combined with other measures. The group was innovative as it was goal oriented and, rather <b>than</b> the usual <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> took place eight times in a two-week period. This new style group intervention appears to be successful in firstly achieving goals as 22 / 30 goals were met and secondly improving coordination as Movement Assessment Battery for Children scores improved significantly. These findings suggest that although this was an exploratory trial and there were therefore potential confounders such as non-blinded outcome assessment, there should be further evaluation of group occupational therapy intervention. The richness of information to show individual development and progressions is explored demonstrating that each child's and family's experience of intervention is unique. Finally combining the results of studies 1 - 3, current practice and the literature a model for service delivery is proposed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

[...] They had lost count, and the man had attended to his work on a day which the dame averred to be the Sabbath. He denied that it was the Sabbath, and I believe that {{it turned out to be}} a Tuesday. This little incident gives some idea of the delightful absence of population in Glen Aline. But no words can paint the utter loneliness, which could actually be felt--the empty moors, the empty sky. The heaps of stones by a burnside, here and there, showed that a cottage had once existed where now was no habitation. One such spot was rather to be shunned by the superstitious, for here, about 1698, a cottar family had been evicted by endless unaccountable disturbances in the house. Stones were thrown by invisible hands--though occasionally, by the way, a white hand, with no apparent body attached to it, was viewed by the curious who came to the spot. Heavy objects of all sorts floated in the air; rappings and voices were heard; the end wall was pulled down by an unknown agency. The story is extant in a pious old pamphlet called [...] "Sadducees Defeated," [...] and a great deal more to the same effect--a masterpiece by the parish minister, signed and attested by the other ministers of the Glen Kens.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Magnetic Resonance Imaging Screening study {{evaluates the}} {{efficacy}} and psychological {{impact of a}} surveillance program for women {{at increased risk for}} hereditary or familial breast cancer in the Netherlands. Surveillance consists of biannual physical examination, annual mammography, annual MRI and monthly breast self-examination (BSE). OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between psychological distress and reported BSE frequency. METHODS: Two months prior to surveillance demographics, BSE frequency, general distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the somatic scale of the Symptom Checklist- 90) and breast cancer-specific distress (Impact of Event Scale) were assessed in 316 women (mean age 40. 5 years, range 21 - 63 years). RESULTS: The majority (57 %) reported performing monthly BSE. Ten percent reported never performing BSE, 20 % less frequently <b>than</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> month and 13 % at least <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> Women below the age of 40 who examined their breasts more frequently than recommended (i. e. at least <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week)</b> were shown to be significantly more distressed than the other women in the sample (p = 0. 03).
