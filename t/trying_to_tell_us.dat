In particular, do the denizens of the social world—cultural values like the Protestant work ethic, firms like ExxonMobil, norms like standards of dress and behavior, institutions like the legal system, teams like FC Barcelona, conventions like marriages—exist? The question is not merely academic. Social scientists use these different social entities to explain social phenomena such as the rise of capitalism, the decline in oil prices, or the effect of unions on the sports labor market.

Little has been said, however, in a general vein, about how moral or, more generally, normative, explanations work – what sort of things they are, in what ways they are like and unlike explanations of non-normative or descriptive phenom-ena, and so on. And that is unfortunate – for given the importance of explanatory ambitions in moral theorizing, differences in expectations about how moral explanations can and cannot work could potentially be playing an important role in underwriting disagreement about many other questions in moral theory. In fact, I think that this is the case. But the only way to see whether this is so is to look hard for implicit theories about how moral or normative explanations must work...|$|R

5000|$|Mokyr has {{outlined}} {{three reasons}} why societies may show resistance to new technologies: [...] "First, {{there are the}} incumbents who fear {{a threat to the}} stream of rents generated by their physical capital, human capital, market power, or political influence. Innovation inevitably disrupt such rents. Second, there is the concern about broader repercussions: innovations have unintended ripple effects on a host of social and political variables that may generate additional costs and pain to people even if they themselves have no direct say over whether to adopt the innovation. And beyond that there is risk- and loss-aversion, the often well-founded fear than a new technique may have unanticipated and unknowable consequences. These three motives often merge and create powerful forces that use political power and persuasion to thwart innovations. As a result, technological progress does not follow a linear and neat trajectory.

One of the most important features of Mc Cabe’s writing is the constant parallel between human and animal world: both are devided into two basic categories, the hunters and the hunted and since in Mc Cabe’s world there is no choice and no space for compromise, one either belongs to the first or is doomed to belong to the other. With his ability to universalize from the immediate particular Mc Cabe forces the reader to realize that the “blind bitter fields” of Northern Ireland are, in the end, a metaphor for the world and the human condition...|$|R
5000|$|A poetic journal is a {{literary}} genre combining aspects of poetry with the daily, or near daily, [...] "takes" [...] of journal writing. Born of twin impulses: to track change {{in daily life}} and to memorialize experience, poetic journals owe allegiances to Asian writing — particularly the Japanese haibun of Matsuo Bashō, The Pillow Book of Sei Shōnagon, and the poetic diaries of Masaoka Shiki — as well as Objectivist poets and others associated with Donald Allen's anthology The New American Poetry 1945-1960. Unlike traditional diaries or journals that focus primarily on recounting a day's experience, poetic journals emphasize {{the act of writing}} itself in collaboration with the day's account.
