25|$|A movie {{adaptation}} of O Mistério da Estrada de Sintra {{was produced in}} 2007. The director had shortly before directed a series inspired in a whodunit involving {{the descendants of the}} original novel's characters (Nome de Código Sintra, Code Name Sintra), and some of the historical flashback scenes (reporting to the book's events) of the series were used in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>movie.</b> The movie was more centered on Eça's and Ramalho Ortigão's writing and publishing of the original serial and the controversy it created and less around the book's plot itself.|$|E
25|$|The channel {{launched}} as {{an original}} channel on January 23, 2012. In 2012, Reuters reported that DeFranco {{had plans to}} create a news network.

25|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on June 26, 2014 in Berlin. Shortly before production {{began in}} Berlin, Core got {{the cast and}} crew together to watch the original Point Break. The new team did not reach out to the original cast and crew; Bracey did not talk to Reeves, and Core did not reach out to director Kathryn Bigelow, though Ramirez did seek and receive the director's blessing. Shooting took place in a total of 11 countries across four continents, using actual extreme sports stars and stuntmen. Locations include Berlin/Germany, Hall in Tirol, Lienz and Carinthia/Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Hawaii, Tahiti, Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Venezuela, France, India, and the United Kingdom. While the original film focused on just a few sports – primarily surfing – and used cranes and other Hollywood trickery to portray them, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>movie</b> eschewed all of that, including green screens, and relied on real life practical stunts. For the numerous stunts performed in the film, Core gathered a group of the best snowboarders, free rock climbers, big wave surfers, high-speed motocross riders and wingsuit pilots in the world and filmed them, essentially, as actors.|$|E
25|$|The {{redevelopment}} {{has led to}} {{a better}} business environment and a better image of the downtown by residents throughout the county with 80% of county residents reporting they visit Downtown and 82% saying they have an improved view of Downtown according to a Siena Research Institute survey commissioned by Metroplex in 2008. On January 8, 2007 however, US News & World Report published an article in which the author discussed the city's industrial past, as home to General Electric and the American Locomotive Company, and then the city’s steady loss of thousands of GE jobs and the closure of the locomotive plant in the late 1960s as emblematic of Upstate New York's urban decline. Schenectady Mayor Brian Stratton responded in a letter to US News that was published in January 29-February 6 edition citing that the article failed to note the $150 million invested in downtown over the previous three years, including <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>movie</b> theater, hotel, restaurants, offices, and Proctor's expansion. Redevelopment of Downtown Schenectady continues, especially along State Street near Proctor's Theatre, with the Metroplex Development Authority's purchase of the Foster Building at 508 State Street along with the neighboring parcels of 510 and 512 State Street and 204 Lafayette Street. The Foster Building is a former hotel on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the failure}} of , Cannon Films {{considered}} producing a fifth film with Albert Pyun as director. Cannon's bankruptcy resulted in the film rights reverting to Ilya and Alexander Salkind. Ilya Salkind wrote the story for Superman V (also known as Superman: <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Movie)</b> with Superboy writers Cary Bates and Mark Jones in the early-1990s. The story had Superman dying and resurrecting in the shrunken, bottled Krypton city of Kandor. The premise of Superman's death and rebirth coincidentally predated [...] "The Death of Superman". Salkind, Bates and Jones developed two drafts of the script, with Christopher Reeve set to reprise the title role.|$|E
500|$|In three weeks, the Coens wrote {{a script}} with a title role written {{specifically}} for actor John Turturro, with whom they'd {{been working on}} Miller's Crossing. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>movie,</b> Barton Fink, was set in a large, seemingly-abandoned hotel. This setting, which they named the Hotel Earle, was a {{driving force behind the}} story and mood of the new project. While filming their 1984 film Blood Simple in Austin, Texas, the Coens had seen a hotel which made a significant impression: [...] "We thought, 'Wow, Motel Hell.' You know, being condemned to live in the weirdest hotel in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Star Trek cast—who {{had agreed}} to appear in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>movie,</b> with contracts as-yet unsigned pending script approval—grew anxious about the constant delays, and pragmatically accepted other acting offers while Roddenberry worked with Paramount. The studio decided to turn the project over to the television division, reasoning that since {{the roots of the}} franchise lay in television the writers would be able to develop the right script. A number of screenwriters offered up ideas that were summarily rejected. As Paramount executives' interest in the film began to wane, Roddenberry, backed by fan letters, applied pressure to the studio. In June 1976, Paramount assigned Jerry Isenberg, a young and active producer, to be executive producer of the project, with the budget expanded to $8 million. Povill was tasked with finding more writers to develop a script. His list included Edward Anhalt, James Goldman, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Ernest Lehman and Robert Bloch. To cap off his list, Povill put as his last recommendation [...] "Jon Povill—almost credit: Star Trek II story (with Roddenberry). Will be a big shot some day. Should be hired now while he is cheap and humble." [...] The end result was a compiled list of 34 names, none of whom were ever chosen to pen the script. Finally, British screenwriters Chris Bryant and Allan Scott, who had penned the Donald Sutherland thriller Don't Look Now were hired to write a script. Bryant believed he earned the screenwriting assignment because his view of Kirk resembled what Roddenberry modeled him on; [...] "one of Horatio Nelson's captains in the South Pacific, six months away from home and three months away by communication". Povill also wrote up a list of possible directors, including Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Lucas and Robert Wise, but all were busy at the time (or were not willing to work on the small script money budget). Philip Kaufman signed on to direct and was given a crash course in the series. Roddenberry screened ten episodes from the original series for Kaufman, including the most representative of the show and those he considered most popular: [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever", [...] "The Devil in the Dark", [...] "Amok Time", [...] "Journey to Babel", [...] "", [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles", [...] "", [...] "The Corbomite Maneuver", [...] "" [...] and [...] "". Early work was promising and, by the fall of 1976, the project was building momentum.|$|E

2500|$|The Klingon language's {{prevalence}} is {{not limited}} to books; a three-disc video game, , requires players to learn the language to advance. In May 2009, a joint collaboration between the KLI, Simon & Schuster, and Ultralingua launched the Klingon Language Suite for the iPhone concurrent with the release of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>movie.</b> The popularity of the language meant that in 1996 it was considered the fastest-growing constructed language, ahead of other languages such as Tolkien's Elvish or Esperanto. While the language is widespread, mastery of the language is extremely uncommon; there are only around a dozen fluent speakers of the language. Okrand himself is not fluent, and the actors who speak the language in the Star Trek series are more concerned with its expression than the actual grammar. According to the 2006 edition of Guinness World Records, Klingon is the most spoken fictional language by number of speakers, Klingon is one of many language interfaces in the Google search engine, and a Klingon character was included in the [...] before its May 2010 update, when it was replaced by a Geʿez character.|$|E
2500|$|Reviews in the {{conservative}} press were more mixed.

[...] Jack Hunter, contributing editor to The American Conservative, wrote, [...] "If you ask the average film critic about <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>movie</b> adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged they will tell you it is a horrible movie. If you ask the average conservative or libertarian they will tell you it is a great movie. Objectively, it is a mediocre movie at best. Subjectively, {{it is one of the}} best mediocre movies you'll ever see." [...] In the National Post, Peter Foster credited the movie for the daunting job of fidelity to the novel, wryly suggested a plot rewrite along the lines of comparable current events, and concluded, [...] "if it sinks without trace, its backers should at least be proud that they lost their own money." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bawer commented {{frequently}} {{on the treatment}} of gays in the films and TV. In a March 10, 1996, Times article, Bawer argued that while new films from Britain, the Netherlands, France, and Germany provided fresh, human treatments of gay people, most Hollywood movies about gays continued to be timid, banal, and formulaic. [...] On April 14, 1996, Bawer said on the CBS Evening News, apropos of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>movie</b> “The Birdcage,” that “A good farce has one foot in reality. A gay person {{going to see this}} movie realizes this movie doesn't have a single foot in reality.” A writer for The Guardian cited Bawer's complaint about the makers of “The Birdcage”: “They don't get gay life. They don't get anything, outside of a narrow Hollywood idea of gay life. These characters have no dignity, nor pride.” Bawer was a major subject of Angela D. Dillard's 2001 book Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Now? Multicultural Conservatism in America. Reviewing it for Salon, he described it as a book written from “the heart of Academic Country, where the very existence of conservatives who are not straight white males can indeed generate horror and confusion (or, alternatively, amusement, perhaps bordering on clinical hysteria), and where, as surely as a multiplicity of genders, skin colors, ethnic backgrounds and sexual orientations is the collective dream, a multiplicity of viewpoints is the collective nightmare.” He chided Dillard's account of “gay conservative” as ill-informed and criticized her for, among other things, including him on “a list of people who have 'sided with the Religious Right'—even though I wrote 'Stealing Jesus' (1997), which indicts fundamentalism as a betrayal of Christianity.” ...|$|E
