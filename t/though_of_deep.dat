In the card scene, the lively duet for Frasquita and Mercédès turns ominous when Carmen intervenes; the fate motif underlines her premonition of death. Micaëla's aria, after her entry in search of José, is a conventional piece, <b>though</b> <b>of</b> <b>deep</b> feeling, preceded and concluded by horn calls. The middle part of the act is occupied by Escamillo and José, now acknowledged as rivals for Carmen's favour. The music reflects their contrasting attitudes: Escamillo remains, says Newman, [...] "invincibly polite and ironic", while José is sullen and aggressive. When Micaëla pleads with José to go with her to his mother, the harshness of Carmen's music reveals her most unsympathetic side. As José departs, vowing to return, the fate theme is heard briefly in the woodwind.

5000|$|The {{prelude to}} act 1 {{combines}} three recurrent themes: {{the entry of}} the bullfighters from act 4, the refrain from the Toreador Song from act 2, and the motif that, in two slightly differing forms, represents both Carmen herself and the fate that she personifies. This motif, played on clarinet, bassoon, cornet and cellos over tremolo strings, concludes the prelude with an abrupt crescendo. When the curtain rises a light and sunny atmosphere is soon established, and pervades the opening scenes. The mock solemnities of {{the changing of the}} guard, and the flirtatious exchanges between the townsfolk and the factory girls, precede a mood change when a brief phrase from the fate motif announces Carmen's entrance. After her provocative habanera, with its persistent insidious rhythm and changes of key, the fate motif sounds in full when Carmen throws her flower to José before departing. This action elicits from José a passionate A major solo that Dean suggests is the turning-point in his musical characterisation. The softer vein returns briefly, as Micaëla reappears and joins with José in a duet to a warm clarinet and strings accompaniment. The tranquillity is shattered by the women's noisy quarrel, Carmen's dramatic re-entry and her defiant interaction with Zuniga. After her beguiling [...] "Seguidilla" [...] provokes José to an exasperated high A sharp shout, Carmen's escape is preceded by the brief but disconcerting reprise of a fragment from the habanera. Bizet revised this finale several times to increase its dramatic effect.Act 2 begins with a short prelude, based on a melody that José will sing offstage before his next entry. A festive scene in the inn precedes Escamillo's tumultuous entrance, in which brass and percussion provide prominent backing while the crowd sings along. The quintet that follows is described by Newman as [...] "of incomparable verve and musical wit". José's appearance precipitates a long mutual wooing scene; Carmen sings, dances and plays the castanets; a distant cornet-call summoning José to duty is blended with Carmen's melody so as to be barely discernible. A muted reference to the fate motif on an English horn leads to José's [...] "Flower Song", a flowing continuous melody that ends pianissimo on a sustained high B-flat. José's insistence that, despite Carmen's blandishments, he must return to duty leads to a quarrel; the arrival of Zuniga, the consequent fight and José's unavoidable ensnarement into the lawless life culminates musically in the triumphant hymn to freedom that closes the act.The prelude to act 3 was originally intended for Bizet's L'Arlésienne score. Newman describes it as [...] "an exquisite miniature, with much dialoguing and intertwining between the woodwind instruments".

The confident, off-stage sound of the departing Escamillo singing the toreador's refrain provides a distinct contrast to José's increasing desperation.The final act is prefaced with a lively orchestral piece derived from Manuel García's short operetta El Criado Fingido. After the opening crowd scene, the bullfighters' march is led by the children's chorus; the crowd hails Escamillo before his short love scene with Carmen. The long finale, in which José makes his last pleas to Carmen and is decisively rejected, is punctuated at critical moments by enthusiastic off-stage shouts from the bullfighting arena. As José kills Carmen, the chorus sing the refrain of the Toreador Song off-stage; the fate motif, which has been suggestively present at various points during the act, is heard fortissimo, together with a brief reference to Carmen's card scene music. Jose's last words of love and despair are followed by a final long chord, on which the curtain falls without further musical or vocal comment.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCarbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) will not reach its full {{greenhouse}} gas emissions mitigation potential without harnessing the vast storage resource thought to exist within deep saline formations. These formations occur within most sedimentary basins and are defined, in part, by containing interstitial formation fluid that is unfit or uneconomic for current or future use. <b>Though</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>deep</b> saline sedimentary successions may be well understood, most have not been characterized in detail for CO 2 storage. Knowledge of critical reservoir parameters is therefore usually insufficient to accurately define storage systems within them at the range of spatial and temporal scales required for a CO 2 injection site. Previous reconnaissance studies are a useful starting point for CO 2 storage system appraisal where exploration survey data exists. This study screens likely storage locations within the onshore Gippsland Basin in eastern Victoria, southeastern Australia. The most prospective system is close to industrial CO 2 emissions nodes and comprises suitable stratigraphy at appropriate depth. However, new geological characterization suggests existing interpretations are unsatisfactory and the opportunity for CO 2 storage {{there may be more}} limited and challenging than initially thought...|$|R

6000|$|Those student days in Paris {{were days}} of hunger and cold, very often, which Millet bore with the steady {{endurance}} of a Norman peasant boy. But {{they were also}} days of something worse to him--of effort misdirected, and of constant struggling against a system {{for which he was}} not fitted. In fact, Millet was an original genius, whereas the teachers at the School of Fine Arts were careful and methodical rule-of-thumb martinets. They wished to train Millet into the ordinary pattern, which he could not follow; and in the end, he left the school, and attached himself to the studio of Paul Delaroche, then the greatest painter of historical pictures in all Paris. But even Delaroche, <b>though</b> an artist <b>of</b> <b>deep</b> feeling and power, did not fully understand his young Norman pupil. He himself used to paint historical pictures in the grand style, full of richness and beauty; but his subjects were almost always chosen from the lives of kings or queens, and treated with corresponding calmness and dignity. [...] "The Young Princes in the Tower," [...] "The Execution of Marie Antoinette," [...] "The Death of Queen Elizabeth," [...] "Cromwell viewing the Body of Charles I."--these were the kind of pictures on which Delaroche loved to employ himself. Millet, on the other hand, <b>though</b> also full <b>of</b> dignity and pathos, together with an earnestness far surpassing Delaroche's, did not care for these lofty subjects. It was the dignity and pathos of labour that moved him most; the silent, weary, noble lives of the uncomplaining peasants, amongst whom his own days had been mostly passed. Delaroche could not make him out at all; he was such a curious, incomprehensible, odd young fellow!
