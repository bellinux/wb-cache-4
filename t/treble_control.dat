2500|$|A simple, {{inexpensive}} amplifier {{may have}} only two tone controls, a passive bass and <b>treble</b> <b>control.</b> In some better quality amps, one or more midrange controls are provided. On the most expensive amps, there may be shelving equalizers for bass and treble, a number of mid-range controls (e.g., low mid, mid and high mid), and a graphic equalizer or parametric equalizer. [...] The amplifier's master volume control restricts the amount of signal permitted through to the driver stage and the power amplifier. [...] When using a power attenuator with a tube amplifier, the master volume no longer acts as the master volume control. Instead, the power attenuator's attenuation control controls the power delivered to the speaker, and the amplifier's master volume control determines the amount of power-tube distortion. Power-supply based power reduction is controlled by a knob on the tube power amp, variously labeled [...] "wattage", [...] "power", [...] "scale", [...] "power scale", or [...] "power dampening".|$|E

5000|$|... where fp and fz {{are called}} the pole and zero frequencies, respectively. Turning down the <b>treble</b> <b>control</b> {{increases}} fz and decreases fp so that frequences higher than fp are attenuated. Turning up the <b>treble</b> <b>control</b> increases fp and decreases fz so that frequencies higher than fz are boosted. Setting the <b>treble</b> <b>control</b> at the center sets fz = fp so that |H(f)|2=1 and the circuit has no effect. At most, {{the slope of the}} filter response in the transition region will be 6 dB per octave (thus a doubling of signal voltage and a consequent quadrupling of signal power for every doubling of frequency).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>TREBLE</b> <b>control</b> was {{the same}} as found in many Fender {{amplifiers}} of the time (i.e., Pro Amp -6G5A-, the Super -6G4A-, the Showman -6G14-, the Vibrolux -6G11-). It was fitted with a [...] "tapped" [...] treble circuit, meaning that the <b>treble</b> <b>control</b> is [...] "flat" [...] at setting [...] "5"; cutting or boosting the treble was possible by turning the knob down (below [...] "5") or up (above [...] "5"), respectively.|$|E

5000|$|The Kalamazoo Reverb 12 was {{introduced}} as a larger, more powerful amplifier, boasting a 12W push-pull tube driven output through a 10" [...] speaker. The Reverb 12 featured a better tremolo circuit than the Model 2, including depth control along with frequency. The tone was managed by individual bass and <b>treble</b> <b>controls</b> {{as opposed to}} the single tone control on earlier models, and boasted a spring reverb.|$|R
50|$|Further channel {{controls}} {{affect the}} equalization {{of the signal}} by separately attenuating or boosting a range of frequencies. The smallest, least expensive mixers may only have bass and <b>treble</b> <b>controls.</b> Most mid-range and higher-priced mixers have bass, midrange, and treble, or even additional mid-range controls (e.g., low-mid and high-mid). Many high-end mixing consoles have a parametric equalizer on each channel. Some mixers have a general equalization control (either graphic or parametric) at the output, for controlling {{the tone of the}} overall mix.|$|R
5000|$|The 5F4 model had Presence, Bass, and <b>Treble</b> <b>controls,</b> and {{separate}} Volume controls for {{the microphone and}} instrument inputs. It used 12AY7 pre-amplifier tubes for [...] "more clarity and headroom" [...] than a 12AX7 would. A fixed-bias output stage and split-phase inverters helped the Super overdrive more quickly than the Fender Bassman and produce a sound that, according to Vintage Guitar's Dave Hunter, [...] "in the estimation of many a vintage-amp fan, is among the sweetest and most delectable of any amp ever made." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tone {{controls}} (usually designated [...] "bass" [...] and [...] "treble") {{are simple}} shelving filters included in most hi-fi equipment for gross adjustment {{of the frequency}} balance. The bass control may be used, for instance, to increase the drum and bass parts at a dance party, or to reduce annoying bass sounds when listening to a person speaking. The <b>treble</b> <b>control</b> {{might be used to}} give the percussion a sharper or more [...] "brilliant" [...] sound, or can be used to cut such high frequencies when they have been overemphasized in the program material or simply to accommodate a listener's preference.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961, a new Princeton (6G2) of {{fundamentally}} different design was introduced, which {{instead of being}} essentially an upgraded Champ {{was more like a}} junior Deluxe. This [...] "brownface" [...] version used a single 7025 dual triode in the preamplifier; a 12AX7 dual triode, one half of which operated a tremolo oscillator and the other half of which served as a split-load phase inverter; and two 6V6GT tubes, which were fixed-biased in Class AB push-pull configuration in the power section. In 1963, the single tone control was replaced with individual bass and <b>treble</b> <b>control</b> knobs, and the base Princeton was joined by the Princeton Reverb. A pull-out [...] "boost" [...] switch was added to the volume pot in 1978.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, the Jaguar Bass Special was {{introduced}} {{with the choice}} of P/J ("P" [...] as in Fender Precision Bass and [...] "J" [...] as in Fender Jazz Bass, and mixes the sounds of both) or single humbucker pickups and Jazz Bass knobs/control plate. While the Jaguar Bass Special features a split-coil Precision neck pickup and a single-coil Jazz Bass bridge pickup paired with an active bass boost circuit and <b>treble</b> <b>control,</b> the Jaguar Bass Special HB uses a high-output humbucking pickup and a 3-band active EQ. Other features include a solid basswood or agathis body (depending the finish) and a maple neck with a 20-fret rosewood fretboard and pearloid dot inlays. The 5-string version {{was introduced}} in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Filtering audio {{frequencies}} {{dates back}} at least to acoustic telegraphy and multiplexing in general. Audio electronic equipment evolved to incorporate filtering elements as consoles in radio stations began to be used for recording as much as broadcast. Early filters included basic bass and <b>treble</b> <b>controls</b> featuring fixed frequency centers, and fixed levels of cut or boost. These filters worked over broad frequency ranges. Variable equalization in audio reproduction was first used by John Volkman working at RCA in the 1920s. That system was used to equalize a motion picture theater sound playback system.|$|R

5000|$|Jim Kelley Amplifiers is the {{trademark}} for the vacuum tube guitar amplifiers designed by Jim Kelley and manufactured by his company Active Guitar Electronics of Tustin, California between {{the years of}} 1978 and 1985. Approximately 600 of these amps were built during that time. The single channel version of the amplifier employed modest gain in the preamp stages, Baxandall type bass and <b>treble</b> <b>controls,</b> a split load phase inverter, and four 6V6GT output tubes. The amplifiers produce 60 watts RMS at full power, and include a half power (30/60) switch.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the range}} of {{equalization}} functions is governed by the theory of linear filters, the adjustment of those functions and the flexibility with which they can be adjusted varies according to the topology of the circuitry and controls presented to the user. Shelving controls are usually simple first-order filter functions which alter the relative gains between frequencies much higher and {{much lower than the}} cutoff frequencies. A low shelf, such as the bass control on most hi-fi equipment, is adjusted to affect the gain of lower frequencies while having no effect well above its cutoff frequency. A high shelf, such as a <b>treble</b> <b>control,</b> adjusts the gain of higher frequencies only. These are broad adjustments designed more to increase the listener's satisfaction than to provide actual equalization in the strict sense of the term.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{controls}} on bass amps: switches and rotary knobs. The simplest, least expensive practice amps and combo amps may {{only have a few}} switches and knobs, such as an [...] "on/off" [...] switch, a volume knob, and a bass and <b>treble</b> <b>control</b> knob. Mid-priced models may add additional tone controls (e.g., one, two or three [...] "midrange" [...] controls and a [...] "presence" [...] knob for very high frequencies) and/or add a second type of volume knob called a [...] "gain", [...] "preamplifier" [...] (or [...] "preamp"/"pre"), or [...] "drive" [...] (short for [...] "overdrive") control. A good selection of equalizer knobs and gain stages is standard on expensive amplifiers. If an amp has one or more preamp or gain knobs, the second volume knob may be called [...] "master", [...] "volume" [...] or [...] "post".|$|E
5000|$|The {{simplest}} guitar amplifiers, such as some vintage amps {{and modern}} practice amps, {{have only a}} single volume control. Most have two volume controls: a first volume control called [...] "preamplifier" [...] or [...] "gain" [...] and a master volume control. The preamp or gain control is designed differently on different types of guitar amps. On an amp designed for an acoustic guitar, turning up the preamp knob will preamplify the signal, but even at its maximum setting, the preamp control is unlikely to produce much overdrive. However, with amps designed for electric guitarists playing electric blues, hard rock and heavy metal music, turning up the preamp or gain knob will usually produce overdrive or distortion. Some electric guitar amps have three controls in the volume section: preamplifier, distortion and master control. Turning up the preamp and distortion knobs in varying combinations can create a range of overdrive tones, from a gentle, warm growling overdrive suitable for a traditional blues show or a rockabilly band to the extreme distortion used in hardcore punk and death metal. On some electric guitar amps, the [...] "gain" [...] knob {{is equivalent to the}} distortion control on a distortion pedal, and similarly may have a side-effect of changing the proportion of bass and treble sent to the next stage.A simple, inexpensive amplifier may have only two tone controls, a passive bass and <b>treble</b> <b>control.</b> In some better quality amps, one or more midrange controls are provided. On the most expensive amps, there may be shelving equalizers for bass and treble, a number of mid-range controls (e.g., low mid, mid and high mid), and a graphic equalizer or parametric equalizer. The amplifier's master volume control restricts the amount of signal permitted through to the driver stage and the power amplifier. When using a power attenuator with a tube amplifier, the master volume no longer acts as the master volume control. Instead, the power attenuator's attenuation control controls the power delivered to the speaker, and the amplifier's master volume control determines the amount of power-tube distortion. Power-supply based power reduction is controlled by a knob on the tube power amp, variously labeled [...] "wattage", [...] "power", [...] "scale", [...] "power scale", or [...] "power dampening".|$|E
2500|$|Typically, guitar {{amplifiers}} {{have two}} amplifying circuit stages {{and in addition}} frequently have tone-shaping electric circuits, which usually include at least bass and <b>treble</b> <b>controls,</b> which function similarly to the equivalent controls on a home hi-fi system. More expensive amplifiers typically have more controls for other frequency ranges, such as one or two [...] "midrange" [...] controls and a [...] "presence" [...] control for high frequencies. Some guitar amplifiers have a graphic equalizer, which uses vertical faders to control multiple frequency bands. Some more expensive bass amps have a parametric equalizer, which enables precise control of tone.|$|R
5000|$|For a time, Bigsby lost {{interest}} in the project—but Crooks kept working on his design. After several months, {{he came up with}} a design he was satisfied with. Its cabinet featured padded Naugahyde, aluminum guards around the cabinet, a lighted control panel, a JBL D-130 speaker, and independent bass and <b>treble</b> <b>controls.</b> Crooks's amplifier was both visually and sonorously appealing. He used his shop's name [...] "Standel" [...] as the amplifier's brand. He called the model the 25L15, because it had 25 watts of power and a Lansing 15-inch speaker. Bigsby eventually purchased a Standel 25L15, #1018 on April 10, 1954.|$|R
5000|$|The RP38 VHF Hunter was {{released}} in 1969, and {{was intended to be}} an [...] "economy" [...] set. It had MW, LW and VHF coverage, but with a cheaper combined tuner section (which was more in line with the majority of sets at the time anyway), and a simplified audio amplifier that lacked the separate bass and <b>treble</b> <b>controls</b> of the Heralds and Sovereigns. The cabinet was also cheaper to make and lacked a turntable. Initial models used the same 5" [...] by 8" [...] Goodmans loudspeaker as the contemporary RP35 Herald/RP25 Sovereign, but a model from Elac quickly replaced this.|$|R
40|$|The audio power {{amplifier}} {{is used to}} amplify low-power audio signals to a level that can be suitable for driving the loudspeakers. Thus the audio {{power amplifier}} {{becomes a kind of}} essential part in the electronics that could make sounds. In this thesis, a good performance audio power amplifier with tonality control is designed. It consists of three parts: pre-amplifier unit, the tonality control unit and the power amplifier unit. In the pre-amplifier unit, a TL 071 CP operational amplifier is applied, to amplify the low signal to be suitable for the tonality control unit. For the tonality control unit, a filter is used to achieve bass and <b>treble</b> <b>control,</b> resulting in different frequency response. In the last part, the low voltage power amplifier LM 386 N- 1 is used. The results of simulation in Multisim show a good output waveform and different frequency response with the tonality control. Also the pure sound can be heard by ear clearly. The good simulation result offers the encouragement to build the circuit on the board and do the measurement. The measured results show a good output waveform, the output power 256 mW, THD 4. 7 %, the maximum voltage gain 40 etc. Meanwhile, sound can be heard by ear clearly with the tonality control. Judging from the results, the audio power amplifier is designed successfully...|$|E
2500|$|Equalizers are {{electronic}} devices that allow audio engineers {{to control the}} tone and frequencies of the sound in a channel, group (e.g., all the mics on a drumkit) or an entire stage's mix. The bass and <b>treble</b> <b>controls</b> on a home stereo are a simple type of equalizer. Equalizers exist in pro sound reinforcement systems in three forms: shelving equalizers (typically for {{a whole range of}} bass and treble frequencies), graphic equalizers and parametric equalizers. Graphic equalizers have faders (vertical slide controls) which together resemble a frequency response curve plotted on a graph. The faders can be used to boost or cut specific frequency bands.|$|R
50|$|A {{first order}} filter {{can alter the}} {{response}} of frequencies above and below a point. In the transition region the filter response will have a slope of up to 6 dB per octave. The bass and <b>treble</b> <b>controls</b> in a hi-fi system are each a first order filter in which the balance of frequencies above and below a point are varied using a single knob. A special case of first order filters is a first order high-pass or low-pass filter in which the 6 dB per octave cut of low or high frequencies extends indefinitely. These are the simplest of all filters to implement individually, requiring only a capacitor and resistor.|$|R

5000|$|Much {{later the}} concept was applied in audio {{engineering}} to adjust the frequency response in recording, reproduction, and live sound reinforcement systems. Sound engineers correct the frequency response of a sound system so that the frequency balance of the music as heard through speakers better matches the original performance {{picked up by a}} microphone. Audio amplifiers have long had filters or controls to modify their frequency response. These are most often in the form of variable bass and <b>treble</b> <b>controls</b> (shelving filters), and switches to apply low-cut or high-cut filters for elimination of low frequency [...] "rumble" [...] and high frequency [...] "hiss" [...] respectively.|$|R
50|$|The next Herald, the RP30, {{retained}} the same loudspeaker and grill, {{but had a}} restyled cabinet that {{retained the}} padded leathercloth, which was available in charcoal black, blue or red (the latter with brass trim). The electronic design was revised, and the audio amplifier was rather more complex, incorporating rotary bass and <b>treble</b> <b>controls.</b> Coverage was MW and LW as before, but a version including short wave (16.5 to 50 metres) was offered (the RP31SW). Later, another version offering Marine Band (70 to 200 metres) in addition to MW and LW was released (the RP32), but this sold in relatively small numbers, and few exist today. These sets continued to use the Mullard AF11x-series of transistors.|$|R
