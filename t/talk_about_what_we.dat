But none of these things bore marks of any kind, and indeed they were so much decayed as to convince us that they had lain in the condition in which we found them for many years.|$|E

This conception of the Third Persona relates to the First Persona, the [...] "I" [...] in discourse (a speaker and their intent), and the second persona, the [...] "you" [...] in discourse. Third Persona is [...] "the 'it' that is not present, that is objectified {{in a way that}} 'you' and 'I' are not." [...] Third Persona, as a theory, seeks to define and critique the rules of rhetoric, to further consider how we <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> talk about—the discourse of discourse—and who is affected by that discourse. [...] The concept of the third persona encourages examination of who (what category of implied audience) is implicitly excluded from a discourse, why they are excluded, and what this can tell us about how that discourse participates in larger networks of social or political power.|$|E

In the Endless Harmony documentary, Wilson described the song as [...] "what children everywhere go through ... wouldn't it be nice if we were older, or could run away and get married". Wilson added in 1996, [...] "'Wouldn't It Be Nice' was not a real long song, but it's a very 'up' song.

5000|$|Toward {{completion}} of the gruelling recording sessions for English Electric (2013), there were internal doubts about the band's future. Morale had risen after several months of touring the album, however. Keyboardist Paul Humphreys said in August 2013: [...] "We're already <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> should be doing next. We've got a great idea for a new album actually."

5000|$|In the posthumously {{published}} Sense and Sensibilia (the {{title is}} Austin's own, and wittily echoes {{the title of}} Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen's first book, just as his name echoes hers), Austin criticizes the claims put forward by A. J. Ayer's The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge (1940), {{and to a lesser}} extent, H.H. Price’s Perception (1932) and G.J. Warnock’s Berkley (1953), concerning the sense-data theory. He states that perceptual variation, which can be attributed to physical causes, does not involve a figurative disconnect between sense and reference, due to an unreasonable separation of parts from the perceived object. Central to his argument, he shows that [...] "there is no one kind of thing that we ‘perceive’ but many different kinds, the number being reducible if at all by scientific investigation and not by philosophy" [...] (Austin 1962a, 4). Austin argues that Ayer fails to understand the proper function of such words as [...] "illusion", [...] "delusion", [...] "hallucination", [...] "looks", [...] "appears" [...] and [...] "seems", and uses them instead in a [...] "special way...invented by philosophers." [...] According to Austin, normally these words allow us to express reservations about our commitment to the truth of what we are saying, and that the introduction of sense-data adds nothing to our understanding of or ability to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> see. As an example, Austin examines the word ‘real’ and contrasts the ordinary meanings of that word based on everyday language and the ways it is used by sense-data theorists. In order to determine the meaning of ‘real’ we have to consider, case by case, the ways and contexts in which it is used. By observing that it is (i) a substantive-hungry word that is sometimes a (ii) adjuster-word, as well as a (iii) dimension-word [...] and (iv) a word whose negative use [...] "wears the trousers," [...] Austin highlights its complexities. Only by doing so, according to Austin, can we avoid introducing false dichotomies.|$|E
5000|$|We had {{a meeting}} in New York when we started the tour over here. We met in New York to get {{together}} and see it as a launch-off place. Kind of had a <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were going to do. At that meeting Kerry and Derek said {{this was going to be}} the last tour and they didn't want to be on the road anymore. And you understand it; they had families. Kerry had just had a baby and Derek was just getting married. But having said that, I was married and so was John. You can change things like that; there are ways to work around that. You don't have to tour. I don't think we really toured an awful lot as Giant. I think we could have worked a lot harder at touring. We toured perhaps five or six months of the year. The rest of the year we didn't tour, which seemed a bit silly if you really want to make it or break the market. So let's go ahead and do it and capitalize on this rush we got. So it all seemed a little odd to me. It was sad. Gary Green reflects on the final Gentle Giant split In the summer of 1980, the group quietly disbanded. In 2005, Derek Shulman recalled that [...] "the creative juices just weren't flowing. I was living in Los Angeles at the time when we broke up. We weren't really sure what direction to take. I don't regret the decision we made to disband, and I'd do it again if we were to do the whole thing all over again." [...] Ray Shulman has commented: [...] "There was definitely the decision that the last tour would be the last tour. Once we knew that, we enjoyed ourselves. We decided to quit then rather than let it go on too long." [...] In an interview with Mojo in 2000, Kerry Minnear asserted [...] "(the split) wasn't because of punk, it was because we had lost our way musically." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Water {{management}} {{is one of}} the most critical and widely studied topics in what concerns proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Traditional macroscopic models of two-phase transport in PEMFCs generally assume “homogeneous ” medium and are based on the concept of volumetric averaging, thus lumping all the detailed information of the structural morphology inside a PEMFC. Mesoscopic models have the potential to reveal the underlying pore-scale mechanism of two-phase transport in PEMFCs. This paper aims to review the sate-of-the-art and perspective of the PEMFC mesoscopic two-phase transport models, mainly the pore network (PN) model and the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) model. We will <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are planning to do using the LB model as well...|$|E

From this material, our Moon formed in about a thousand years. I will explain how the properties of the Moon can be explained by this model and why the alternative ideas are either incorrect or highly improbable.
