Even though the first two Tests had been drawn the press were optimistic about the series. Lindsay Hassett said it wasn't the best team England had sent to Australia, but no other <b>tried</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> make cricket interesting.|$|E

What is my perspective now? I've fought for so many things, I've <b>tried</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> be number one and to stay on top, to look good, to be the best. And I realized that a lot of things that last and the things that matter are none of those things." ...|$|E

500|$|... "There {{are certain}} movies {{that serve as}} a {{standard}} bearer for a genre – a high water mark that filmmakers always try to hit, but seem to always come up short. To me, I think Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas is that type of film for the gangster genre. In the 21 years since the film was released, so many filmmakers have <b>tried</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> copy Goodfellas success, and so few have gotten even close to capturing the magic that Scorsese did {{in one of his}} very best films. The 21 years have been littered with a bunch of pale imitations. To that list, you can add Jonathan Hensleigh’s Kill the Irishman, which wants so desperately to be Goodfellas, and comes up so very, very short." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics. Jackson {{felt that it}} served as the episode's highlight, and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton. [...] "After a season of whining, there {{had to have been}} at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes, but she quickly became Linda Hamilton-badass, braining zombies with her foot," [...] he said. Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has <b>tried</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> convince us all she is finally came across." [...] Ryan thought that Andrea's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group. She spoke of her scene with Michonne: [...] "She'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully. When it appeared she might not live, I was, quite rightly, {{on the edge of my}} seat. And the appearance of the caped figure—towing two armless walkers, no less—was as dramatic as could be." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{report was}} {{formally}} reviewed {{by an independent}} panel set up {{in compliance with the}} Federal Advisory Committee Act. [...] This FACA panel's report gave a generally favorable review while providing many specific areas where improvements were needed. [...] The advisory committee's greatest concern was that the report <b>tried</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> be evenhanded and not overstate what we know, that it came close to leaving the impression that we know little in cases where a lot is known. [...] EPA revised the report to satisfy those concerns and published a response to each of the comments. [...] While not taking issue with the report's findings, the Government Accountability Project complained that EPA delayed releasing the report three months so that its results could be excluded from a regulatory finding about whether greenhouse gases threaten public health.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Now, if I {{can only}} save you by running for help!' she cried. 'Oh, I {{would have died}} instead! Why did you <b>try</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> deliver me?' And she turned away wildly to run for assistance.|$|R
