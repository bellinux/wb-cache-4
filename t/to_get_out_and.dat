5|$|The {{fire spread}} {{quickly in the}} high wind and, by mid-morning on Sunday, people {{abandoned}} attempts at extinguishing it and fled. The moving human mass and their bundles and carts made the lanes impassable for firemen and carriages. Pepys took a coach back into the city from Whitehall, but only reached St Paul's Cathedral before he had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> walk. Pedestrians with handcarts and goods {{were still on the}} move away from the fire, heavily weighed down. The parish churches not directly threatened were filling up with furniture and valuables, which soon had to be moved further afield.|$|E
5|$|Skin & Bone is a 1996 American drama film. It is {{the story}} of three Los Angeles-area hustlers, or male prostitutes, and their female pimp. The three men are at {{different}} stages of their hustling careers: Dean is just beginning; Billy is somewhat more experienced but still naive; and Harry actively wants <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> is looking to break into film acting. Ghislane, the pimp, sends each of the three young men into increasingly dangerous scenarios with clients, until both Billy and Harry are killed. The film stars B. Wyatt as Harry, Alan Boyce as Dean, Garret Scullin as Billy and Nicole Dillenberg as Ghislaine.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Before qualifying began on Saturday afternoon, Mercedes was forced to change the power unit in Nico Rosberg's car back to the one used in Belgium, which had already run for six full races, after finding an issue with the new specification unit. Meanwhile, Lotus was forced to borrow tyre blankets from other teams, as their own had been rendered unusable by rain during the night. When the session began, Nico Hülkenberg {{was one of the first}} out on track, but his fast lap was disrupted by Marcus Ericsson, who was later penalised for the incident. Both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen spent most of the session in the pit lane. While Ricciardo was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> set a lap sufficient to see him proceed to the second part of qualifying (Q2), Verstappen went out only to see his engine cover blown off at Curva Grande, scattering the track with debris, though at the very end of the session, so no other cars were affected. Next to Verstappen, both Manor Marussia and McLaren drivers were eliminated.|$|E

The slider was {{the pitch}} Lieber often used <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>outs</b> <b>and</b> was most {{successful}} against right-handed batters. The changeup darted away from batters. Lieber {{was not a}} hard thrower (his fastball was in the low 90mph range); he relied on controlling his pitches to have success.|$|R
25|$|If {{a player}} is in jail, {{they do not}} take a normal turn and must either pay a fine of $50 to be released, use a Chance or Community Chest Get Out of Jail Free card, or attempt to roll doubles on the dice. If a player fails to roll doubles, they lose their turn. Failing to roll doubles in three {{consecutive}} turns requires the player to either pay the $50 fine or use a Get Out of Jail Free card, after which they move ahead according to the total rolled. Players in jail may not buy properties directly from the bank, due to being unable to move, but can engage all other transactions, such as mortgaging properties, selling/trading properties to other players, buying/selling houses and hotels, collecting rent, and bidding on property auctions. A player who rolls doubles to leave jail does not roll again; however, if the player pays the fine or uses a card <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> then rolls doubles, they do take another turn.|$|E

The police have closed the area so that no people can get in or out– some tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> were shot at by police." [...] The SMC was seen as a safe place for the opposition protesters to go. By late afternoon, about 4,000 protesters had congregated at the hospital, while protesters who had gathered in the car parks near the emergency entrance chanted: [...] "Down with the regime, with our blood we will defend our rights." ...|$|E
500|$|In fall 1941 the Nazis began {{transporting}} Jews {{out of the}} ghetto. Most {{of these}} were sent to Belzec extermination camp and killed. On 13 March 1943 the ghetto was liquidated and those still fit for work {{were sent to the}} new concentration camp at Płaszów. Several thousand not deemed fit for work were sent to extermination camps and killed. Hundreds more were killed on the streets by the Nazis as they cleared out the ghetto. Schindler, aware of the planned action because of his Wehrmacht contacts, had his workers stay at the factory overnight to prevent them coming to any harm. Schindler witnessed the liquidation of the ghetto and was appalled. From that point forward, says Schindlerjude Sol Urbach, Schindler [...] "changed his mind about the Nazis.

Paschall was pinned in the wreckage. Frink, who was seriously wounded, urged Astorga <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> away from the aircraft. A few moments later advancing North Vietnamese soldiers fired on the wreckage with automatic weapons and the aircraft's fuel cell exploded with the remainder of the crew inside. Astorga was captured but pilots 1st Lt. Byron Kulland and WO John Frink along with SP5 Ronald Paschall were killed.|$|E

[...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it." [...] Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that [...] "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates." ...|$|E

On arrival in Dongo, they met Bellini delle Stelle, who was the local {{partisan}} commander, to arrange for Mussolini to be handed over to them. Audisio used the nom de guerre of [...] "Colonel Valerio" [...] during his mission. In the afternoon, he, with other partisans, including Aldo Lampredi and Michele Moretti, drove to the De Maria family's farmhouse to collect Mussolini and Petacci. After they were picked up, they drove a short distance to the village of Giulino de Mezzegra. The vehicle pulled up at the entrance of the Villa Belmonte on a narrow road known as via XXIV maggio (approximate coordinates: [...] ) and Mussolini and Petacci were told <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> stand by the villa's wall. Audisio then shot them at 4:10p.m. with a submachine gun borrowed from Moretti, his own gun having jammed.|$|E

It was her first concert tour since the Glassheart Tour in 2013. Spanning fourteen shows visiting various concert halls and theatres in England, Scotland and Wales, the tour began at the Liverpool Empire Theatre on 21 February and concluded at the Plymouth Pavilions on 11 March; it also included two dates at the London Palladium. Lewis announced the tour on 11 September 2015 and tickets went on sale a week later on 18 September. Speaking about touring again, Lewis said that she was [...] "So so excited to announce a 2016 UK Tour! I cannot wait <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> perform all the new songs for you and some old favourites too!" [...] In an interview for What's On magazine in December 2015, Lewis revealed that she had originally planned for the tour to be longer, but decided to shorten it in order to spend time with family and friends and start writing songs for her sixth studio album sooner.|$|E

[...] Pearl Jam faced a relentless touring schedule for Ten. Drummer Dave Abbruzzese joined the band for Pearl Jam's live shows supporting the album. Halfway through its own planned North American tour, Pearl Jam cancelled the remaining dates in order to take a slot opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the band's Blood Sugar Sex Magik tour in the fall of 1991 in North America. The spot was arranged by Jack Irons, who had called his former band asking for them to get an opportunity to his friend Vedder. The Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana were also supporting acts. Nirvana was initially brought in because the tour promoters [...] decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act, but the departure of The Smashing Pumpkins still kept the group in the concert bill. Epic executive Michael Goldstone observed that [...] "the band did such an amazing job opening the Chili Peppers tour that it opened doors at radio." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{critical}} reviews were mixed, {{the game}} proved popular with players. The game's alpha footage, {{as well as}} Let's Play videos on pre-release copies such as that from PewDiePie, drew {{a great deal of}} demand for the game prior to release. Ibrisagic stated that Coffee Stain Studios made their money back on the development costs within a few minutes of the game being offered on Steam. As of August 2014, the studio has reported that nearly a million copies of Goat Simulator have been sold, outperforming their other games over the previous four years. The mobile release for iOS and Android systems reached 100,000 downloads within 6 days of launch. By mid-January 2015, over 2.5 million copies of the game were sold across all platforms. During a presentation at the 2016 Game Developers Conference, Ibrisagic revealed that Goat Simulator has made more than $12 million in revenue, compared to both Sanctum and Sanctum 2 which made under $2 million each. Goat Simulator was seen as a disruptive title in contrast to typical AAA titles; Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester felt they needed to publish more games like Goat Simulator, stating [...] "You have to have an edge in there, and that's why I say 'more Goat Simulator and less Call of Duty' for Paradox, because we need the edge. It's easier <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> market, it's easier to show what you're doing" [...] adding that [...] "People are tired of explosions and dubstep music.

[...] Titled by his fans the Evolution 8701 Tour, the original tour plan—to which Usher would perform in venues that held 5,000 to 12,000 seats—was postponed, due to Usher dislocating his shoulder during a rehearsal. Once recovered, Usher announced new tour dates, and commented: [...] "I'm really looking forward <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> performing live onstage. Now that my arm is healed, I'm ready <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> there <b>and</b> interact with my fans. Nothing compares to that excitement and energy."
