500|$|David is an android {{that acts}} as the ship's butler and {{maintenance}} man. It {{is designed to be}} indistinguishable from humans, and begins to develop [...] "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy". Writer Damon Lindelof stated that the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, [...] "what does the movie look like from the robot's point of view? If you were to ask him, 'What do you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> of this? What's going on? What do you think about these humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to answer those questions?" [...] Fassbender said, [...] "David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance". In developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), and instead studied the replicants in Scott's 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, with a focus on Sean Young's character Rachael, whose [...] "vacancy" [...] and longing for a soul interested him. Fassbender drew further inspiration from the voice of the HAL 9000 computer in , the [...] "funny walk and economy of movement" [...] of Olympic diver Greg Louganis, and the performances of David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Dirk Bogarde in The Servant, and Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. David's blond hair was modeled on that of T. E. Lawrence. Scott favored Fassbender for the role; by January 2011 he was confirmed to have joined the cast, despite earlier reports that his agents had sought too high a fee.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} Jeremy Davies character Daniel Faraday. Daniel {{was introduced in the}} fourth season and was originally intended to be a minor character only. However, his quiet demeanor and seemingly good heart made him a favorite with the fans, so Lindelof and Cuse decided to expand Daniel's role, which has led to him being a key player in Losts eventual resolution. In response to Daniel's death, Cuse said, [...] "It was an incredibly painful thing to kill this beloved character, but we feel that’s what this show has to do. His death is kind of the culminating event in the entire season. It really ends one chapter and commences the start of the final chapter of the entire series." [...] Once the show runners explained that to Davies, he was saddened that his full-time status on Lost was coming to an end, but put the story [...] "above his own personal self". Damon seconded Carlton's emotions, adding that Jeremy took the news well: [...] "When Carlton and I called Jeremy to explain what was going to be happening with Daniel, we’ve never had a more awesome exit interview with somebody on the show. For us, Daniel really was the cornerstone of the fifth season – he really shined. I can’t imagine what Season 5 would have looked like without Jeremy Davies. When you <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the crazy stuff that had to come out of that guy’s mouth, for him to be as interesting and emotional and poetic as he was is really extraordinary." [...] The cast of the show said Davies would be missed, though he may not be done with Lost — Carlton commented that Jeremy's [...] "full-time" [...] status was over, but dead characters have been known to reappear on the show. Michael Emerson, who plays Ben, said Davies was [...] "a great sensitive guy who got deep into his character, he really lived it." ...|$|E

[...] Instead of dwelling on the past he is continually looking forward, [...] "You have to crank yourself {{up every morning and}} <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the awful stuff you did yesterday, and how you can compensate for that by doing better today." [...] He does not read reviews of his work as he already knows – [...] "better than any reviewer" [...] – the places in which its faults lie.|$|E

I don’t think most people <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the work that happens behind the scenes. And it should be that way. The viewers should {{be caught up in}} the show. Anyway, it doesn’t come up much. I do have a niece who thinks it’s pretty cool. And I {{impressed}} a bunch of third-graders at career day at my daughter’s school. But they were much more excited by the work I did for the [...] Go figure...And drawing for [...] was exceptional. It wasn’t just a one-time gig for a movie that is out in theaters for a couple weeks. It was ongoing and evolving.

[...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] is about the town of Hunstanton, where James Veck-Gilodi and bassist Lee Wilson went to school. 'It brings me back to the only place I ever really felt at home, and how much I miss it. It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads my mind to wander off and <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the people I used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we could go back to the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would be in on time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14. 'This song is just, I suppose, about how much we miss him'.|$|E

60|$|George Stephenson's {{connection}} with the locomotive, however, was even now beginning. Already, in 1816, he and his boy had tried a somewhat higher flight of mechanical and scientific skill than usual, {{in the construction of}} a sun-dial, which involves a considerable amount of careful mathematical work; and now George found that the subject of locomotive engines was being forced by circumstances upon his attention. From the moment he was appointed engine-wright of the Killingworth collieries, he began to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> possible means of hauling coal at cheaper rates from the pit's mouth to the shipping place on the river. For that humble object alone--an object that lay wholly within the line of his own special business--did the great railway projector set out upon his investigations into the possibilities of the locomotive. Indeed, in its earliest origin, the locomotive was almost entirely connected with coals and mining; its application to passenger traffic on the large scale was quite a later and secondary consideration. It was only by accident, so to speak, that the true capabilities of railways were finally discovered in the actual course of their practical employment.|$|E
