5|$|During the Article 32 hearing, the prosecution, led by Captain Ashden Fein, {{presented}} 300,000 {{pages of}} documents in evidence, including chat logs and classified material. The court heard from two Army investigators, Special Agent David Shaver, head of the digital forensics and research branch of the Army's Computer Crime Investigative Unit (CCIU); and Mark Johnson, a digital forensics contractor from ManTech International, {{who works for the}} CCIU. They testified that they had found 100,000 State Department cables on a workplace computer Manning had used between November 2009 and May 2010; 400,000 military reports from Iraq and 91,000 from Afghanistan on an SD card found in her basement room in her aunt's home in Potomac, Maryland; and 10,000 cables on her personal MacBook Pro and storage devices <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> had not been passed to WikiLeaks because a file was corrupted. They also recovered 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on Manning's MacBook hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Two of the chat handles, which used the Berlin Chaos Computer Club's domain (ccc.de), were associated with the names Julian Assange and Nathaniel Frank.|$|E
5|$|Following the Irish War of Independence the Irish Free State {{was set up}} as an {{independent}} British Dominion covering most of the island of Ireland. After a brief civil war between the pro-Free State forces {{and members of the}} Irish Republican Army (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA forced underground. The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the Irish Self-Determination League (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them. Between February and March they provided information on individuals <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil. On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL. Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty or approximately 100. The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a Royal Navy destroyer. It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England), at least six had never even been to Ireland before.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the poor could enter a field to collect {{three times a day}} — in the morning, at midday, and in the afternoon. Rabban Gamliel taught <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> this only so that landowners should not reduce the number of times {{that the poor}} could enter. Rabbi Akiva taught <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> this only so that landowners should not {{increase}} the number of times that the poor had to enter. The landowners of Beit Namer used to harvest along a rope and allowed the poor to collect a corner from every row.|$|E

25|$|The WBC {{designated}} Rahman as Vitali Klitschko's next mandatory challenger; {{the fight}} was set for April 30, 2005. Klitschko injured his thigh while training for the fight, so it was rescheduled for June 18. As this date approached, Klitschko's camp said that the thigh had not fully healed; the WBC made July 23 the new fight date. Soon after this second postponement, Vitali's doctors reportedly discovered back injuries <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> demanded minor-yet-immediate corrective surgery. The WBC pushed Rahman's title shot back again, this time to November 12; Rahman's share of the purse following this match would reportedly be around US$4.2million.|$|E

25|$|Five {{juvenile}} males—four {{black and}} one of Hispanic descent—were tried variously for assault, robbery, riot, rape, sexual abuse, and attempted murder. Based solely on confessions <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> were coerced and false, {{and despite the fact}} that DNA tests on the rape kit excluded them as the source, they were convicted in 1990 by juries in two separate trials. Known as the Central Park Five, they received sentences ranging from 5 to 15 years. Four of the convictions were appealed and the convictions were affirmed by appellate courts. The defendants spent between 6 and 13 years in prison.|$|E
25|$|In {{one study}} of Friends in Britain Yearly Meeting, around 30% of Quakers had views that were {{described}} as non-theistic, agnostic, or atheist. Another study of British Quakers, found that of the 727 members of the Religious Society of Friends who completed the survey, 75.1% said that they consider themselves to be Christian; 17.6% did not consider themselves Christian; and 7.3% of the members either did not answer or circled both answers. A further 22% of Quakers did not consider themselves to be a Christian, but fulfilled a definition of being a Christian in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> that they devoutly followed the teachings and example of Jesus Christ. In the same survey 86.9% said that they believed in God.|$|E

Creed liked their song [...] "Lost", which was written for Mars. At first Mars and Lawrence didn’t want to give it up, so Creed offered $20,000 for it. They were so surprised <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> [...] "You can have that one and whatever else you need!"

500|$|Several critics praised {{this episode}} for its {{character}} development, something <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> was {{missing in the}} previous episodes. Robert Canning of IGN said that although there was still {{plenty of room for}} growth, the episode gave a better understanding of Liz and Jenna's friendship. He felt that prior to the episode, nothing was known about Liz and Jenna's longtime friendship, {{and that there was no}} depth to it. Canning said that Liz's admission of being somewhat jealous of Jenna's success was a much needed storyline for the show, and one that gave the audience something deeper to latch onto. However, Canning pointed out that small hints of what their friendship was like in the past were played for laughs as opposed to establishing any sort of history. Canning found that their verbal sparring really [...] "solidified their bond", and that by the end of the episode the audience had seen their [...] "human side" [...] and the [...] "characters had become people".|$|E
500|$|American mycologist William Alphonso Murrill {{originally}} {{named the}} species Boletinus lakei after mycologist E.R.Lake of Oregon Agricultural college (now Oregon State University). Lake collected the type specimen from Corvallis, Oregon, in late November, 1907. Rolf Singer later transferred the species to the genera Ixocomus and Boletinus in 1940 and 1945, respectively. In their 1964 monograph on North American Suillus species, Alexander H. Smith and Harry Delbert Thiers transferred the species to Suillus. Simultaneously, they described the S.lakei variety pseudopictus <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> had been misidentified by collectors as Suillus pictus (now called Suillus spraguei) {{because of its}} reddish and scaly cap. Singer considered Suillus amabilis {{to be the same}} species as S.lakei, but Smith and Thiers later examined the type material of both, and concluded that they were distinct species. Engel and colleagues described a variety in 1996, S.lakei var. landkammeri, based on Boletinus tridentinus subsp. landkammeri described by Czech mycologists Albert Pilát and Mirko Svrček in 1949. The nomenclatural databases Index Fungorum and MycoBank consider this synonymous with S.lakei. The mushroom is commonly known as the [...] "western painted Suillus", the [...] "matte Jack", or [...] "Lake's slippery cap".|$|E

500|$|The {{facts of}} {{what took place}} in the store are still disputed. [...] According to what Jones said at the time, the other boys {{reported}} that Till had a photograph of an integrated class at the school he attended in Chicago, and Till bragged to the boys that the white children in the picture were his friends. He pointed to a white girl in the picture, or referred to a picture of a white girl that had come with his new wallet, and said she was his girlfriend and {{one or more of the}} local boys dared Till to speak to Bryant. However, writing a personal account of the incident in a book released in 2009, Till's cousin Simeon Wright, who was also present, disputed Jones' version of what happened on that day. According to Wright, Till did not have a photo of a white girl in his wallet and no one dared him to flirt with Bryant. Speaking in 2015, Wright said, [...] "We didn't dare him to go to the store — the white folk said <b>that.</b> <b>They</b> <b>said</b> that he had pictures of his white girlfriend. There were no pictures. They never talked to me. They never interviewed me." [...] The FBI report completed in 2006 notes [...] "...Jones recanted his 1955 statements prior to his death and apologized to Mamie Till-Mobley".|$|E

Linnell responded <b>that</b> <b>they</b> [...] "were in this band, we're making this record, and we're going to start touring next year...They were particularly interested in <b>that,</b> because <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> 1992 was ISY.
