5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>riot,</b> federal troops were deployed in Rock Springs. They escorted the surviving Chinese miners, most of whom had fled to Evanston, Wyoming, back to Rock Springs a week after <b>the</b> <b>riot.</b> Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. In Rock Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of <b>the</b> <b>riot,</b> while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for <b>the</b> <b>riot</b> was limited to sympathy for the causes of the white miners. The massacre in Rock Springs touched off a wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the Puget Sound area of Washington Territory.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 Strangeways Prison riot was a 25-day prison riot and rooftop protest at Strangeways Prison in Manchester, England. <b>The</b> <b>riot</b> {{began on}} 1 April 1990 when prisoners {{took control of}} the prison chapel, and <b>the</b> <b>riot</b> quickly spread {{throughout}} most of the prison. <b>The</b> <b>riot</b> and rooftop protest ended on 25 April when the final five prisoners were removed from the rooftop, making it the longest prison riot in British penal history. One prisoner was killed during <b>the</b> <b>riot,</b> and 147 prison officers and 47 prisoners were injured. Much of the prison was damaged or destroyed with the cost of repairs coming to £50million.|$|E
5|$|A trial {{involving}} thirty-three prisoners charged over <b>the</b> <b>riot</b> {{was also}} held, {{the largest in}} the state's history, which resulted in lengthened sentences for the prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Jacobs {{was living}} with his mother in Manor Road, Tottenham, {{at the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>riot.</b> He had spent time in a {{residential}} school in Reading, and in 1985 joined a Tottenham gang, the Park Lane Crew. He was named shortly after <b>the</b> <b>riot</b> by two of those arrested, and was arrested himself five days later on suspicion of murder. The police had a photograph of him from the night carrying a petrol bomb and a container of rocks, though he told them he had first arrived at the estate after midnight, two hours after Blakelock was killed. In the end he was charged with affray, and in November 1986 was sentenced to eight years by Judge Neil Denison (the longest sentence handed out for affray during <b>the</b> <b>riot,</b> according to Rose), reduced on appeal to six years. Jacobs was one of nine suspects that the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge with Blakelock's murder at the conclusion of Commander Perry Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February, one {{day after}} the {{conclusion}} of the match and three days after <b>the</b> <b>riot,</b> Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about <b>the</b> <b>riot.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{citizens}} {{were said to}} be shocked by the emotive, evangelical tactics of the Salvation Army when they arrived in the town in 1880, but the reaction from those employed by the breweries or within the Licence trade quickly grew more openly hostile. Violent clashes became a regular occurrence culminating on Sunday 27 March 1881 with troops being called upon to break up the conflict after the Mayor had read <b>the</b> <b>Riot</b> Act. <b>The</b> <b>riot</b> and its causes led to questions in Parliament and a period of notoriety for the town. The town was described as 'Barbarous Basingstoke' by one London newspaper in 1882.|$|E
50|$|Following the attack, {{thousands}} of Bat Yam residents <b>rioted</b> in <b>the</b> {{streets of the}} city for five days without significant interference, causing heavy damage to property while occasionally attacking random Arab-looking by-passers. Among the organizers of <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> was Baruch Marzel, who was later sentenced to 8 months probation for his part in <b>the</b> <b>riots.</b> After 5 days, during which Helena Rapp's father Ze'ev Rapp encouraged <b>the</b> <b>riots,</b> he eventually responded to a police request to help disperse the rioters and as a result <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> subsided. In <b>the</b> Or Commission Israeli Chief of Police Assaf Hefetz criticized the way the police handled <b>the</b> <b>rioting</b> after Rapp's murder and claimed that <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> should have been dispersed much earlier.|$|R

50|$|In 1981, England {{suffered}} serious riots {{across many}} major cities. They {{were perceived as}} race riots between communities, in all cases the main motives for <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> were related to racial tension and inner city deprivation. <b>The</b> <b>riots</b> were caused by a distrust of the police and authority. <b>The</b> four main <b>riots</b> that occurred were <b>the</b> Brixton <b>riot</b> in London, <b>the</b> Handsworth <b>riots</b> in Birmingham, <b>the</b> Chapeltown <b>riot</b> in Leeds and <b>the</b> Toxteth <b>riots</b> in Liverpool.|$|R

5|$|The Stonewall Inn {{lasted only}} a few weeks after <b>the</b> <b>riot.</b> By October 1969 it was up for rent. Village {{residents}} surmised it was too notorious a location, and Rodwell's boycott discouraged business.|$|E
5|$|The area's {{demographics}} {{changed as}} a result of <b>the</b> <b>riot.</b> Many black residents left Manhattan permanently (many moving to Brooklyn). By 1865, the black population fell below 10,000, equivalent to the number in 1820.|$|E
2500|$|The Korean-Americans {{and their}} stores {{throughout}} LA’s Korea town were hit the hardest by <b>the</b> <b>riots,</b> {{with an estimated}} $400 million done in damages. Despite claims that Koreatown had not been intentionally targeted during <b>the</b> <b>riots,</b> by Sunday, over 1,600 Korean-American-owned stores had been completely destroyed. Hispanic-owned stores and African-American-owned stores were also destroyed during <b>the</b> <b>riots.</b> <b>The</b> diversity among victims has earned <b>the</b> 1992 LA <b>riots</b> <b>the</b> title of [...] "America's First Multiethnic 'Riots'", though this title did not come into existence until years after <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> occurred. Media focused exclusively on select groups rather than observing the overall picture.|$|R
50|$|Amitav Ghosh's 1988 English novel The Shadow Lines has <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> as <b>the</b> {{underlying}} theme. Across Borders by Shuvashree Ghosh {{also has}} <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> as <b>the</b> underlying theme. Chhimchhangar Duta Par, a 1965 Assamese novel by Umakanta Sharma has the persecution and subsequent exodus of Garos from East Pakistan during <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> as <b>the</b> central theme. Chitra Nadir Pare, a 1999 Bengali film by Bangladeshi filmmaker Tanvir Mokammel has <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> in <b>the</b> backdrop.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> initial <b>riots</b> were cleared, <b>the</b> {{feeling of}} urgency and {{aggression}} {{began to spread}} throughout all of Greenwich Village. <b>The</b> <b>riots</b> would continue {{for a few days}} afterwards. However, <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> turned into altercations between the police and the Village people, different from the open violence shown the morning of the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>riots.</b> Interestingly enough, even people who had not seen <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> at <b>the</b> Inn began {{to become a part of}} the aftermath. Many were emotionally moved by the events and began to attend meetings in an effort to take action. Many look to <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> at Stonewall as being the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement.|$|R
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>riot</b> in Chicago and the {{subsequent}} trial, Ochs changed direction again. The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics. Ochs thought that by playing the sort of music that had moved him as a teenager he could speak more directly to the American public.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} no deaths, the fire caused $1.8million of damage, and {{officers}} were injured. In the aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>riot,</b> there was extensive media attention on Fremantle Prison, and investigative journalists uncovered prior warnings to the prison authorities {{of the risk of}} such an event. The government hastily initiated an enquiry into the incident, and a report was completed within six weeks.|$|E
5|$|At least 61 police {{officers}} and an estimated 100 {{members of the public}} were hospitalized in the course of <b>the</b> <b>riot.</b> A civil grand jury convened to find out who ordered the attack, but it ended inconclusively with a settlement covering personal injury claims and damages.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> Hough <b>riots</b> were <b>riots</b> in <b>the</b> {{predominantly}} African-American {{community of}} Hough (pronounced [...] "Huff") in Cleveland, Ohio, {{which took place}} from July 18 to July 23, 1966. During <b>the</b> <b>riots,</b> four African Americans were killed and 50 people were injured. There were 275 arrests and numerous incidents of arson and firebombings. City officials at first blamed black nationalist and communist organizations for <b>the</b> <b>riots.</b> But historians generally dismiss these claims today, arguing {{that the cause of}} <b>the</b> Hough <b>Riots</b> were primarily poverty and racism. <b>The</b> <b>riots</b> caused rapid population loss and economic decline in the area, which lasted at least five decades after <b>the</b> <b>riots.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Riots</b> is a play {{created by}} Gillian Slovo from spoken evidence, which {{explains}} and evaluates {{the events that}} took place during <b>the</b> 2011 England <b>riots.</b> <b>The</b> play is written {{in the style of}} verbatim theatre using interviews from politicians, police, rioters and victims involved in <b>the</b> <b>riots.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Riots</b> first opened at the Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn on 22 November 2011, after previewing from 17 November 2011.|$|R

The Salisbury government sent troops to the town to clear the barricades by force after the reading of <b>the</b> <b>Riot</b> Act.|$|E
5|$|Campbell was unapologetic. He {{said that}} he {{considered}} it his duty as president to attend the game. Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau was livid at Campbell for attending, and he laid the blame for <b>the</b> <b>riot</b> on Campbell. A Montreal city councilor wanted Campbell arrested for inciting <b>the</b> <b>riot.</b> Years later, Canadiens player Jean Béliveau stated that, although he disagreed with Campbell's decision to attend the game, as well as feeling Campbell might have been using his appearance to make a statement, he concluded that Campbell may have felt {{that if he did}} not attend he could appear to be hiding. He also noted that Campbell's absence might not have made much of a difference.|$|E

40|$|Using {{street level}} crime data for London from December 2010 to March 2012 merged with {{detailed}} information on crimes committed during <b>the</b> 2011 London <b>riots,</b> I show that crime in areas affected by <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> fell considerably {{in the months following}} <b>the</b> <b>riots.</b> I also investigate two potentials channels through which <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> might have influenced future crime rates, specifically unemployment and changes in police deployment. The results suggest increases in unemployment in the affected areas and no change in police deployment in the months after <b>the</b> <b>riots,</b> suggesting that crime fell for other reasons. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1988, an enquiry {{investigated}} the Fremantle Prison riot that {{occurred at the}} start of the year. The report suggested that little evidence supported the escape plan theory reported by the media, but that <b>the</b> <b>riot</b> was largely the result of an incident of that morning involving the mistreatment of a prisoner and his subsequent release into Three Division yard.|$|E
5|$|Several {{hours after}} <b>the</b> <b>riot</b> {{had been broken}} up, police made a retaliatory raid on a gay bar in San Francisco's Castro District.

5|$|The Rock Springs massacre, {{also known}} as the Rock Springs Riot, {{occurred}} on September 2, 1885, in the present-day United States city of Rock Springs in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. <b>The</b> <b>riot,</b> between Chinese immigrant miners and white immigrant miners, was the result of racial tensions and an ongoing labor dispute over the Union Pacific Coal Department's policy of paying Chinese miners lower wages than white miners. This policy caused the Chinese to be hired over the white miners, which further angered the white miners and contributed to <b>the</b> <b>riot.</b> When the rioting ended, at least 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured. Rioters burned 78 Chinese homes resulting in approximately US$150,000 in property damage ($ in present-day terms).|$|E
25|$|Communal riots {{occurred}} in Bihar from 24 October to 11 November 1946, in which Hindu mobs targeted Muslim families. <b>The</b> <b>riots</b> were {{triggered by the}} Great Calcutta Killings, as well as <b>the</b> Noakhali <b>riots</b> earlier that year. Mahatma Gandhi declared that he would fast unto death if <b>the</b> <b>riots</b> did not stop. <b>The</b> <b>riots</b> {{were part of a}} sequence of communal violence that culminated in the partition of India.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} examples of racial bias was the portrayal of blacks in <b>the</b> 1992 <b>riots</b> in Los Angeles.

Some 60% of the rioters and looters were Hispanics and whites, facts that were not reported by the media.|$|R
