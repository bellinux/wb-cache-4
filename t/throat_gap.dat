40|$|Reynolds {{number and}} cowl {{position}} {{effects on the}} internal shock structure and the resulting performance of a generic three-dimensional sidewall compression scramjet inlet with a leading edge sweep of 45 degrees at Mach 10 have been examined both computationally and experimentally. Prior to the experiment, a threedimensional Navier-Stokes code was adapted to perform preliminary parametric studies leading {{to the design of}} the present configuration. Following this design phase, the code was then utilized as an analysis tool to provide {{a better understanding of the}} flow field and the experimental static pressure data for the final experimental configuration. The wind tunnel model possessed 240 static pressure orifices distributed on the forebody plane, sidewalls, and cowl and was tested in the NASA Langley 31 Inch Mach 10 Tunnel.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{study is}} performed on two-dimensional mixed convection in an annulus between a horizontal outer cylinder and a heated, rotating, eccentric inner cylinder. The computation {{has been done}} using a non-orthogonal grid and a fully collocated finite volume procedure. Solutions are iterated to convergence through a pressure correction scheme and the convection is treated by Van Leer's MUSCL scheme. The numerical procedure adopted here can easily eliminate the 'Numerical leakage' phenomenon of the mixed convection problem whereby strong buoyancy and centrifugal effects are encountered {{in the case of}} a highly eccentric annulus. Numerical results have been obtained for Rayleigh number Ra ranging from 7 x 10 (3) to 10 (7), Reynolds number Re from 0 to 1200 and Prandtl number Pr from 0. 01 to 7. The mixed rotation parameter sigma (= Ra/PrRe 2) varies from infinity (pure natural convection) to 0. 01 with various eccentricities epsilon. The computational results are in good agreement with previous works which show that the mixed convection heat transfer characteristics in the annulus are significantly affected by sigma and epsilon. The results indicate that the mean Nusselt number Nu increases with increasing Ra or Pr but decreases with increasing Re. In the case of a highly eccentric annulus the conduction effect becomes predominant in the <b>throat</b> <b>gap.</b> Hence the crucial phenomenon on whereby Nu first decreases and then increases can be found with increasing eccentricity.

40|$|Treatment {{planning}} of facial attractiveness is difficult. One {{of the primary}} goals of orthodontic treatment is to attain and preserve optimal facial attractiveness. For this, {{it is important that}} the orthodontist conduct a thorough facial examination so that the orthodontic correction will not adversely affect the normal facial traits. By knowing the soft tissue traits and the normal range, a treatment plan can be designed to normalize the facial traits for a given individual. This paper presents development of a new soft tissue analysis algorithm, which will be used as an analysis tool in Computer Assisted Craniofacial Surgery Planner â€“ a surgery planning system under development. This analysis tool may be used by surgeons as an aid in diagnosis and treatment planning. This research uses 19 landmarks to calculate 18 facial traits such as facial profile angle, nasal projection, nasolabial angle, lower face height, maxillary sulcus contour, interlabial <b>gap,</b> <b>throat</b> length etc. The proposed algorithm allows picking the required landmarks interactively and then allows adjustment in the position of each landmark precisely. The source data used to get 3 D digital models of human soft tissues include CT data and 3 D laser scanner data. Up to now Malaysia does not have any source for normal trait values of human face. This algorithm can be used to calculate facial traits for building a nationwide database that can be used to compare normal traits with abnormal ones and then plan the surgery procedures. The system is the result of collaboration between a university, an industrial research organization and a research hospital. In this paper, components of the cephalometric analysis tool are detailed. Issues related to future research and plans for expanding the current system are discussed...|$|R
