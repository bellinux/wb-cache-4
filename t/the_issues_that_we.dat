6000|$|It is {{only five}} weeks, I think, since our scheme was launched, and I am bound {{to say that}} at the end of those five weeks the {{position}} may fairly be described as hopeful and promising. I do not think that the millennium will come in five more weeks, nor in fifty weeks; but I do say that for a scheme of so wide a scope to be received as this scheme has been received, is a highly encouraging sign. It does not follow that because we have launched our ship with a slant of fair wind, this means the same thing as getting into harbour. There are plenty of difficult points that we have got to settle. But when I try from my conning-tower in this office, to read the signs in the political skies, I am full of confidence. The great thing is that in every party both in India and at home--in every party, and every section, and every group--there is a recognition of the magnitude and the gravity of the enterprise on which we have embarked. I studied very closely the proceedings at Madras, and the proceedings at Amritsar, and in able speeches made in both those places I find a truly political spirit in the right sense of the word--in the sense of perspective and proportion--which I sometimes wish could be imitated by some of my political friends nearer home. I mean that issues, important enough but upon which there is some difference, are put aside--for the time only, if you like, but still put aside--in face of the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> present to you in these reforms. On Monday, in The Times newspaper, there was a long and most interesting communication from Bombay, written, I believe, by a gentleman of very wide Indian knowledge and level-headed humour. What does he say? He takes account of the general position as he found it in India shortly after my Despatch arrived. [...] "I might have dwelt," [...] he says, [...] "upon the fact that I have not met a single official who does not admit that some changes which should gratify Indian longings were necessary, and I might have expatiated upon the abounding evidence that Lord Morley's despatch and speech have unquestionably eased a tension which had become exceedingly alarming." [...] That is a most important thing, and I believe Parliament has fully recognised it.|$|E

In order to provide an answer for this question, we shall crittically attend to the interpretations of two important commentators of Heidegger’s works, who have reflected upon the theme, and offered their own readings: Robert Brandom and Rainer Bast. As a conclusion we will propose our own reading, in an attempt to unify the discussed subjects and suggest an integrative of the heideggerian approaches on the artefactual character of the statement...|$|R

5000|$|Many gun safe {{manufacturers}} {{state that}} their gun safe is [...] "DOJ approved". The state of California Department of Justice (DOJ) has required that any gun safe sold in California should {{be approved by}} the Regulatory Gun Safe Standards. This DOJ standard has now become a common rating for the classification of gun safes. However, in 2012, a report appeared in Forbes written by the investigative attorney and physical security specialist Marc Weber Tobias, presenting the results of his investigation into the quality of the security provided by eleven different models among three leading brands of gun safes sold in the U.S. through many retail outlets. Eight models from one of the brands are said to conform to the DOJ standard. Tobias reported that he and his colleagues found that all eleven models could be opened with one of a variety of simple implements and techniques, including bouncing and rapping, or insertion of paperclips, wires, drinking straws, screwdrivers, or brass strips that can be purchased from a hardware store. Four of the models were unlocked by a three-year old child. (It was a fatality resulting from such an occurrence that led to the investigation.) When Tobias reported their findings to the manufacturers and retailers of the [...] "safes", no useful dialog or corrective action resulted. Tobias concluded that the DOJ [...] "Standards are woefully inadequate and do not address any of <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> found in any of the gun safes that we tested. If the Standards do not cover a method of entry, then they are meaningless." ...|$|E
