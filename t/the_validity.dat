40|$|Common wisdom {{tells us}} that more {{information}} can only help and never hurt. Goldstein and Gigerenzer (2002) highlighted an instance violating this intuition. Specifically, {{in an analysis of}} their recognition heuristic, they found a counterintuitive less-ismore effect in inference: An individual recognizing fewer objects than another individual can, nevertheless, make more accurate inferences. Goldstein and Gigerenzer emphasized that a sufficient condition for this effect is that <b>the</b> recognition <b>validity</b> be higher than <b>the</b> knowledge <b>validity,</b> assuming that <b>the</b> <b>validities</b> are uncorrelated with the number of recognized objects, n. But how is the occurrence of the less-is-more effect affected when this independence assumption is violated? I show that validity dependencies (i. e., correlations of <b>the</b> <b>validities</b> with n) abound in empirical data sets, and I demonstrate by computer simulations that these dependencies often have a strong limiting effect on the less-is-more effect.

40|$|This study {{examined}} <b>the</b> predictive <b>validity</b> of <b>the</b> Washington State Juvenile Pre-Screen Assessment (WSJCA pre-screen) in the Netherlands.

The sample consisted of 520 youths who had been referred to the juvenile probation service by court. The present study showed <b>the</b> predictive <b>validity</b> of <b>the</b> WSJCA pre-screen in the Netherlands to be modest too, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of. 625. Modifying the scoring procedure by means of chi-squared automatic interaction detector analyses significantly improved <b>the</b> predictive <b>validity</b> to an AUC of. 702.

Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze <b>the</b> reproducibility and <b>validity</b> of a developed food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for use among adolescents. Design: In total, 58 students (aged 13 – 14) from four different schools in the southern part of Norway participated in the reproducibility study of filling out the FFQ 4 weeks apart. In addition, 93 students participated in <b>the</b> relative <b>validity</b> study where <b>the</b> FFQ was compared to 2 × 24 -hour dietary recalls, while 92 students participated in <b>the</b> absolute <b>validity</b> study where <b>the</b> intakes of fatty acids and vitamin D from the FFQ were compared to fatty acids and 25 -hydroxy-vitamin D 3 in whole blood.
