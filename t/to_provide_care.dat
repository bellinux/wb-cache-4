5|$|Occasionally {{a hospice}} {{will be unable}} <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> to a patient, either due to {{philosophical}} differences with the patient or due to a safety issue.

Patients may, after being discharged from hospice for any reason, re-enroll in hospice at a later date as necessary.|$|E

5|$|Should {{a patient}} be {{transferred}} to an assisted living facility, nursing home, or hospital, the hospice would continue <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> to the patient which is on par with the services provided under the routine home care benefit. In this way, {{the only difference between}} respite and routine care is that the hospice pays the room and board charges of the facility. Should a patient receive respite in an inpatient hospice unit the care would be similar to what other patients of the hospice unit receive. Respite is provided for a maximum of five days every benefit period.|$|E

5|$|During the English Civil War, the Royal Fort was {{considered}} the strongest part of Bristol's defences, and {{it was to the}} fort that the Royalists retreated when they found themselves under siege from the Parliamentarians. It fell to the parliamentary forces in 1645 and was subsequently demolished. St Nicholas's Almshouses were built in 1652 <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> for the poor. Several public houses were also built in this period, including the Llandoger Trow on King Street and the Hatchet Inn. More churches were built, including St Michael on the Mount Without. It served the St Michaels hill area, one of the first areas outside the city walls to be colonised by the wealthy merchants who were by then trying to escape the overcrowded and unhealthy conditions in the city centre. The city was by this time beginning to expand rapidly beyond its traditional city walls, and the surrounding villages were starting to become suburbs, such as the villages of Horfield and Brislington. Both had their own churches, the Church of the Holy Trinity with St Edmund and St Lukes respectively.|$|E

When the war ended, she resumed her trips to Morocco, spending several months there each year. In 1946, de Bourgoing was not only appointed Directrice Générale de la Croix Rouge but was elevated to Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, the first woman to receive the honour.

5|$|With Merrick {{admitted}} into the hospital, Treves now {{had time to}} conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over {{the previous two years}} and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a heart condition and that he had only a few years left to live. Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this and cared for him. The problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's long-term care had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> for the incurable, which Merrick clearly was.|$|E

25|$|Nurse {{practitioners}} {{can legally}} examine patients, diagnose illnesses, prescribe medication, and provide treatments. Just under {{half of the}} country permits NPs the authority to practice on their own. In fact, 22 states (plus D.C.) give full practice authority to NPs. Thirty-eight states require NPs to have a written agreement with a physician in order <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>care.</b> Even with the formal agreement between physician and NPs, their practice is restricted in at least one domain (e.g., prescribing, treatment). Twelve of those states restrict NPs even more. In order for NP's <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>care</b> to patients, they are required to be supervised or delegated by a physician. The states in the Pacific Northwest, the Mountain states, and in upper New England generally permit more freedom to NPs. Many states in the South are the most restrictive states.|$|E
