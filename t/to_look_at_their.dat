25|$|In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Hermione Granger creates fake, enchanted Galleons {{that are}} used for {{communication}} between members of Dumbledore's Army. Like real Galleons, the coins have numerals around the edge; on normal Galleons these serial numbers aren't used {{the same way the}} enchanted coins are used, the numbers represent the time and date of the next meeting, and automatically change to match whatever numbers Harry Potter sets on his coin. Due to the coins being infused with a Protean Charm, once Harry Potter alters his, every coin changes to suit. The coins grow hot when the numbers change to alert the members <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> coins.|$|E
25|$|Some Oaxacan {{artisans}} draw on {{the native}} use of bright colors and magic realism present in modern works such as those by Rufino Tamayo and Francisco Toledo. Others show a world view that mixes native beliefs and traditions with the Catholic faith. Most potters cannot compete with cheap, mass-produced items so many have turned to upper scale folk art and one-of-a-kind pieces. Others have been inspired <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> own ancient cultures {{and use them to}} help create sellable works. Cooperatives such as these have attracted the attention of Japanese ceramists and billionaire financier Alfredo Harp Helú, who have provided seed money, business advice and outlets to show their wares internationally. Despite this, becoming profitable is still not easy.|$|E
500|$|A report {{published}} by SBT in 1987 looked at details for a subsea tunnel to the mainland. It {{was the first}} official document to use the [...] "Triangle Link" [...] term, although this had previously {{been used by the}} press. A delegation traveled to Washington State in the United States and British Columbia in Canada <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> seven pontoon bridges, while seismic surveys were undertaken in Bømlafjorden. SBT changed its name to Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap and a majority of the board shifted towards being in favor of a fixed link. The issue became the subject of major local debate and was supplemented by a demand from residents in southern Bømlo that {{they did not want to}} lose their ferry service, which would be faster than driving via the fixed link.|$|E

500|$|In October 2011, Kevin Feige, {{president}} of Marvel Studios said the studio was beginning <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> Phase Two films, which would start with Iron Man 3 and would culminate {{in a second}} Avengers film. In March 2012, Joss Whedon, director of the first film, stated that he would want a sequel to be [...] "smaller. More personal. More painful. By being the next thing that should happen to these characters, {{and not just a}} rehash of what seemed to work the first time. By having a theme that is completely fresh and organic to itself." [...] Despite the production of the film becoming increasingly wider in scope, Feige maintained that this was not their intention, always looking to see where the team wanted to take the characters, over how to make it bigger than The Avengers.|$|E
500|$|The {{religious}} division had by {{now become}} a political issue, resulting in great excitement during the elections of May 1637. [...] The orthodox party {{of the majority of}} magistrates and ministers maneuvered to have the elections moved from Boston to Newtown (later Cambridge) where the Hutchinsonians would have less support. [...] The Boston supporters of Hutchinson wanted a petition to be read before the election, but the orthodox party insisted on holding the election first. [...] Tempers flared, and bitter words gave way to blows as zealots on both sides clamored to have their opinions heard. [...] During the excitement, Reverend Wilson was lifted up into a tree, and he bellowed to the crowd below, imploring them <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> charter, to which a cry went out for the election to take place. [...] The crowd then divided, with a majority going to one end of the common to hold the election, leaving the Boston faction in the minority by themselves. [...] Seeing the futility of resisting further, the Boston group joined in the election.|$|E
500|$|Batman's Batmobile was {{an aspect}} of the {{character}} that Rocksteady had wanted to include in its other Arkham games, but were limited by technical constraints. The designers, who worked in conjunction with DC, chose <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> earlier design from Arkham Asylum, instead of models from the history of Batman comics and media, and evolve that to meet the necessary gameplay requirements. The vehicle was designed to integrate with Batman's on-foot traversal without being a burden; Hill stated, [...] "We didn't want it to be like, 'Okay, the Batmobile is so good I'll just stay in that all the time.' or 'Batman is so powerful gliding around I won't be using the Batmobile.' There's a definite need to use both of those." [...] The world's challenges were set out on the vertical and horizontal plane of the map to discourage players from using only one form of movement, with the Batmobile providing a faster method for moving large distances over gliding. Unlike Arkham Origins, Arkham Knight does not feature a fast travel system as the designers considered traversal {{to be part of the}} game, and allowing players to skip that would detract from the experience. Buildings hit by the vehicle suffer cosmetic damage without slowing the car, as it was considered that being impeded by a collision while turning a corner would diminish the fantasy of driving the Batmobile.|$|E

Thus even Scythians and Sarmatians sent envoys to seek the friendship of Rome. Nay, the Seres came likewise, and the Indians who dwelt beneath the vertical sun, bringing presents of precious stones and pearls and elephants, but thinking all of less moment than the vastness of the journey which they had undertaken, and which they said had occupied four years.

2500|$|The {{ability to}} {{visually}} identify previous social partners {{is essential for}} successful interactions because it aids in recognizing which partners can and cannot be trusted. [...] In humans, this is accomplished by facial recognition. [...] Research suggests that humans are born with an innate ability to process other human faces. In one study, Pascalis, et al. (1995) found that four-day-old neonates (infants) prefer <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> mothers' faces rather than at a stranger's. This finding suggests that neonates are able to remember, recognize, and differentiate between faces. [...] Further research suggests that humans prefer to attend to faces rather than non-face alternatives. [...] Such specialized processing for faces aids in the encoding of memory for people. [...] This preference is one explanation for why humans are more proficient at memorizing faces than non-faces.|$|E
2500|$|Utilisation: Any {{utilisation}} {{leads to}} increasing trance depth. All utilisation should proceed as {{a continuation of}} extension of the initial procedure. Much can be done nonverbally; for example, if any subjects are just looking blankly at me, I may slowly shift my gaze downward, causing them <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> hand, which I touch and say [...] "look at this spot.". This intensifies the trance state. Then, whether the subjects are looking at you or at their hand or just staring blankly, {{you can use your}} left hand to touch their elevated right hand from above or the side - so long as you merely give the suggestion of downward movement. Occasionally a downward nudge or push is required. If a strong push or nudge is required, check for anaesthesia.|$|E
2500|$|To some extent, results {{along these}} lines have been {{achieved}} in trials performed around the globe, making use of GPS, mobile phone signals, and vehicle registration plates. [...] GPS is becoming standard in many new high-end vehicles and is an option on most new low- and mid-range vehicles. In addition, many users also have mobile phones which transmit trackable signals (and may also be GPS-enabled). [...] Mobile phones can already be traced for purposes of emergency response. [...] GPS and mobile phone tracking, however, do not provide fully reliable data. Furthermore, integrating mobile phones in vehicles may be prohibitively difficult. Data from mobile phones, though useful, might even increase risks to motorists as they tend <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> phones rather than concentrate on their driving. Automatic registration plate recognition can provide high levels of data, but continuously tracking a vehicle through a corridor is a difficult task with existing technology. Today's equipment is designed for data acquisition and functions such as enforcement and tolling, not for returning data to vehicles or motorists for response. GPS will nevertheless {{be one of the}} key components in VII systems.|$|E

Even though Twitter, a medium that emerged early in 2006 – the first tweet was posted on 21 March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter – and elections occurring only every few years, it has already received much academic attention.

2500|$|In {{terms of}} Web 2.0's social impact, critics such as Andrew Keen argue that Web 2.0 {{has created a}} cult of digital narcissism and amateurism, which {{undermines}} the notion of expertise by allowing anybody, anywhere to share and place undue value upon their own opinions about any subject and post any kind of content, regardless of their actual talent, knowledge, credentials, biases or possible hidden agendas. Keen's 2007 book, Cult of the Amateur, argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, Sunday Times reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as [...] "creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels... mistakes, half truths and misunderstandings". In a 1994 Wired interview, Steve Jobs, forecasting the future development of the web for personal publishing, said [...] "The Web is great because that person can't foist anything on you - {{you have to go}} get it. They can make themselves available, but if nobody wants <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>their</b> site, that's fine. To be honest, most people who have something to say get published now." [...] Michael Gorman, former president of the American Library Association has been vocal about his opposition to Web 2.0 {{due to the lack of}} expertise that it outwardly claims, though he believes that there is hope for the future.|$|E
