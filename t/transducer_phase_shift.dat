Slightly off-axis interferometry lowers the requirement on the angle between the object and the reference waves {{as well as the}} requirement on the resolving power of the charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. In addition, the apparatus is cost-effective and offers ease of alignment. The phase-shifting DHM is simply implemented by mechanically moving the reference mirror while disposing of a precise phase modulator such as a piezoelectric <b>transducer</b> (PZT). The <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> between the two interferograms is extracted by Fourier transformation analysis, and then the phase image is reconstructed.

Keywords gas sensor, conditioning circuit, {{surface acoustic wave}} 1. SAW TRANSDUCER AS A GAS SENSOR Systems with surface acoustic wave (SAW) have been applied in the construction of gas detectors for a long time [1 - 4]. The SAW gas sensors are composed of at least one acoustic delay line with a sensitive thin film layer on a top of the piezoelectric substrate and a pair of interdigital transducers (IDT) for excitation and detection of Rayleigh wave (see Fig. 1). In this paper results of investigations of two types of primary electronic circuits are presented and discussed. The first one is the oscillator with frequency output signal and the second is the phase-shift output circuit. 2. FREQUENCY OUTPUT CONDITIONING CIRCIUT As a conditioning circuit for SAW sensors the electronic oscillators are often applied – the delay line with SAW transducer is placed in the feedback loop of an amplifier. The acoustic delay line ensures the phase condition for oscillation, whilst the amplifier ensures the amplitude condition. The main disadvantages of this simple configuration are high output frequency range (30 – 150 MHz) and a weak thermal stability. Therefore a much more suitable configuration in practical applications is the dual delay line design with the active and the reference acoustic paths, as shown in Fig. 2...|$|R

Firstly, it investigates the influence of <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> on axial superresolution. It proves theoretically that axial superresolution can not be obtained by two-zone phase filter with <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> pi, and it gets the <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> with which axial superresolution can be brought by two-zone phase filter. Secondly, it studies the influence of <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> on transverse superresolution.

By {{different}} combinations of a quarter-wave-plate, a half-wave-plate, and an analyzer, phase delays are introduced in the interference light path {{in order to achieve}} the <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> digital holog-raphy. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experiments are conducted to verify the validity of this method. The numerical simulation shows that the result of the wave-plate <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method is consistent with that of the traditional four-step <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method. The experimen-tal results successfully reconstruct the object light intensity in the image plane. Based on the wave-plate <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method, a pixelated wave-plate array structure is designed to achieve real-time <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> digital holography. The wave-plate array <b>phase</b> <b>shifting</b> method not only can reconstruct object image of high quality, but also can be used in dynamic phase measurement.
