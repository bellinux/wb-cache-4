50|$|<b>Trend</b> <b>lines</b> are {{a simple}} and widely used {{technical}} analysis approach to judging entry and exit investment timing. To establish a <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> historical data, typically presented in the format of a chart such as the above price chart, is required. Historically, <b>trend</b> <b>lines</b> have been drawn by hand on paper charts, but it is now more common to use charting software that enables <b>trend</b> <b>lines</b> to be drawn on computer based charts. There are some charting software that will automatically generate <b>trend</b> <b>lines,</b> however most traders prefer to draw their own <b>trend</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Trend</b> <b>line</b> breaks {{can be used}} to {{generate}} signals. <b>Trend</b> <b>lines</b> can be drawn connecting the peaks and troughs. From oversold levels, an advance above −100 and <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> breakout could be considered bullish. From overbought levels, a decline below +100 and a <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> break could be considered bearish.|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of what a trader is hoping is a bull trend, after the first higher low, a <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> {{can be drawn from}} the low at {{the start of}} the trend to the higher low and then extended. When the market moves across this <b>trend</b> <b>line,</b> it has {{generated}} a <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> break for the trader, who is given several considerations from this point on. If the market moved with a particular rhythm to-and-fro from the <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> with regularity, the trader will give the <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> added weight. Any significant <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> that sees a significant <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> break represents a shift in the balance of the market and is interpreted as the first sign that the countertrend traders are able to assert some control.|$|R
40|$|Interdependencies between {{experimental}} spectra, representing <b>line</b> or plane <b>projections</b> {{of electronic}} densities, {{are derived from}} their consistency and symmetry conditions. Some additional relations for plane projections are obtained by treating them as <b>line</b> <b>projections</b> of <b>line</b> <b>projections.</b> The knowledge of these dependencies can be utilised both for an improvement of experimental data and for a verification of various techniques used for correcting e. g. two-dimensional (or one-dimensional) angular correlation of annihilation radiation spectra and Compton scattering profiles.

The alternative scenario on resumption of the trend is that it picks up strength and requires a new <b>trend</b> <b>line,</b> in this instance with a steeper gradient, which is worth mentioning for sake of completeness and to note {{that it is not a}} situation that presents new opportunities, just higher rewards on existing ones for the with-trend trader.|$|R
3000|$|Regarding {{the power}} trend type of the CHBDC formula of minimum {{depth of cover}} D h / 6 ((D h /D v [...]) 0.5) and the trend {{of changes in the}} cover depth for the boxes and {{low-profile}} arches versus the span, exponential, polynomial, or power <b>trend</b> <b>lines</b> were assumed to properly fit to the data of 2 D results. Therefore, two types of exponential, one type of polynomial, and one type of power <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> were examined as follows: (1) exponential <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> {{as a function of the}} effective span (D h [...]); (2) power <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> as a function of the effective span (D h [...]); (3) exponential <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> as a function of D h /D v [...] (D v [...] effective rise of the structure); and (4) polynomial <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> as a function of D h /D v [...]. A comparison of the R 2 values of the <b>trend</b> <b>lines</b> shows that the exponential and power functions of D h [...] represent a more accurate estimation of the data. However, due to the dimensions of the formulas for calculating the minimum depth of cover that must be in meters, an exponential function (D h [...]) was chosen to describe the change in the minimum depth of cover versus the effective span.|$|R

50|$|<b>Trend</b> <b>lines</b> {{are used}} {{in many ways by}} traders. If a stock price is moving between support and {{resistance}} <b>trend</b> <b>lines,</b> then a basic investment strategy commonly used by traders, is to buy a stock at support and sell at resistance, then short at resistance and cover the short at support. The logic behind this, is that when the price returns to an existing principal <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> it may be an opportunity to open new positions {{in the direction of the}} trend, in the belief that the <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> will hold and the trend will continue further. A second way is that when price action breaks through the principal <b>trend</b> <b>line</b> of an existing trend, it is evidence that the trend may be going to fail, and a trader may consider trading in the opposite direction to the existing trend, or exiting positions in the direction of the trend.|$|R
