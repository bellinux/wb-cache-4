Captains Scarlet and Blue have been pursuing the transporter in a Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle {{and find the}} wounded man, who is taken into hospital.

5000|$|Thermal sensitivity. Determining {{the point}} at which a {{compound}} is capable of detonating under confinement with thermal stress is useful. A fixed quantity of material is placed in an aluminum blasting cap shell, and pressed into place with an aluminum plug. The sample is immersed in a hot metal bath, and the time-to-detonation is measured. If over 60 seconds, a fresh sample is run again at a higher temperature. In this manner, it is possible to determine the temperature at which an explosive will detonate on the small scale. Unlike the other tests above, this figure is misleading as explosives have more thermal issues on the large scale. Therefore, the thermal sensitivity figures established using this technique are higher than one would expect in the real world. <b>Thermal</b> <b>safety</b> testing may also be performed via differential scanning calorimetry, in which a small (sub-milligram) sample is placed in a sample cell, and the temperature is increased slowly. The calorimeter determines how much energy is required to increase the temperature of the sample. Using this device, characteristics such as the melting point, phase transitions and decomposition temperature of an explosive may be determined.|$|E
30|$|After {{articulating}} the ultrasound probe, the investigators used the graphical overlay to simulate various ablation widths, angles, and {{locations of the}} intended ablation. In this fashion, before introducing the RF electrodes into a fibroid, the investigator planned and optimized the ablation. Once the size, angle, and location of the ablation were established, the investigator advanced a trocar-tipped introducer into the fibroid under intrauterine ultrasound visualization. The investigator aligned the graphical overlay with the introducer tip and then rotated the VizAblate Handpiece about the introducer to assess {{the position of the}} Ablation Zone and <b>Thermal</b> <b>Safety</b> Border relative to the uterine serosa, as displayed on the graphical user interface, adjusting the size and/or position of the desired ablation if necessary. Depending on the width of the ablation, the distance from the Ablation Zone to the uterine serosal margin will vary from 6.0 to 9.5  mm. When properly positioned, the introducer is located within the fibroid while the serosa is maintained tangent to or beyond the <b>Thermal</b> <b>Safety</b> Border. The investigator then deployed the electrodes, again rotating to ascertain the position of the <b>Thermal</b> <b>Safety</b> Border relative to the serosa. Once the <b>Thermal</b> <b>Safety</b> Border was confirmed to be within the uterine serosal margin in all adjacent ultrasound planes, RF energy was used to accomplish the ablation. Treated fibroids each received one or more ellipsoidal ablations, ranging from 1 to 4  cm in width and 2 – 5  cm in length. The number of ablations, along with their sizes, was at the discretion of the investigator. While usually only one ablation may sufficiently ablate up to a 5 -cm myoma, two smaller ablations might be needed rather than one larger one, in order to ablate a greater aggregate volume when a fibroid is close to the serosa or where there is additional constraint on ablation volume and position (e.g., the cornu).|$|E

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{observation}} that when ionic liquids are added to electrolytes the performances of lithium ion cells become poor, while the <b>thermal</b> <b>safeties</b> of the electrolytes might be improved. In this study, this behavior is investigated based on the kinetics of ionic diffusion. As a model ionic liquid, we chose butyldimethylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BDMIPF 6). The common solvent was propylene carbonate (PC), and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6) {{was selected as the}} lithium conducting salt. Ionic diffusion coefficients are estimated by using a pulsed field gradient NMR technique. From a basic study on the model electrolytes (BDMIPF 6 in PC, UPF 6 in PC, and BDMIPF 6 + LiPF 6 in PC), {{it was found that the}} BDMI+ from BDMIPF 6 shows larger diffusion coefficients than the Li+ from LiPF 6. However, the anionic (PF 6 -) diffusion coefficients present little difference between the model electrolytes. The higher diffusion coefficient of BDMI+ than that of Li+ suggests that the poor C-rate performance of lithium ion cells containing ionic liquids as an electrolyte component can be attributed to the two-cation competition between Li+ and BDMI+. close 474...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{physiological}} abilities of organisms {{to cope with}} heat stress is critical for predictions of species’ distributions in response to climate change. We investigated physiological responses (respiration and heart beat rate) of the ectotherm limpet Patella vulgata to heat stress events during emersion {{and the role of}} seasonal and microclimatic acclimatization for individual thermal tolerance limits. Individuals were collected from 5 microhabitats characterized by different exposure to solar radiation in the high intertidal zone of a semi-exposed rocky shore in winter and summer of 2014. Upper thermal tolerance limits (heat coma temperatures - HCTs, and heart rate Arrhenius break temperatures - ABTs) were determined for individuals from each microhabitat in both seasons under laboratory conditions. While we found a clear seasonal acclimatization, i. e., higher HCTs and ABTs in summer than in winter, we did not find evidence for microhabitat-specific responses that would suggest microclimatic acclimatization. However, operative limpet temperatures derived from in-situ temperature measurements suggest that individuals from sun exposed microhabitats have a much narrower <b>thermal</b> <b>safety</b> margins than those from less exposed surfaces or within crevices. Microhabitat specific <b>thermal</b> <b>safety</b> margins caused by high thermal heterogeneity at small spatial scales and the lack of short term acclimatization will likely shape small scale distribution patterns of intertidal species in response to the predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves...|$|E
