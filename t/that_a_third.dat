5|$|A second {{specimen}} {{was obtained}} in 1966 and the find {{was published in}} 1971 by Hugh Genoways and Knox Jones, who noted that the species is closely similar to O.palustris. Later workers affirmed the relationship between O.dimidiatus, O.palustris and associated species like O.couesi. Fiona Reid reported in 1997 <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> specimen had been found. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler and coworkers removed most of the species formerly placed in Oryzomys from the genus, {{because they are not}} closely related to the type species O.palustris, but kept O.dimidiatus as an Oryzomys.|$|E

5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to DAB, widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first tested in the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016. DAB+ is not backwards compatible with DAB so older radios cannot receive DAB+ stations. There are no plans {{in the foreseeable future}} {{for the vast majority of}} BBC and commercial stations to transition from DAB to DAB+. Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> of radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{reproduction}} is complex, reflecting {{the differences in}} lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> of all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within {{the life cycle of}} a species, the teleomorph and the anamorph. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures for sexual or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing propagules.|$|E
5|$|Hinkley Point A {{nuclear power}} station was a Magnox power station {{constructed}} between 1957 and 1962 and operating until ceasing generation in 2000. Hinkley Point B is an Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) {{which was designed to}} generate 1250MW of electricity (MWe). Construction of Hinkley Point B started in 1967. In September 2008 it was announced, by Electricité de France (EDF), <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third,</b> twin-unit European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) reactor known as Hinkley Point C is planned, to replace Hinkley Point B which is due for closure in 2016.|$|E

The bridges over the Sagtikos at Campus Road and Crooked Hill Road (CR13) {{would have to}} be reconstructed {{to make room for the}} added lane, and the interchange with Pine Aire Drive (exitS3) would be completely rebuilt. A new interchange would also be constructed on the parkway between Pine Aire Drive and Campus Road, creating a junction with CR100. The project would cost $4billion (2011USD) and be built in phases for 15–20 years.|$|E
5|$|One {{specific}} {{failure in}} the massive operation was the critical lack of transport aircraft for the operation, an unsolved flaw that had dogged every large-scale airborne operation the Allies had conducted. In the original planning for Varsity, an extra airborne division, the 13th, had been included; however, a lack of transport aircraft to drop this division led to it being excluded from the final plan. Thus, the unsolved problem of a shortage of transport aircraft meant <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> of the planned troops to be used were discarded, weakening the fighting power of the airborne formation. In the event, the airborne troops actually employed were sufficient to overwhelm the defenders.|$|E

5|$|The orangutans (also spelled orang-utan, orangutang, or orang-utang) {{are three}} extant species of great apes native to Indonesia and Malaysia. Orangutans are {{currently}} only {{found in the}} rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Classified in the genus Pongo, orangutans were originally considered to be one species. From 1996, they {{were divided into two}} species: the Bornean orangutan (P. pygmaeus, with three subspecies) and the Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii). In November 2017 it was reported <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> species had been identified, the Tapanuli orangutan (P. tapanuliensis).|$|E
5|$|The second rule of privity, <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> party cannot claim {{benefits}} from a contract, was widely criticised by academics, {{members of the}} judiciary and legal professionals. One {{problem was that the}} rule made no exceptions for cases where it was obviously intended for the third party to claim a benefit, such as in Beswick v Beswick, where an uncle gave his nephew a business, on the condition that the nephew would pay the uncle a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow.|$|E
5|$|After finding Sharon's trashed hotel room, Mulder {{meets with}} Millar, who {{tells him that}} the door was pulled off the plane from the outside while it was in flight. Later, Frish finds his {{colleague}} dead from a faked suicide. A group of commandos arrive to capture Frish, but he escapes. Frish goes to see Mulder and Scully, telling them that he lied before and that his commanding officer had ordered him to track the plane's coordinates as it was being intercepted by a second aircraft. Seconds later, {{there was an explosion}} and the plane disappeared from his radar. Mulder believes <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> aircraft, a UFO, approached the plane and was destroyed by the second aircraft, also causing the Flight 549 crash. The agents leave with Frish and are soon chased by the commandos. Meanwhile, Millar returns to the crash site and encounters a UFO. He finds Sharon nearby, having just been returned by her abductors.|$|E

5|$|By 1957, the DRR was {{becoming}} overwhelmed by ever-increasing crowds; Disney determined <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> train was needed. Instead of having another locomotive built from scratch {{to pull the}} train, Disney believed that costs could be saved by purchasing and restoring an already-existing narrow-gauge steam locomotive, and the job of finding one was given to Roger Broggie. With the assistance of Gerald Best, a suitable locomotive was found in Louisiana; it had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1894, had previously {{been used as a}} switcher at a sugar cane mill in Louisiana owned by the Godchaux Sugar Company, and was initially used by the Lafourche, Raceland & Longport Railway in Louisiana. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and having its firebox reconfigured to burn diesel oil for fuel to generate steam. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 3 locomotive and it went into service on March 28, 1958, at a cost after restoration of more than $37,000. Joining the No. 3 locomotive when it went into service were five new open-air Narragansett-style excursion cars with front-facing bench seating collectively referred to by Disneyland employees as the Excursion Train, which was designed by Bob Gurr and built at Walt Disney Studios.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Marvel {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> Thor {{film was}} in development, with Craig Kyle and Christopher Yost writing the screenplay, and was officially announced as Thor: Ragnarok in October 2014. By October 2015, Taika Waititi entered in negotiations to direct Thor: Ragnarok. In December 2015, Stephany Folsom {{was hired to}} rewrite the script. A year later, in January 2017, {{it was revealed that}} Eric Pearson wrote the screenplay, with Kyle, Yost and Folsom receiving story credit. Pearson, Kyle and Yost would ultimately receive screenwriting credit for the film. Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins reprise their roles as Thor, Loki, Heimdall and Odin, respectively, and are joined by Cate Blanchett as Hela. Production began in July 2016 in Australia at Village Roadshow Studios, and wrapped in late October 2016. Thor: Ragnarok premiered in Los Angeles on October 10, 2017, began its international release on October 24, 2017 in the United Kingdom, and was released on November 3, 2017 in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 National Family Health Survey, it was {{reported}} that the city's total fertility rate is 1.8, which is below the replacement rate. Only 61% of children had been provided with all basic vaccines (BCG, measles and full courses of polio and DPT), fewer than in all other surveyed cities except Meerut. The infant mortality rate was 35 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate for children under five was 41 per 1,000 live births. The survey also reported <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> of women and a quarter of men are overweight or obese, 49% of children below 5 years are anaemic, and up to 20% of children are underweight, while more than 2% of women and 3% of men suffer from diabetes.|$|E

5|$|Like {{nearly all}} extrasolar planets {{discovered}} prior to 2008, PSR B1620-26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on {{radiation from the}} star it orbits (in this case, changes in the apparent pulsation period of the pulsar). In the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying {{what they thought was}} a binary pulsar, determined <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving an estimate of the mass of the third object that was too small for it to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix's {{investigation}} {{brings him}} to look into an incident seven years ago, in which Athena's mother Metis was killed and Blackquill was convicted for the murder. With one day until Blackquill's planned execution, his sister Aura takes several people hostage, including Phoenix's adopted daughter Trucy, demanding that a re-trial of the case is held to convict Athena for Metis's murder. Upon receiving a letter from Maya Fey, Phoenix decides to hold the trial in the courtroom destroyed in the earlier bombing. Together with chief prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, Phoenix deduces <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> party {{was responsible for the}} murder, proving Athena's and Blackquill's innocence. Edgeworth declares Blackquill a free man, and places him back in charge as prosecutor for the case while he retrieves vital information. Phoenix learns that the true culprit behind both Metis's and Clay's murders was the Phantom, an international spy that has disguised himself as the deceased Fulbright. The Phantom posed as Fulbright to steal evidence to conceal his true identity, fearing he will be killed by his enemies should it be revealed. With the assistance of Edgeworth, Blackquill, Apollo and Athena, Phoenix manages to break the normally emotionless Phantom, after which the Phantom is shot by an unseen sniper. After proving the Phantom's guilt and Athena's innocence and bringing an end to the dark age, the Wright Anything Agency sees Solomon off as he heads into space.|$|E
5|$|The first {{election}} {{under the}} 1776 constitution {{took place in}} 1781, and the system would not change again until 1838. In the interim, {{a number of problems}} had cropped up in the appointment process, and the 1838 election saw the passage of a number of constitutional amendments that fundamentally changed how Senators were chosen. The electoral college was abolished, terms were lengthened to six years with rotating elections such <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> of the senate would be elected every two years, and a single Senator was chosen by direct election from each county and the City of Baltimore. The Senate no longer acted as the Governor's Council, although they would continue to confirm the Governor's appointments. Constitutional changes altered this new system slightly in 1851, when terms were shortened to four years, and 1864, when Baltimore City was given three Senate districts rather than one, but substantial change to the structure of the Senate did not come again until 1964.|$|E
