5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1998 {{to improve the}} bridge over the Schuylkill River in Montgomery County. The work {{involved}} building a new bridge adjacent to the existing bridge; the new bridge was wide enough <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> future widening to six lanes. This project was completed in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The circuit was resurfaced {{ahead of}} the race weekend, {{smoothing}} out many of the bumps and imperfections that had developed over time. The new surface—introduced to allow the circuit <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> round of the MotoGP World Championship—saw teams projecting lap times of under 1:06.000 for the first time.|$|E
5|$|E-767 – the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) {{platform}} for the Japan Self-Defense Forces; it is essentially the Boeing E-3 Sentry mission package on a 767-200ER platform. E-767 modifications, completed on 767-200ERs flown from the Everett factory to Boeing Integrated Defense Systems in Wichita, Kansas, include strengthening <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> dorsal surveillance radar system, engine nacelle alterations, as well as electrical and interior changes. Japan operates four E-767s. The first E-767s were delivered in March 1998.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, Republic Aviation's chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, {{began working}} on a turbojet-powered {{replacement}} for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early centrifugal compressor turbojets. Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an axial compressor turbojet engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the army}} air base was {{reactivated}} as Amarillo Air Force Base and expanded <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> Strategic Air Command B-52 Stratofortress wing. The arrival of servicemen {{and their families}} ended the city's depression. Between 1950 and 1960, Amarillo's population grew from 74,443 to 137,969. However, the closure of Amarillo Air Force Base on December 31, 1968, contributed to a decrease in population to 127,010 by 1970.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, Toshiba {{took over}} {{sponsorship}} of the top-most screen of One Times Square from Discover Card in a 10-year lease. Throughout 2008, upgrades began {{to be made to}} the upper portion of One Times Square; including the installation of new Toshiba high definition LED displays (known as ToshibaVision), and the redesign of its roof <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> larger New Year's Eve ball, which became a year-round fixture of the building beginning in 2009.|$|E

50|$|They {{differed}} from the later Admiralty and the Thornycroft V classes in {{that they had a}} larger bridge structure, taller foremast, mainmast mounted further aft <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>an</b> enlarged spread of wireless aerials, extra boats abreast the after funnel and the searchlight platform between the torpedo tubes was enlarged <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>an</b> extra compass. Vampire trialled triple mounts for her torpedoes and as a result had a total of six tubes.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s Lawrence Expressway was widened {{north of}} I-280 to 8 lanes <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>an</b> HOV carpool lane.|$|R
5|$|In a follow-up, to meet Specification O.21/44 for a two-seat strike fighter, the Spearfish was {{redesigned}} <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> twin-coupled Rolls-Royce Merlin {{engine and}} contra-rotating propellers. A {{variety of other}} engines were considered and although a production order was placed for three examples in 1944, the programme was eventually shelved, remaining as an unfulfilled paper project.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers also {{praised the}} {{gameplay}} and system mechanics. Maxwell McGee of GameSpot credited {{the ability to}} adjust team sizes, adding that the trade-off between strength and versatility helped <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> wider skill range of players. Neidel Crisan of 1UP praised the tutorial system for teaching beginner players about the fundamentals of the fighting game genre. Daniel Maniago of G4 complimented the custom assists, anti-infinite system, and online play, praising Reverge Labs for utilizing feedback from the fighting game community during development.|$|E
5|$|Rodney K. Waldron {{served as}} the head of the library from 1954 until 1984. In the same year as Waldron's departure, Melvin R. George took over as {{director}} of the library, which at that time had a $4.5 million annual budget and 72 employees. In 1986, a room was added to the library <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> donation from alumnus Linus Pauling, which consisted of his papers and two Nobel Prizes.|$|E

5|$|The work {{begins with}} a sinfonia and then {{alternates}} choral movements and arias. There are no recitatives, no da capo repeats, {{and there is no}} chorale tune, unusually for Bach's cantatas. Bach makes extensive use of choral fugues and imitative polyphony, often shifting the tempo and character of the music within movements very quickly <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> new musical idea with each successive phrase of text.|$|E
5|$|Woodside {{railway station}} {{was built in}} 1871 to serve Croydon Racecourse (see below). The station was unusual in being {{designed}} for horses, with access ramps instead of steps and with unusually high entrances designed <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> horse and rider. In 1997 the railway was replaced by Tramlink; the station is now Woodside tram stop.|$|E
5|$|Abe refines this {{proof-of-concept}} {{and builds}} a stable time-apparatus ("the box"), sized <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> human subject. Abe uses this box to travel six hours {{into his own}} past—as part of this process, Original-Abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room, {{so as not to}} interact or interfere with the outside world, after which Original-Abe enters the box, waits inside the box for six hours (thus going back in time six hours), and becomes Future-Abe, who travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the self-storage facility housing the box. At the end of the overlap-timespan, Original-Abe enters the box and ceases to exist.|$|E

5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually large <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} platform.|$|E
5|$|As a {{historic}} site, many of Duxford's buildings {{are of particular}} architectural or historic significance. In 2005, following a review of sites relating to British aviation history by English Heritage, some 255 buildings at 31 sites received listed building status. Duxford contains over thirty of these buildings, the largest number at any one site. Listed buildings include three hangars {{dating back to the}} First World War and the operations block, which received Grade II* status. This block, open to the public, houses the wartime operations room from which Duxford's aircraft were directed. Another historic building, the 1918 Watch Office, will be converted <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> new exhibition entitled Historic Duxford. The exhibition, to open in late 2012, will depict the history of the site and the experiences of Duxford's personnel.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} March 2012, {{information}} was leaked hinting {{at a new}} series of Zenbooks and in early May Asus revealed the UX32 series, followed by their release on May 21. Two models were announced: the UX32A and the UX32VD, both including a thicker chassis <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> 500GB/24GB flash hybrid drive and in the UX32VD an Nvidia Geforce GT 620M. The UX32A was designed to be a cheaper Zenbook with a previous generation Sandy Bridge processor option, lower resolution screen and hybrid drive.|$|E

5|$|As {{time went}} by, Matilda {{directed}} {{more of her}} attention to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century {{some changes}} to Conwy's town walls {{were made in}} order <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> new railway line and roads. The {{engineer}} Thomas Telford built two new gateways into the walls in 1826 to accommodate the traffic from the new suspension bridge across the river Conwy. In 1848 Robert Stephenson constructed the Chester to Holyhead railway line, which ran through Conwy; unusually for the period, {{attempts were made to}} sensitively protect the appearance of the medieval fortifications and the entrance for the railway through the walls {{on the south side of}} the town was built in the form of a mock-Gothic archway, while an exit tunnel was dug under the western walls.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of {{excavation}} of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with clinker (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting gunports into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt <b>to</b> <b>accommodate</b> <b>a</b> hull with carvel edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports. Later examination indicates that the clinker planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.|$|E
