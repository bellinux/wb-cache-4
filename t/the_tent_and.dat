5|$|Then {{the girl}} was pulled into <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> the men started to beat on the shields so her screams could not be heard. Six men entered the tent to have {{intercourse}} with the girl, after which they forced her onto her master's bed. Two men grabbed her hands, and two men her wrists. The angel of death put a rope {{around her neck and}} while two men pulled the rope, the old woman stabbed the girl between her ribs with a knife. Thereafter, the relatives of the dead chieftain arrived with a burning torch and set the ship aflame. It is said that the fire facilitates the voyage to the realm of the dead.|$|E
25|$|On 17 March 2016 Jund al-Aqsa members {{attempted}} {{to hold a}} mourning service at a tent {{for the death of}} an ISIL commander in Sarmin, Idlib Governorate. Ahrar ash-Sham fighters then entered <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> forced them to end the ceremony, sparking a gunfight between the two groups. In response, Jund al-Aqsa fighters set up checkpoints in the town, intending to arrest Ahrar ash-Sham members.|$|E
25|$|After {{the climbers}} had {{recovered}} {{and made their}} way to the tent at Camp VII, Gilkey was lost. He had been anchored to the ice slope as the exhausted climbers prepared <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> <b>and</b> his muffled shouts were heard. When Bates and Streather returned to bring him to the tent, they found no sign of him. A faint groove in the snow suggested that an avalanche had taken place.|$|E
60|$|Herrara {{walked back}} to <b>the</b> <b>tents,</b> <b>and</b> a moment later a horn blew. It had an uncouth sound, and bore no {{resemblance}} to the ordinary call, but it was promptly obeyed. The men snatched their muskets from the piles in front of <b>the</b> <b>tents,</b> <b>and</b> in a wonderfully short time the whole were formed up in their ranks, stiff and immovable.|$|R

25|$|Following Barnum's death, his circus {{merged with}} that of James Anthony Bailey, and {{travelled}} to Europe as the Barnum & Bailey Greatest Show On Earth, where it toured from 1897 to 1902, impressing other circus owners with its large scale, its touring techniques (including <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> circus train), and its combination of circus acts, a zoological exhibition and a freak show. This format was adopted by European circuses {{at the turn of}} the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The king's tent {{was next}} to the woods and was under the {{branches}} of a tall tree for shade. When Agne was fast asleep, Skjalf took a rope which she attached to the torc. Then she had her men remove <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> <b>and</b> she threw the rope over a bough. Then she told her men to pull the rope and they hanged Agne avenging Skjalf's father. Skjalf and her men ran to the ships and escaped to Finland, leaving her sons behind.|$|E
25|$|The Crown {{alleged that}} Lindy Chamberlain had cut Azaria's throat {{in the front}} seat of the family car, hiding the baby's body in a large camera case. She then, {{according}} to the proposed reconstruction of the crime, rejoined the group of campers around a campfire and fed one of her sons a can of baked beans, before going to <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> raising the cry that a dingo had taken the baby. It was alleged that at a later time, while other people from the campsite were searching, she disposed of the body.|$|E
50|$|The demands were rejected, and in July 1972, {{following}} {{an amendment to}} the relevant ordinance, police moved in, removed <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> arrested eight people.|$|R

25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>tent.</b> <b>And</b> this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E
25|$|The party {{started from}} Zermatt on 13 July at half-past five. The eight members {{included}} Peter Taugwalder {{and his two}} sons, Peter and Joseph, who were acting as porters. At 8.20 they reached the chapel at Schwarzsee, where they picked up some material that was left there. They continued along the ridge and at half past eleven they reached {{the base of the}} peak. Then they left the ridge and proceeded for half an hour on the east face. Before twelve o'clock they had found a good position for <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> <b>and</b> at a height of 3,380 metres they set the bivouac. Meanwhile, Croz and young Peter Taugwalder went on to explore the route, in order to save time on the following day. They turned back before 3 p.m., reporting that that ridge offered no great difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Bonatti was in {{the best}} {{physical}} condition of all the climbers and the natural choice to make the summit attempt, but Ardito Desio selected Lacedelli and Compagnoni. Had Bonatti joined the summit team he would likely not have used supplemental oxygen. Therefore, Lacedelli and Compagnoni's oxygen-assisted climb could have been eclipsed. Although the Bonatti-Mehdi forced bivouac was not anticipated, Compagnoni intended to discourage Bonatti from reaching <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> participating in the final summit climb. In the morning of 31 July, after Bonatti and Mehdi had already begun their descent to the safety of Camp VIII, Compagnoni and Lacedelli retrieved the oxygen cylinders left at the bivouac site and reached the summit of K2 at 6.10pm. Ardito Desio, in his final report, mentioned the forced bivouac only in passing. Mehdi's frostbite was an embarrassment to the expedition. The Italian government provided Mehdi with a small pension for his contribution and sacrifice on the first ascent of K2. This is disputed by Mehdi's son.|$|E

500|$|In a paper {{published}} 100 {{years after}} the Amundsen expedition, researchers claimed that <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> flags are buried under [...] of ice and about a minute of latitude north of the South Pole. Scott's party {{was the last to}} see the tent, which they found on 18 January 1912. Henry Robertson Bowers took a photo of the tent, but died returning from the Pole.|$|E
500|$|On 7 May 1916, Ball {{was posted}} to No.11 Squadron, which {{operated}} {{a mix of}} fighters including Bristol Scouts, Nieuport 16s, and Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b [...] "pushers". After his first day of flying with his new unit, {{he wrote a letter}} home complaining about fatigue. He was unhappy with the hygiene of his assigned billet in the nearest village, and elected to live in a tent on the flight line. Ball built a hut for himself to replace <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> cultivated a garden.|$|E
500|$|On July 20, {{the fabric}} began being formed around the {{aluminum}} shell while it remained in <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> <b>and</b> although construction {{was expected to}} be completed on August 1, the opening was not anticipated at that time due to both weekend crowds and the cost of disassembling the tent on the weekend. [...] The weekday opening should allow officials a better opportunity to gauge the wear and tear on the structure by visitors. What eventually amounted to over [...] of fabric was stitched and fitted by over a dozen workers. [...] It opened to the public on August 4 as rescheduled. Upon the completion of the temporary exhibition, the pavilion will be deeded to the city to lend or rent out to other cities. It is not designed to withstand snow loads of a Chicago winter. [...] The pavilion is made of aluminum, donated by Marmon/Keystone Industries, a member of the Marmon Group, and a tensile fabric.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tents</b> were {{exhibited}} at the U.S. Patent Office, and transferred the Smithsonian Institution in 1881. It wasn't until 1901, nearly 40 years after their seizure, that <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> Washington artifacts were returned to the Lees' son, George Washington Custis Lee.|$|R

60|$|There was, however, no {{uncertainty}} as to {{the disposition}} of the savages, when, after a thorough inspection of the children, they took them to <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> set before them some boiled fish and roast venison.|$|R
500|$|The {{bodies of}} the three men were cremated in 1930 without further {{examination}} upon being returned to Sweden. The question of what, exactly, caused their deaths has attracted both interest and controversy among scholars. Several medical practitioners and amateur historians have read the extensive diaries with a detective's eye, looking for clues in the diet, for telltale complaints of symptoms, and for suggestive details at the death site. They agree on many particulars. For instance, the explorers {{are known to have}} eaten mainly scanty amounts of canned and dry goods from the balloon stores, plus huge portions of half-cooked meat of polar bears and occasionally seals. They suffered often from foot pains and diarrhea, and were always tired, cold, and wet. When they moved on to Kvitøya from the ice, they left much of their valuable equipment and stores outside <b>the</b> <b>tent,</b> <b>and</b> even down by the water's edge, as if they were too exhausted, indifferent, or ill to carry it further. Strindberg, the youngest, died first and was [...] "buried" [...] (wedged into a cliff aperture) by the others. However, the interpretation of these observations is contested.|$|E
500|$|The {{party were}} further slowed {{down by the}} {{frostbite}} in Oates' left foot - daily marches were now down to less than five miles, which was insufficient {{given the lack of}} oil. Furthermore, by March 10 it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose." [...] In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated March 16, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, who [...] "now with hands as well as feet pretty well useless", voluntarily left <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E
500|$|On {{the return}} {{journey from the}} Pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams, three days ahead of schedule, noting in his diary for 27 February 1912 [...] "We are {{naturally}} always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt." [...] By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below , and it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble." [...] With 400miles (670km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward. In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, whose toes had become frostbitten, voluntarily left <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E
50|$|Each king {{tried to}} outshine the other, with {{dazzling}} <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> clothes, huge feasts, music, jousting <b>and</b> games. <b>The</b> <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> costumes displayed so much cloth of gold, an expensive fabric woven with silk and gold thread, {{that the site}} of the meeting was named after it.|$|R
6000|$|After breakfast {{he waved}} his hand toward <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> they became {{handkerchiefs}} again, which were at once returned to the pockets of their owners. Then they all climbed into the red wagon and the Sawhorse inquired: ...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} evening, so they drew their camp chairs in a circle before one of <b>the</b> <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> began to tell stories to amuse themselves and pass away the time before they went to bed.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 14th, they {{assembled}} together outside <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> started directly at dawn. Young Peter Taugwalder came on with them as a guide, and his brother, Joseph, returned to Zermatt. They followed the route which had been explored on the previous day, and in a few minutes came in view of the east face: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God told Moses {{to collect a}} staff from the {{chieftain}} {{of each of the}} 12 tribes, inscribe each man's name on his staff, inscribe Aaron's name on the staff of Levi, and deposit the staffs in the Tent of Meeting. The next day, Moses entered <b>the</b> <b>Tent</b> <b>and</b> Aaron's staff had sprouted, blossomed, and borne almonds.|$|E
2500|$|The stripes {{are about}} four inches wide. The tent itself is {{about four feet}} wide by three feet deep, and inside {{headroom}} is well over six feet. A long white zipper runs up {{the middle of the}} front, while the back is open and contoured to fit the bus. The frame consists of four metal poles which fit into pockets inside the top of <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> lock together to form a square. Legs on two of the poles fit into brackets which were bolted to the camper's roof. Two additional poles dogleg into the top frame and have small chain-hooks to hold the doors open. The lower ends of these poles fit into holes in the jack supports. Rubber grommets help protect the paint on the doors and the jack points. The lower edge of the tent is secured to the ground with about a dozen metal stakes. Each stake is about six inches long and is formed from hardened 1/4" [...] rods with a loop at one end. Two storage bags made of (usually matching) canvas with leather straps are supplied for <b>the</b> <b>tent</b> <b>and</b> poles.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s {{the face of}} Sideshow Alley, {{traditionally}} home to the weird and wonderful, began to change. <b>The</b> <b>tents</b> <b>and</b> booths largely disappeared, to be replaced with high technology rides, tests of skill and popular music entertainment.|$|R
50|$|In the Red House Area {{there is}} <b>the</b> Red House <b>Tent</b> <b>and</b> Trailer Area; Quaker Area has <b>the</b> Diehl <b>Tent</b> <b>and</b> Trailer Trailer Area, and the Cain Hollow Camping Area. Between the three, 424 sites are {{available}} for tent or trailer use.|$|R
