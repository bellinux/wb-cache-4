Passenger service was markedly reduced, as people had shifted to using private automobiles for many trips.|$|E
25|$|Born in Chicago, Illinois on November 22, 1905, James Burnham {{was the son}} of Claude George Burnham, an English {{immigrant}} and executive with <b>the</b> <b>Burlington</b> <b>Railroad.</b> James was raised as a Roman Catholic but rejected Catholicism as a college student, professing atheism for much of his life (although returning to the church shortly before his death). He graduated {{at the top of his}} class at Princeton University before attending Balliol College, Oxford University, where his professors included J.R.R. Tolkien and Martin D'Arcy. In 1929, he became a professor of philosophy at New York University.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, Perkins {{believed}} <b>the</b> <b>Burlington</b> <b>Railroad</b> must {{be included}} into a powerful transcontinental system. Though the railroad as far west as Denver and Billings, Montana, it had failed to reach the Pacific Coast during the 1880s and 1890s, when construction was less expensive. Though approached by E. H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad, Perkins felt his railroad was a more natural fit with James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway. With its river line to the Twin Cities, the Burlington Route formed a natural connection between Hill's home town (and headquarters) of St. Paul, Minnesota, and the railroad hub of Chicago. Moreover, Hill was willing to meet Perkins' $200-a-share asking price for the Burlington's stock. By 1900, Hill's Great Northern, {{in conjunction with the}} Northern Pacific Railway, held nearly 100 percent of Burlington's stock.|$|E
25|$|The Fred Harvey Company was {{the owner}} of the Harvey House chain of restaurants, hotels, and other {{hospitality}} industry businesses alongside railroads in the western United States. The company traces its origins to the 1875 opening of two railroad eating houses located at Wallace, Kansas and Hugo, Colorado on the Kansas Pacific Railway. These cafés were opened by Fred Harvey, then a freight agent for the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad. The café operation ended within a year, but Harvey had been convinced of the potential profits from providing a high quality food and service at railroad eating houses. His longtime employer, <b>the</b> <b>Burlington</b> <b>Railroad,</b> declined his offer of establishing a system-wide eating house operation at all railroad meal stops, but the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway (AT) subsequently contracted with Harvey for several eating houses on an experimental basis.|$|E
500|$|Debs {{gradually}} became {{convinced of the}} need for a more unified and confrontational approach as railroads were powerful companies in the economy. [...] One influence was his involvement in <b>the</b> <b>Burlington</b> <b>Railroad</b> Strike of 1888, a defeat for labor that convinced Debs of the necessity of organizing along craft lines. After stepping down as Brotherhood Grand Secretary in 1893, Debs organized one of the first industrial unions in the United States, the American Railway Union (ARU), for unskilled workers. The Union successfully struck the Great Northern Railway in April 1894, winning most of its demands.|$|E

500|$|Bellaire {{was founded}} in 1908 by William Wright Baldwin, who was the {{president}} of the South End Land Company. Baldwin, a native of Iowa, was well known as the vice president of <b>the</b> <b>Burlington</b> <b>Railroad.</b> Bellaire was founded on what was part of William Marsh Rice's [...] ranch. Baldwin surveyed the eastern [...] of the ranch into small truck farms. He named those farms [...] "Westmoreland Farms". Baldwin started Bellaire in the middle of [...] "Westmoreland Farms" [...] to serve as a residential neighborhood and an agricultural trading center. South End Land Company advertised to farmers in the Midwestern United States. Baldwin stated that the town was named [...] "Bellaire", or [...] "Good Air" [...] for its breezes". Bellaire may have been named after Bellaire, Ohio, a town served by one of Baldwin's rail lines.|$|E
500|$|The {{worldwide}} {{economic depression}} of 1890 saw {{the reduction of}} Lincoln's population from 55,000 to 37,000 by 1900. [...] Volga-German immigrants from Russia settled in the North Bottoms neighborhood and as Lincoln expanded with the growth in population, the city began to annex towns nearby. [...] Bethany Heights, incorporated in 1890, was the first town annexed in 1922. [...] In 1926, the town of University Place was annexed. College View, incorporated in 1892, was annexed in 1929. [...] Union College, a Seventh Day Adventist institution, was founded in College View in 1891. [...] In 1930, annexed the town of Havelock. [...] Havelock actively opposed annexation to Lincoln and only relented due to a strike by <b>the</b> <b>Burlington</b> <b>railroad</b> shop workers which halted progress and growth for the city.|$|E
500|$|Immigrants soon created ethnic {{enclaves}} {{throughout the}} city, including Irish in Sheelytown in South Omaha; Germans in the Near North Side, {{joined by the}} European Jews and black migrants from the South; Little Italy and Little Bohemia in South Omaha. Beginning in the late 19th century, Omaha's upper class lived in posh enclaves throughout the city, including the south and north Gold Coast neighborhoods, Bemis Park, Kountze Place, Field Club and throughout Midtown Omaha. They traveled the city's sprawling park system on boulevards designed by renowned landscape architect Horace Cleveland. The Omaha Horse Railway first carried passengers throughout the city, as did the later Omaha Cable Tramway Company and several similar companies. In 1888, the Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company built the Douglas Street Bridge, the first pedestrian and wagon bridge between Omaha and Council Bluffs. Gambling, drinking and prostitution were widespread in the 19th century, first rampant in the city's Burnt District {{and later in the}} Sporting District. Controlled by Omaha's political boss Tom Dennison by 1890, criminal elements enjoyed support from Omaha's [...] "perpetual" [...] mayor, [...] "Cowboy Jim" [...] Dahlman, nicknamed for his eight terms as mayor. Calamities such as the Great Flood of 1881 did not slow down the city's violence. In 1882, the Camp Dump Strike pitted state militia against unionized strikers, drawing national attention to Omaha's labor troubles. The Governor of Nebraska had to call in U.S. Army troops from nearby Fort Omaha to protect strikebreakers for <b>the</b> <b>Burlington</b> <b>Railroad,</b> bringing along Gatling guns and a cannon for defense. When the event ended, one man was dead and several were wounded. In 1891, a mob hanged Joe Coe, an African-American porter after he was accused of raping a white girl. There were several other riots and civil unrest events in Omaha during this period as well.|$|E
