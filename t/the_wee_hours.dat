It burned {{uncontrolled}} until around 1:00am, and, in <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> <b>hours,</b> the walls along Flood's Alley collapsed, filling the alley with debris. By 3:00am it began burning out. Nevins considered the blaze now partially under control.|$|E
25|$|It {{was all for}} naught. By then, Nwe as well as Ngan-Mohn {{had come}} to {{consider}} Maha Dewi as the enemy, believing that she would put her lover on the throne instead. Zeik-Bye had been instigating; he had warned Nwe that Maha Dewi and Maru were plotting to arrest him. By 22 April 1383, Nwe had decided to revolt. In <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> of 5 May 1383, Nwe and his 30 men fled to Dagon, and seized the governor's residence at Dagon.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> <b>hours,</b> 75th Line and the 17th Light Infantry Demi-Brigades added their weight to the battle. By dawn, convinced that the odds against him were increasing, Schübirz withdrew. Given some breathing room by his lieutenant's all-night combat, on 9 May Beaulieu directed his troops to cross the Adda farther north at Lodi. The Battle of Lodi occurred on 10 May, though Schübirz missed it, having been ordered to march four battalions and four squadrons to Crema.|$|E

Burr threw the traditional beads and doubloons to the crowds, and following the parade he reigned at the Krewe's annual invitation-only ball (Bacchus calls it their Rendezvous) at the Rivergate Convention Center in downtown New Orleans. There, an invited crowd of over 10,000 greeted King Bacchus II {{and the rest of the}} parade as it rolled within the Center, with Burr again throwing more beads and doubloons.

25|$|The way to Martaban was now open. Unlike before, Laukpya had not {{opened the}} western front. But Byattaba did not panic. He {{still had the}} support of his other brothers, E Bya Bon and U-Lo, who were commanders in his army, and had {{collected}} enough men and arms. When the Martaban command heard that a Pegu army was taking a circuitous route through the woods to encircle the city from the east, the brothers planned a surprise attack outside the city. In <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> <b>hours,</b> the Martaban army, led by the three brothers themselves, ambushed and destroyed the five vanguard regiments of the Pegu army. But the Martaban command did not know that two Pegu rearguard regiments, led by generals Smim Than-Byat and Dein, were still in the area. While the Martaban army dispersed to mop up the remaining enemies in the area, Than-Byat launched a surprise attack targeting the battalions guarding the Martaban command. It worked. Byattaba, E Bya Bon and U-Lo all fled. The remaining Martaban forces surrendered.|$|E
25|$|The Gujarat {{government}} had faced strong criticism by {{human rights groups}} for anti-Muslim human rights violations, following the communal riots of 2002. During this period, there had been several police encounter deaths in the Gujarat, three {{of which have been}} attributed to attempts to kill Narendra Modi in retaliation for the alleged involvement of the state machinery in the riots. Some human rights activists have alleged that many of these alleged encounters actually happen in police custody. They claimed that there is a pattern that many of these encounters followed: they always took place in <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> of the morning in a deserted area, with no witnesses; a vigorous exchange of fire resulted in the deaths of all the terrorists, while the police received no injuries; and the diary of the accused was often recovered, and contained incriminating evidence. In 2007, several of the policemen held {{responsible for the death of}} Ishrat faced trial in connection with the 2005 fake encounter of Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife. The police officer D.G. Vanzara, who led the encounter was later jailed for his involvement in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter. This resulted in an investigation into the encounter involving Ishrat.|$|E

A spokesman confirms that NATO bombed Zliten at 2:34 a.m. on 9 August, but says he was unable to confirm the casualties.

2500|$|In an interview, Albee {{acknowledged}} that he based the characters of Martha and George on his good friends, New York socialites Willard Maas and Marie Menken. [...] Maas was a professor of literature at Wagner College (one similarity between the character George and Willard) and his wife Marie was an experimental filmmaker and painter. Maas and Menken were known for their infamous salons, where drinking would [...] "commence at 4pm on Friday and end in <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> of night on Monday" [...] (according to Gerard Malanga, a Warhol associate and friend to Maas). The primary conflict between George and Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? derived from Maas and Menken's tempestuous and volatile relationship.|$|E
2500|$|During Union General Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign, Confederate troops under General George E. Pickett fought Union troops near Milford. Just as the Civil War was {{concluding}} in April 1865, President Lincoln {{was assassinated}} in Washington, DC {{as part of a}} conspiracy to kill the leaders of the United States.

2500|$|Russell {{attempts}} {{to highlight the}} cynical view of many Germans towards the Nazi régime. In particular, he focusses on the popular views of key Nazi figures - including Hermann Goering ("When Goering appears on the movie screen...Berlin audiences usually snigger."), Rudolf Hess, Heinrich Himmler, Julius Streicher ("...has committed so many crimes and stolen so much money from the Party that even the Nazis could not cover up his crimes any longer") and Hans Kerrl ("...a gay old rascal frequently seen in Berlin dives until <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> of the morning"). Above all, Joseph Goebbels (whom Russell describes as [...] "...the most hated man in Germany...") is seen to elicit the most hatred. [...] "In three years spent in Germany," [...] Russell wrote [...] "I have never heard one kind word spoken on his behalf." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992 Stone {{founded the}} World Studio Group (WSG) {{for the purpose}} of {{bringing}} together major recording studios around the world in order to provide premium recording services to major groups while on tour. [...] World Studio Group was chosen by Larry Hamby of A Records who proposed Stone's involvement with Woodstock '94. [...] Stone arranged for four remote recording trucks, two for each stage, at Woodstock '94, as a safety backup in case something went wrong. Bearsville Studios would serve as the hub of recording. Bob Clearmountain was chosen as chief audio engineer to tie the four parts together, and to mix the resulting album. Stone arranged to have a tour bus parked between the two stages for as many as 12 audio engineers to sleep. After Peter Gabriel's concluding set ended in <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> of Monday, August 15, 1994, Stone's plan was carried out: all of the performances were digitally copied and backed up in the next two days. Not one song was lost.|$|E

Since then, Pharrell Williams revealed, in an interview in Australia,, that he had also worked with Ciara for the record along with his production outfit, The Neptunes. When asked what the recording process of her new album was like, Ciara made the following comments to Maxim magazine [...] "It's the coolest, can't lie. I go to the studio at, like, noon, and there's a lot of dancing and, of course, singing. There's a cook who whips up food, and we sit around and joke and record until <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> <b>hours.</b> Then we head home, get up, and do it again.

6000|$|But it {{was hard}} work at first. She could get through the days easily enough by {{wandering}} {{in the woods and}} taking long walks along the rugged country roads; but in the evenings came the insistent call of the cafes, the cheap orchestras, vaudeville, midnight suppers and the like. She strenuously fought this yearning and found it was growing less and less powerful to influence her. But her nights were yet restless and her nerves throbbing from the effects of past dissipations. Often she would find herself unable to sleep and would go out into the moonlight when all others were in bed, and [...] "prowl around with the cats," [...] as she expressed it, until <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> of morning. Often she told Patsy she wished there was more work she could do. The drawings required by the paper never occupied her {{more than a couple of}} hours each day.
