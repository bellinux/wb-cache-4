5|$|At present, {{there are}} two ways <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad {{with the rest of the}} country is Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and the Dead Sea to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore the only way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Masada's western side.|$|E
