6000|$|Why is he so disturbed, as {{he reads}} the {{contents}} of his letter? Why do <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>look</b> at him with alarmed eyes? And why, above all, is Hetty so pale? ...|$|R
60|$|The {{mother had}} stood {{watching}} impassive, looking {{not at the}} child, but at Brangwen. He became aware of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>looking</b> at him, standing there isolated yet for him dominant in her foreign existence.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>looked</b> at {{each other}} and said something, and Ciccio interposed, shaking his head. But one woman ostentatiously wiped a bottle mouth with a clean handkerchief, and offered the bottle to Alvina, saying: ...|$|R
60|$|To him <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>looked,</b> praying {{him with}} her eyes. He nodded reluctantly {{and turned toward the}} door.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>looked</b> on the ground, {{as if she}} {{maintained}} {{her position}} by a supreme effort of will.|$|E

6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>looking</b> {{very much}} ashamed, walked along by Christian; she kept rubbing her brown hands together, and saying; [...] "Gracious lady, I {{would not have}} wished. It is heavy, but I would not have wished." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, ma'am," [...] said <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>looking</b> up at Victoria with grateful, patient eyes, {{and then}} with awe at what seemed to her the priceless {{embroidery}} on Victoria's waist, [...] "won't he spoil your dress?" ...|$|R

60|$|But <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>looked</b> {{away at the}} violet-shadowed sails, afar on the changeful purple of the sea, and {{her throat}} choked with pain.|$|E

60|$|To please his guests, Curtis {{allowed the}} utmost formality, {{and did not}} hasten, interrupt, or excise.

60|$|<b>The</b> gypsy <b>woman</b> <b>looked</b> at him reproachfully {{out of her}} one {{uncovered}} eye.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> poor <b>woman</b> <b>looked</b> at {{him with}} tears of gladness in her eyes.|$|R

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>looked</b> up at Mrs. Bird, with a keen, scrutinizing glance, {{and it did}} {{not escape}} her that she was dressed in deep mourning.|$|E

60|$|At {{first he}} could {{scarcely}} distinguish one woman from another amongst {{the crowd that}} thronged the courtyard, and the close ironwork hindered his view considerably. <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>looked</b> almost like phantoms in the grey misty air, gliding slowly along with noiseless tread on the flag-stones.|$|R
60|$|Macphail {{turned his}} head when the missionary came back. <b>The</b> two <b>women</b> <b>looked</b> up.|$|R

6000|$|... "It was an {{exceptionally}} deep lock. The party gathered round {{and watched the}} water slowly rising. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>looked</b> down, and shuddered; the man was standing by her side.|$|E

[...] Lloyd and <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>looks</b> at each other, as Lloyd picks out a rod (the type {{used for}} Urethral sounding) and inserts {{it into his}} erect penis.

60|$|It was {{significant}} that the hum of voices which followed the music ceased as the drumming of hoofs grew louder; <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>looked</b> anxious and <b>the</b> men glanced at one another.
