5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> of the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did not agree with him, because he did not feel his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Det Norske Helikoperskole started Norway's first {{helicopter}} pilot {{school at the}} airport. This was met with protests from <b>the</b> <b>neighbors,</b> who were affected by noise pollution all day long. The municipality was sued by 600 locals who wanted to prohibit the school from operating. During an air show in 1983, the airport was visited by a Boeing 737-200 from Braathens SAFE and General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon from the Royal Norwegian Air Force.|$|E

Most of <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, {{except for the}} eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries. This leads him to discover he can groom dogs' hair, and later he styles the hair of the neighborhood women. One of <b>the</b> <b>neighbors,</b> Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce Edward, but scares him away.

50|$|This alpha is {{also one}} of two {{versions}} to have a tutorial. The player's first objective is to complete a tutorial that explains how to interact with the environment in Hello <b>Neighbor.</b> Then, <b>the</b> player must go to <b>the</b> <b>neighbor's</b> house. Should <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> catch <b>the</b> player the first time, they will be treated to a cutscene of <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> going inside <b>the</b> basement. What may look like an explosion occurs, and a tire rolls out. Then <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> goes back upstairs and walks away. This alerts the player that he needs to find out what <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> is hiding. As from the Pre-Alpha, the player needs a key and a tool for getting the boards off, however the keypad has been removed.|$|R
50|$|Next, {{for each}} <b>neighbor,</b> <b>the</b> BGP process applies various {{standard}} and implementation-dependent criteria {{to decide which}} routes conceptually should go into <b>the</b> Adj-RIB-In. <b>The</b> <b>neighbor</b> could send several possible routes to a destination, but the first level of preference is at <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> level. Only one route to each destination will be installed in the conceptual Adj-RIB-In. This process will also delete, from the Adj-RIB-In, any routes that are withdrawn by <b>the</b> <b>neighbor.</b>|$|R
5|$|In another story, Stowe and Calvin {{meet a man}} on a Mandarin dock who {{has been}} cheated out of much the land he was given by the government. Named Old Cudjo, he worked the small {{homestead}} on which he grew cotton for years. Where at first <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> surrounding the colony of former slaves from South Carolina were hesitant and suspicious, Old Cudjo and his colony were so industrious and honest that they won their white neighbors over. One who was a justice of the peace intervened on his behalf and Old Cudjo's land was returned to him. Stowe's final chapter is dedicated to defending the notion that blacks should be employed to help build the state of Florida to transform it from a wilderness into a civilization. They are better suited for work in the hot sun, more resistant to malaria, and are trustworthy and extremely eager to learn. She also dedicates a few pages to her interested observations on their culture as she details overhearing their festivities at night and sitting outside an informal church service.|$|E
5|$|The film {{continues}} to be appreciated for its experimental nature, its camera angles and montage elements being treated in an unusual manner, while the fiction elements of the screenplay hint of magic realism. In this sense, {{it is important to}} mention that the days in the film are separated by Andrei's erotic dreams. In his dreams, the differences between him and Marilena are partially removed, either by lowering the rooftop on which the boy stands to ground level or by debarking the girl from a breast-shaped UFO that scares <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> away. Another fictional element is Marilena's capacity of provoking short circuits, in moments in which she is very emotionally active (e.g., when Andrei touches her in the bar's restroom, or when the whole neighborhood is cut from electricity when she cries near the high voltage electrical box).|$|E

25|$|An edge connects {{vertices}} x and y in {{the graph}} (where x<nbsp&y) whenever the xth {{bit of the}} binary representation of y is nonzero. Thus, for instance, <b>the</b> <b>neighbors</b> of vertex 0 consist of all odd-numbered vertices, because the numbers whose 0th bit is nonzero are exactly the odd numbers. <b>The</b> <b>neighbors</b> of vertex 1 consist of vertex 0 (previously identified because 1 is odd) and all vertices with numbers congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4 (because those are exactly the numbers with a nonzero bit at index 1), every {{one of which is}} greater than 1.|$|E

30|$|Due {{to the use}} of <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> table, adversaries {{can hardly}} launch replay attacks. For the node joining messages, if a node exists in <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> table, any {{duplicate}} joining messages claimed to be from it will be discarded by the receiving node. For the data messages, by using the sequence number field in <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> table, any duplicate data messages will also be discarded by the receiver.|$|R
50|$|In May 2013, Shumlin was {{involved}} in a real estate transaction, which generated controversy. A neighbor, who owned a house and land adjacent to Shumlin's East Montpelier home, owed back taxes and risked losing the property in a tax sale, asked Shumlin to consider buying the property. Shumlin bought the property, had the assessed value reduced because the house was in disrepair, paid the back taxes, paid <b>the</b> <b>neighbor's</b> back child support, and allowed <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> to continue living in the house for several months. <b>The</b> <b>neighbor</b> then had second thoughts about the transaction. After some criticism in the press, Shumlin agreed to let <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> repurchase <b>the</b> property.|$|R

50|$|The subplot {{involves}} Wilson, {{who tries}} to make amends with a difficult neighbor.

He finds that <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> is a wounded veteran who lost an arm in Vietnam; However Houses further investigations lead him to discover <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> is Canadian. <b>The</b> <b>neighbor's</b> anger is derived from his pain, and his pain {{is due to a}} psychosomatic attachment to a phantom limb. House dismisses his veteran status as Canada was not combatively involved in Vietnam but <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> points out historically Canada did send troops to Vietnam in 1973 to enforce the peace process where he struck a land mine saving a child. House solves the dispute with Wilson's neighbor by kidnapping him and forcing him to undergo V.S.

Wilson finds <b>the</b> <b>neighbor</b> has withdrawn all accusations and is allowing Wilson to do things he had been very much against. Wilson wonders what House did, and House says he was nice. Wilson doesn't really believe him, but House merely asks, 'Do you really want to know?' Wilson says he'll give House the benefit of the doubt.|$|R
