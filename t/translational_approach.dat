Taking multiple sclerosis as an exemplary disease, he primarily investigates aspects of immuneregulation and the interaction between immune system and nervous system. Furthermore, Wiendl conducted research projects on immune cell trafficking and explores biomarkers for the prognosis and therapy of multiple sclerosis. By establishing translational research projects, his work helps to further elucidate {{the question of how}} immune therapies in neurological diseases work and how new mechanisms of action can be developed. In his research projects, Wiendl pursues a <b>translational</b> <b>approach,</b> closely connecting laboratory work with patient care. With this objective, he also established a biobank at the Department of Neurology Muenster. Wiendl was involved {{in the development of the}} monoclonal antibody daclizumab which was approved in 2016 and exhibits a completely new mechanism of action in MS therapy.

Although in vitro experiments can obtain valuable information of the mechanisms underlyingdrug-induced toxicity, {{there is still a}} clear lack of approaches translating such in vitro findings into apatient situation. In this thesis, a novel <b>translational</b> <b>approach</b> is presented and is successfully applied inthree different studies to investigate the onset of adverse drug events at patient level. Here, multiscalemodeling enables the coupling of in vitro concentration-response relationships, at the cellular level, withdrug concentration-time profiles, at the organism level, to predict cellular responses following drug administrationof different doses in vivo. The application of the developed <b>translational</b> <b>approach</b> allowedstudying drug-induced toxicity in humans (i) for acute and chronic administration of azathioprine in aproof-of-concept study, (ii) for fifteen hepatotoxic drugs in a comparative manner focusing on drug administrationof therapeutic and toxic doses, and (iii) for a drug combination therapy of acetaminophenand caffeine. The presented <b>translational</b> <b>approach</b> may lead to useful knowledge for clinical applicationgained from in vitro experiments thereby contributing to the ongoing discussion of the predictive valueof preclinical research.

40|$|Abstract. Bridging grammarware and modelware {{is still}} challenging, though often {{required}} {{as a prerequisite}} for several model-driven engineering scenarios. For instance, in model-driven reverse engineering, program code has to be lifted to the model level before model-driven techniques are applicable. Manually building metamodels based on given grammars introduces a significant overhead and may lead to inconsistencies between the resulting metamodels and the grammars, especially when dealing with large languages. In previous work, we have investigated a purely <b>translational</b> <b>approach</b> that is able to semi-automatically generate metamodels from grammars by utilizing user input. In this work, we aim to provide {{a higher degree of}} automation by combining the <b>translational</b> <b>approach</b> with by-example techniques to reduce the manual effort. In particular, knowledge is derived from concrete programs to further refine the produced metamodels. We demonstrate a transformation chain that combines translational and by-example techniques to produce Ecore-based metamodels from EBNFbased grammars. ...|$|E
