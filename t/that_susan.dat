25|$|Islamists {{took control}} in Sudan in a 1989 coup d'état, and the United States adopted {{a policy of}} {{disengagement}} with the authoritarian regime throughout the 1990s. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, however, some critics charged that the US should have moderated its policy toward Sudan earlier, since the influence of Islamists there waned {{in the second half}} of the 1990s, and Sudanese officials began to indicate an interest in accommodating US concerns with respect to 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden, who had been living in Sudan until he was expelled in May 1996. Timothy M. Carney, US ambassador to Sudan between September 1995 and November 1997, co-authored an op-ed in 2002 claiming that in 1997 Sudan offered to turn over its intelligence on bin Laden but <b>that</b> <b>Susan</b> Rice, as NSC Africa specialist, together with the then NSC terrorism specialist Richard A. Clarke, successfully lobbied for continuing to bar U.S. officials, including the CIA and FBI, from engaging with the Khartoum government. Similar allegations (<b>that</b> <b>Susan</b> Rice joined others in missing an opportunity to cooperate with Sudan on counterterrorism) were made by Vanity Fair contributing editor David Rose and Richard Miniter, author of Losing Bin Laden.|$|E
25|$|On December 20, 1997, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), {{started to}} monitor a weak {{tropical}} disturbance that was located about , {{to the northwest}} of Pago-Pago in American Samoa. Over {{the next two weeks}} the system gradually moved towards the west-southwest, without developing into a tropical cyclone. During January 2, a mid-level ridge of high pressure developed between Fiji and Vanuatu, which provided an area of low vertical wind shear. The system subsequently started to show signs of significant development, before early on January 3, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated warnings on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 11P. The FMS subsequently reported later that day that the depression had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone, on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, while located near the Fiji dependency of Rotuma. During that day the system continued to rapidly develop with RSMC Nadi reporting early on January 4, <b>that</b> <b>Susan</b> had become a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 120km/h (75mph). During January 4, Susan continued to rapidly intensify with the JTWC reporting <b>that</b> <b>Susan</b> had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale as convection surrounding the system organized further and developed an eye feature.|$|E

Xanadu was a lonely fortress, and Susan was quite right to escape from it. The mistress was never one of Hearst's possessions: he was always her suitor, {{and she was the}} precious treasure of his heart for more than 30 years, until his last breath of life.
