They include the goblin shark, basking shark, megamouth shark, the <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks,</b> shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and great white shark. They are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction. The Lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon, Carcharodon megalodon.|$|E
5|$|Other sharks feed on squid or fish, {{which they}} swallow whole. The viper dogfish has teeth it can point {{outwards}} to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact. The great white {{and other large}} predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. <b>Thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded rostra.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategies}} that sailfish and <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> employ against shoaling fish {{are more effective}} when the shoal is first concentrated into a ‘bait ball’ (Helfman, Collette & Facey, 1997; Oliver et al., 2013; Domenici et al., 2014). Since this is difficult for individual predators to achieve, they cooperate in this effort. When herding a shoal of fish or squid, sailfish also raise their sails to make themselves appear larger. When they slash or wipe their bills through shoaling fish by turning their heads, their dorsal sail and fins are outstretched to stabilize their bodies hydrodynamically (Lauder & Drucker, 2004). Domenici et al. (2014) postulate that these fin extensions enhance the accuracy of tapping and slashing. The sail can reduce yaw rotation by counteracting the lateral force in the direction opposite to the slash. This means that prey {{is less likely to}} recognize the massive trunk as being part of an approaching predator (Marras et al., 2015; Webb & Weihs 2015). Film footage available online impressively demonstrates the hunting strategies of sailfish and <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks.</b>|$|E

5|$|The common {{thresher}} is {{a fairly}} robust shark with a torpedo-shaped trunk and a short, broad head. The dorsal profile of the head curves evenly down to the pointed, conical snout. The eyes are moderately large and lack nictitating membranes. The small mouth is arched and, unlike in other <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks,</b> has furrows at the corners. There are 32-53 upper and 25-50 lower tooth rows; the teeth are small, triangular, and smooth-edged, lacking lateral cusplets. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with {{the fourth and fifth}} pairs located over the pectoral fin bases.|$|E

500|$|The common {{thresher}} (Alopias vulpinus), {{also known}} by many {{names such as}} Atlantic thresher, big-eye <b>thresher,</b> fox <b>shark,</b> green <b>thresher,</b> swingletail, slasher, swiveltail, thintail <b>thresher,</b> whip-tailed <b>shark</b> and Zorro <b>thresher</b> <b>shark,</b> is the largest species of <b>thresher</b> <b>shark,</b> family Alopiidae, reaching some [...] in length. About half of its length consists of the elongated upper lobe of its caudal fin. With a streamlined body, short pointed snout, and modestly sized eyes, the common thresher resembles (and has often been confused with) the pelagic thresher (A. pelagicus). It can be distinguished from the latter species by the white of its belly extending in a band over the bases of its pectoral fins. The common thresher is distributed worldwide in tropical and temperate waters, though it prefers cooler temperatures. It can be found both close to shore and in the open ocean, from the surface {{to a depth of}} [...] It is seasonally migratory and spends summers at lower latitudes.|$|R
25|$|Swordfish {{charge at}} high speeds through forage fish schools, {{slashing}} with their swords to kill or stun prey.

500|$|Interestingly, Spinosaurus {{exhibited}} the anatomical features required to combine all three hunting strategies: a sail for herding prey more efficiently, {{as well as}} flexible tail and neck to slap the water for stunning, injuring or killing prey. The submerged dorsal sail would have provided a strong centreboard-like counterforce for powerful sidewards movements of the strong neck and long tail, as performed by sailfish (Domenici et al., 2014) or <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> (Oliver et al., 2013). While smaller dorsal sails or fins make the dorsal water volume better accessible for slashing, it can be speculated that their smaller stabilization effect makes lateral slashing less efficient (e.g. for <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks).</b> Forming a hydrodynamic fulcrum and hydrodynamically stabilizing the trunk along the dorsoventral axis, Spinosaurus’ sail would also have compensated for the inertia of the lateral neck by tail movements and vice versa not only for predation but also for accelerated swimming. This behaviour might also have been one reason for Spinosaurus’ muscular chest and neck reported by Ibrahim et al. (2014). [...] " ...|$|E
500|$|Certain {{species of}} fish {{maintain}} elevated body temperatures. Endothermic teleosts (bony fish) {{are all in the}} suborder Scombroidei and include the billfishes, tunas, and one species of [...] "primitive" [...] mackerel (Gasterochisma melampus). All sharks in the family Lamnidae – shortfin mako, long fin mako, white, porbeagle, and salmon shark – are endothermic, and evidence suggests the trait exists in family Alopiidae (<b>thresher</b> <b>sharks).</b> The degree of endothermy varies from the billfish, which warm only their eyes and brain, to bluefin tuna and porbeagle sharks who maintain body temperatures elevated in excess of 20°C above ambient water temperatures. See also gigantothermy. Endothermy, though metabolically costly, is thought to provide advantages such as increased muscle strength, higher rates of central nervous system processing, and higher rates of digestion.|$|E

500|$|Common {{threshers}} {{are well}} regarded by sports fishers {{as one of}} the strongest fighting sharks alongside the shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrhinchus), and are ranked as game fish by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA). They are pursued by anglers using rod and reel off California, South Africa, and elsewhere. Frank Mundus has called <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> [...] "exceedingly stubborn" [...] and [...] "pound for pound, a harder fish to whip" [...] than the mako. Fishing for the common thresher is similar to that for the mako; the recommended equipment is a [...] rod and a big-game reel holding at least 365 m (400 yd) of [...] line. The ideal method is trolling with baitfish, either deep or allowing it to drift.|$|E
500|$|An oft-repeated myth {{about the}} common {{thresher}} {{is that they}} cooperate with swordfish to attack whales. In one version of events, the thresher shark circles the whale and distracts it by beating the sea to a froth with its tail, thereby allowing the swordfish to impale it in a vulnerable spot with its rostrum. In an alternate account, the swordfish positions itself beneath the whale, while the thresher leaps {{out of the water}} and lands on top of the whale, hammering it onto the swordfish's rostrum. Yet other authors describe the thresher [...] "cutting huge gashes" [...] in the side of the whale with its tail. Neither threshers nor swordfish however are known to feed on whales or indeed possess the dentition to do so. The story may have arisen from mariners mistaking the tall dorsal fins of killer whales, which do attack large cetaceans, for thresher shark tails. Swordfish bills have also been found embedded in blue and fin whales (likely accidents due to the fast-moving fish's inertia), and <b>thresher</b> <b>sharks</b> do exhibit some of the aforementioned behaviors independent of whales.|$|E

500|$|There are {{numerous}} accounts of common threshers using the long upper lobes of their tail fins to stun prey, {{and they are}} often snagged on longlines by their tails after presumably striking at the bait.
