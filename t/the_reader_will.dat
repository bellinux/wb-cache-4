5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|Making or {{recording}} a payment using the card for public transport or purchases at Octopus-enabled retailers {{can be done}} by holding the card against or waving it over an Octopus card reader from up to a few centimetres away. <b>The</b> <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> acknowledge payment by emitting a beep, and displaying the amount deducted and the remaining balance of the card. Standard transaction time for readers used for public transport is 0.3 seconds, while that of readers used for retailers is 1 second. When using the MTR system, the entry point of commuters is noted when a passenger enters, and the appropriate amount based on distance traveled will be deducted when the users validate their cards again at the exit point.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{protocols}} {{for the evaluation}} of research reports have been suggested and will be summarized here. Some of these divide research evidence dichotomously into EBP and non-EBP categories, while others employ multiple levels of evidence.

25|$|Every apology is, however, due to {{the reader}} for the hasty and {{imperfect}} execution of the plates. Having much more serious work in hand, and desiring merely to render them illustrative of my meaning, I have sometimes very completely failed even of that humble aim; and the text, being generally written before the illustration was completed, sometimes naively describes as sublime or beautiful features which the plates represents by a blot.

25|$|After {{determining}} {{that the subject}} is cooperative, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> make a number of probing statements or questions, typically using variations of the methods noted below. The subject will then reveal further information with their replies (whether verbal or non-verbal) and the cold reader can continue from there, pursuing promising lines of inquiry and quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones. In general, while revelations seem {{to come from the}} reader, most of the facts and statements come from the subject, which are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce the idea that the reader got something correct.|$|E

25|$|The {{main body}} of the work states at the {{beginning}} that it assumes prior knowledge of Immanuel Kant's theories, and Schopenhauer is regarded by some as remaining more faithful to Kant's metaphysical system of transcendental idealism {{than any of the other}} later German Idealists. However, the book contains an appendix entitled critique of the Kantian philosophy, in which Schopenhauer rejects most of Kant's ethics and significant parts of his epistemology and aesthetics. Schopenhauer demands that the introduction be read before the book itself, although it is not fully contained in this book but appeared earlier under the title On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason. He also states in his introduction that <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> be at his best prepared to understand his theories if he has lingered in the school of Plato or he is already familiar with Indian philosophy.|$|E
500|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Richardson prefaced {{the novel by}} claiming to be merely the editor, saying, [...] "How such remarkable collections of private letters fell into the editor's hand he hopes <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> not think it very necessary to enquire". [...] However, Richardson did not keep his authorship secret and, on the prompting of his friends like Samuel Johnson, dropped this framing device from the second edition.|$|E
500|$|In 1852, he {{serialized}} a novel titled Life and Adventures of Jack Engle: An Auto-Biography: A Story of New York at the Present Time {{in which}} <b>the</b> <b>Reader</b> <b>Will</b> Find Some Familiar Characters in six installments of New York's The Sunday Dispatch. In 1858, Whitman published a 47,000 word series called Manly Health and Training under the pen name Mose Velsor. Apparently {{he drew the}} name Velsor from Van Velsor, his mother's family name. This self-help guide recommends beards, nude sunbathing, comfortable shoes, bathing daily in cold water, eating meat almost exclusively, plenty of fresh air, and getting up early each morning. Present-day writers have called Manly Health and Training [...] "quirky", [...] "so over the top", [...] "a pseudoscientific tract", and [...] "wacky".|$|E

500|$|The book {{received}} relatively positive {{reviews from}} critics. Susan Carpenter, {{writing in the}} Los Angeles Times, called the book [...] "a luridly fascinating, if horrifying, tell-all, from her birth in an eastern Ohio steel town to her present-day life as an actress and recording artist who is happily married in L.A." [...] Amanda Tyler of USA Today commented: [...] "Lords' story of personal redemption is so immersed in genuine emotion and beaming with soulful resiliency that <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> walk away with nothing but respect {{for her and her}} remarkable journey." [...] Bill Zwecker, who reviewed the book for Chicago Sun-Times, noted: [...] "'Graphic' is said to be quite the understatement for the memoirs former under-age porn star Traci Lords has penned." [...] John Patterson of The Guardian wrote: [...] "It has porn's typical, irreversible-nosedive trajectory: fake IDs, serious money, major narcotics - the lowest, stickiest rung on stardom's ladder - followed by exposure (of entirely the wrong sort), disgrace, and rehabilitation." ...|$|E
500|$|Palmetto Leaves was not Stowe's first travel memoir. In 1854 she {{published}} Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands {{about her}} {{first trip to}} Europe, a book unique as an American woman's view of Europe. She followed this with Agnes of Sorrento that appeared as a serial in The Atlantic Monthly from 1861 to 1862. Source material for Agnes of Sorrento was culled from her observations of and experiences in Italy, collected during her third trip to Europe, which she took with her family. Olav Thulesius, author of Harriet Beecher Stowe in Florida, recognizes Stowe's tendency to spin everything she saw into something selectively positive. Stowe addressed this in the foreword to Sunny Memoirs of Foreign Lands, writing: If the criticism be made that every thing is given couleur de rose, the answer is, Why not? If there be characters and scenes that seem drawn with too bright a pencil, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> consider that, after all, there are many worse sins than disposition to think and speak well of one's neighbors.|$|E
500|$|Although Wollstonecraft argues against {{excessive}} sensibility, {{the rhetoric}} of the Rights of Woman is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader. Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at Rousseau. For example, after excerpting a long passage from [...] (1762), Wollstonecraft pithily states, [...] "I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage, than just to observe, that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness." [...] A mere page later, after indicting Rousseau's plan for female education, she writes [...] "I must relieve myself by drawing another picture." [...] These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument (it is assumed that <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> agree with them). While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience, she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self. Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric.|$|E

Furthermore, there is still an increasing interest in its potential in clinical and research applications. Despite very early technical infancy problems, which meanwhile have been solved, there are still different limitations that have to be worked around in daily routine responsibly by the physicists and physicians. This article gives an overview over the most common technical, logistical, and clinical limitations; artifacts; and pitfalls, without any claim for completeness. <b>The</b> <b>readers</b> <b>will</b> not only learn the background of the limitation but also partly learn about possible solutions.

500|$|Influenced by his {{television}} and film scripting background, Martin {{tries to keep}} readers engrossed by ending each Ice and Fire chapter with a tense or revelational moment, a twist or a cliffhanger, similar to a TV act break. Scriptwriting has also taught him the technique of [...] "cutting out the fat and leaving the muscle", which is {{the final stage of}} completing a book, a technique that brought the page count in A Dance with Dragons down almost eighty pages. Dividing the continuous Ice and Fire story into books is much harder for Martin. Each book shall represent a phase of the journey that ends in closure for most characters. A smaller portion of characters is left with clear-cut cliffhangers to make sure readers come back for the next installment, although A Dance with Dragons had more cliffhangers than Martin originally intended. Both one-time and regular POV characters are designed to have full character arcs ending in tragedy or triumph, and are written to hold the readers' interest and not be skipped in reading. Main characters are killed off so that <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> not rely on the hero to come through unscathed and will instead feel the character's fear with each page turn.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{starting}} the actual reading, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> typically try to elicit {{cooperation from the}} subject, saying something such as, [...] "I often see images that are a bit unclear and which may sometimes mean more to you than to me; if you help, we can together uncover new things about you."

While <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> <b>will</b> do most of the talking, it is the subject who provides the meaning.|$|E
