5|$|A European innovation, castles {{originated}} in the 9thand 10thcenturies, {{after the fall of}} the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. These nobles built castles <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> area immediately surrounding them, and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as protection from enemies. Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source.|$|E

5|$|Before the Romans {{arrived in}} Britain, the land now forming {{the county of}} Carmarthenshire {{was part of the}} kingdom of the Demetae who gave their name to the county of Dyfed; it {{contained}} one of their chief settlements, Moridunum, now known as Carmarthen.
