25|$|Why did I take my own life? Well, {{when you}} {{committed}} two double murders you would too. Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin {{in the city}} park that night, and killed Mr. Starks {{and tried to get}} Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever you think it will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, I think it should go to him, and <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> don't want the car now.|$|E

500|$|In 1892, Warner {{returned}} to Springville {{and began to}} use his cowboy experience to [...] gamble on horse races. Although he {{had no interest in}} college, soon after coming back he was practically forced to attend Cornell University's law school, as he lost all of his money at the races. Later Warner wrote [...] "I dare not write to my father and <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> was broke" [...] he felt {{that the only way to}} get funds was to inform his father that he decided to study law.

2500|$|In April 1982, when {{interviewer}} Merv Griffin {{asked him}} about his religious beliefs, Welles replied, [...] "I {{try to be a}} Christian.

[...] Near {{the end of his life}} Welles was dining at Ma Maison, his favorite restaurant in Los Angeles, when proprietor Patrick Terrail conveyed an invitation from the head of the Greek Orthodox Church, who asked Welles to be his guest of honor at divine liturgy at Saint Sophia Cathedral.

Like father, like daughter. Did you ever see Gropius? A big handsome man. The true Aryan type. The only man who was racially suited to me.

2500|$|One Texas Ranger {{said that}} {{although}} {{it was obvious to}} him that Lucas often lied, there was an instance where he demonstrated guilty knowledge: [...] "I remember him trying to cop to one he didn't do, but there was another murder case where I'll kiss your butt if he didn’t lead us right to the deer stand where the murder took place. Ain't no way he could've guessed that, and I damn sure didn't <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> think he did that one." [...] Another Ranger had a similar experience: Lucas demonstrated his apparent familiarity with a crime scene by directing his escort to the murder location with ease, {{as if he had been}} there before.|$|E

2500|$|The Black Beetle attacks {{during a}} family hike. During the battle, Black Beetle {{claims to be}} Hector's future incarnation, wanting revenge for Nadia's death. He retracts his statement, {{claiming}} to have killed Hector and taken his scarab.

Jaime eventually manages to use tachyon beams to paralyze Black Beetle, only for the villain to claim that he was Jaime from the future {{and that he would}} don the black scarab after Milagro (who would suffer brain damage from the injury she had just received in the present) destroyed the scarab. Jaime, deciding to get Milagro medical attention as quickly as possible, was forced to let Black Beetle escape.

6000|$|... "Do so. <b>Tell</b> <b>him</b> that <b>I</b> am {{well and}} prospering. But say no more. Do not <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> what <b>I</b> am doing. He has his prejudices too.
