5|$|On April 17, 2013, it was rechalked by {{more than}} 100 people, {{including}} local councillor, Alex Lofts. On April 18, it was again removed, only to be re-chalked. Since that date it has remained chalked. A group of families and supporters continue to chalk the rainbow, especially after rain. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>has</b> also ensured the area remains free of litter; they also hold occasional performances and arts-related celebrations at the site. Some local businesses have offered discounts {{and support for the}} rainbow, these display a logo with a stylised image of the rainbow crossing on it.|$|E
5|$|The {{cockatoos}} {{were first}} {{defined as a}} subfamily Cacatuinae within the parrot family Psittacidae by the English naturalist George Robert Gray in 1840, with Cacatua the first listed and type genus. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>has</b> alternately been considered as either a full or subfamily by different authorities. The American ornithologist James Lee Peters in his 1937 Check-list of Birds of the World, Sibley and Monroe in 1990 maintained it as a subfamily, while parrot expert Joseph Forshaw classified it as a family in 1973. Subsequent molecular studies indicate that the earliest offshoot from the original parrot ancestors were the New Zealand parrots of the superfamily Strigopoidea, and following this the cockatoos, now a well-defined group or clade, split off from the remaining parrots, which then radiated across the Southern Hemisphere and diversified into the many species of parrots, parakeets, macaws, lories, lorikeets, lovebirds and other true parrots of the superfamily Psittacoidea.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{have been}} {{referred}} to as living fossils, which means they retain many basal characteristics from {{around the time of the}} squamate – rhynchocephalian split (220 MYA). However, taxonomic work on Sphenodontia has shown <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>has</b> undergone a variety of changes throughout the Mesozoic, and a March 2008 molecular study showed their rate of molecular evolution has been the fastest of any animal yet examined. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There was even a successful group of aquatic sphenodontians known as pleurosaurs, which differed markedly from living tuatara. Tuatara show cold weather adaptations that allow them to thrive on the islands of New Zealand; these adaptations may be unique to tuatara since their sphenodontian ancestors lived in the much warmer climates of the Mesozoic. For instance, Palaeopleurosaurus appears to have had a much shorter lifespan compared to the modern tuatara.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>has</b> {{received}} some attention {{in recent years}} due to claims from the Republic of Macedonia that these people form an ethnic Macedonian minority in Greece. Some organisations and academics have stated {{that there is a}} minority within the Slavophone community in Greece which self-identifies as ethnic Macedonian.|$|E
25|$|The crown group mammals, {{sometimes}} called 'true mammals', are the extant mammals {{and their relatives}} back to their last common ancestor. Since <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>has</b> living members, DNA analysis can be applied {{in an attempt to}} explain the evolution of features that do not appear in fossils. This endeavor often involves molecular phylogenetics, a technique that has become popular since the mid-1980s.|$|E

25|$|The {{closely related}} Lenape (Delaware) {{languages}} Munsee and Unami form a subgroup, {{with the two}} languages descending from an immediate ancestor called Common Delaware (CD). Goddard notes {{a small number of}} innovations in morphology and phonology that set Munsee and Unami off from their neighbours. As well, similarities between the Delaware languages and Mahican have been recognized in that Mahican shares innovations with Munsee and Unami, suggesting a subgroup containing Common Delaware and Mahican; <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>has</b> been referred to as Delawaran.|$|E
25|$|Group R6-1 {{is similar}} to GroupsQ5-1 and Q6-1, except that the higher pyramid {{structure}} is {{on the south side}} of the courtyard. The basal platform of the complex is built of dolomitic limestone blocks. A circular altar rests at the base of the pyramid and a small structure occupies the centre of the courtyard, an unusual feature that is not often found in the Maya lowlands although other examples have been identified at Tikal and Uaxactun. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>has</b> been dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
25|$|The Opatas are {{location}} {{in a number}} of communities in the center and northwest of the state, but have been disappearing as a distinct ethnicity. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>has</b> lost its traditional rituals, and the language died out in the 1950s. The name means “hostile people” and was given to them by the Pimas, as the Opatas were generally in conflict with their neighbors. They were especially hostile to the Tohono O’odham, who they depreciatingly refer to as the Papawi O’otham, or “bean people.” Today’s Opatas have completely adopted the Catholic religion with Isidore the Laboror as the ethnicity’s patron saint.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Buteo group" [...] {{includes}} genera Buteo, Parabuteo, Geranoetus, {{and most}} of Leucopternis. Members of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>have</b> also been called [...] "hawk-buzzards".|$|R

25|$|Around 1870 many European {{immigrants}} from Norway settled in North Dakota's northeastern corner, especially near the Red River. Icelanders also arrived from Canada. Pembina was {{a town of}} many Norwegians when it was founded; they worked on family farms. They started Lutheran churches and schools, greatly outnumbering other denominations in the area. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>has</b> unique foods such as lefse and lutefisk. The continent's largest Scandinavian event, Norsk Høstfest, is celebrated each September in Minot. The Icelandic State Park in Pembina County and an annual Icelandic festival reflect {{immigrants from}} that country, who are also descended from Scandinavians.|$|E
25|$|The Malmesbury Group {{has been}} dated from between 830 and 980Mya, and was {{deformed}} during the Saldanian orogenic cycle, {{both before and}} during the granite intrusions of 630 to 500Mya, and there are minor intrusions which precede the granite. The base of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>has</b> not been exposed. The basal rocks were eroded to a relatively featureless peneplain with exposed granites covering most of the peninsula south of Lion's Head and Devil's Peak. The Sea-Point contact zone, described by Charles Darwin is a well known region of metamorphic rocks formed by the (originally very hot) granite intrusion into the Malmesbury rocks.|$|E
25|$|There is {{significant}} debate among sociologists about {{the interpretation of}} this trend in census data. The increase in those indicating 'no religion' is often cited {{in support of the}} secularisation thesis, although more detailed research of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>has</b> thrown this assumption into question. An alternative theory is that the data indicates a decline in institutional religious affiliation rather than simply a decrease in spiritual belief. A 1985 survey showed that around one-quarter of those answering 'no religion' may believe in a god and that, conversely, between 7 percent and 36 percent of Christians (depending on their denomination) did not believe in the existence of deities.|$|E
2500|$|In {{one notable}} case, as {{introduced}} in the [...] "Drug Criminal Organization" [...] section in the National Police Agency's 1991 Police White Paper, a Fukuoka-based 20-member small Dojin-affiliate had managed a systematic trafficking ring, selling methamphetamines to various drug-dealing yakuza organizations throughout the country. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>had</b> also smuggled methamphetamines from Taiwan where it had a connection with a local Taiwanese drug ring. <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>had</b> used a small island located in Kagoshima Prefecture as a smuggling base, and for example in 1986, <b>this</b> <b>group</b> smuggled approximately [...] of methamphetamines—estimated retail price of nearly US$1 billion—from Taiwan.|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} {{numbers for}} <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>have</b> fluctuated {{in the last}} decades between approximately 11,000 (Wise and Ribeiro, 1978) {{to as many as}} 25,000 individuals (Hern 1994).|$|R
