5|$|A pair of aces {{gives the}} {{blackjack}} player a starting hand value of either a 2 or a soft 12 {{which is a}} problematic starting hand in either case. Splitting aces gives a player two chances to hit 21. Splitting aces is so favorable to the player that most gambling establishments have rules limiting the player's rights to do so. In most casinos the player is only allowed to draw one card on each split ace. As a general rule, a ten on a split ace (or vice versa) is not considered a natural blackjack and does not get any bonus. Prohibiting resplitting and redoubling is also common. Regardless of the payout for blackjack, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> resplitting, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> doubling, <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> multiple card draws and the dealer's cards, one should always split aces.|$|E

5|$|Lanny McDonald was {{the first}} winner of the King Clancy Memorial Trophy in 1987–88, earning the award in {{recognition}} of his charity work in both Toronto and Calgary. Sergei Makarov was a controversial winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy in 1989–90. He won the {{rookie of the year}} award at the age of 31 after spending 13 seasons in the Soviet League. As a result, the NHL changed <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> the award, restricting it to players aged 26 or younger.|$|E

The British Army, which organises Ten Tors, initially stated that the 2007 event would proceed as planned.

5|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the CGS systems and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them. The CGPM, which was established by the Metre Convention of 1875, brought together many international organisations to not only agree on the definitions and standards of the new system but also agree on <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> writing and presenting measurements in a standardised manner around the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{strategy}} guide {{also received}} criticism; it urged buyers to log onto an online site {{to gain the}} information, instead of providing it within the actual guide.

5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E
5|$|Modern-day Olympic equestrian {{events are}} rooted in cavalry skills and {{classical}} horsemanship, and through 1948, competition was restricted to active-duty officers on military horses. Only after 1952, as mechanization of warfare {{reduced the number of}} military riders, were civilian riders allowed to compete. Equestrian is the only Olympic sport in which animals compete with humans, and is one of four sports in which the genders compete against each other, the others being some sailing divisions, mixed doubles division in tennis and the mixed doubles division of badminton. <b>The</b> <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> Olympic equestrian competition are set by the Fédération Équestre Internationale, the international governing body for equestrian sports.|$|E

5|$|On March 30, 1993, it was {{announced}} that Gil Stein, who at the time was the president of the National Hockey League, had been inducted into the Hall of Fame. There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the hall's board of directors and by telling them to change <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> selection. Two lawyers, hired by the league to lead an investigation, recommended that Stein's selection be overturned, although it was soon revealed that Stein had previously decided to turn down the induction.|$|E
5|$|Otto Kuntze and Howard James Banker later {{independently}} {{sought to}} restore Linnaeus' species name, but the resulting combination (Auriscalpium auriscalpium) is a tautonym and disallowed under <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> botanical nomenclature (ICBN 2005 rule 23.4), and these combinations are therefore no longer validly published.

A.vulgare is the type species of the widely distributed genus of eight species that it belongs to.|$|E
5|$|Poohsticks {{was invented}} by English author A. A. Milne for his son Christopher Robin Milne. The sport first came to {{prominence}} when it was described in the author's book The House at Pooh Corner {{as well as in}} the Disney animated featurette Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore. Winnie-the-Pooh, the protagonist of the book, accidentally drops a pine cone into a river from a bridge and, after observing how it appeared on the other side of the bridge, devises <b>the</b> <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> Poohsticks.
