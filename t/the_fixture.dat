5|$|Dundee United's {{traditional}} rivals are Dundee, {{with whom}} they compete in the Dundee derby. <b>The</b> <b>fixture</b> was lacking a competitive element {{for a number of}} years until Dundee's return to the top flight of the Scottish game. A unique element of the rivalry lies in the fact that both clubs' stadiums are located within 100 yards of one another.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} season in {{succession}} the highlights of <b>the</b> <b>fixture</b> list were the games against local rivals The Wednesday, with a record 22,900 supporters attending Bramall Lane to see the Blades record a 5–0 victory {{at the end of}} October. Just under a month later United lost the return fixture at Olive Grove 4–1 in front of a more modest crowd of just under 12,000.|$|E

50|$|Modern public toilets {{often have}} a service entrance, {{utilities}} passage, and the like, that run behind all <b>the</b> <b>fixtures.</b> Sensors are installed in a separate room, behind <b>the</b> <b>fixtures.</b> Usually <b>the</b> separate room is just a narrow corridor or passageway.|$|R
5|$|San Marino play home matches at the San Marino Stadium, a municipally owned {{stadium in}} Serravalle which also hosts the matches of club side San Marino Calcio. It has a {{capacity}} of 7,000. Crowds are low, and on occasion travelling supporters outnumber the Sammarinese support. For example, in <b>the</b> <b>fixture</b> against the Republic of Ireland in February 2007, 2,500 of the 3,294 crowd were Irish supporters.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the two clubs play {{each other}} in the league on Boxing Day every year, with the match usually {{attracting}} the biggest league attendance of the season. However, in 2009 the match was removed from <b>the</b> <b>fixture</b> list by the Irish Football Association due to crowd trouble at Windsor Park. The match returned in 2011, and usually alternates venues between the Oval and Windsor Park each year.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{directly}} involved with Sheffield football, Charles Alcock {{had a major}} role in relations between the local and London associations. He acted as a go between encouraging the FA to accept rules from the Sheffield Rules. When the FA declined an inter-association match in Sheffield {{on the grounds that they}} could not play under Sheffield Rules it fell to Alcock to organise a team of London players to fulfil <b>the</b> <b>fixture.</b> The success of the match led to it becoming a regular event in the following years.|$|E
50|$|A {{meeting was}} held in Barcelona, Spain on 8 January 2008 to {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>fixtures</b> for Group 5. However, the Bosnian delegation arrived several hours late, and Spain and Turkey were unable to agree on scheduling. Since <b>the</b> <b>fixtures</b> were not finalised by 16 January 2008 deadline, FIFA conducted a random draw to determine <b>the</b> <b>fixtures.</b> <b>The</b> draw took place in Zagreb, Croatia at 16:00 CET on 30 January 2008, {{on the eve of}} the XXXII Ordinary UEFA Congress.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{previous}} qualifying tournaments where <b>the</b> <b>fixtures</b> were pre-determined, <b>the</b> <b>fixtures</b> {{were determined}} by draw, which was held {{as part of the}} 2018 FIFA World Cup Preliminary Draw on 25 July 2015, starting 18:00 MSK (UTC+3), at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, Russia.|$|R

5|$|Arsenal and Manchester United first {{played a}} {{competitive}} match in October 1894; as of May 2017, the two clubs have {{faced each other}} 226 times in total. United have won 94 to Arsenal's 82, and 50 matches have ended in a draw. Wayne Rooney has scored the most goals in <b>the</b> <b>fixture</b> with 12, while Ryan Giggs has made {{the highest number of}} appearances with 50. Several players have featured for both clubs at different stages of their career, including Brian Kidd, Andy Cole, David Platt, Robin van Persie, Danny Welbeck and former manager George Graham.|$|E
5|$|As cup winners, Napoli {{qualified}} for the 2014 Supercoppa Italiana {{in which they would}} face Serie A champions Juventus. The match had traditionally taken place in August, but Napoli requested it be moved due to their Champions League play-off that month. <b>The</b> <b>fixture</b> was eventually played on 22 December during the league's winter break, at the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha, Qatar. It finished 11 after 90 minutes, 22 after extra time, and Napoli won 65 in the penalty shootout.|$|E
5|$|Chosen for the Gentlemen v Players, Fender had {{his first}} success in <b>the</b> <b>fixture,</b> hitting 50 in 40 minutes, the highest score for the Gentlemen in the match; it may have {{influenced}} his selection for the MCC team to tour Australia. Some sections of the press suggested Fender should captain that team, but Reginald Spooner was initially appointed by the MCC; when he was unavailable, J.W.H.T.Douglas became captain. Fender {{was included in the}} team, and the press regarded his selection as a formality.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall {{had another}} light workout in the match against Cambridge University, taking match figures of 1/33 from nine overs. His solitary wicket {{was that of}} Doug Insole, {{and he was not}} {{required}} to bat as Australia completed another innings victory. After <b>the</b> <b>fixture</b> against Cambridge, Lindwall was rested for two consecutive matches. In the first, Australia crushed Essex by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the summer. The second match resulted in another innings victory, this time over Oxford University.|$|E
5|$|Luton Town {{supporters}} {{maintain a}} bitter rivalry with Hertfordshire-based Watford. Watford have remained the higher ranked {{team at the}} end of every season since 1997. However, overall Luton still hold the superior record in <b>the</b> <b>fixture</b> between the two clubs; out of 118 competitive matches there have been 53 Luton victories and 36 for Watford, with 29 draws. A survey taken in 2003 showed that there was also animosity between Luton Town fans and those of west London club Queens Park Rangers.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February 2015, in his 100th Champions League appearance, Alonso was sent-off for {{a second}} bookable offense in a 0–0 draw against Shakhtar Donetsk. Alonso was {{suspended}} for the return leg of <b>the</b> <b>fixture,</b> which Bayern won 7–0. Alonso {{would go on to}} record his fourth goal, another free kick, against Porto in the Champions League quarter-final. Bayern would go on to win 6–1, advancing to the semi-finals for a fourth-straight season on aggregate, 7–4.|$|E

5|$|On this tour, Chappell {{clashed with}} cricket administrators over pay and {{conditions}} for the first time. The South African authorities requested that an extra Test be added to <b>the</b> <b>fixture</b> and the Australian Board of Control consented. Incensed that the players were not consulted about the change, Chappell led a group of his teammates in a demand for more money to play the proposed game. Eventually the match was cancelled after Chappell and his supporters refused to back down.|$|E
5|$|The two clubs {{were due}} to meet a month earlier, but the stadium {{disaster}} at Hillsborough, which killed 96 of Liverpool's supporters, meant <b>the</b> <b>fixture</b> was postponed out of respect. It was moved to late May, days after the FA Cup Final which Liverpool won. Arsenal manager George Graham prepared for the match by giving his squad a minibreak and created a calming atmosphere in their training sessions. He adjusted his usual formation to a defensive one to stop Liverpool's attacking threat; David O'Leary was employed as a sweeper in a back five.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the city}} is home {{of two of the}} country's oldest {{professional}} football teams: Aston Villa F.C., which was founded in 1874 and plays at Villa Park; and Birmingham City F.C., which was founded in 1875 and plays at St Andrew's. Rivalry between the clubs is fierce and <b>the</b> <b>fixture</b> between the two is called the Second City derby. Aston Villa are 7-time First Division champions and the 1982 European Champions, but currently play in the Championship following their relegation from the Premier League in the 2015–16 season. Birmingham City also currently play in the Championship.|$|E

5|$|Although Allen {{appeared}} {{four times}} for Middlesex in 1948, {{most of his}} remaining cricket was played for the Free Foresters against Cambridge University. On very good batting pitches, the matches lacked a competitive edge, but in 12 games between 1948 and his retirement, he scored four centuries and averaged over 80 with the bat. In 1948, he scored 180 in <b>the</b> <b>fixture,</b> the highest score of his career; in combination with his success in Middlesex matches, he finished {{on top of the}} English batting averages that season. He played his final Middlesex games in 1950, captaining the team in four matches {{in the absence of the}} regular captain, and made his final first-class appearance for the Free Foresters in 1954. In all first-class cricket, he scored 9,233 runs at an average of 28.67 and took 788 wickets at 22.23.|$|E
5|$|An {{invitation}} {{was sent}} to the Launceston Cricket Club in February with a view to playing that March. The invitation was accepted but the match was delayed when the acceptance letter was not posted in time to reach the steamer transporting mail. The MCC repeated their invitation later in 1850. While the match was being arranged, legislation passed in the United Kingdom to separate the Port Phillip District, which was to be renamed as Victoria, from the colony of New South Wales. When news of this much anticipated decision reached the colony late in 1850, two weeks of celebrations were arranged in Melbourne to mark independence. The delayed cricket match, now scheduled for February 1851, became part of the general festivities, although formal independence did not come about until later in 1851. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>fixture</b> was to be the first Australian intercolonial match and was later considered the first first-class cricket match in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was <b>the</b> <b>fixture</b> against Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six players currently in England's Test team be allowed {{to play for the}} hosts. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, so Hamence was left out. Australia led by 312 on the first innings and were well in control, but the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Hamence batted once in each match, scoring six and 15 as Australia ended the tour with two innings victories.|$|E
