25|$|Sir Roger’s sister-in-law, Mrs. Ackroyd, her daughter, Flora, his secretary, Geoffrey Raymond and Major Blunt, a guest, are {{relaxing}} in the hall. Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora live there {{due to their}} financial circumstances. They are utterly reliant on Sir Roger who tightly controls their money and consequently they are in some debt. They discuss {{a report in the}} newspaper of the suicide of a local woman, Mrs. Ashley Ferrars, during the previous night. She had a close relationship with Sir Roger and her death has greatly affected him. They further discuss the impending announcement of the engagement between Flora and Sir Roger’s stepson, Ralph Paton and the difference that this marriage will make. A young woman who is a neighbour, Caryl Sheppard, arrives to play bridge and Flora teases her over her fascination for a recent arrival in the village – a foreigner who Caryl thinks is called M. Porrott, but Flora reveals that her uncle has told her that he in fact is M. Hercule Poirot, the famous French detective. Poirot arrives and meets everyone. He is especially taken with Caryl. During the conversation, Caryl tells Flora that she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Ralph Paton in the village that morning but Flora is surprised – as far as she knew Ralph has been in London for the previous six months ever since he had an argument with his uncle. As Caryl's brother, Dr. James Sheppard, is dining at Fernley that evening, she will be alone and she invites Poirot to dine with her. They leave together. As the others go off to change for dinner, a maid, Ursula Bourne, tidies the room and meets Ralph when he comes in from the terrace. It is obvious that the two have a secret relationship but their conversation is interrupted as Bourne sees Dr. Sheppard approaching the house. Ralph quickly hides in the adjoining library and Dr. Sheppard enters to be greeted by Parker, the butler. Dr. Sheppard may have to rush out to a confinement case later and consequently he has his doctor's bag with him which Parker looks after. Sheppard is left to his own devices for a moment and Ralph comes out of hiding and tells the doctor, an old friend, that he is in a mess with his stepfather and that he is staying at a local inn, the White Horse. Ralph leaves the house and soon Sir Roger himself comes down into the hall. He too unburdens himself on Sheppard: Mrs. Ferrars was going to be his fiancée after the year’s mourning for the late Mr. Ferrars came to an end but, when the requisite time was up, she hesitated for three more months and then confessed that she poisoned her brutal husband. She was driven to suicide by an unknown blackmailer who knew of her actions and has been draining her of funds all this time. Sir Roger is certain that she would have left him a letter detailing who her persecutor was. At that moment, Parker comes in with a letter for Sir Roger – it is from the late Mrs. Ferrars but he has no time to open it as the others come down for dinner.|$|E
500|$|After Mrs Lycett Green had {{finished}} her testimony {{on the fifth}} day, her place was taken by Mrs Wilson. On examination by Russell, Mrs Wilson stated that she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Gordon-Cumming cheat twice by adding additional counters to his stake. When Clarke cross-examined her, he asked if anyone had placed a stake of £15. Mrs Wilson stated that only her husband had placed such an amount, but Wilson had not played on either night as he disliked both the game and high-stakes gambling. Havers, Grayson and Shankland consider it [...] "rather shocking really, considering that she had sworn to tell the truth,... to find her coming out with this... lie spoken, apparently, with the complete self-assurance that {{the other members of}} her family had shown".|$|E
60|$|And a {{great way}} up the {{hillside}} she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> some white things spread upon the grass.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm hopeless {{without your}} help!" [...] he exclaimed passionately, but withdrew {{his hand and}} turned his back. When he faced her, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{him for the first}} time without disguise.|$|R
60|$|As {{the girl}} turned to bid them good night, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> a shadowy form {{moving in the}} {{darkness}} beyond them, and almost simultaneously she was sure that she heard the sounds of stealthy movement in the same direction.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad of that," [...] said Anty, {{who felt}} {{that she had to}} collect her <b>thoughts</b> before <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> him; and then, after a moment, she added, [...] "Can't I take my {{medicine}} now, doctor?" ...|$|R
60|$|While {{they were}} thus engaged, Gudrid {{happened}} to cast her eyes over {{the stern of}} the ship, and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> an object moving in the water.|$|E
60|$|The {{sergeant}} remarked her frankness, but <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> some frankness was indicated, {{because for}} him {{to find out where}} the party had got off was not hard.|$|E
60|$|This commotion {{every now}} and then, and the almost continual reports from the guns on board, and Corny's screams when she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> an alligator, made the scene quite lively.|$|E
60|$|He never <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> in {{him what}} {{no one else could}} see. He never thought that in the whole world there were no other eyes that looked upon him with the same light and {{strength}} as hers.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do love him," [...] said Linda. Using {{the moment}} for {{reflection}} allowed to her as best <b>she</b> could, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the best means of escape in this avowal. Surely her aunt would not press her to marry one man when she had declared that she loved another.|$|R
60|$|She feigned to be dandling {{the child}} as the servant retired on this errand, but <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Mr Dombey's colour changed; that the {{expression}} of his face quite altered; that he turned, hurriedly, as if to gainsay what he had said, or she had said, or both, and was only deterred by very shame.|$|R
6000|$|And {{when the}} Vicar join'd their hands, [...] 240 [...] Her limbs did creep and freeze: [...] But when they prayed, she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> [...] Her mother on her knees.|$|E
6000|$|Alice <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{a way out}} of the {{difficulty}} this time. 'If you'll tell me what language [...] "fiddle-de-dee" [...] is, I'll tell you the French for it!' she exclaimed triumphantly.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she had to}} ride between {{walls and}} villas, and lost sight of all till she emerged on the parade, and <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Uncle Clement's hat above the crowd as she looked over their heads.|$|E
60|$|It {{was empty}} when Mrs. Benson came {{in some time}} later to say good-night to her son {{on her way to}} bed. She walked slowly round the table, and pausing at the window gazed from it in idle <b>thought,</b> until <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the figure of her son {{advancing}} with rapid strides toward the house. He looked up at the window.|$|R
60|$|When {{he broke}} away from all this unworthy life to devote himself to a manly {{enterprise}} for the redemption of Greece, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{the beginning of an}} answer to her prayers. Even although one of his latest acts concerning her was to repeat to Lady Blessington the false accusation which made Lady Byron the author of all his errors, she still had hopes from the one step taken in the right direction.|$|R
60|$|When she had gone, Elissa {{stood for}} a while thinking; and, as <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> Metem <b>saw</b> a look of fear gather on her face.|$|R
60|$|Madeline <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Stewart give {{a slight}} start. But an unaccountable dimness came over her eyes, at brief {{intervals}} obscuring her keen sight. Vaguely she {{was conscious of}} a clogged and beating tumult in her breast.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{she shook}} off the spell, and looked round and clown, terrified, self-conscious. Her eye caught Stangrave's; she saw, or <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw,</b> by the {{expression}} of his face, that he knew all, and burst away with a shriek.|$|E
60|$|And {{then they}} all went to breakfast with many signs of outward joy. And not without some inward joy; for Madame Bauche <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> that her son was cured of his love. In the mean time Marie sat up stairs still afraid to show herself.|$|E
60|$|It was a mild {{day for the}} season, and Millicent, {{who found}} friends, {{dismissed}} the subject from her <b>thoughts,</b> when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> her husband exchange no word with his latest guests. She was sitting with a young married lady, where the sun shone pleasantly in {{the shelter of the}} great white deck-house, when a sound of voices came out, with the odor of cigar smoke, from an open window.|$|R
6000|$|Fanny spoke fast, {{and laughed}} uncomfortably, {{as she went}} back to the sofa, {{wondering}} if Polly had told her a lie. Polly seemed to guess at her <b>thoughts</b> as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the card, and turning toward her, she held it up, saying, with a conscious look in her eyes, [...] "You thought Mr. Sydney sent them? Well, you are mistaken, and the next time you want to know anything, please ask straight out. I like it better than talking at cross purposes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gradually {{her eyes}} became riveted {{on the glass}} before her, for in it <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the door move. Next second, she was {{sure that it was}} moving, very slowly; the hinges took an age to turn. What could be behind it? At last it was open, and in the glass Angela saw framed in {{darkness}} the head and shoulders of George Caresfoot. At first she believed that her mind deceived her, that it was an apparition. No, there was no mistake. But the respirator, the hollow cough and decrepitude of the morning--where were they? ...|$|R
60|$|Peter Conant stared awhile {{and then}} resumed his breakfast without comment. Mary Louise <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> a smile flicker over his stolid {{features}} for a moment, {{but could not}} be positive. Aunt Hannah had spoken in a practical, matter-of-fact way that did not admit of argument.|$|E
6000|$|Under {{all this}} bitterness--the first {{exhibition}} of Francine's temper, at its worst, which {{had taken place}} since she joined the school--Emily saw, or <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw,</b> distress that was too proud, or too shy, to show itself. [...] "How can you ask the question?" [...] she answered cordially.|$|E
60|$|Peering ahead, Alvina <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{the hollow}} between the peaks, {{which was the}} top of the pass. And every time the omnibus took a new turn, she thought it was coming out on the top of this hollow between the heights. But no--the road coiled right away again.|$|E
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 Oh shit. That {{was her only}} <b>thought</b> when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> him pull that little velour covered box {{out of his pocket}} and get down on one knee in front of her. They had been in Italy for {{thirteen}} days, traveling from city to city, touring the country, and staying at the finest hotels. This, he said, was his gift to her 2 ̆ 7 just because. 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆...|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{less than}} the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of people passing beyond {{the bars of the}} court-yard gate, and the {{reviving}} influence {{of the rest of the}} bread and meat and beer, would have brought me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself as soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to let me out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I <b>thought,</b> if <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, don't--don't say that, mamma!" [...] said Lionel, {{extremely}} {{distressed by}} her weeping, {{and not knowing}} where to rest her, as she hung with her whole weight abandoned on him. Marian and Clara were obliged to help him, and seat her in her chair again; while she still wept piteously, and poor Lionel stood, hearing the sobs, and very much grieved. [...] "Ought I not to have told her?" [...] said he to Marian. [...] "I <b>thought</b> if <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> I could bear it, {{it would be better}} than writing." ...|$|R
6000|$|He arose, tottering, {{but with}} set face, {{and again he}} placed the bloody hand on the Balancing Rock. Jane Withersteen gazed from him down the passageway. Tull was climbing. Almost, she <b>thought,</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> his dark, {{relentless}} face. Behind him more riders climbed. What did they mean for Fay--for Lassiter--for herself? ...|$|E
60|$|Studying {{the groups}} of {{passengers}} at the rails, she <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> a face she knew. The face got distinct, and when the liner's lofty side towered above the boat, Shillito, looking down, lifted his cap and bowed with ironical politeness. Barbara turned her head and tried for calm while she watched the tug.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy colored. Although he was embarrassed, to know Laura had {{bothered to}} remark his moodiness was flattering; the strange thing was, when {{she crossed the}} veranda he had not <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> him. Jimmy was raw, but not {{altogether}} a fool. He knew Laura did not mean him {{to go with her}} to the lake.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Metak, still clinging desperately to the girl, had backed toward the opposite door. At {{the sight of}} the blood two of the guardsmen, as though suddenly aroused to maniacal frenzy, dropped their sabers to the floor and fell upon each other with nails and teeth, while some sought to reach the prince and some to defend him. In {{a corner of the room}} sat one of the guardsmen laughing uproariously and just as Metak succeeded in reaching the door and taking the girl through, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> another of the men spring upon the corpse of the dead messenger and bury his teeth in its flesh.|$|R
60|$|In {{the mist}} also the Romans came {{near to the}} gate, {{notwithstanding}} the risk, for they were very curious about her, and called to her asking why she was bound there. She replied in the Latin language, which was understood by {{very few of the}} Jews, that it was because she had rescued a Roman from death. Before they could speak again those who questioned her were driven back by a shower of arrows discharged from the wall, but in the distance <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> one of them make report to an officer, who on receipt of it seemed to give some orders.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, Crittle's mother Sylvia {{arrived from}} Australia, but it being {{too late to}} book into a hotel, slept on the sofa in his King's Road store. Waking {{in the morning and}} {{ascending}} the staircase, <b>she</b> briefly <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Jesus in a long white robe with a halo {{at the top of the}} stairs. It was actually Jimi Hendrix in his dressing gown, and his [...] "halo" [...] was his expansive afro haircut backlit by the sun. According to Sylvia, he said [...] "Hello, my name's Jimi. John told me I could sleep here tonight".|$|R
