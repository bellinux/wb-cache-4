5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>they</b> need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of the core team, who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E

Such a supporting group {{of family and friends}} was equally necessary as his personal qualities of genius, to complete a work of the magnitude of Tantrāloka.|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{explores the}} concept of health and {{well-being}} as perceived by teachers and parents of preschool-aged children {{in the specific context}} of a child day care facility. The study also identifies the barriers parents and teachers encounter and <b>the</b> <b>supports</b> <b>they</b> require in promoting {{the health and well-being of}} preschool-aged children. Method: A qualitative phenomenological research design combined with a projective technique of Photovoice was used for data collection. A total of eight participants, four teachers and four parents of preschool-aged children from a child day care facility, participated in the study. Results: Several themes were identified related to barriers that parents and teachers face and <b>the</b> <b>supports</b> <b>they</b> require in promoting the health and well-being of preschool-aged children. Conclusions: This study discusses a potential role for occupational therapy practitioners in collaborating with administrators and teachers and parents of preschool-aged children to develop a program to promote the health and well-being of preschool-aged children...|$|R

25|$|The post {{election}} violence therefore is, in part, {{a consequence}} of the failure of President Kibaki and his first Government to exert political control over the country or to maintain sufficient legitimacy as would have allowed a civilised contest with him at the polls to be possible. Kibaki's regime failed to unite the country, and allowed feelings of marginalisation to fester into what became the post election violence. He and his then Government were complacent in <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>they</b> considered they would receive in any election from the majority Kikuyu community and failed to heed the views of the legitimate leaders of other communities.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the suburbs, Bush's percentage of votes in rural counties was significantly below <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>they</b> gave Reagan in 1980 and 1984. In Illinois, Bush lost a number of downstate counties that previously went for Reagan. He lost the state of Iowa by a surprisingly wide margin, losing counties all across the state even in traditionally Republican areas. The rural state of West Virginia remained narrowly in the Democratic column. Bush also performed weaker in the northern counties of Missouri, narrowly winning that state. In three typically solid Republican states, Kansas, South Dakota, and Montana, the vote was much closer than usual. The farm states had fared poorly since the recession of the mid-to-late 1970s and early 1980s, and Dukakis was the beneficiary of these agricultural problems. Probably {{as a result of}} this, 1988 is the only election since 1916 when Blaine County, Montana supported a losing Presidential candidate, the only occasion since 1948 when Sargent County, North Dakota did not support the winning candidate, and the last occasion as of 2016 when neighbouring Marshall County, South Dakota did not predict the winner.|$|E
25|$|To be an enlisted woman {{during the}} {{creation}} stages was not easy. Besides {{the fact that}} everyone was learning as they went, they did not receive <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>they</b> needed from the male recruits. Women were initially paid two-thirds of what {{a man at the}} same level made. As the war progressed the military leaders began to see the substantial impact the women could make. In many cases the women had outperformed their male counterparts. This was taken into account and the women received a raise to four-fifths of the wages of a man. A female doctor however, received equal financial compensation to her male counterpart. One commander argued that it would be impossible for female recruits to reach the location of his station, even though it was located only three and a half miles from the city and was serviced by a paved road and a bus route The negative reaction of men towards the female recruits was addressed in propaganda films. Proudly She Marches and Wings on Her Shoulder were made to show the acceptance of female recruits, while showing the men that although they were taking jobs traditionally intended for men, {{they would be able to}} retain their femininity.|$|E
25|$|The Intifada was not {{initiated}} by any single individual or organization. Local leadership came from groups and organizations {{affiliated with the}} PLO that operated within the Occupied Territories; Fatah, the Popular Front, the Democratic Front and the Palestine Communist Party. The PLO's rivals in this activity were the Islamic organizations, Hamas and Islamic Jihad {{as well as local}} leadership in cities such as Beit Sahour and Bethlehem. However, the uprising was predominantly led by community councils led by Hanan Ashrawi, Faisal Husseini and Haidar Abdel-Shafi, that promoted independent networks for education (underground schools as the regular schools were closed by the military in reprisal for the uprising), medical care, and food aid. The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) gained credibility where the Palestinian society complied with the issued communiques. There was a collective commitment to abstain from lethal violence, a notable departure from past practice, which, according to Shalev arose from a calculation that recourse to arms would lead to an Israeli bloodbath and undermine <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>they</b> had in Israeli liberal quarters. The PLO and its chairman Yassir Arafat had also decided on an unarmed strategy, in the expectation that negotiations at that time would lead to an agreement with Israel. Pearlman attributes the non-violent character of the uprising to the movement's internal organization and its capillary outreach to neighborhood committees that ensured that lethal revenge would not be the response {{even in the face of}} Israeli state repression. Hamas and Islamic Jihad cooperated with the leadership at the outset, and throughout the first year of the uprising conducted no armed attacks, except for the stabbing of a soldier in October 1988, and the detonation of two roadside bombs, which had no impact.|$|E

40|$|American Catholic nuns {{have been}} found to age more ‘successfully’ than their lay counterparts, living longer, healthier, and happier lives.   Two of the key factors {{contributing}} to the nuns’ physical and mental wellbeing are <b>the</b> spiritual <b>support</b> <b>they</b> experience from <b>the</b> divine and <b>the</b> social <b>support</b> <b>they</b> provide for and receive from each other in the convent.   I argue that by integrating the divine into their everyday interactions, the nuns engage in phenomenological meaning-making process through which mundane care interactions are rendered sacred. This communicative process, I argue, contributes to the nuns’ overall wellbeing by providing an enriched form of care and support, thereby enhancing their end-of-life experience...|$|R

500|$|Although the Senate {{hoped to}} keep the treaty secret until Washington had decided {{whether or not to}} sign it, it was leaked to a Philadelphia editor who printed it in full on June 30. Within a few days the whole the country knew the terms of the agreement, and, in the words of Samuel Morison, [...] "a howl or rage went up that Jay had betrayed his country." [...] The {{reaction}} to the treaty was the most negative in the South. Southern planters, who owed the pre-Revolution debts to the British and who were now not going to collect for the slaves lost to them, viewed it as a great indignity. As a result, the Federalists lost most of <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>they</b> had among planters. Protests, organized by Republicans, included petitions, incendiary pamphlets, and a series of public meetings held in the larger cities, each of which addressed a memorial to the president.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{animation}} director, Yumi Satou, the anime project originated with his personal wish to animate original manga, which he enjoyed. The project was given approval in early 2011, {{and according to}} the film's producer, Shuko Yokoyama, the anime was originally planned as an original video animation, which would not have been released in theaters. [...] However, the popularity of Natsume's Book of Friends, which was also written by Midorikawa and developed by the same production staff, gave them <b>the</b> <b>support</b> <b>they</b> needed to create an anime film. The film was produced by the studio Brain's Base and directed by Takahiro Omori, starring Japanese voice actors Ayane Sakura as Hotaru and Kōki Uchiyama as Gin. [...] Satou had frequently worked together with Yokoyama on previous projects. [...] Other staff included Akira Takata (character design), Yukihiro Shibuya (art), Hiromi Miyawaki (color design), Hitoshi Tamura (photography), and Kazuhiko Seki (editor). [...] The anime film had a very small staff because it was a very short film and was produced domestically, unlike the TV series, Natsume's Book of Friends, which was primarily outsourced to other countries—a common trend in anime production.|$|E
