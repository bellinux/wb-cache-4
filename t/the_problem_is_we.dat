40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{a new approach to}} fingerprint classification based on both singularities and traced pseudoridge analysis. Since noise exists in most of the fingerprint images including those in the NIST databases which are used by many researchers, it is difficult to get the correct number and position of the singulairities such as core or delta points which are widely used in current structural classification methods. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> may miss the true singular points and/or get false singular points due to the poor quality of fingerprint images. Classification based on exact pair of singulairities will fail in such conditions. With the help of the pseudoridge tracing and analysis of the traced cvrve, our method does not rely on the extraction of the exact number and positions of the true singular points, thus improving the classification accuracy. This method has been tested on the NIST- 4 fingerprint database. For the 4000 images in this database, the classification accuracy is 95. 3 % with 11. 8 % reject rate for 4 -class problem (combining Arch and Tented Arch as one class) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{contribution}} of Choice Advice to making admissions to English secondary schools fairer. The initiative characterises the unfairness of admissions as unequal opportunity for poorer parents to access good schools because they are less able to negotiate the admissions process. A major objective of Choice Advice is to enable more poor parents {{to gain access to}} popular and high performing secondary schools. The results of an evaluation in 15 Local Authorities are presented showing that Choice Advice provided a valuable service to some families but the proportion of poorer families helped was too small to make {{a significant impact on the}} numbers of poorer parents gaining access to popular schools. The characterisation of <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> argue, flawed and, as a consequence, so is the way this policy was designed. Choice Advice is an example of a discursively complex initiative that is ambivalent in its effects. It provides a symbol of political will and is of real benefit to some parents, but it sustains a way of characterising the problem that plays a part in labelling poorer parents as deficient while making no significant impact on the unfairness of admissions...|$|E
40|$|Voters {{feel about}} {{political}} candidates {{at least as}} much as they think about them. And yet we know relatively little yet about how an affective sense about a candidate – global evaluation – interacts with information voters learn about candidates. Motivated reasoning suggests that when an initial evaluation of a candidate is established, that evaluation acts as an anchor against which any new information has to struggle to be accounted for properly. Thus instead of operating as efficient Bayesian updaters, calculating correctly how new information should balance against existing feelings, studies show voters stick to their existing affect, at least for a while. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> do not really know how this process works. In particular at some point a voter who encounters enough negative information about a previously liked candidate – or good stuff about a disliked one – may finally adjust global evaluations to be more in line with “reality”. But at what point? This paper reports the results of a study using dynamic process tracing designed to put subjects into the position of learning bad things about a good candidate and good things about a bad one. The results show evidence of motivated reasoning, but the process is eventually attenuated as incongruent information finally breaks through pre-existing affect...|$|E
40|$|From the {{introductory}} paragraphs: 2 ̆ 2 If we observe {{a herd of}} sheep who want to pass through a gate to a green pasture, we see them pushing so hard that they get stuck at the gate and pass through it only very torturously and with great delay. It is obvious that if they would not push, but pass one or two at a time, the sheep would get through the gate much faster and more easily. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> conclude, that the sheep are animals with a rather low level of intelligence. If a creature from Outer Space observes one of our cities from a Spaceship (2 ̆ 2 flying saucer 2 ̆ 2) on a weekday morning, he will certainly come to conclusions about the behavior of humans in traffic {{very similar to those}} we reached about the sheep. The observer from Space would be surprised that the humans, who build beautiful buildings, excellent vehicles and have tools for sophisticated controls, do not manage their cities and their travel as an intelligent system. Traffic in streets mostly consists of individuals driving vehicles for their own immediate benefit. The control that could make the entire system work much more efficiently virtually does not exist. Operation of the transportation system is not much better than what the sheep would arrange. Analyzing our policies and practices in urban transportation, one can easily discover a number of irrational situations which prevent urban transport from efficient functioning. 2 ̆...|$|E

We delved into the mysteries of video communication over web for a specific project ePomocnik (translates to eHelper). There is a lot of possibility but we singled out a few. First of all we present a few basic technologies used [...] Java, Flash, and some protocols used for video communication. What is more, we built three basic solutions for video communication. Two of them have a common base [...] Red 5 streaming server. First is based on the standard Flash applets for video capture and playback, the second is using Java for video capture. The third solution is depending on VLC player as server and client. Going further from that point, we monitored CPU and network bandwidth usage for every solution and we did a short user survey regarding solution quality. What we concluded was quite interesting, even though nobody puts much faith in Flash anymore, Flash and Red 5 combination is still a very strong option. By the choice of users and test data it is still the best solution followed by VLC. Problem with VLC is that it needs quite a bit of tinkering, while Flash is "ready to go". The recommendation for anyone not really demanding would be to just stick with Flash for now. If your resources permit it, you should use VLC or FFmpeg with x 264 encoder by building your own distribution compiling it from source and customizing it...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{locating}} collection centers of a company that aims to collect used products from product holders. The remaining value in the used products that can be captured by recovery operations is the company’s motivation for the collection operation. We assume that a pick-up strategy is in place according to which vehicles with limited capacity are dispatched from the collection centers to the locations of product holders to transport the returns. Each product holder has an inherent willingness to return, and makes the decision {{on the basis of the}} financial incentive offered by the company. The incentive depends on the condition of the returned item referred to as return type. We formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear facility location-allocation model to find both the optimal locations of a predetermined number of collection centers and the optimal incentive values for different return types. Since <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> propose a heuristic method to solve medium and large-size instances. The main loop of the method is based on a tabu search method performed in the space of collection center locations. For each location set prescribed by tabu search, Nelder–Mead simplex search is called to obtain the best incentives and the corresponding net profit. We experiment with different quality profiles when there are two and three return types, and observe the effect of the uniform incentive policy (UIP) in which the same incentive is offered to product holders regardless of the quality of their returns. We conclude that the UIP is inferior to the quality-dependent incentive policy resulting in a higher profit loss when the proportion of lowest quality returns is relatively high...|$|E
