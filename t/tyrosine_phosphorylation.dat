5|$|In the hippocampus, ApoER2 is {{complexed}} with NMDA receptors {{through the}} PSD-95 adapter protein. When reelin binds ApoER2, it initiates <b>tyrosine</b> <b>phosphorylation</b> of NMDA receptors. This occurs through Dab-1 activation of Src family kinases, which {{have been shown to}} play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity. VLDLR also acts as a receptor coupled to ApoER2 as it does during development, but its role is not well understood. ApoER2 plays a more important role in this process, most likely due to its ability to bind the PSD-95 adapter protein through the 59 amino acid insert on its cytoplasmic tail. Studies with mice have shown that knocking out ApoER2 or just the alternatively spliced exon 19 causes a much greater impairment of LTP than knocking out VLDLR.|$|E

Activation of the EGFR by H. pylori is associated with altered signal transduction and gene expression in host epithelial cells that may contribute to pathogenesis.

40|$|The same {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} (RTK) can mediate strikingly different biological responses in a fibroblast {{as opposed to a}} neuron. We have compared the rapidly induced <b>tyrosine</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> mediated by various RTKs in both NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts and in the PC 12 neuronal precursor cell line and found that each RTK induces a distinct pattern of protein <b>tyrosine</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> in the two cell types. These findings are consistent with a model in which various cell types present a given RTK with different menus of signal transduction components, allowing the same RTK to elicit fundamentally distinct biological responses. Although there are obvious overlaps in the <b>tyrosine</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> induced by different RTKs in the same cell, there are also clear differences. The attempt to dissect these differences revealed that the kinase inhibitors K- 252 a and staurosporine inhibit RTK autophosphorylation and thus the biological consequences of receptor/ligand interaction. These inhibitors displayed substantially greater specificity for a subset of RTKs (including the neurotrophin receptors) than for other RTKs and acted as remarkably selective blockers of neurotrophin action in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells.

Glucopiericidin A inhibited the formation of inositol phosphate (IPt) in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -stimulated NIH 3 T 3 gamma 1 cells with an IC 50 of 5. 0 mu M, In vitro enzyme assay showed the compound had no inhibitory effect on PLC-gamma 1 even at 100 mu M concentration.

40|$|Unlike the {{cross-linking}} of membrane immunoglobulins, {{the activation}} of B cells by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) {{does not involve}} the phosphoinositol turnover and the initial activation of tyrosine kinases. However, LPS-induced B-cell proliferation was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A even when added 48 h after {{the beginning of the}} culture. Tyrosyl-phosphorylated proteins were detected by Western blotting after 24 h of culture with LPS, reaching a maximum concentration after 72 h. Late <b>tyrosine</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> were also detected in B cells activated for 72 h with anti-immunoglobulin M antibody and were abrogated by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and herbimycin A, and the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine. The role of protein kinase C in late tyrosine kinase activation is independent of Ca 2 + mobilization and was confirmed by detection of a comparable but restricted pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates in B cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate alone or in association with ionomycin. Tyrosine kinase activation was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. However, culture supernatants of LPS-activated B cells were devoid of mitogenic activity and induced a phosphorylation pattern more restricted than that achieved by LPS. Altogether these data indicate that proliferation signals induced by LPS or by the cross-linking of membrane immunoglobulins are controlled by late <b>tyrosine</b> <b>phosphorylations</b> occurring throughout the first 3 days of culture, controlled in part by protein kinase C activation, and dependent on the synthesis of an intermediate protein(s) either not secreted in the culture supernatant or present but biologically inactive in naive B cells...|$|R

To define the mechanism of activation, recombinant wild-type 42 -kDa MAP kinase (p 42 mapk) and a kinase-defective mutant of p 42 mapk (K 52 R) were used to assay both activator activity for p 42 mapk and kinase activity toward K 52 R in stimulated EL 4. I 12 mouse thymoma cells. Phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate (10 min, 650 nM) stimulated a single peak of MAP kinase activator that was coeluted from Mono Q at pH 7. 5 and 8. 9 with K 52 R kinase activity. Both activities were inactivated by the serine/threonine-specific phosphatase 2 A but not by the tyrosine-specific phosphatase CD 45. Phosphorylation of K 52 R occurred specifically on Thr- 183 and Tyr- 185, as determined by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping in comparison with synthetic marker phosphopeptides.

The rat bladder {{carcinoma}} {{cell line}} NBT-II exhibits two completely different responses to acidic FGF (aFGF) : at high cell density, aFGF {{is a potent}} mitogen whereas at low cell density, aFGF acts as a scattering agent that can convert the epithelial NBT-II cells into fibroblastic-like, motile cells. The basis of the dual action of aFGF has been approached by using substances interfering with the transducing pathways known to be activated by growth factors.

[...] All IL-6 cytokines whether they homo- or heterodimerise gp130 seem to activate JAK1, JAK2 and to a lesser degree Tyk2. It should be noted however that JAK1, JAK2, and tyk2 are not interchangeable in the gp130 system, this has been demonstrated with the use of JAK1, Jak2 or Tyk2 deficient cell lines obtained from mutant mice.

In contrast, fibroblasts derived from JAK2 null mice can respond to IL-6, with demonstratable <b>tyrosine</b> <b>phosphorylation</b> of gp130, JAK1 and TYK2. Thus it seems JAK1 is the critical JAK required for gp130 signalling. Activation of the same Jaks by all three receptor combinations (gp130/gp130, gp130/LIFR, gp130/OSMR) raises the question of how IL6, LIF and OSM can activate distinct intracellular signaling pathways.
