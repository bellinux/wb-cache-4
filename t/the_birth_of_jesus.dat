5|$|Jack Finegan noted {{some early}} writers' {{reckoning}} of the regnal years of Augustus are the equivalent to 3/2 BC, or 2 BC or later for <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> including Irenaeus (3/2 BC), Clement of Alexandria (3/2 BC), Tertullian (3/2 BC), Julius Africanus (3/2 BC), Hippolytus of Rome (3/2 BC), Hippolytus of Thebes (3/2 BC), Origen (3/2 BC), Eusebius of Caesarea (3/2 BC), Epiphanius of Salamis (3/2 BC), Cassiodorus Senator (3 BC), Paulus Orosius (2 BC), Dionysus Exiguus (1 BC), and Chronographer of the Year 354 (AD 1). Finegan places {{the death of}} Herod in 1 BC, and says if Jesus was born two years or less before Herod the Great died, <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> {{would have been in}} 3 or 2 BC. Finegan also notes the Alogi reckoned Christ's birth with the equivalent of 4 BC or AD 9.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{title is}} taken from the angels' song to the shepherds in Luke 2:14, announcing <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus,</b> and is in {{reference}} to the show's Christmas theme. The words also make up the beginning of the Great Doxology: Gloria in Excelsis Deo (Glory to God in the highest).|$|E
5|$|If {{the story}} of the Star of Bethlehem {{described}} an actual event, it might identify the year Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew describes <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> as taking place when Herod was king. According to Josephus, Herod died after a lunar eclipse and before a Passover Feast. The eclipse is usually identified as the eclipse of March 13, 4 BC. Other scholars suggested dates in 5 BC, because it allows seven months for the events Josephus documented between the lunar eclipse and the Passover than the 29 days allowed by lunar eclipse in 4 BC. Others suggest it was an eclipse in 1 BC. The narrative implies that Jesus was born sometime between the first appearance of the star and the appearance of the Magi at Herod's court. That the king is said to have ordered the execution of boys two years of age and younger implies that the Star of Bethlehem appeared within the preceding two years. Some scholars date <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> as 6–4 BC, while others suggest Jesus' birth was in 3/2 BC.|$|E

5|$|In {{the format}} of the chorale cantata cycle, an unknown {{librettist}} retained some parts of Luther's wording, while he paraphrased other passages for recitatives and arias. He used the original verses 46–48 for the first movement, verse 54 for the fifth movement, and the doxology for the seventh movement. He paraphrased verse 49 for the second movement, verses 50–51 for the third, verses 52–53 for the fourth, and verse 55 for the sixth movement, the latter expanded by a reference to <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Matthew and Luke each {{describe}} Jesus' nativity (or birth), {{especially that}} Jesus was born by a virgin Mary in Bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy. Luke's account emphasizes events before <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> and centers on Mary, while Matthew's mostly covers those {{after the birth}} and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that Jesus was born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, in Bethlehem, and both support {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus, according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb when she was still a virgin.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparition}} of 12BC {{was recorded}} in the Book of Han by Chinese astronomers of the Han Dynasty who tracked it from August through October. It passed within 0.16AU of Earth. Halley's appearance in 12BC, {{only a few years}} distant from the conventionally assigned date of <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ, has led some theologians and astronomers to suggest that it might explain the biblical story of the Star of Bethlehem. There are other explanations for the phenomenon, such as planetary conjunctions, and there are also records of other comets that appeared closer to the date of Jesus' birth.|$|E

5|$|Eclogue 4, {{also known}} as the Fourth Eclogue is the name of a Latin poem by the Roman poet Virgil. Part of his first major work, the Eclogues, the piece was written around 40 BC, during a time of {{temporary}} stability following the Treaty of Brundisium; it was later published in and around the years 39–38 BC. The work describes the birth of a boy, a supposed savior, who once of age will become divine and eventually rule over the world. During late antiquity and the Middle Ages, a desire emerged to view Virgil as a virtuous pagan, and as such, early Christians, such as Roman Emperor Constantine, early Christian theologian Lactantius, and St. Augustineto varying degreesreinterpreted the poem to be about <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ.|$|E
5|$|The {{east and}} south chancel stained glass is {{in memory of the}} wife, son, and {{daughter}} of Hugh Wynne Jones, who died in the mid-19th century. He was the first priest to be vicar of the parish (1868–1888); his predecessors had been curates, a lower position. He is depicted as Simeon, who in Luke's Gospel receives Jesus and his family when they visit the Temple of Jerusalem after <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> (an event celebrated as the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple). The north transept has a three-light window to the north depicting St Edern, by Franz Mayer & Co. There are also windows with two lights on the east and west sides of the transept, one of which has a window from 1951 by Celtic Studios.|$|E
5|$|The main {{components}} of the design are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, of which five smaller ones are each framed and supported by four naked youths or Ignudi. At either end, and beneath the scenes are the figures of twelve {{men and women who}} prophesied <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> On the crescent-shaped areas, or lunettes, above each of the chapel's windows are tablets listing the Ancestors of Christ and accompanying figures. Above them, in the triangular spandrels, a further eight groups of figures are shown, but these have not been identified with specific Biblical characters. The scheme is completed by four large corner pendentives, each illustrating a dramatic Biblical story.|$|E
25|$|The early Christian {{document}} The Ascension of Isaiah, {{which may}} {{date to the}} 2nd century, also has a narrative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virgin <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b> However, <b>the</b> date and origin of this document are questionable, given that the author disguised his identity behind Isaiah. The narrative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virgin <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> can be found also in other New Testament apocrypha, for instance the Protevangelium of James, perhaps written in the 2nd century.|$|R

5|$|While the proem and {{invocation}} of Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi {{are composed of}} several original lines of Latin in addition to lines borrowed from or alluding to the Roman poet Virgil, the Silver Age poet Lucan, and the fourth-century poet Juvencus, {{the rest of the}} work is entirely a Virgilian cento, which is a patchwork poem of verses extracted from the works of Virgil. Proba's choice to rework Virgil seems to have been made for two reasons: First, Virgil was an influential poet who was commissioned by Caesar Augustus, the first Roman emperor, to write the epic Aeneid. The poet's influence was felt well into late antiquity, and he was imitated by Juvencus and Prudentius. The respect given to Virgil eventually manifested in centos, which reached their peak in the fourth century AD. Second, Virgil was often appropriated by Christian authors due to a popular interpretation of his fourth Eclogue, which many believed to be a prophecy of <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus.</b>|$|E

In Luke 1:26 the Archangel Gabriel visits the Virgin Mary in the Annunciation to foretell <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ.
