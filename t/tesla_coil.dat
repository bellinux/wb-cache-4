25|$|In a dual {{resonant}} solid-state <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> (DRSSTC), {{the electronic}} switching of the solid-state <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> {{is combined with}} the resonant primary circuit of a spark-gap <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil.</b> The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series tank circuit with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional resonant circuit, one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the duty cycle of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil,</b> and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a spark-gap <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> operating at the same input power.|$|E
25|$|While {{generating}} discharges, {{electrical energy}} from the secondary and toroid is transferred to the surrounding air as electrical charge, heat, light, and sound. The process is similar to charging or discharging a capacitor, except that a <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> uses AC instead of DC. The current that arises from shifting charges within a capacitor is called a displacement current. <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> discharges are formed {{as a result of}} displacement currents as pulses of electrical charge are rapidly transferred between the high-voltage toroid and nearby regions within the air (called space charge regions). Although the space charge regions around the toroid are invisible, they play a profound role in the appearance and location of <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> discharges.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{they are}} simple {{enough for an}} amateur to make, <b>Tesla</b> <b>coils</b> are a popular student science fair project, and are {{homemade}} by hobbyists.

25|$|In {{addition}} to its use in spark-gap radio transmitters and electrotherapy described above, the <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> circuit was also used in the early 20th century in x-ray machines, ozone generators for water purification, and induction heating equipment. However, in the 1920s vacuum tube oscillators replaced it in all these applications. The triode vacuum tube was a much better radio frequency current generator than the noisy, hot, ozone-producing spark, and could produce continuous waves. After this, industrial use of the <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> was mainly limited to a few specialized applications which were suited to its unique characteristics, such as high voltage insulation testing.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary power {{transformers}} have an {{iron core}} {{to increase the}} magnetic coupling between the coils. However at high frequencies an iron core causes energy losses due to eddy currents and hysteresis, {{so it is not}} used in the <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|E

25|$|The <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> is an {{electrical}} resonant transformer circuit designed by inventor Nikola Tesla in 1891. It {{is used to}} produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla experimented {{with a number of}} different configurations consisting of two, or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.|$|E
25|$|An {{erroneous}} {{explanation for}} the absence of electric shock that has persisted among <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> hobbyists is that the high frequency currents travel through the body close to the surface, and thus do not penetrate to vital organs or nerves, due to an electromagnetic phenomenon called skin effect.|$|E

25|$|A <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> is a radio {{frequency}} oscillator that drives an air-core double-tuned resonant transformer to produce high voltages at low currents. Tesla's original circuits {{as well as}} most modern coils use a simple spark gap to excite oscillations in the tuned transformer. More sophisticated designs use transistor or thyristor switches or vacuum tube electronic oscillators to drive the resonant transformer.|$|E
25|$|A large <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> of {{more modern}} design often {{operates}} {{at very high}} peak power levels, up to many megawatts (millions of watts). It is therefore adjusted and operated carefully, not only for efficiency and economy, but also for safety. If, due to improper tuning, the maximum voltage point occurs below the terminal, along the secondary coil, a discharge (spark) may break out and damage or destroy the coil wire, supports, or nearby objects.|$|E
25|$|Single {{resonant}} {{solid state}} <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> (SRSSTC) - In this circuit the primary {{does not have}} a capacitor and so is not a tuned circuit; only the secondary is. The pulses of current to the primary from the switching transistors excite resonance in the secondary tuned circuit. Single tuned SSTCs are simpler, but don't have as high a Q and cannot produce as high voltage from a given input power as the DRSSTC.|$|E

David stood between them on a pedestal, wearing a Faraday suit, without food or sleep. At the conclusion of the event, David claimed that this will be the last endurance stunt that he is to perform.|$|R
25|$|Tesla {{used these}} {{circuits}} to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, phosphorescence, X-ray generation, high frequency alternating current phenomena, electrotherapy, and {{the transmission of}} electrical energy without wires. <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> circuits were used commercially in sparkgap radio transmitters for wireless telegraphy until the 1920s, and in medical equipment such as electrotherapy and violet ray devices. Today their main use is for entertainment and educational displays, although small coils are still used today as leak detectors for high vacuum systems.|$|E
25|$|The primary break rate of {{sparking}} Tesla coils is slow {{compared to}} the resonant frequency of the resonator-topload assembly. When the switch closes, energy is transferred from the primary LC circuit to the resonator where the voltage rings up over {{a short period of}} time up culminating in the electrical discharge. In a spark gap <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil,</b> the primary-to-secondary energy transfer process happens repetitively at typical pulsing rates of 50–500 times per second, depending on the frequency of the input line voltage. At these rates, previously-formed leader channels do not get a chance to fully cool down between pulses. So, on successive pulses, newer discharges can build upon the hot pathways left by their predecessors. This causes incremental growth of the leader from one pulse to the next, lengthening the entire discharge on each successive pulse. Repetitive pulsing causes the discharges to grow until the average energy available from the <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> during each pulse balances the average energy being lost in the discharges (mostly as heat). At this point, dynamic equilibrium is reached, and the discharges have reached their maximum length for the Tesla coil's output power level. The unique combination of a rising high-voltage radio frequency envelope and repetitive pulsing seem to be ideally suited to creating long, branching discharges that are considerably longer than would be otherwise expected by output voltage considerations alone. High-voltage, low-energy discharges create filamentary multibranched discharges which are purplish-blue in colour. High-voltage, high-energy discharges create thicker discharges with fewer branches, are pale and luminous, almost white, and are much longer than low-energy discharges, because of increased ionisation. A strong smell of ozone and nitrogen oxides will occur in the area. The important factors for maximum discharge length appear to be voltage, energy, and still air of low to moderate humidity. There are comparatively few scientific studies about the initiation and growth of pulsed lower-frequency RF discharges, so some aspects of <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> air discharges are not as well understood when compared to DC, power-frequency AC, HV impulse, and lightning discharges.|$|E
25|$|Tesla {{experimented with}} these, and many other, circuit {{configurations}} (see right). The <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> primary winding, spark gap and tank capacitor are connected in series. In each circuit, the AC supply transformer charges the tank capacitor until its voltage {{is sufficient to}} break down the spark gap. The gap suddenly fires, allowing the charged tank capacitor to discharge into the primary winding. Once the gap fires, the electrical behavior of either circuit is identical. Experiments have shown that neither circuit offers any marked performance advantage over the other.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{applications}} of the <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> circuit was in early radio transmitters called spark gap transmitters. The first radio wave generators, invented by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, were spark gaps connected directly to antennas, powered by induction coils. Because they lacked a resonant circuit, these transmitters produced highly damped radio waves. As a result, their transmissions occupied an extremely wide bandwidth of frequencies. When multiple transmitters were operating {{in the same area}} their frequencies overlapped and they interfered with one another, causing garbled reception. There was no way for a receiver to select one signal over another.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, {{pioneering}} accelerator physicists Merle Tuve and Gregory Breit built a 5 million volt <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> as {{a linear}} particle accelerator. The bipolar coil {{consisted of a}} pyrex tube a meter long wound with 8000 turns of fine wire, with round corona caps on each end, and a 5 turn spiral primary coil surrounding it at the center. It was operated in a tank of insulating oil pressurized to 500 psi which allowed it to reach a potential of 5.2 megavolts. Although it was used {{for a short period}} in 1929-30 it was not a success because the particles' acceleration had to be completed within the brief period of a half cycle of the RF voltage.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps can be {{illuminated}} by means {{other than a}} proper electrical connection. These other methods, however, result in very dim or very short-lived illumination, and so are seen mostly in science demonstrations. Static electricity or a Van de Graaff generator will cause a lamp to flash momentarily as it discharges a high voltage capacitance. A <b>Tesla</b> <b>coil</b> will pass high-frequency current through the tube, and since it has a high voltage as well, the gases within the tube will ionize and emit light. Capacitive coupling with high-voltage power lines can light a lamp continuously at low intensity, depending on {{the intensity of the}} electrostatic field, as shown in the image on the right.|$|E
