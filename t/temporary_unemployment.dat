40|$|This paper uses a large panel {{assembled}} from Spanish {{administrative data}} for {{over one million}} individuals assembled from tax, welfare and employment records over a period spanning 30 years to estimate a dy-namic model of individual optimization that explains transitions and spell lengths between permanent positions, <b>temporary</b> positions, <b>unemployment</b> and exits from the workforce. We seek to explain the sequence of job spells in <b>temporary</b> contracts and <b>unemployment</b> transitions as new en-trants in the workforce gradually acquire experience and, ultimately, tran-sition into permanent contracts. The career mobility of young workers is jointly determined with geographical and occupational mobility. Thus we investigate how different types of labor market experience and wel-fare entitlements affect job search behavior, employment duration, and migration patterns over the life cycle. I...|$|R

40|$|The US {{unemployment}} insurance system is financed by an experience-rated payroll tax. The system imposes a layoff or firing cost on employers, {{leading them to}} fire fewer workers in a downturn and hire fewer workers in an upturn.

30|$|Third, {{temporary}} contracts {{played a}} prominent role for labour market dynamics during the Great Recession {{in a number of}} European countries. In particular, transitions from <b>temporary</b> employment to <b>unemployment</b> increased more strongly during the crisis than transitions from permanent employment to unemployment. This finding holds true especially for men and high-skilled workers, suggesting that temporary contracts drive the gender- and skill-related heterogeneities that we detect. Furthermore, the overall outflow rate from temporary employment remained relatively constant during the crisis. This can be explained by offsetting effects: the transition rate from <b>temporary</b> employment to <b>unemployment</b> increases significantly, while the transition rate from temporary employment to permanent employment declines significantly.|$|R

The insurance typically include monetary provisions for retirement pensions and survivor benefits, permanent and <b>temporary</b> disabilities, <b>unemployment</b> and parental leave. Unlike private insurance, governmental schemes are based on public statutes and not contracts, so that contributions and benefits may change in time and are based on solidarity among participants. Its funding is done on an ongoing basis, without direct relationship with future liabilities.|$|R

50|$|If {{there is}} no {{hysteresis}} in unemployment, then for example if the central bank wishes to lower the inflation rate it may shift to a contractionary monetary policy, which if not fully anticipated and believed will temporarily increase the unemployment rate; if the contractionary policy persists, the unemployment rise will eventually disappear as the unemployment rate returns to the natural rate. Then {{the cost of the}} anti-inflation policy will have been <b>temporary</b> <b>unemployment.</b> But if there is hysteresis, the unemployment rise initiated by the contractionary policy will never completely go away, and in this case the cost of the anti-inflation policy will have been permanently higher unemployment, making the policy less likely to have greater benefits than costs.|$|E

50|$|Neoclassical {{macroeconomic}} reasoning {{concludes that}} because of Walras's law, if all markets for goods are in equilibrium, the market for labor must also be in equilibrium. Thus, by neoclassical reasoning, Walras's law contradicts the Keynesian conclusion that negative excess demand and consequently, involuntary unemployment, may exist in the labor market, even when all markets for goods are in equilibrium. The Keynesian rebuttal is that this neoclassical perspective ignores financial markets, which may experience excess demand (such as a Keynesian liquidity trap) that permits an excess supply of labor and consequently, <b>temporary</b> involuntary <b>unemployment,</b> even if markets for goods are in equilibrium.|$|R

On {{the other end of}} the scale are high frequency events with non-severe income effects like transient illness, crop loss, and <b>temporary</b> <b>unemployment.</b> Protection against these non-catastrophic events need not require long-term net transfers to the afflicted household.
