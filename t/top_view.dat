5|$|The {{lower jaw}} is rather robust. It is also {{straight}} in <b>top</b> <b>view,</b> without much expansion at the jaw tip, suggesting the lower jaws as a pair, the mandibula, were narrow. Several traits in 2008 identified as autapomorphies, later transpired {{to have been}} the result of damage. However, a unique combination of traits is present in the wide longitudinal groove on the outer side (shared with Torvosaurus), the small third dentary tooth and a vascular channel, below the row of interdental plates, that only is closed from the fifth tooth position onwards. The number of dentary teeth was probably thirteen or fourteen, though the preserved damaged specimens show at most eleven tooth sockets. The interdental plates have smooth inner sides, whereas those of the maxilla are vertically grooved; the same combination is shown by Piatnitzkysaurus. The surangular has no bony shelf, or even ridge, on its outer side. There is laterally an oval opening present in front of the jaw joint, a foramen surangulare posterior, but a second foramen surangulare anterior to the front of it is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the rear}} {{part of the}} skull is preserved. It likely showed a horselike, broad snout {{equipped}} with pencil-like teeth, as seen in related sauropods for which more complete skulls are known. As in other dicraeosaurids, the external naris (nostril opening) was situated in the posterior half of the skull, diagonally above the eye socket, which was proportionally large. As in most other dinosaurs, the skull featured three additional openings (fenestrae). The infratemporal fenestra, located below the eye socket, was long and narrow. Behind the eye socket was the supratemporal fenestra, which in dicraeosaurids was uniquely small and can be seen when the skull is viewed from the side. This contrasts with other diapsid reptiles, where these openings were directed upwards, thus being visible only in <b>top</b> <b>view.</b> The antorbital fenestra would have been located {{in front of the}} eye socket, although this region is not preserved. An unusual feature were small openings seen on the backside of the skull, the so-called parietal openings or fontanelles. In other tetrapods, these openings are usually seen only in juveniles and would close as the individual grows. Skull features shared with Dicraeosaurus but absent in other sauropods included the fused frontal bones and the notably long basipterygoid processes, bony extensions connecting the braincase with the palate.|$|E
5|$|The head of Scelidosaurus was small, {{about twenty}} {{centimetres}} long, and elongated. The skull was low {{in side view}} and triangular in <b>top</b> <b>view,</b> longer than it was wide, {{similar to that of}} earlier ornithischians. The snout, largely formed by the nasal bones, was flat on top. Scelidosaurus still had the five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings) seen in basal ornithischians: apart from the nostrils and eye sockets which are present in all basal dinosaurs, the fenestra antorbitalis and the upper and lower temporal fenestrae were not closed or overgrown, as with many later armoured forms. In fact, the upper temporal fenestrae were very large, forming conspicuous round openings {{in the top of the}} rear skull, serving as attachment areas for the powerful muscles that closed the lower jaws. The eye socket was slightly overshadowed in its front part by the prefrontal bone. Behind it, the upper rim of the eye socket was formed by the supraorbital bone. A study by Susannah Maidment e.a. concluded that juvenile specimens show that this bone was a fusion of three elements, one in front, the next in rear, and the third at the inner side.|$|E

25|$|The {{sequence}} of ceratopsian {{evolution in the}} Cretaceous is roughly from Psittacosaurus (121 -99Ma) to Protoceratops (83Ma) to (Triceratops 67Ma and Styracosaurus 72Ma). In side view the skull of Psittacosaurus bears very little resemblance to that of Styracosaurus but in <b>top</b> <b>view</b> a similar pentagonal arrangement can be seen.|$|E
25|$|The {{skull of}} E. annectens {{is known for}} its long, wide muzzle. Cope {{compared}} this feature to that of a goose in side view, and to a short-billed spoonbill in <b>top</b> <b>view.</b> The skull was longer and lower proportionally than in any other known hadrosaurid. The toothless portion of the anterior mandible was relatively longer than in any hadrosaur. The extreme length and breadth did not appear until an individual reached maturity, so many specimens lack the distinctive shape. The bones surrounding the large openings for the nostrils formed deep pockets around the openings. The eye sockets were rectangular and longer front to back than top to bottom, although this may have been exaggerated by postmortem crushing. The skull roof was flat and lacked a bony crest, and the quadrate bone that formed the articulation with the lower jaw was distinctly curved. The lower jaw was long and straight, lacking the downward curve seen in other hadrosaurids, and possessing a heavy ridge running its length. The predentary was wide and shovel-like. The ridge on the lower jaw may have reinforced the long, slender structure.|$|E

500|$|Adult skulls also possess large, rugose, and oval bosses on the supraorbital region {{above the}} eyes, {{instead of the}} horns of other ceratopsids. The supraorbital bosses {{extended}} from the postorbital bone forward to incorporate the triangular palpebral and prefrontal bones, and had high transverse ridges around the middle, which were thick at their base and thin towards their top. The palpebral bones strongly stood out, forming an [...] "antorbital buttress". The fused prefrontals did not reach the nasal boss, forming a distinctive transverse sadle-shaped groove separating the nasal boss from the supraorbital bosses. This groove extended backwards, separating the supraorbital bosses {{from each other and}} forming a T-shape in <b>top</b> <b>view.</b> These bosses were similar to those of Pachyrhinosaurus, but with taller ridges and more pronounced rugosities. The long and low supraorbital horncores of the sub-adult specimen MOR 591 were similar to those of sub-adult Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. They had a concave surface on the inner side as with Pachyrhinosaurus; ridges on the postorbital bones were present that may indicate a beginning transition to bosses.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Victoria Arbour and Phil Currie {{provided}} a differential diagnosis, setting Euoplocephalus {{apart from its}} nearest relatives. [...] When compared with Anodontosaurus and Scolosaurus, Euoplocephalus lacks round osteoderms {{at the base of}} the squamosal and quadratojugal horns. Compared with Anodontosaurus it lacks small osteoderms at the bases of the large osteoderms on the first cervical half-ring, but, contrary to that genus, does in <b>top</b> <b>view</b> have large rounded osteoderms at the sides of the tail club. It differs from Dyoplosaurus in possessing sacral ribs that perpendicularly point outwards. It differs from Scolosaurus in possessing keeled osteoderms with a round or oval base on the top and sides of the first cervical half-ring and having a shorter rear blade of the ilium. Euoplocephalus differs from Ankylosaurus in possessing anteriorly directed external nostrils and in lacking a continuous keel between the squamosal horn and the supraorbitals.|$|E

2500|$|Major {{characteristics}} of nanoparticles include volume, structure, and visual properties {{that make them}} valuable in nanobiotechnology. Depending on specific properties of size, structure, and luminescence, nanoparticles {{can be used for}} different applications. Imaging techniques are used to identify such properties and give more information about the tested sample. Techniques used to characterize nanoparticles are also useful in studying how nanoparticles interact with biomolecules, such as amino acids or DNA, and include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), denoted by the solubility of the nanoparticles in water and fluorescent. MRI can be applied in the medical field to visualize structures; atomic force microscopy (AFM) that gives a topographic view [...] of the sample on a substrate; transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that gives a <b>top</b> <b>view,</b> but with a different technique then that of atomic force microscopy; Raman spectroscopy or surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) gives information about wavelengths and energy in the sample. ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) measures the wavelengths where light is absorbed; X-ray diffraction (XRD) generally gives an idea of the chemical composition of the sample.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} large size, the {{description}} of 2015 indicated some additional distinguishing traits. On the fourth foot claw, the boss that serves as an attachment for the tendon of the flexor muscle is reduced in size. The [...] "blood groove" [...] on the outer side of the fourth claw of the foot, towards the tip is fully enclosed over half of its length, forming a bony tubular structure. The second and third claws of the foot have sharp keels at their undersides. The second foot claw, the [...] "sickle claw", equals 29% of the thighbone length. On the shinbone, the crista fibularis, the crest that contacts the calfbone, is long and lightly built with a height that does not exceed 9% of the crest length. The upper edge of this crest ends in a hook. On the second metacarpal, of the two condyles that contact the finger, the inner one is almost {{as large as the}} outer one. The outer side of the second metacarpal has but a shallow groove for the ligament that connects it to the third metacarpal. When the arm is seen in a flat position, of the second metacarpal the edge between the wrist joint and the upper shaft is straight in <b>top</b> <b>view.</b> The teeth have fifteen to twenty denticles per [...] on the rear edges and twenty to twenty-seven denticles on the front edges.|$|E
