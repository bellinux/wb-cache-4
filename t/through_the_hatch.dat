5|$|The astronauts planned {{placement}} of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so {{some of the highest}} heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.|$|E
25|$|For {{his first}} EVA Collins {{did not leave}} the Gemini capsule, but stood up <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> with a device that resembled a sextant. In his {{biography}} {{he said he felt}} at that moment like a Roman god riding the skies in his chariot.|$|E
25|$|On 26 July 1960, crewmember Fernando Davila {{was injured}} {{when he fell}} through an open hatch on the {{forecastle}} of Vercharmian. He sued in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit claiming damages for injuries suffered when he fell <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatch.</b> The claim was denied and an appeal was unsuccessful. On 31 May 1961, Vercharmian ran aground off Mormugao, India. She was refloated, and sailed on 7 July but was discovered to be leaking and was beached in Mormugao Bay. She was refloated on 7 October and towed to Karachi, Pakistan. She arrived on 7 March 1962 at Chittagong, India for scrapping.|$|E

50|$|Vehicles {{in upper}} stowage spaces can be embarked/debarked <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatches</b> with cargo booms, while pallets are embarked/debarked in lower stowage spaces by elevators. <b>The</b> main deck <b>hatch</b> of hold 2 is {{unobstructed}} {{and can be}} opened for embarking/debarking of vehicles without the delay of unloading landing craft stowed on <b>the</b> <b>hatch.</b> Hold 4 is well suited for high priority cargo because of its {{direct access to the}} flight deck or main deck via elevator number 5.|$|R
25|$|Once {{the bell}} {{is at the}} correct depth, the final {{adjustments}} to pressure are made and after final checks, the supervisor instructs the working diver(s) to lock out of the bell. The hatch {{is at the bottom}} of the bell and can only be opened if the pressure inside is balanced with the ambient water pressure. The bellman tends the working diver's umbilical <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> during the dive. If the diver experiences a problem and needs assistance, the bellman will exit the bell and follow the diver's umbilical to the diver and render whatever help is necessary and possible. Each diver carries back-mounted bailout gas, which should be sufficient to allow a safe return to the bell in the event of an umbilical gas supply failure.|$|E
500|$|Because of her limited range, UB-8 {{would not}} have been able to make the entire journey to Turkey, so on 2 May, she was towed by the Austrian cruiser [...] from Pola down the Adriatic and through the Straits of Otranto. The duo {{continued}} until spotted by French forces near Kefalonia. UB-8 slipped the tow and Novara raced back into the Adriatic without incident. Two days after her departure, UB-8 was running on the surface when the stern of the boat suddenly dropped. The watch officer, on the conning tower with the helmsman and a lookout, was able to partially close the hatch before the entire submarine slipped below the waves, depositing the three men in the water. On board the submarine, water continued to pour in <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> and the boat was sinking by the stern. Voigt ordered the interior hatch to the control room sealed and all the ballast tanks filled with compressed air to increase buoyancy. The tactic returned UB-8 to the surface where the boat's diesel engines were restarted. Voigt circled back for the missing crewmen but only the watch officer and helmsman were recovered; the lookout had drowned.|$|E
500|$|A {{separate}} model, approximately [...] long, {{was created}} for the Nostromo underside from which the Narcissus would detach and from which Kane's body would be launched during the funeral scene. Bower carved Kane's burial shroud out of wood; it was launched <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> using a small catapult and filmed at high speed. The footage was slowed down in editing. Only one shot was filmed using blue-screen compositing: that of the shuttle racing past the Nostromo. The other shots were simply filmed against black backdrops, with stars added via double exposure. Though motion control photography technology was available at the time, the film's budget would not allow for it. The team therefore used a camera with wide-angle lenses mounted on a drive mechanism to make slow passes over and around the models filming at 2½ frames per second, giving them the appearance of motion. Scott added smoke and wind effects to enhance the illusion. For the scene in which the Nostromo detaches from the refinery, a [...] docking arm was created using pieces from model railway kits. The Nostromo was {{pushed away from the}} refinery by a forklift covered in black velvet, causing the arm to extend out from the refinery. This created the illusion that the arm was pushing the ship forward. Shots of the ship's exterior in which characters are seen moving around inside were filmed using larger models which contained projection screens displaying pre-recorded footage.|$|E

60|$|The English disappeared, {{as if by}} magic. Some leaped {{upon the}} ridge-ropes, others sought the {{protection}} of the guns, and many went <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatches.</b> At that moment Ludlow made his most desperate effort. Aided by the gunner, he applied matches to the two swivels, which had been placed in readiness for a last resort. The deck was enveloped in smoke, and, when the vapor lifted, the forward part of the ship was as clear as if man had never trod it. All who had not fallen, had vanished.|$|R

60|$|The Lascar {{sprang to}} his feet with the agility of a panther, leaped <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> above him, and {{disappeared}} over {{the bow of the}} ship with an unhesitating directness that showed that every avenue of escape had been already contemplated by him. Slipping lightly from the cutwater to the ground, he continued his flight, only stopping at the private office of Mr. Sleight.|$|E
60|$|Whitney {{crept into}} the low-roofed cabin, where {{he sat on a}} locker, holding the tackle that lifted the heavy iron centerplate.

60|$|The tub {{came down}} by and by, in fact, two of them, {{and those who}} had no shovels bailed up the slimy kernels with their hats and hands; but each time the chain swung <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> the tub below was full. It was two o'clock when they desisted, and some of them were waist deep in water then, while soon after they came up the big hose splashed in again. There were steampipe collars to unbolt and pack, and bolt again, before that was done; while when Austin came upon Jefferson, he held up one hand from which the scalded skin was peeling.|$|E
60|$|Wilder {{was by far}} {{too deeply}} interested, to break the sudden reverie into which his {{companion}} had now evidently fallen, even by breathing as loud as usual. The boy descended <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> like a serpent gliding into his hole, or, rather, a fox darting into his burrow, and then a profound stillness reigned in the cabin. The Commander of the ship leaned his head on his hand, appearing utterly unconscious {{of the presence of}} any stranger. The silence might have been of much longer duration, had it not been interrupted by the appearance of a third person. A straight, rigid form slowly elevated itself through the little hatchway, very much in the manner that theatrical spectres are seen to make their appearance on the stage, until about half of the person was visible, when it ceased to rise, and turned its disciplined countenance on the Captain.|$|E

60|$|A short voyage gives short commons; and I {{was soon}} obliged {{to look out}} for another craft. This time I shipped in the Erie, Captain Funk, a Havre liner, and sailed soon after. This was a noble ship, with the best of usage. Both our {{passages}} were pleasant, and give me nothing to relate. While I was at work in the hold, at Havre, a poor female passenger, who came to look at the ship, fell <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatch,</b> and was so much injured as to be left behind. I mention the circumstance merely to show how near I was to a meeting with my old shipmate, who is writing these pages, and yet missed him. On comparing notes, I find he was on deck when this accident happened, having come to see after some effects he was then shipping to New York. These very effects I handled, and supposed them to belong to a passenger who was to come home in the ship; but, as they were addressed to another name, I could not recognise them. Mr. Cooper did not come home in the Erie, but passed over to England, and embarked at London, and so I failed to see him.|$|E
60|$|Of this Don Miguel's anguished {{eyes had}} {{no more than a}} {{fleeting}} but comprehensive glimpse before his own decks were invaded by a wild, yelling swarm of boarders from the grappling ship. Never was confidence so quickly changed into despair, never was hunter more swiftly converted into helpless prey. For helpless the Spaniards were. The swiftly executed boarding manoeuvre had caught them almost unawares in the moment of confusion following the punishing broadside they had sustained at such short range. For a moment there was a valiant effort by some of Don Miguel's officers to rally the men for a stand against these invaders. But the Spaniards, never at their best in close-quarter fighting, were here demoralized by knowledge of the enemies with whom they had to deal. Their hastily formed ranks were smashed before they could be steadied; driven across the waist to the break of the poop on the one side, and up to the forecastle bulkheads on the other, the fighting resolved itself into a series of skirmishes between groups. And whilst this was doing above, another horde of buccaneers swarmed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> to the main deck below to overpower the gun-crews at their stations there.|$|E
60|$|We got our scous after this, but {{the negro}} logged the whole transaction, as one may suppose. He was {{particularly}} set against me, as I had been ringleader in the cobbing. The weather continued bad, the watches were much fagged, {{and the ship}} gave no grog. At length I could stand it no longer, or thought I could not; and I led down betwixt decks, tapped a cask of gin, introduced the stem of a clean pipe and took a nip at the bowl. All my watch smoked this pipe pretty regularly, first at one cask and then at another, until we got into port. The larboard watch did the same, and I do think the strong liquor helped us along that time. As bad luck would have it, the cook's wood was stowed among the casks, and, one morning, just {{as the last of}} us had knocked off smoking, we saw the wool of this gentleman heaving in sight, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>hatch</b> by which we went down. Still, nothing was said until we came to be paid off, when the darky came out with his yarn. I owned it all, and insisted we never could have brought the ship in, unless we had got the gin. I do believe both captain and owner were sorry we had been complained of, but they could not overlook the matter. I was mulcted five-and-twenty dollars, and left the ship. I know I did wrong, and I know that the owners did what was right; but I cannot help thinking, bad as gin is on a long pull, that this did us good. I was not driven from the ship; on the contrary, both master and Owners wished me to remain; but I felt a little savage, and quitted their employment.|$|E
