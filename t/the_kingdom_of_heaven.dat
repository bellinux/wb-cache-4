5|$|Since our blessed Lord, {{instead of}} a rich and honourable station in this world, was pleased to choose his lot among men of the lower condition; let not those, on whom the bounty of Providence hath {{bestowed}} wealth and honours, despise the men who are placed in a humble and inferior station; but rather, with their utmost power, by their countenance, by their protection, by just payment of their honest labour, encourage their daily endeavours {{for the support of}} themselves and their families. On the other hand, let the poor labour to provide things honest in the sight of all men; and so, with diligence in their several employments, live soberly, righteously, and godlily in this present world, that they may obtain that glorious reward promised in the Gospel to the poor, I mean <b>the</b> <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Heaven.</b>|$|E
5|$|The murals {{are one of}} {{the best}} {{representations}} of Byzantine art outside the traditional borders of Byzantium. The majority of the murals bear scriptures in Greek. The murals were painted under the patronage of atabek Ivane Zakarian between 1205 and 1216. Parallels have been drawn between the murals and the 11th century Armenian miniature paintings of the Mugni Gospels. The coloring of the murals is characteristic of typical Byzantine art while the thematic solutions are more Armenian. New and Old Testaments scenes as well as various saints including Saint Gregory the Illuminator are depicted on the murals. A large image of the Holy Virgin is depicted in the dome holding Jesus. The mural has been badly damaged and only parts of it survived. Below the Holy Virgin, the Communion is shown where Jesus is depicted twice, turning on the right and left sharing bread with the Apostles. The images of the Apostles Peter, John the Evangelist, Paul and Matthew have survived. The common Christians saints are depicted below the Communion scene, including Pope Sylvester, Saint James the son of Alpheus, Saint John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, Gregory the Illuminator, Jacob of Mtsbin, Clement of Rome, Gregory the Thaumaturgist, Cyril of Alexandria and Eusebius of Caesarea. The murals on the western wall depict <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Heaven.</b> The northern wall depicts the trial of Jesus by the high priest of Caiaphas and by the Roman Procurator Pontius Pilate. Some of the murals were renovated in 1979. The arches, niches and columns are also covered by murals.|$|E

25|$|The first legendary {{stories on}} the life of the emperor Maurice are {{recorded}} in the ninth century, {{in the work of the}} Byzantine historian Theophanes the Confessor.

25|$|Several {{scholars}} {{argue that}} Thomas is dependent on Syriac writings, including unique versions of the canonical gospels. They contend that many sayings of the Gospel of Thomas are more similar to Syriac translations of the canonical gospels than their record in the original Greek. Craig A. Evans states that saying 54 in Thomas, which speaks {{of the poor and}} <b>the</b> <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>heaven,</b> is more similar to the Syriac version of Matthew 5:3 than the Greek version of that passage or the parallel in Luke 6:20.|$|E

The Torah has little {{to say on the}} subject of survival after death, but {{by the time of the}} rabbis two ideas had made inroads among the Jews: one, which is probably derived from Greek thought, is that of the immortal soul which returns to its creator after death; the other, which is thought to be of Persian origin, is that of resurrection of the dead.|$|E
25|$|An {{interpretation}} of Roman law regarding treasure troves makes an {{appearance in the}} 13th chapter of the Gospel of Matthew. The Parable of the Hidden Treasure is told by Jesus of Nazareth to the crowds surrounding him and his disciples. In the parable, the treasure trove is hidden in a field, which is open country and anyone could conceivably discover something hidden in that location. It's also assumed that the present owner has no knowledge or memory of the treasure. The finder of the treasure kept the trove secret until he could raise capital to purchase the land holding the trove. Selling all he had, the finder purchased the land and then unearthed the trove and, as the finder and owner, he was legally entitled to the entire trove. Jesus compared <b>the</b> <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Heaven</b> to the trove, being of greater value than all a person's earthly wealth and a wise investment that not everyone understands at first.|$|E

500|$|Jesus is {{identified}} with the Word ("Logos"), and the Word {{is identified}} with theos ("god" [...] in Greek); no such identification {{is made in the}} synoptics.

In the synoptics the chief theme is the Kingdom of God and <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Heaven</b> (the latter specifically in Matthew), while John's theme is Jesus as the source of eternal life and the Kingdom is only mentioned twice.
