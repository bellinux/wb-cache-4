Moore had additional orders to retrieve what he could from the wreck site of the HMS Halifax.|$|E

This form of intelligence {{has been defined as}} the ability to interact effectively with people from different cultures (Soon & Linn, 2015; Tuleja, 2014); and this involves the ability to shape and exhibit appropriate behavior in a different or new cultural setting (Thomas 2006).|$|R
