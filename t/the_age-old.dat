5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of <b>the</b> <b>age-old</b> problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded us that our great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E

25|$|In Russia, <b>the</b> <b>age-old</b> {{ways of life}} of the Sami were brutally {{interrupted}} by the collectivization of the reindeer husbandry and agriculture in general. Most Sami were organized in a single kolkhoz, located in {{the central part of}} the Peninsula, at Lovozero (Sami: Lojavri). The Soviet state made an enormous effort to develop this strategically important region, and the Sami people witnessed their land being overrun by ethnic Russians and other Soviet nationalities, including Nenets and other Arctic peoples.|$|E
25|$|This dynamic {{scenario}} is {{further complicated by}} <b>the</b> <b>age-old</b> problem of the possible identification between Nuragic people and the Shardana, one of the Sea peoples. Textual evidence from cuneiform tablets and Egyptian reliefs from the New Kingdom, relate that Sea Peoples were the final catalyst that put the fall of Aegean cities and Levantines states in motion. The Shardana apparently took part as mercenaries in several conflicts involving Ancient Egypt and are often associated with Sardinia.|$|E

People, caught in the Kalimayai, began to be inimical towards one another - men against women, children against parents, and so forth. People used demonic force to harm one another. Kalimayai captured the king of Thiruvitankur and began to rule over the people as their king.|$|R
25|$|The second {{article of}} the Treaty of Simulambuco, signed in 1885, {{is often used}} as an {{argument}} by Cabindis separatists. It states that Portugal must ensure {{the integrity of the}} Territories under its protection. The Cabindis celebrated in 2005, the 120th anniversary of this Treaty, to the dismay of the Angolan authorities who consider this treaty to be contrary to the state of fact, making Cabinda an Angolan enclave. This differentiated reading of the Treaty is also at the origin of <b>the</b> <b>age-old</b> conflict between the two Parties.|$|E
25|$|Such a {{conclusion}} led Heidegger {{to depart from}} the phenomenology of his teacher Husserl and prompt instead an (ironically anachronistic) return to the yet-unasked questions of Ontology, a return that in general did not acknowledge an intrinsic distinction between phenomena and noumena or between things in themselves (de re) and things as they appear (see qualia): Being-in-the-world, or rather, the openness {{to the process of}} Daseins becoming was to bridge <b>the</b> <b>age-old</b> gap between these two. In this latter premise, Heidegger shares an affinity with the late Romantic philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, another principal forerunner of post-structuralist and postmodernist thought. Influential to thinkers associated with Postmodernism are Heidegger's critique of the subject–object or sense–knowledge division implicit in Rationalism, Empiricism, and methodological naturalism, his repudiation of the idea that facts exist outside or separately from the process of thinking and speaking them (however, Heidegger is not specifically a nominalist), his related admission that the possibilities of philosophical and scientific discourse are wrapped up in the practices and expectations of a society and that concepts and fundamental constructs are the expression of a lived, historical exercise rather than simple derivations of external, a priori conditions independent from historical mind and changing experience (see Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Heinrich von Kleist, Weltanschauung, and social constructionism), and his instrumentalist and negativist notion that Being (and, by extension, reality) is an action, method, tendency, possibility, and question rather than a discrete, positive, identifiable state, answer, or entity (see also process philosophy, dynamism, Instrumentalism, Pragmatism, and Vitalism).|$|E
500|$|The County Championship was a semi-official {{competition}} in 1878 {{as it was}} not formally structured until December 1890, but <b>the</b> <b>age-old</b> ad hoc claims {{on behalf of a}} [...] "Champion County" [...] had been regulated somewhat by the introduction of residential criteria for players in 1873.

Besides performing the music for dances, in the former viscounty of Soule (Zuberoa in Basque) it may enliven accompanied on both the ttun-ttun and the atabal the traditional carnival-time performances called maskaradak as well as <b>the</b> pastorals, <b>age-old</b> region-specific theatre plays popular in the area.|$|R
5000|$|Midway {{through the}} film, {{revolution}} breaks out. The unbridled optimism of the January 25 Revolution {{is evident in}} drivers' interactions, some of whom volunteer as [...] "traffic helpers" [...] in Tahrir Square.

It was the second episode written by Burns that season, the first being [...] "Holidays of Future Passed". According to Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club, the episode satirizes the phenomenon of the social networking website Facebook. He commented that [...] "the thrust of the satire can be summed up with <b>the</b> <b>age-old</b> cry of parents to their offspring to put that damn thing down and go outside already." [...] Childs added that the episode points out [...] "the most blatant of the many faults of Facebook—namely, its hypnotic ability to distract people in a semi-narcissistic haze [...] ".|$|E
500|$|During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West {{explained}} why {{he believed that}} President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: [...] "Man, {{let me tell you}} something about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have the same level of connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, <b>the</b> <b>age-old</b> canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Kreisberg, {{creator and}} {{executive}} producer on both series, said, [...] "It's {{really going to be}} an adventure with the Arrow and Flash on both episodes. Watching the two teams come together and fight alongside each other, it's one of the most fun parts, ... we just don’t believe in waiting. We really believe in accelerated storytelling." [...] Kreisberg explained that since they are all comic book fans themselves, they have all debated <b>the</b> <b>age-old</b> question of which superhero would win in a fight; [...] "So, the idea that [...] would fight each other in one of these episodes was one of our earliest ideas, and that the cast members would have that Comic-Con argument on camera was one of our earliest ideas." [...] Greg Berlanti, creator {{and executive producer}} on both series, explained that [...] "crossovers are part of [...] DNA, ... and if we waited ..., then we would be depriving the audience of something we all wanted to see".|$|E

Some of the more recently made hieroglyphics Tarzan's companions read with interest and commented upon, and then with the points of their knives they too added to <b>the</b> possibly <b>age-old</b> record of <b>the</b> blackened walls.|$|R

Lennon and Ono pledged to auction the shorn hair for a charitable cause, having similarly announced on 5 January that they would donate all future royalties from their recordings to the peace movement. Also while in Denmark, the Lennons, Cox and the latter's current partner, Melinde Kendall, discussed the concept of [...] "instant karma", whereby the causality of one's actions is immediate rather than borne out over a lifetime. Author Philip Norman writes of the concept's appeal: [...] "The idea was quintessential Lennon – <b>the</b> <b>age-old</b> Buddhist law {{of cause and effect}} turned into something as modern and synthetic as instant coffee and, simultaneously, into a bogey under the stairs that can get you if you don't watch out." ...|$|E
500|$|Mulan explores <b>the</b> <b>age-old</b> {{theme of}} {{remaining}} true to oneself, with co-director Tony Bancroft summarizing the character's {{role in the}} film as [...] "the story of a girl who can't help who she is but she exists in a different society that tells her who she is supposed to be." [...] Because the Ballad of Mulan is such a beloved and well-known story, San Souci longed to maintain the character's integrity. However, certain creative liberties were taken with the story in regards to Mulan's role, such as the character neglecting to ask her parents' permission prior to enlisting herself in the army. Additionally, Mulan's surname was changed from [...] "Hua" [...] to [...] "Fa." [...] Finally, Mulan's true identity is discovered much earlier in the film, soon after the army's initial encounter with the enemy, whereas her comrades remain ignorant throughout their entire 12 years at war until after Mulan has returned home.|$|E
500|$|Firstly, it was {{intended}} to prevent further war between France and Germany and other states by tackling the root cause of war. The ECSC was primarily conceived with France and Germany in mind: [...] "The coming together of the nations of Europe requires the elimination of <b>the</b> <b>age-old</b> opposition of France and Germany. Any action taken must in the first place concern these two countries." [...] The coal and steel industries being essential for the production of munitions, Schuman believed that by uniting these two industries across France and Germany under an innovative supranational system that also included a European anti-cartel agency, he could [...] "make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible". Schuman had another aim: [...] "With increased resources Europe will be able to pursue the achievement of one of its essential tasks, namely, the development of the African continent." [...] Industrial cartels tended to impose [...] "restrictive practices" [...] on national markets, whereas the ECSC would ensure the increased production necessary for their ambitions in Africa.|$|E

Climbers snake up the tree stems, and the forest floor is littered with fallen leaves and foliage plants. Sculptural anthills dot the landscape. There is a watering hole created by the Forest Department to quench the thirst of wild animals. A number of pebbled dry rivulets, which come alive during the monsoon season. A vast stretch of forest clearing is in sight. It is a man-made clearing and a 'fire line' which helps in the intricate task of containing forest fires, which once if they start off can turn into an inferno.|$|R
