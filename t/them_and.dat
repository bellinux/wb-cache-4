5000|$|On Eat <b>'Em</b> <b>and</b> Smile, Roth {{returned}} to a hard rock sound, comparable with that of early Van Halen, albeit featuring eclectic forays into lounge, jazz, and speed metal. Both a critical and commercial success, Rolling Stone wrote that no song on Eat <b>'Em</b> <b>and</b> Smile was as slick {{as any of the}} singles from Van Halen's 5150 album, (which featured Roth's replacement Sammy Hagar) and also opined that Eat <b>'Em</b> <b>and</b> Smile was much more [...] "trashy fun". Indeed, many of the reviews of Eat <b>'Em</b> <b>and</b> Smile compared it directly with Van Halen's synth-heavy 5150, often favorably.|$|R

25|$|In late 1985, Roth {{assembled}} a virtuoso solo band, consisting of guitarist Steve Vai (previously of Frank Zappa's band), bassist Billy Sheehan (previously of Talas), and drummer Gregg Bissonette (previously of Maynard Ferguson's big band).

The album saw Roth return to hard rock music, but also incorporated {{some of his}} more eclectic musical tastes, ranging from jazz to speed metal. Eat <b>'Em</b> <b>and</b> Smile met with widespread commercial and critical success, charting at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200, and selling over 2 million copies in the U.S. alone. Roth and his band toured arenas extensively in support of Eat <b>'Em</b> <b>and</b> Smile (see Eat <b>'Em</b> <b>and</b> Smile Tour), {{before returning to the}} studio in 1987 to record a follow-up.|$|R
