5|$|After 1906, <b>the</b> <b>Canadian</b> <b>Government</b> {{took over}} the Halifax Dockyard (now CFB Halifax) from the Royal Navy.

The outbreak of the war brought Halifax back to prominence. As the Royal Canadian Navy had virtually no seaworthy ships of its own, the Royal Navy assumed responsibility for maintaining Atlantic trade routes by re-adopting Halifax as its North American base of operations. In 1915, management of the harbour fell {{under the control of}} the Royal Canadian Navy under the supervision of Captain Superintendent Edward Harrington Martin; by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in Halifax, including patrol ships, tugboats, and minesweepers.|$|E
