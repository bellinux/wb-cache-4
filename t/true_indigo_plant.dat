25|$|The species used {{to produce}} dyes include the following: Logwood Haematoxylon campechianum; a large spiny tree that can grow up to 15m tall. Its cork is thin and soft and its wood is hard. The {{heartwood}} is {{used to produce}} dyes that are red and purple. The histological stain called haematoxylin is produced from this species. Brazilwood tree (Caesalpinia echinata) {{is similar to the}} previous tree but smaller and with red or purple flowers. The wood is also used to produce a red or purple dye. The Madras thorn (Pithecallobium dulce) is another spiny tree native to Latin America, it grows up to 4m high and has yellow or green flowers that grow in florets. Its fruit is reddish and is used to produce a yellow dye. Indigo dye is extracted from the <b>True</b> <b>indigo</b> <b>plant</b> Indigofera tinctoria that is native to Asia. In Central and South America dyes are produced from two species related to this species, indigo from Indigofera suffruticosa and Natal indigo from Indigofera arrecta.yellow dye is extracted from Butea monosperma commonly called as flame of the forest.|$|E
40|$|Indigo {{fabric is}} created by dying silk or cotton with color from the <b>true</b> <b>indigo</b> <b>plant</b> (Indigofera tinctoria) and is a {{valuable}} commodity in Northeastern Thai communities. This is a qualitative investigation with two principal research aims: 1) To study the history and background of indigo-dyed fabric in Sakon Nakhon Province; 2) To study the current conditions and application of traditional knowledge in creating indigo-dyed fabric in Sakon Nakhon Province, Thailand. Data for this investigation were collected from document analysis and field research between July 2013 and July 2014. Results show that weaving groups are sponsored {{by the government and}} the local community to produce indigo-dyed fabric that can be transformed into a variety of different products that meet consumer needs. These products include blankets, scarves, shawls, formal wear and bags. Weaving communities prefer to use materials from the surrounding environment. Community members cultivate their own true indigo plants using the traditional processes inherited from generation to generation. The dye creation process requires plant matter to be soaked in water for 24 hours before it can be used in the dye mixture. The traditional dye mixture is 4 liters of indigo plant, 2 liters of natural lye water and 1 tablespoon of white lime. During the dyeing process, the cotton fabric is stirred and wring in the dye mixture until the color holds. The fabric is then rested and the process is repeated to achieve the desired hue. The quality of the dye is then tested by washing the fabric in clean water. By applying the resourcefulness of traditional knowledge used in the dye creation process to the marketing and sale of indigo fabric, the entire production will benefit...|$|E
500|$|Blue {{colorants}} {{around the}} world were derived from <b>indigo</b> dye-bearing <b>plants,</b> primarily those in the genus Indigofera, which are native to the tropics.

It was a primary supplier of indigo dye to Europe as early as the Greco-Roman era. The association of India with indigo is reflected in the Greek word for the dye, which was indikon (ινδικόν). The Romans used the term indicum, which passed into Italian dialect and eventually into English as the word indigo.|$|R

50|$|Indigo dye {{could be}} made from two {{different}} types of plants: the <b>indigo</b> <b>plant,</b> which produced the best results, and from the woad plant. The British were producing indigo with woad, a plant that yielded a lesser quality dye, but a plant they could grow. They even tried to hold their monopoly on indigo dye by managing to ban the <b>indigo</b> <b>plant</b> for years, claiming that it was poisonous. But eventually the British began to focus on tea and other crops, and meanwhile, the French started to get their fair share of the market.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} to {{investigate}} the four <b>indigo</b> <b>plant</b> varieties and other <b>plants</b> that give <b>indigo</b> dye. The findings revealed that Nakhon Panom variety gave the greatest yield. The leaf produce was 5520 kg/Acre A followed by Kalasin variety, Mukdahan variety and Sakon Nakhon variety with leaf yield of 4560, 4320 and 3920 kg/Acre, respectively. Kalasin variety was proved to be the best. This variety gave the highest amount of indigo dye, 0. 022 g per 100 g of indigo leaves. Mukdahan variety, Sakon Nakhon and Nakon Phanom variety gave 0. 017, 0. 015 and 0. 015 g. of indigo dye respectively. The difference was not statistically different. From the study the plant {{that could be used to}} supplement the <b>indigo</b> <b>plants</b> was Marsdenia tinctoria R. Br. which gave 0. 025 g per 100 g of indigo leaves at 40 oC, whereas Memecylin edule Roxb. had high acidity, it did not give the color of indigo dye...|$|R
50|$|But {{this was}} problematic. The French {{had gone to}} war with Britain, so the British could hardly rely on the French for this {{precious}} blue dye.

50|$|Cause lead to revolt - <b>Indigo</b> <b>planting</b> in Bengal dated back to 1777. Louis Bonard was {{probably}} the first indigo planter. With expansion of British power in the Nawabate of Bengal, <b>indigo</b> <b>planting</b> {{became more and more}} commercially profitable because of the demand for blue dye in Europe. It was introduced in large parts of Burdwan, Bankura, Birbhum, North 24 Parganas, Jessore (present Bangladesh) etc. The indigo planters pursued the peasants to <b>plant</b> <b>indigo</b> instead of food crops. They provided loans, called dadon, at a very high interest. Once a farmer took such loans he remained in debt for whole of his life before passing it to his successors. The price paid by the planters was meagre,only 2.5% of the market price. The farmers could make no profit growing indigo. The farmers were totally unprotected from the indigo planters, who resorted to mortgages or destruction of their property if they were unwilling to obey them. Government rules favoured the planters. By an act in 1833, the planters were granted a free hand in oppression. Even the zamindars, means the landlords money lenders and other influential persons sided with the planters. Out of the severe oppression unleashed on them the farmers resorted to revolt.|$|R

30|$|No dye {{components}} {{could be}} unequivocally identified in most blue samples after mild hydrolysis. Suspecting inefficient extraction, a harsh hydrolysis method {{was performed on}} the same sample (Table  1). XRF did not show any consistent elemental composition across samples. It is possible all elements detected came from vats used by the dyers, since indigo does not require a mordant to dye [32, 33, 48]. The use of <b>indigo</b> <b>plants</b> as a source for blue colouring is consistent with analyses carried out on other eighteenth century European textiles [29, 43, 58].|$|R
40|$|Colors {{ranging from}} blue to purple can be {{obtained}} using fresh leaves of <b>indigo</b> <b>plants</b> such as Polygonum tinctorium Lour, by producing indirubin in addition to indigo. To obtain a variety of color from a single plant, chlorophyll was extracted from {{the remainder of the}} fresh leaves of Polygonum which was used for blue or purple dyeing and was subjected to dyeing to silk fabrics. Similar green shade as reported for other plants was obtained. Various colors could be produced by dyeing green chlorophyll to blue or purple silk fabrics...|$|R
