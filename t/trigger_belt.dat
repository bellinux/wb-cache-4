40|$|To protect {{occupants}} {{during a}} rollover event, restraint control modules with integrated Rollover Sensing (RoSe) function have been developed. These devices {{are able to}} <b>trigger</b> <b>belt</b> tensioners and curtain airbags if the vehicle’s roll angle and roll rate indicate that the vehicle is going to tip over. Especially {{in the case of}} tripped rollovers, however, the optimum deployment time for curtain airbags is before the vehicle has build up a significant roll angle. To cope with this challenge the advanced rollover sensing function from Bosch uses the lateral velocity of the vehicle as additional input to its deployment decision. Based on a new crash test setup developed by Dekra the performance benefit of this advanced rollover sensing system can be shown under realistic circumstances. The test does not only cover the rollover phase but also the skidding phase before the vehicle passes onto the soil and rolls over. First tests have been performed to investigate both the repeatability of the movement and the behaviour of the vehicle during such tests. To steer the car, an optically controlled guidance is used combined with a time-based activation of the steering without braking. The vehicle with rightwards steered front wheels runs for a short time on a µ-split path. Several sensors are used to measure the relevant kinematics (velocity, acceleration, yaw-, roll- and pitch-rate). Additionally the movement is filmed by several high-speed cameras. In the article the authors describe the test method and the results and discuss the benefit of this new method to assess the performance of an algorithm for advanced rollover protection...|$|E

50|$|The P-11 was {{designed}} by Swedish-born George Kellgren, the designer of many earlier Husqvarna (Sweden), Intratec, and Grendel brand firearms. The P-11 uses an aluminum receiver inside a polymer grip housing held on with polymer pins. The slide, barrel, and magazine are steel. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds, or 12 rounds in states not limited to 10-round magazines. Both fit flush {{to the bottom of}} the pistol. At 17.1 oz unloaded, the handgun itself is comparatively light. The P-11 lacks an external manual safety, relying instead on a long and heavy double action only (DAO) trigger pull, which requires 9 pounds of pressure, to prevent accidental discharge. A firing pin spring and low-mass hammer prevent discharge if the gun is dropped. The P-11 will also accept some Smith & Wesson 59 series magazines. An available adapter wraps around the base of 15-round Smith & Wesson model 59-style magazines. Smith & Wesson series 69 compact 12-round magazines will also work, with a matching short adapter sleeve, as well. Accessories such as <b>trigger</b> shoes, finger-rests, <b>belt</b> clips, steel guide rods to replace the factory installed polymer guide rod, gray- and OD green-colored polymer grip housings, night sights, and other accessories are also available from the manufacturer.|$|R
40|$|Classically, {{deepwater}} fold-and-thrust belts {{are classified}} in two main types, depending if they result from near- or far-field stresses and {{the understanding of}} their driving and triggering mechanism is poorly known. We present a geophysical data set off the western margin of New Caledonia (SW Pacific) that reveals deformed structures of a deepwater fold-and-thrust belt that we interpret as a near-field gravity-driven system, which is not located at a rifted passive margin. The main factor triggering deformation is inferred to be oversteepening of the margin slope by postobduction isostatic rebound. Onshore erosion of abnormally dense obducted material, combined with sediment loading in the adjacent basin, has induced vertical motions that have caused oversteepening of the margin. Detailed morphobathymetric, seismic stratigraphic, and structural analysis reveals that the fold-and-thrust belt extends 200 km along the margin, and 50 km into the New Caledonia Trough. Deformation is rooted at depths greater than 5 km beneath the seafloor, affects an area of 3, 500 km(2), and involves a sediment volume of approximately 13, 000 km(3). This deformed belt is organized into an imbricate fan system of faults, and one out-of-sequence thrust fault affects the seabed. The thrust faults are {{deeply rooted in the}} basin along a low-angle floor thrust and connected to New Caledonia Island along a major detachment. This study not only provides a better knowledge of the New Caledonia margin but also provides new insight into the mechanisms that <b>trigger</b> deepwater fold-and-thrust <b>belts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Heavy {{precipitation}} {{and deadly}} flooding occurred on 12 - 14 February 1996 over the northeastern parts of South Africa. A persistent tropical moist conveyor belt supplied ample moisture {{and a deep}} layer of conditional instability favorable for heavy precipitation. The three-day heavy pre-cipitation event occurred in several episodes. Rainfall on the 12 th was due to deep convection triggered by a minor short-wave trough in the mid-latitude westerlies passing east-southeastward across the country. On the 13 th, deep convection again occurred within the moist conveyor <b>belt,</b> <b>triggered</b> by enhanced moist, northerly flow resulting from an approaching mesoscale convective vortex (MCV). Much of the precipitation fell on upwind slopes, suggesting that orographic lift helped initiate the convection. Heavy pre-cipitation on the 14 th, in contrast, was {{not the result of}} deep convection within the moist tropical plume, but rather from lifting of the west edge of the moist plume over a cold front. Isentropic charts, derived from the output of the South African Eta numerical weather prediction model, depicted these key synoptic features very well. This case illustrates the advantages of using several tools such as observations, numerical model guidance on pressure and isentropic surfaces and satellite imagery- to identify the crucial factors in forecasting heavy rain events in South Africa. Because South Africa is located in a data-sparse region of complex terrain, the use of all available tools, including conceptual models of mesoscale weather sys-tems, is the key to improved weather forecasting. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{describe}} an ordered formation of long- and very long-chain ceramide species {{in relation to}} the progression of B-cell receptor (BcR) triggering induced apoptosis. An early and caspase-independent increase in long-chain ceramide species, in which C- 24 -ceramide predominated, was observed 6 h after <b>Belt</b> <b>triggering.</b> In contrast, very long-chain ceramide species were generated later, 12 - 24 h after BeR triggering. The formation of these very long-chain ceramide species, in which C- 24 -ceramide predominated, required the activation of effector caspases. BcR-induced formation of long-chain ceramide species resulted in proteasomal activation and degradation of XIAP and subsequent activation of effector caspases, demonstrating an important cell-biological mechanism through which longchain ceramides may be involved in the progression of BcR triggering induced apoptosis and subsequent formation of very long-chain ceramide species. BcR-induced activation of the proteasome was blocked with ISP- 1 /myriocin, a potent and selective inhibitor of serine palmitoyl transferase that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the de novo formation of ceramide. Both ISP- 1 and clasto-lactacystin beta-lactone, an irreversible inhibitor of the proteasome, prevented BcR cross-linking-induced XIAP degradation. Also, a mutant XIAP lacking the ubiquitin-ligating ring finger motif was completely resistant to proteasome-mediated degradation, and Ramos cells overexpressing XIAP became highly resistant to BcR cross-linking-induced activation of caspases. The formation of C- 16 -ceramide in response to BcR cross-linking was found unaltered in XIAP overexpressing Ramos cells, whereas C- 24 -ceramide formation was completely abolished. These results demonstrate how de novo generated long-chain ceramide species may be involved in the activation of downstream effector caspases and subsequent formation of very long-chain ceramide species. As such, these results provide novel and important insights into the significance of specific ceramide species in defined stages of apoptosis...|$|R
