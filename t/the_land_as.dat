5|$|In Anglo-Saxon society, noblewomen enjoyed {{considerable}} {{rights and}} status, although the society was still firmly patriarchal. Some exercised power as abbesses, exerting widespread influence across the early English Church, although their wealth and authority diminished with the monastic {{reforms of the}} 9th century. Anglo-Saxon queens began to hold lands {{in their own right}} in the 10th century and their households contributed to the running of the kingdom. Although women could not lead military forces, in the absence of their husbands some noblewomen led the defence of manors and towns. Most Anglo-Saxon women, however, worked on <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>as</b> part of the agricultural community, or as brewers or bakers.|$|E
5|$|No {{time was}} to be wasted on {{elaborate}} drawings; charts and plans should have notes and simple views of <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>as</b> seen from the sea showing measured heights of hills. Continued records of tides and meteorological conditions were also required. An additional suggestion was for a geological survey of a circular coral atoll in the Pacific Ocean including its profile and of tidal flows, to investigate the formation of such coral reefs.|$|E

5|$|Remington and Innes later {{met with}} Menage and, in 1882, devised {{a plan to}} sell King's land to Menage for {{development}} without telling King. Menage also negotiated a separate deal with Innes (likely behind Remington's back) where he agreed to pay him one-third of the profits made from <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>as</b> a finder's fee and in exchange for Innes' help keeping Remington and King at bay. Menage proceeded to develop the land into housing and profited handsomely.|$|E
5|$|The Domesday Book {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>as</b> being predominantly {{flat and}} composed of London clay {{with the exception}} of alluvium {{along the banks of the}} River Pinn. Of the few archaeological surveys of Ickenham carried out, one in 1994 by the Museum of London found a system of Roman fields, dating back to the 1st and 2nd centuries along with pottery fragments. Research suggest that the area may have been abandoned for a period following the departure of the Romans from Britain around AD 410.|$|E
5|$|As {{temperatures}} {{continue to}} rise, the last animal {{life will be}} driven back toward the poles, and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the polar night, aestivating during the polar day due to the intense heat. Much of the surface would become a barren desert and life would primarily {{be found in the}} oceans. However, due to a decrease of the amount or organic matter coming to the oceans from <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>as</b> well as oxygen in the water, life would disappear there too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start with the loss of freshwater species and conclude with invertebrates, particularly those that do not depend on living plants such as termites or those near hydrothermal vents such as worms of the genus Riftia. As a result of these processes, multi-cellular lifeforms may be extinct in about 800 million years, and eukaryotes in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the prokaryotes.|$|E

5|$|On October 24, 1979, church {{president}} Spencer W. Kimball visited Jerusalem {{to dedicate}} the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens, {{located on the}} Mount of Olives. The church had donated money to beautify the Jerusalem area, and officials of the Jerusalem government were present at the occasion. It was at this dedication that Kimball announced the church's intent to build a center for BYU students in the city. Negotiations between {{the church and the}} Israeli government stretched from 1980-1984. The land the church wanted for the center, located at the northwestern margin of Mount Olivet, right next to the valley which separates it from Mount Scopus, had been acquired by Israel during the Six Day War of 1967 and could not be sold under Israeli law. The church decided to obtain a lease on the land instead. Leasing the land also prevented the politically controversial problem of the church owning a piece of Jerusalem land. Israeli officials saw the building of the center on <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>as</b> a way of solidifying control over land whose ownership was ambiguous under international law. By August 1984, the church had the land on a 49-year lease, building permits had been obtained, and construction on the building began.|$|E

25|$|The Umayyads delayed {{their attack}} to so {{late in the}} year {{probably}} because part of the army needed to live off <b>the</b> <b>land</b> <b>as</b> they advanced.
