Such joints typically have higher optical loss and are less robust than fusion splices, especially if the gel is used.

Propranolol works to inhibit the actions of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter <b>that</b> <b>enhances</b> memory consolidation. Individuals given propranolol immediately after trauma experienced fewer stress-related symptoms and lower rates of PTSD than respective control groups who did not receive the drug. Due {{to the fact that}} memories and their emotional content are reconsolidated in the hours after they are recalled/re-experienced, propranolol can also diminish the emotional impact of already formed memories; for this reason, it is also being studied in the treatment of specific phobias, such as arachnophobia, dental fear, and social phobia.|$|E
