5|$|Like Lovinescu, other {{advocates of}} modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions.

Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu {{had a tendency to}} reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.|$|E

These are Se tutti i mali miei, K.83/73p, Misero me, K.77/73e, and Ah più tremar..., K.71. The Symphony in G, K.74, evidently completed in Rome in April, may have been started in Milan.|$|E
