[...] "Use reality as the springboard to whatever you're writing about", Paul said. Paul also says that being a successful songwriter is like being a journalist who writes about what he sees and knows, the times people are living in and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>people</b> are facing today. [...] "The journalist {{looks out the window}} and writes about what is really happening." [...] "I make sure it's real. [...] I don't want to fictionalize about things I haven't witnessed." [...] Paul states that over the years he's learned the value of simplicity in writing. He's learned that he can say more when he writes more simply and direct. [...] "It's almost as if you can be complex and intricate by adopting a shorter, less complicated structure." [...] "I'm not doing rocket science -- I'm a storyteller", he said. [...] "I hope to inspire people to think and feel and to walk out with more than they came in with." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} first conceptualised {{soon after the}} release of Resident Evil 5, and began full {{development}} in 2010. Resident Evil 5 producer Jun Takeuchi said that he considered a [...] "completely new system" [...] for Resident Evil 6, but later ruled out his involvement with the game. In March 2009, co-producer Masachika Kawata stated that the new instalment was not decided upon, but admitted that it could take Capcom four to eight years to develop. Kawata later claimed that the new game will be drastically different from its predecessors. The game was directed by Eiichiro Sasaki, who also directed the Resident Evil Outbreak series. When development of the game first begun, producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi wanted to revolve the game around the [...] "ultimate horror entertainment", bearing in mind that the team considered the upcoming Resident Evil 6 to be the flagship title of the horror genre. In a February 2012 interview, Hirabayashi stated that he went to lengths to balance [...] "all of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>people</b> love" [...] about the series, so the team focused to orientate gameplay around horror themes. In March 2012, Capcom admitted that the survival-horror market was too small for Resident Evil, and issued a statement that the development team would instead choose to orientate the gameplay around the action genre.|$|E
500|$|Although he did {{not focus}} less on Christian lyrical {{material}} for Undone, mainstream radio was on Millard's mind when he wrote the lyrics on the album. Millard attempted to write lyrics that, while still focused on God, tapped into <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>people</b> deal with every day. Further, he avoided using Christian jargon, as {{people who are not}} churchgoers might not understand what those terms mean; instead, he tried to be [...] "clearer in the things [...] were talking about". Another impact on the songwriting was the band's experiences over the previous year; while working on Undone, Millard and {{the other members of the}} band lost eight people close to them. Millard noted that [...] "There's a lot of personal stuff on [...] about the things we've gone through and how Christ has been the solution". One particular song, [...] "Homesick", was written after two incidents. The first incident occurred during the holiday season of 2004; a friend of Millard's lost her twin babies during pregnancy and was so far along in the pregnancy that doctors had to induce labor. After attending the funeral for the two babies, Millard wrote the chorus to the song. However, he didn't write any more to [...] "Homesick" [...] after that as {{he did not}} want to [...] "fake" [...] his way through writing it. Following the death of his brother-in-law Chris, however, Millard finished the song. Although Undone was [...] "essentially complete" [...] at that point, the band recorded and included it on the album.|$|E

500|$|The team {{failed to}} throw a {{touchdown}} pass in any of their first five games, three of which were shutout losses. Offensive coordinator John Rauch walked out on the team during the week 5 game against Cincinnati, and gave 'personal differences' {{as the reason for}} his resignation. His duties were taken over by McKay, who pointed to the increased effectiveness of the team’s “simpler” offense, saying that they were no longer “trying to do all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>people</b> said you have to do in this league”. On a strange NFL weekend in which O.J. Simpson was ejected from a game for fighting, the Chicago Bears lost a game due to a referee’s inadvertent whistle, and Minnesota Vikings receiver Sammy White fumbled away a touchdown due to starting his celebration before entering the end zone, McKay launched an obscenity-filled tirade against Denver Broncos coach John Ralston after a blowout loss. McKay admitted that his feelings dated back to their college rivalry, when McKay coached at USC and Ralston coached at Stanford University, but pointed to specific plays such as a reverse and a last-minute punt return as evidence that Ralston was trying to run up the score. Third-string running back Manfred Moore caught a lucky break when, waived after the week 13 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was picked up by the Oakland Raiders as an injury replacement for ex-Buccaneer Rick Jennings. He wound up going from an 0–13 team to the eventual Super Bowl champion. Players began to meet for postgame parties at Steve Spurrier’s house, in order to avoid having to show their faces in public. According to defensive end Pat Toomay, “By the time we got to the last game of the season, we had so many injuries that we didn’t feel we had much of a chance. Everybody was so sick of the season that they showed up packed and ready to get out of town. It looked like a bunch of Okies fleeing the dust bowl." [...] McKay said that the week 4 game against the Baltimore Colts summed up the season: “On one play I looked up and one of our guys was getting kicked out of the game, and two more were getting carried off”.|$|E

Linehan also said that, being a special event, the musical would {{need to focus on}} a [...] "world-shaking" [...] story, possibly with Ted becoming Pope due to [...] "some weird succession thing". In June, Linehan said that he hoped The Divine Comedy frontman Neil Hannon, who wrote the show's music, would return to compose the songs.|$|E

For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969 as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.|$|E
