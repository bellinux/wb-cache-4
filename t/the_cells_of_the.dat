5|$|The body's {{first line}} of defence against viruses is the innate immune system. This {{comprises}} cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner. This means that <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innate system recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic way, but, unlike the adaptive immune system, it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{adaptive}} {{immune system}} are special types of leukocytes, called lymphocytes. B cells and T cells are the major types of lymphocytes and are derived from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. B cells {{are involved in the}} humoral immune response, whereas T cells are involved in cell-mediated immune response.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some {{is bound to}} metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but {{in a form that}} lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E

5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{developmental}} biology ('Evo Devo') has assembled evidence from embryology and genetics {{to show how}} evolution has acted at all scales from the whole organism down to individual genes, proteins and genetic switches. In the case of countershaded mammals with dark (often brownish) upper parts and lighter (often buff or whitish) under parts, {{such as in the}} house mouse, it is the Agouti gene which creates the difference in shading. Agouti encodes for a protein, the Agouti signalling peptide (ASP), which specifically inhibits the action of the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). In the absence of the Agouti protein, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone stimulates the cells bearing MC1R, melanocytes, to produce dark eumelanin, colouring the skin and fur dark brown or black. In the presence of the Agouti protein, the same system produces the lighter-coloured, yellow or red phaeomelanin. A genetic switch active in <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> embryo that will become the belly skin causes the Agouti gene to become active there, creating the countershading seen in adult mammals.|$|E

5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} {{granular}} layer from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and granule cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the granule cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E

5|$|The {{duplication}} {{and transmission}} of genetic material {{from one generation}} of cells to the next {{is the basis for}} molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents' cells. In asexually reproducing organisms, the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism. In sexually reproducing organisms, a specialized form of cell division called meiosis produces cells called gametes or germ cells that are haploid, or contain only one copy of each gene. The gametes produced by females are called eggs or ova, and those produced by males are called sperm. Two gametes fuse to form a diploid fertilized egg, a single cell that has two sets of genes, with one copy of each gene from the mother and one from the father.|$|E
5|$|The well-characterized {{interactions}} between archaea and other organisms are either mutual or commensal. There are no clear examples of known archaeal pathogens or parasites. However, some species of methanogens {{have been suggested}} {{to be involved in}} infections in the mouth, and Nanoarchaeum equitans may be a parasite of another species of archaea, since it only survives and reproduces within <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crenarchaeon Ignicoccus hospitalis, and appears to offer no benefit to its host. In contrast, Archaeal Richmond Mine Acidophilic Nanoorganisms (ARMAN) occasionally connect with other archaeal cells in acid mine drainage biofilms. The nature of this relationship is unknown. However, it is distinct from that of Nanarchaeaum–Ignicoccus in that the ultrasmall ARMAN cells are usually seen independent of the Thermoplasmatales cells.|$|E
5|$|This {{process can}} be modeled by Rule 184, as follows. The {{particles}} are modeled as points that are aligned, not with <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automaton, but rather with the interstices between cells. Two consecutive cells that both have state 0 model a particle at the space between these two cells that moves rightwards one cell at each time step. Symmetrically, two consecutive cells that both have state 1 model an antiparticle that moves leftwards one cell at each time step. The remaining possibilities for two consecutive cells are that they both have differing states; this is interpreted as modeling a background material without any particles in it, through which the particles move. With this interpretation, the particles and antiparticles interact by ballistic annihilation: when a rightwards-moving particle and a leftwards-moving antiparticle meet, {{the result is a}} region of background from which both particles have vanished, without any effect on any other nearby particles.|$|E

5|$|When the {{adaptive}} immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus, it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and often render it non-infectious. This is called humoral immunity. Two types of antibodies are important. The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralising viruses but is produced by <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immune system {{only for a few}} weeks. The second, called IgG, is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past. IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the genetic makeup of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species. It {{has been suggested that}} it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria {{are less likely to be}} passed on to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E

5|$|Overdoses of {{ingested}} iron {{can cause}} excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High {{blood levels of}} free ferrous iron react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to <b>the</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, {{is one of the}} most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40mg/day.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{is connected}} by the brainstem to the spinal cord. The brainstem {{consists of the}} midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum {{is connected to the}} brainstem by pairs of tracts. Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system, consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including the amygdala and the hippocampus; the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia; the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain include neurons and supportive glial cells. There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and a more or less equal number of other cells. Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses. Neurons form elaborate neural networks of neural pathways and circuits. The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. <b>The</b> <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and epithelial cell rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E
