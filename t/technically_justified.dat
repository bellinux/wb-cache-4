40|$|In this paper, a novel {{adaptive}} {{strategy to}} obtain <b>technically</b> <b>justified</b> fault-ride-through requirements for wind turbines (WTs) is proposed. The main {{objective is to}} promote an effective integration of wind turbines into power systems with still low penetration levels of wind power based on technical and economical considerations. The level of requirement imposed by the strategy is increased stepwise over time, depending on system characteristics and on wind power penetration level. The idea behind is to introduce stringent requirements only when they are technically needed for a reliable and secure power system operation. Voltage stability support and fault-ride-through requirements are considered in the strategy. Simulations {{are based on the}} Chilean transmission network, a midsize isolated power system with still low penetration levels of wind power. Simulations include fixed speed induction generators and doubly fed induction generators. The effects on power system stability of the wind power injections, integrated into the network by adopting the adaptive strategy, are compared with the effects that have the same installed capacity of wind power but only considering WTs able to fulfill stringent requirements (fault-ride-through capability and support voltage stability).

Currently, centralized hot water supply systems are in an emergency condition {{due to the fact}} that the external networks are made of black pipes without anticorrosive coatings. A fundamental difference between hot water supply systems and heating systems is the nature of black metal corrosion. The purpose of this article is to conduct a research of the state of hot water supply systems and consider options for their recovery. The options suggested for restoration of hot water supply systems in cities and settlements of Ukraine are the following: complete replacement of failed networks with new pre-insulated plastic pipelines; refusal from external networks of centralized hot water supply systems and a central heat point with the installation of individual heat points in each house; decentralization of hot water supply systems by installing electric water heaters. A technical and economic comparison of these options is carried out, and the advantages and disadvantages of each option are considered. The arrangement of a set of individual heat points instead of one central point cannot be considered as the recommended method, because of the need for large additional costs for the reconstruction of heating, water supply and electricity supply systems.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{an example}} of the mutual influence of law, culture and politics, within the modes of the gothic and the sublime. In the context of eighteenth and early nineteenth-century English laws of adultery and of child custody, suppression of the woman's interest was <b>technically</b> <b>justified</b> by the existence of certain formal requirements, or certain presumptions; the resulting environment corresponded to a key trope of the "gothic" novel. That suggests the closeness of the link between such laws, some of which really originated in gothic law, and the development of the literary gothic, generically fascinated by ancestry and fraught with anxiety about the family, sexuality, and power. The core of the argument is an analysis of two texts which relate to a specific example, the rhetoric of the "criminal conversation" adultery action. Charlotte Dacre's notorious novel of 1806, Zofloya, or the Moor, can be read as a reaction, which takes its rhetoric of social damage to a catastrophic extreme.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the growing "divergence" {{in the field}} of surface metrology through the presentation of a practical system for unification. A technical and economic review of applied surface metrology is presented, highlighting the problems associated with the many advances in instrumentation - particularly in light of the growing industrial dependence on surface metrology. This background serves {{as the basis for the}} development of a scheme whereby surface specification, instrumentation, and analysis can be concisely and completely defined and, more importantly, controlled. Several technical aspects of surface metrology are addressed in the development of the scheme. First the topic of specification and reference geometries is addressed, where it is argued that least squares methods should provide the most stable basis for assessment. Stylus/radius convolution and the associated wavelength transmissions are also considered and experimental investigations are undertaken as to describe their influences on measured data sets. The treatment of unwanted asperities is investigated and a new, robust algorithm developed and presented. The study of wavelength limitation approaches concludes that a sub-set of current methods is technologically acceptable and therefore economically attractive. A review of parameterization concentrates on a means for selecting a "unified" set of parameters and guidelines for the incorporation of future parameters. Finally, it is shown that the this proposed scheme {{addresses the}} underlying divergence in surface metrology in a manner which is practical in the context of application, <b>technically</b> <b>justified</b> in the context of standardization, and extensible in the context of further research...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{contains}} definitions for {{a process}} and a methodology for restoration of parts {{on the basis}} of the analysis of the known methods and their selection. Geometric parameters and operational properties that should be provided for restoration of parts have been determined in the paper. A process for selection of the required method for restoration parts has been improved and it makes it possible to synthesize an optimal process of the restoration according to a criterion of industrial resource consumption with due account of quality, productivity and security limits. A justification on measures that meet the required limits has been presented in the paper. The paper shows a direction of technical solutions that ensure complete use of residual life of repair fund parts. These solutions can be achieved through close application of all repair sizes of work-pieces with revision of their values, uniform removal of the allowance while cutting the work-pieces at optimum locating, application of coating processes only in <b>technically</b> <b>justified</b> cases, application of straightening with thermal fixing of its results or all-around compression of deformable elements. The paper proposes to limit a number of overhauls for the units together with restoration of basic and fundamental parts by two repairs for the whole period of their lifetime. Number of shaft journal building-up should be limited by one building-up operation throughout the whole life cycle of the part with the purpose to preserve its length within the prescribed limits. It has been recommended to expand an application area of volumetric plastic deformation of material in the form of thermoplastic distribution or reduction of repair work-pieces representing class of rotation bodies with holes that ensures an allowance to machine external and internal surfaces for nominal dimensions without coating. A structure of the coating material with fine inclusions of carbides or nitrides of metals and preferred orientation of structural components perpendicular to the restored surface under the influence of heat removal has been established in the paper. Due to surface plastic deformation the structure orientates fiber axis tangentially in the direction of relative sliding that inhibits growth of fatigue radially oriented cracks. </p...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{materials}} and laying techniques have arisen the question how scratchesand indentations in plastics pipes affect the strength and technical lifetime of pipelines. Scratches may occur both in the manufacturing of the pipes, in connection with theinstallation and subsequent maintenance. The problems in assessing the failure risk fromscratches and indentations are similar for pipes used in gas and water distribution and indistrict heating applications. Therefore, a broad effort to identify the risks in relation tocurrent pipe materials is <b>technically</b> and economically <b>justified.</b> The project has aimed to evaluate the effect of scratches and indentations on the technicallifetime of plastics pipes and to present criteria for maximum allowable depth ofscratches and indentations. The study on pressure pipes focused on the conditions for scratched polyethylene pipes toachieve a lifetime of 50 years. It is noted that a scratch damage can not be judged solelyon {{the basis of its}} depth and sharpness. To assess the impact of the scratch on theserviceability of the pipe, consideration must also be taken to the material from which thepipe was made and the safety factor used in the design. Extensive pressure tests show thatpipes made of modern materials can withstand surface scratches to a higher degree thanpipes of older materials. For pipes made of modern bimodal PE 80 and PE 100 materials,scratches up to 10 % depth may be accepted without reduction of rated pressure. However,for pipes of older material, a reduction in pressure may be required already at smallerscratches. The study also indicates that for the same relative scratch depth, a greaterreduction in pressure is required with increasing pipe dimension. The study on the non pressure pipes shows that the studied polypropylene pipes resistboth deep scratches combined with ovalization and large indentations without any crackspenetrating the pipe wall. However, the extent and development of crazing and surfacecracking vary with scratch depth, deformation level and material. The test pipes weresubjected to extreme conditions very rarely or never occurring in practice. This suggeststhat small scratches at moderate ovalization and realistic indentations in temperaturesaround room temperature do not affect the lifetime of the pipes. One objective of the project was to develop a method for the evaluation of the scratchresistance of a pipe. In the proposed test method the force needed to produce a specifiedscratch is measured. This force is used as a relative measure of the scratch resistance of apipe material when compared to other materials. In order to assess to what extent a scratch affects the lifetime of the pipe, the depth of thescratch must be estimated with reasonable accuracy. Since the scratch in many cases isfound on existing pipelines the method must be suited for field use. To achieve that asimple instrument for scratch depth measurements was made and evaluated.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find out whether {{technical}} or economic aspects justify the development of cryoresistive cables. Naturally cooled cables will not be able to transmit the amounts of power that will be in the future in the congestion areas. The installation of overhead lines or parallel conventional cables will not be possible because of the growing lack of space for the cable trenches. Consequently, the development of advanced-power-cables should already be started now. The solution of the problem, whether the use of a cable, especially of a cryocable, is <b>technically</b> and economically <b>justified,</b> depends on the construction of the cable, on the materials which are used, and on the cooling machinery. For economic reasons aluminium or perhaps copper will be the preferred material for the conductors. Thecooling liquid can be practically only liquid nitrogen. The study discusses six kinds of electrical insulations, three variations of the flow of the cooling medium, two possibilities for the arrangement of electrical and thermal insulation and some kinds of conductor constructions. Altogether there are 504 theoretical conceivable cable concepts. Taking certain selection criteria as basis, three principal concepts which promise the most success have been selected from these concepts. By furthervariation three definite cable concepts are obtained for one of the solutions, so that totally in this study five cable concepts are discussed in detail. The two cryocables which have been under development in the USA for some years now are included in these concepts. At a nominal voltage of 110 kV and 15 km distance between thecooling stations the limit is about 1000 to 1500 MVA, at 380 kV and the same distance about 4000 to 5000 MVA. At smaller distances the power limits are correspondingly higher. In addition for each cryocable concept the transmission costs per km cable length and per MVA power rating are determined in variation with the diameter of the cable, the distance between cooling stations and the transmitted power. The formula used for the costs takes into account the capital cost of the cable, termination and fitting costs, including installation, civil engineering, cooling stations and costs of power losses, i. e. the costs for the electrical losses in thecable and the energy costs for the cooling stations. All the costs are determined according to uniform criteria. The used cost-formula allows for the standard utility-load. The results show that at maximum load the capital costs of the cooling stations and the costs of power-losses yield the biggest contribution to the total costs. Whereas the cost of the cable itself can be determined relatively accurately, there are greater uncertainties with respect to the capital cost and the efficiency of the cooling stations because plants have not yet been built for such an application. The accuracy of the calculated transmission costs is therefore determined on the basis of these uncertainties. In order to make a comparison with conventional cables, the costs of conventional cables buried directly and in cooling-water-ducts were computed with the same formulas and the same assumptions as for cryocables. The limits of power tx'ansmission-capability and the transmission costs fo cryocables and conventional cables that have been found are in close agreement with the corresponding data which are cited in a recently published study of A. D. Little entitled"Underground Power Transmission". Within the accuracy which is nowadays possible in such a calculation it is found that all the five cable concepts can competewith the present cable systems. The following advantages may be important for the justification of the development of cryocables: the width of the cable trench related to the power rating is considerably less compared with conventional cables (see Fig. 8. 1) - by stepswise uprating of the installed cooling-stations the transmission capability can be adapted to the growing demand. - a multiplication of the transmission-capability is possible, if more cooling stations are installed in thecourse of the line. even operating at the maximum continous load, a cryocable can sustain a substantially higher short-time overload compared to a conventional cable because of its high heat capacity. Although we expect no unsurmöuntable obstacles in the development of the cable concept which are considered to be promising, some important problems have to be solved, for example, the design of the electrical insulation, favourable construction of the conductor, shielding and piping for low eddy current losses and so on (see chapter 4. 2. 8). The data worked out in this study show that the cross-sections of cryocables will be large compared to conventional cables...|$|R
