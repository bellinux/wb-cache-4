5|$|Busch {{made contact}} with the artist {{association}} Jung München (Young Munich), met several notable Munich artists, and wrote and provided cartoons for the Jung München newspaper. Kaspar Braun, who published the satirical newspapers Münchener Bilderbogen (Picture Sheets from Munich) and Fliegende Blätter (Flying Leaves), proposed a collaboration with Busch. This association provided Busch with sufficient funds to live. An existing self-caricature suggests {{that at this time}} he had an intense relationship with a woman from Ammerland. His courtship with a seventeen-year-old merchant's daughter, Anna Richter, whom Busch met through his brother Gustav, ended in 1862. Busch's biographer, Diers, suggests that her father probably refused to entrust his daughter <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> unknown artist without regular income.|$|E

5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, and it would not be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with all}} {{elements}} having atomic weights {{higher than that}} of iron, it is only naturally formed in supernovae. Primordial thorium and uranium are only produced in the r-process (rapid neutron capture), because the s-process (slow neutron capture) is too slow and cannot pass the gap of instability after bismuth. Besides the two extant primordial uranium isotopes, 235U and 238U, the r-process also produced significant quantities of 236U, which has a shorter half-life and has long since decayed completely to 232Th, which was itself enriched by the decay of 244Pu, accounting for the observed higher-than-expected abundance of thorium and lower-than-expected abundance of uranium. While the natural abundance of uranium has been supplemented by the decay of extinct 242Pu (half-life 0.375millionyears) and 247Cm (half-life 16millionyears), producing 238U and 235U respectively, this occurred <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> negligible extent due to the shorter half-lives of these parents and their lower production than 236U and 244Pu, the parents of thorium: the 247Cm:235U ratio at the formation of the Solar System was (7.0 ± 1.6) × 10−5.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} that the King would be succeeded by his daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of William of Orange, Stadtholder of the Netherlands, but when in 1688, James produced a male heir, James Francis Edward Stuart, {{it was clear that}} his policies would outlive him. An invitation by seven leading Englishmen led William to land in England with 40,000 men on 5 November. In Edinburgh there were rumours of Orange plots and on 10 December the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, the Earl of Perth, quit the capital for Drummond Castle, planning an abortive escape to Ireland (he was later captured as he embarked for France). As rioters approached Holyrood Abbey they were fired on by soldiers, resulting in some deaths. The city guard was called out, but the Abbey was stormed by a large mob. The Catholic furnishings placed there when it was restored as a chapel for James were torn down and the tombs of the Stuart kings desecrated. A crowd of students burnt the Pope in effigy and took down the heads of executed Covenanters that were hanging above the city gates. The crisis was resolved when James fled from England on 23 December, leading <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> bloodless revolution. Although there had been no significant Scottish involvement in the coup, most members of the Scottish Privy Council went to London to offer their services to William. On 7 January 1689, they asked William to take over the responsibilities of government.|$|E

Patients who do not respond to compression are less likely to fare well with LVA, as a greater amount of their increased extremity volume consists of fibrotic tissue, protein or fat.

In retirement he was highly critical of regimes such as Sukarno's Indonesia which confiscated assets belonging to their former colonial rulers, and appears to have reverted somewhat to the right-wing views which he had espoused in the 1920s.|$|E

The 11th Air Assault Division (Test) was activated in February 1963 specifically to test the concept, and its commander (Major General Harry Kinnard) was given a great deal of control over the unit's organization and training (from selecting officers for command positions <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> unlimited budget and scope of operations). Over the next two years, Kinnard's division conducted a number of exercises and maneuvers to demonstrate that airmobility was practical and flexible enough to meet the vision of the board's final report.|$|E
25|$|Hormones {{also have}} activational effects on singing {{and the song}} nuclei in adult birds. In {{canaries}} (Serinus canaria), females normally sing less often and with less complexity than males. However, when adult females are given androgen injections, their singing will increase <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> male-like frequency. Furthermore, adult females injected with androgens also show an increased size in the HVC and RA regions. Melatonin is another hormone that is also believed to influence song behavior in adults, as many songbirds show melatonin receptors in neurons of the song nuclei. Both the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and house sparrow (Passer domesticus) have demonstrated changes in song nuclei correlated with differing exposures to darkness and secretions of melatonin. This suggests that melatonin might {{play a role in}} the seasonal changes of singing behavior in songbirds that live in areas where the amount of daylight varies significantly throughout the year. Several other studies have looked at seasonal changes in the morphology of brain structures within the song system and have found that these changes (adult neurogenesis, gene expression) are dictated by photoperiod, hormonal changes and behavior.|$|E
25|$|In the X-Men film series, Magneto {{is portrayed}} by Ian McKellen (original iteration) and by Michael Fassbender (younger self). His {{character}} {{development in the}} films is directly influenced by the African American human rights leader Malcolm X. The character's pre-teen versions were portrayed by Brett Morris (in X-Men) and by Bill Milner (in X-Men: First Class). His real name is Erik Magnus Lehnsherr, {{which at the time}} was his name in the comics, and was a holocaust survivor. Though he was good friends with Charles Xavier, his objective to ensure mutant prosperity but only so long as he remains in control of it. In the X-Men films, Magneto's resistance to mental attack does not stem from his own natural powers but from his helmet which is made of a psychic shielding component. Having taken the helmet from Shaw, Magneto is rendered immune to any form of telepathy and mind control as seen in the first two film entries. His powers are much more limited when compared to his depiction in comics. Whereas he's displayed controlling magnetism <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>almost</b> unlimited degree in the comics, he is generally restricted to manipulating metal within the films. Throughout the films, despite being at odds with Xavier, Magneto displays great care towards his old friend while acknowledging his contributions to mutant kind. Magneto appears in seven of the nine X-Men films up to 2016.|$|E
