5|$|Having {{managed to}} quietly depose their father, the {{brothers}} {{now had to}} deal with Constantine VII. Unfortunately for them, rumours soon spread around Constantinople, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that,</b> following Romanos's deposition, Constantine VII's life was in danger. Before long, crowds gathered before the palace, demanding to see their emperor in person. The contemporary Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona notes that the ambassadors and envoys from Amalfi, Gaeta, Rome, and Provence present in the capital also supported Constantine VII. Stephen and his brother had to succumb to the inevitable, recognizing their brother-in-law as the senior emperor.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} and discusses the {{theoretical and empirical}} literature <b>that</b> analyses <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of monetary policy on financial stability. As a means to clarifi- cation and structure, the thesis will build on the IMF (2013) approach of separating <b>the</b> different <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> monetary policy may have on financial stability. These effects are divided into five different channels. In a literature review, these channels are carefully examined, {{and many of the}} most important contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> litera- ture are presented. In short, the borrower balance sheet channel refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> higher monetary policy rates may have on borrowing constraints and therefore possibly on default rates. The asset price channel refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> lower monetary policy rates may have on aggregate asset prices that might lead to asset price bubbles. The exchange rate channel points <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> monetary policy may have on capital flows and exchange rates, and therefore on foreign borrowing. The risk-shifting channel refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>that</b> higher monetary policy rates have on the liability side of banks balance sheets, possibly reducing banks margins. Fi- nally, the risk-taking channel refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> potential <b>effects</b> of monetary policy on the asset side of banks balance sheets, which may affect banks risk-taking. The second part of the thesis provides an empirical analysis of a potential risk- taking channel in Norway. By making use of quarterly panel data for Norwegian banks over <b>the</b> period 1995 <b>to</b> 2014, I study <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of an increased three-month NIBOR interest rate, as a proxy for Norwegian monetary policy, on the composition of banks risk weighted corporate lending. The results provide evidence of a risk- taking channel. Thus, the results from the analysis suggest that banks risk-taking is negatively associated with interest rates. However, since the estimated interest rate coefficient is quite small, the economic significance seems modest. I also find evidence of a less pronounced negative relationship for banks with higher capitalization levels, which is contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> implications suggested by the theory as well as previous empirical findings in other countries. This literature suggests that the negative relationship is less pronounced for banks with lower capitalization levels. The results from the empirical analysis may contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ongoing debate on the role of monetary policy on financial stability. However, the analysis also clearly indicates a need of further investigation...|$|R

5|$|A second scandal {{occurred}} in 1936 when Blamey attempted {{to cover up}} details of the shooting of the superintendent of the Criminal Investigation Branch, John O'Connell Brophy, whom Blamey had appointed to the post. The story put about was that Brophy had taken two women friends and a chauffeur along with him to a meeting with a police informant. While {{they were waiting for}} the informant, they had been approached by armed bandits, and Brophy had opened fire and had himself been wounded. In order to cover up the identities of the two women involved, Blamey initially issued a press release <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that</b> Brophy had accidentally shot himself (three times). The Premier, Albert Dunstan, gave Blamey the choice of resigning or being dismissed. The latter meant the loss of pension rights and any future prospects of employment in the Public Service or the Army. He reluctantly submitted his resignation on 9 July 1936.|$|E
5|$|As Germany's {{military}} and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took {{the lives of thousands}} of people. Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that</b> further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.|$|E
5|$|George IV {{spent most}} of his later reign in {{seclusion}} at Windsor Castle, but he continued to intervene in politics. At first it was believed that he would support Catholic emancipation, as he had proposed a Catholic Emancipation Bill for Ireland in 1797, but his anti-Catholic views became clear in 1813 when he privately canvassed against the ultimately defeated Catholic Relief Bill of 1813. By 1824 he was denouncing Catholic emancipation in public. Having taken the coronation oath on his accession, George now argued that he had sworn to uphold the Protestant faith, and could not support any pro-Catholic measures. The influence of the Crown was so great, and the will of the Tories under Prime Minister Lord Liverpool so strong, that Catholic emancipation seemed hopeless. In 1827, however, Lord Liverpool retired, to be replaced by the pro-emancipation Tory George Canning. When Canning entered office, the King, hitherto content with privately instructing his ministers on the Catholic Question, thought it fit to make a public declaration <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that</b> his sentiments on the question were those of his revered father, George III.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{aggressive}} tactics of Haywood and the IWW, {{along with their}} call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism created tension with moderate electorally-oriented leaders of the Socialist Party.

When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that</b> he had never advocated {{the use of the}} ballot by the workers but had instead favored the tactics of direct action, an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee of the Socialist Party of New York.

Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks of the Socialist Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.|$|E
5|$|Krueger did not {{immediately}} give Martin permission for such an operation. There was still the possibility of Japanese attack, and the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming Hansa Bay operation. On 20 January, a visiting staff officer from Alamo Force was asked to raise the possibility with Krueger. However, on 21 January Martin received a letter stating that {{the mission of the}} Michaelmas Task Force remained unchanged and a radiogram was received on 22 January <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that</b> this was not consistent with Krueger's wishes. On 8 February, Martin received a garbled radiogram from Krueger that indicated that the earlier restrictive message of 22 January had itself been garbled, and on 9 February a radiogram was received authorising offensive action. Plans were immediately made but on 10 February contact was made with elements of the Australian 5th Division, which had relieved the 9th Division on 20 January.

It is unknown, if she was alive when her son, Pericles, was elected general or when he was executed after the Battle of Arginusae. The time of her death that most historians give (c. 401 BC-400 BC) is based on the assessment that Aspasia died before the execution of Socrates in 399 BC, a chronology which is implied in the structure of Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{soon began}} {{detecting}} signs of preparations {{for a new}} convoy. A Japanese floatplane of the type normally used for anti-submarine patrols in advance of convoys was sighted on 7 February 1943. The Allied Air Forces South West Pacific Area commander – Lieutenant General George Kenney – ordered an increase in reconnaissance patrols over Rabaul. On 14 February, aerial photographs were taken that showed 79 vessels in port, including 45 merchant ships and six transports. It was clear that another convoy was being prepared, but its destination was unknown. On 16 February, naval codebreakers in Melbourne (FRUMEL) and Washington, D.C. finished decrypting and translating a coded message revealing the Japanese intention to land convoys at Wewak, Madang and Lae. Subsequently, codebreakers decrypted {{a message from the}} Japanese 11th Air Fleet <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that</b> destroyers and six transports would reach Lae about 5 March.

5|$|There is some {{authority}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that</b> a {{court will}} not generally grant a declaration if it considers {{the issue at}} hand to be an academic question or one that is entirely hypothetical. For instance, in Vince v. Chief Constable of Dorset Police (1992), proceedings against the Chief Constable of Dorset Police were brought by the plaintiffs on behalf of members of the Police Federation of England and Wales to, among other things, enable chief constables throughout the country to know where they stood on a question of law with respect to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, namely, whether it was unlawful to appoint an acting sergeant as a custody officer under section 36(3) of the Act. Affirming the decision of the judge below, a majority of the Court of Appeal declined to make a declaration on the matter. It took the view that since {{there was no evidence that}} any chief constable had ever appointed an acting sergeant as a custody officer, the issue was academic or hypothetical.|$|E
5|$|Dowding saw 12 Group as the {{protector}} of the Midlands and a reserve for 11 Group. Mallory and Bader wanted to ignore both the defence of the Midlands and keeping a reserve in order to commit 12 Group to battle. In essence, they proposed the opposite of Dowding and resolved to commit the reserves before the front-line units. While this method might have spared 11 Group, it had its problems. Although Mallory and Bader wanted to stop the enemy before it hit RAF airfields, {{the amount of time}} it took to position large formations for interception meant that the Big Wing often failed to achieve this. Instead, they engaged the enemy as he withdrew. Prompted by a supporting comment from Leigh-Mallory, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that</b> it did not matter when an interception was made, as long as it accounted for a large number of enemy aircraft, Bader announced that he would rather destroy 50 German bombers after hitting their targets than 10 before. The argument was strong; crippling losses would act as a deterrent, so that damage sustained on an occasion when the Germans did get through would have to be offset against later occasions when they did not even care to try.|$|E

5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that</b> some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009, a {{group of}} {{consumers}} filed the class action suits Owens v. Apple, Inc. and Johnson v. Apple Inc. against Apple on behalf of American individuals who purchased iTunes gift cards and who were then unable to use the cards to purchase iTunes music at the price advertised on the card because Apple raised {{the price of the}} music after it sold the cards to consumers. The Johnson case absorbed the Owens case and was settled on February 10, 2012, with payments to be made to consumers by Apple. The Owens complaint alleged that Apple wrongfully marketed, distributed, and sold iTunes gift cards and songs through its online iTunes store, while representing that consumers could use the gift cards to purchase songs for US$.99 a song and then, after such gift cards were purchased, raised the price on certain songs to $1.29 on April 7, 2009. The lawsuit's allegations included that Apple's conduct constituted breach of contract, violated the state consumer fraud statute, and violated consumer protection statutes of other states. The plaintiffs sought a $.30 refund remedy for each song that class members purchased using a $.99 iTunes card for which they were charged $1.29, plus their attorneys' fees and costs. Apple mounted a vigorous defense and sought to dismiss the suit but lost its motion in December 2009. Individuals are part of the class of plaintiffs if they are U.S. residents who purchased or received an iTunes Gift Card on which the card itself or its packaging contained language <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that</b> songs were priced at $0.99 and who used the card to purchase one or more $1.29 songs from the iTunes Store on or before May 10, 2010.

5|$|In October 1857 the inquisitor of Bologna, a Dominican friar called Father Pier Gaetano Feletti, {{learned of}} rumours <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>that</b> a secret baptism had been {{administered}} {{to one of}} the city's Jewish children by a Catholic servant. If true, this would make the child a Catholic {{in the eyes of the}} Church—a fact with secular as well as spiritual ramifications since the Church stance was that children they considered to be Christians could not be raised by non-Christians, and should be taken from their parents in such circumstances. Cases like this were not uncommon in 19th-century Italy, and often revolved around the baptism of a Jewish child by a Christian servant. The official Church position was that Catholics should not baptise Jewish children without the parents' consent, except if a child was on the brink of death—in these cases the Church considered the customary deferment to parental authority to be outweighed by the importance of allowing the child's soul to be saved and go to Heaven, and permitted baptism without the parents' assent. Many Jewish families feared clandestine baptisms by their Christian maids; to counter this perceived threat some households required Christians leaving their employment to sign notarised statements confirming that they had never baptised any of the children.|$|E
