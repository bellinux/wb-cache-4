Alexandra and Alexei sat in chairs provided by guards at the Empress's request. After several minutes, the guards entered the room, led by Yurovsky, who quickly informed the Tsar and his family that they were to be executed.

The rest of the Imperial retinue were shot in short order, with the exception of Anna Demidova, Alexandra's maid.
