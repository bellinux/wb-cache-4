5|$|At the {{northeast}} corner of Cross and River Streets stands the Thompson Block, a historic building which was used as barracks in the Civil War. The Thompson Block suffered a bad fire early in the morning on September 23, 2009, and the temporary supports reaching into adjacent streets, installed shortly after the fire to stabilize the structure, blocked westbound traffic on Cross Street for more than three months and have resulted in legal tussles between the city and <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>owner.</b>|$|E
5|$|D Charitable Foundation was {{established}} by Borislow in 1997 with a $21 million stock donation. In the first two years, he tried to use the charity to buy and preserve a tract of land in New Hope, Pennsylvania. This venture failed in 1998 when <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> declined Borislow's offer. Following this, D made donations to the Clearwater Endoscopy Center and the Center for Digestive Healthcare in Clearwater, Florida until 2001. Since then, it has issued varied grants to causes Borislow supported, such as $2.75 million to two yeshivas and $173,450 to a West Palm Beach, Florida private school. Tax records indicate that Borislow and George Farley, {{the chief financial officer}} of the non-profit, split approximately $2.1 million in profits from 2001-2005, while $1.6 million went to charitable causes. Borislow drew criticism in 2007 when he paid himself $1.7 million through the charity.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, {{members of}} the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit {{conducted}} a measured survey of the monument. In 2005, Ashbee noted {{that he had found}} evidence of recent metal detectoring activity at the site. On 15 May 2007, the Kentish archaeologist Brian Philp was conducting his regular inspection of the monument when <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>owner,</b> Mrs Bygrave, pointed out to him an area where the road was beginning to subside. He alerted Kent County Council, who organised for contractors to investigate the reason for the subsidence, which proved to be decades of rabbit burrowing beneath the tarmac. Archaeologists from Kent Archaeological Unit visited the site during the work, discovering a buried sarsen; comparison with older records revealed that this stone had once been upright but had been buried where it stood in the 19th century by workmen who were replacing the trackway with a paved road.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} was constructed pursuant {{to an agreement}} between the General Services Administration (GSA) and Boston developer David Nassif, Sr. In July 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson began planning to unite various disparate transportation agencies into a new United States Department of Transportation. GSA (<b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> and manager for the U.S. federal government) began seeking to lease or build a structure to house the new agency in late 1965. Donald T. Kirwan, chief of GSA's leasing division, knew Nassif from a previous lease negotiation, and discussed with him the siting of a building and its size. Nassif approached the RLA on April 21, 1966, and asked to buy the newly razed block of land bounded by 6th, 7th, D, and E Streets SW. In May 1967, GSA {{sent a letter to}} Nassif advising him that it was likely to lease the entire structure he intended to build. The $5.9 million land purchase was finalized on October 30, 1967. The cost of the structure is unclear. On November 15, 1967, Nassif had secured a $39 million construction loan. But The Washington Post pegged the cost of the building at $27 million in July 1968. The newspaper said in August 1970 that the cost of the structure was $26.5 million. The {{building was}} designed by architect Edward Durrell Stone, who also designed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. On April 11, 1968, GSA leased the entire building from Nassif for 20 years for $98 million. John A. Volpe Construction was the chief contractor.|$|E

25|$|When {{the matter}} {{came before the}} Confederate court, <b>the</b> <b>{{property}}</b> <b>owner</b> could not appear because {{he was unable to}} travel across the front lines between Union and Confederate forces. Thus, the District Attorney won the case by default, the property was typically sold, and the money used to further the Southern war effort. Eventually, because there was no Confederate Supreme Court, sharp attorneys like South Carolina's Edward McCrady began filing appeals. This prevented their clients' property from being sold until a supreme court could be constituted to hear the appeal, which never occurred. Where Federal troops gained control over parts of the Confederacy and re-established civilian government, US district courts sometimes resumed jurisdiction.|$|E

25|$|Introduced as Senate Bill 520 {{and signed}} into law in December 1972, this {{legislation}} was originally known as the Alquist-Priolo Geologic Hazard Zones Act, and had the goal of reducing damage and losses due to surface fault ruptures or fault creep. The act restricts construction of buildings designed for human occupancy across potentially active faults. Since it is presumed that surface rupture will likely take place where past surface displacement has occurred, the state geologist was given the responsibility for evaluating and mapping faults that had evidence of Holocene rupture, and creating regulatory zones around them called Earthquake Fault Zones. State and local agencies (as well as <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>owner)</b> were then responsible for enforcing or complying with the building restrictions.|$|E
25|$|Before the Hatlestad Slide, Norway {{maintained}} a liberal policy {{when it came}} to housing construction on hills. The area of the afflicted housing units were therefore not surveyed for landslide risk before construction was commenced in the sixties, and the risk of landslides did not become known until later. After construction was finished, there were several incidents of rocks dislodging from the cliff and hitting the road. The rocks did not cause material damage or personal injury, and the municipality took no action besides setting up a warning sign by the road. Despite repeated complaints from Hatlestad's residents about this problem and the general risk of landslides, the municipality did not secure the area, stating that securing land against landslides is the responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>owner.</b> However, an order given to the property owners to secure the hill were never responded to, and the case was never resolved.|$|E
25|$|The New York City guide Preventing Rats on Your Property {{discusses}} how the NYC Health Department, {{through its}} Pest Control Services program, inspects {{private and public}} properties for rats. Property owners that fail an inspection receive a Health Department Commissioner's Order and have five days to correct the problem. If after five days the property fails a second inspection, the owner receives a Notice of Violation and can be fined. If the Health Department feels it must itself exterminate or clean up the property, <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>owner</b> is billed (about $1,000 a day in 2004). Unpaid charges become a priority lien against the building, preventing property owners from selling with a clean legal title. Failure to comply with an order of the Commissioner is a misdemeanor, and subjects the landlord to criminal prosecution, a fine and/or imprisonment, as well as additional civil penalties. The penalty for each rodent violation was as high as $2,000 in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Second, in {{situations}} where multiple parties hold <b>the</b> <b>property</b> rights, Coasean bargaining often fails because of the holdout problem.
