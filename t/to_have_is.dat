25|$|In 2016, a North Carolina {{woman said}} that DNA testing by the Toronto-based company Accu-Metrics showed that she, her mother, {{and her brother}} have Beothuk DNA. Geneticists have {{challenged}} the company's claim as bogus, both because the database it claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> non-existent, and because previous analyses of the only reference Beothuk DNA available, from Nonosabasut and his wife Demasduit, show that it is far too fragmentary to make such an identification. The company suspended its claims after being challenged by geneticists and news media.|$|E

(3) Failure to act. A person responsible for the welfare of a child who has not attained the age of 16 years is guilty of a Class F felony if that person has knowledge that another person intends <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> <b>is</b> having or has had sexual intercourse or sexual contact with the child, is physically and emotionally capable of taking action which will prevent the intercourse or contact from taking place or being repeated, fails to take that action and the failure to act exposes the child to an unreasonable risk that intercourse or contact may occur between the child and the other person or facilitates the intercourse or contact that does occur between the child and the other person.|$|E

2500|$|The {{gap between}} the two gender titles is a direct {{response}} to the gender bias within India. Men and women in India have unequal health and education rights. Male education and health are made more of a priority, so women’s death rates are increasing. The argument continues that a lack of independence that women are not allowed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> a large contributor to these fatalities. Women in India have high fertility and get married at a young age. Those who are given more opportunity and rights are more likely to live longer and contribute to the economy rather than that of a women expected to serve as wife starting at a young age and continuing the same responsibilities {{for the rest of her}} life. As women continue to [...] "disappear," [...] the sex ratio turns its favor toward men. In turn, this offsets reproduction and does not allow for a controlled reproductive trend. While the excess mortality of women is relatively high, it cannot be blamed completely for the unequal sex ratio in India. However, it is a large contributor considering the precedence that Indian men have over women.|$|E

60|$|We {{talked a}} good deal with Mr. Poplington about the hotels of Buxton, and we had agreed to go to one called the Old Hall, where we are now. There was a good many reasons why we chose this house, one being {{that it was not}} as {{expensive}} as some of the others, though very nice; and another, which had {{a good deal}} of force with me, was, that Mary Queen of Scots came here for her rheumatism, and the room she used <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> still kept, with some words she scratched with her diamond ring on the window-pane. Sometimes people coming to this hotel can get this room, and I was mighty sorry we couldn't do it, but it was taken. If I could have actually lived and slept in a room which had belonged to the beautiful Mary Queen of Scots, I would have been willing to have just as much rheumatism as she had when she was here.|$|E

Still there are, in every age, a few souls that all the wants and woes of life cannot debase to selfishness, or even to the necessary alloy of caution and prudence. If ever I am in danger of vanity, it is when I contemplate myself on this side of my disposition and character. God knows I am no saint; I have a whole host of follies and sins to answer for; but if I could--and I believe I do it as far as I can--I would wipe away all tears from all eyes. Adieu! ...|$|E
