Katie tells Grace that The Today Show is having massive {{televised}} weddings in the park for ratings sweeps week. When Katie asks Grace and Leo if they would like to get married, Leo says yes, but Grace believes he is being sarcastic, only later realizing that he is serious.

Leo proposes and Grace accepts, despite that the two have only known each other for two months.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} sacrament of {{confirmation}} as required to complete the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they {{are old enough to}} understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by {{the sacrament of}} Penance; <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.|$|E
5|$|The Storm {{was always}} going to go with the colours of their state, Victoria (Navy blue with a white 'V'), but club {{consultant}} at the time, Peter McWhirter of the JAG fashion house, suggested that <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> have purple and gold to make their merchandise more attractive. These colours appear in the logo, however, on the home jersey they have varied. Between 1998 and 2004 these four colours also appeared but between 2005 and 2009, gold was completely removed and silver introduced. Between 2010–2012, gold returned and silver was omitted, purple also became the dominant colour in the jersey. For 2013 a new design was announced featuring a deeper V, with more navy blue in the jersey, gold disappeared along with most of the white, the lightning bolts were also changed to purple. During 2015 the jersey changed again for the first time not featuring a V at all, but the V returned somewhat along with the lightning bolts in 2016 with a manufacturer change. Over the years and in all variations of the Jersey, Navy Blue and Purple always remain the main colours.|$|E

25|$|But it was Philip's son Alexander the Great {{who made}} the divinity of kings {{standard}} practice among the Greeks.

25|$|Surgery was {{formally}} taught in Italy {{even though it}} was initially looked down upon as a lower form of medicine. The most important figure of the formal learning of surgery was Guy de Chauliac.

Not only should surgeons have knowledge about the body but <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> be well versed in the liberal arts.

25|$|After the Compromise of 1850 allowed California {{into the}} Union {{as a free}} state while {{permitting}} Utah and New Mexico territories the option of deciding the issue by popular sovereignty, the Utah Territorial Legislature took {{up the issue of}} legalizing slavery. At that time, Brigham Young was governor, and the Utah Territorial Legislature was dominated by church leaders. In 1852, Brigham Young addressed the joint session of the legislature advocating slavery. He made the matter religious by declaring that if members of the church believe in the Bible and the priesthood then <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> believe in slavery. Following the speech, the Utah Legislature passed an Act in Relation to Service, which officially sanctioned slavery in Utah Territory. The Utah slavery law stipulated that slaves would be freed if their masters had sexual relations with them; attempted to take them from the territory against their will; or neglected to feed, clothe, or provide shelter to them. In addition, the law stipulated that slaves must receive schooling.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Gee {{also argues}} that reading and writing {{should be viewed as}} more than just “mental achievements” {{happening}} inside people’s minds; <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>also</b> be seen as “social and cultural practices with economic, historical, and political implications”. So, in Gee’s view, literacies are not only multiple but are inherently connected to social practices. In order to expand the traditional view of literacy as print literacy, Gee recommends that we think first of literacy in terms of semiotic domains. By this, he means “any set of practices that recruits one or more modalities (e.g., oral or written language, images, equations, symbols, sounds, gestures, graphs, artifacts, etc.) to communicate distinctive types of meanings”. There is a seemingly endless and varied range of semiotic domains, including (but certainly not limited to) cellular biology, first-person-shooter video games, rap music, or modernist painting. Most pundits would describe this conception of literacies as a key element in {{what has come to be}} known as the New Literacy Studies. In short, this theoretical and methodological orientation emphasizes studying language-in-use and literacies within their contexts of social practice. It includes work by colleagues such as Brian Street, Gunther Kress, David Barton, Mary Hamilton, Courtney Cazden, Ron Scollon, and Suzie Scollon, among others.|$|E
