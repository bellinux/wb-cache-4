5|$|A {{centre of}} {{religious}} discussions called Anubhava Mantapa ("Hall of experience") in Kalyani became the conclave where devotees gathered {{to discuss their}} mystic experiences. Here, they expressed their devotion to Shiva in simple poems called Vachanas. These were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical and satirical prose emphasising the worthlessness of riches, rituals and book learning. Many of these poems are anonymous, but <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>are</b> identifiable by the unique divine name of the god Shiva that is invoked in the poem.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh {{published}} The Messianic Legacy, {{a sequel}} to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. The authors assert that the Priory of Sion {{is not only the}} archetypal cabal but an ideal repository of the cultural legacy of Jewish messianism that could end the “crisis of meaning” within the Western world by providing a Merovingian sacred king as a messianic figure in which the West and, by extension, humanity can place its trust. However, <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>are</b> led to believe by Plantard that he has resigned as Grand Master of the Priory of Sion in 1984 and that the organisation has since gone underground in reaction to both an internal power struggle between Plantard and an “Anglo-American contingent” as well as a campaign of character assassination against Plantard in the press and books written by skeptics.|$|E

John Cooper reviewed the encyclopedia for The Times, and described it as [...] "an entertaining compilation of ideas ranging from who was the 'real William Shakespeare' to the BCCI case and al-Qaeda". Cooper noted, [...] "The most fascinating section relates to 'Assassinations'... an unusual fairytale book for Christmas." [...] Martin Samuel gave a more critical review of the encyclopedia for The Times, commenting, [...] "For all the encyclopedia's pretence at sifting the evidence in search of a verdict, if the truth is out there, <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>are</b> damned if they can find it." ...|$|E

500|$|For Ivar Lødemel and Heather Trickey, {{editors of}} An Offer You Can't Refuse': Workfare in International Perspective, {{workfare}} programmes' reliance on compulsion makes them throffers. Citing the Danish model as a particular example, the pair argue that workfare {{involves the use}} of compulsory offers; while the work or education is presented as an offer, because recipients of welfare are dependent upon the help they would lose if they refuse the offer, they effectively have no choice. The compulsive aspect reveals that at least some recipients of welfare, in the eyes of policy makers, require coercion before they will accept offers of work. Neither the chance of paid work nor participation in labour schemes are, alone, enough to encourage some to freely accept the offers they receive. Such compulsion serves to reintegrate people into the labour market, and serves as a kind of [...] "new paternalism". <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> <b>are</b> concerned about this compulsion, and present several arguments against it which are possible or have been utilised in the literature: Firstly, it impacts the rights of those against whom it is used. This may make it objectionable in and of itself, or it may result in undesirable outcomes. Secondly, {{it can be argued that}} benefits must be unconditional in order to act as a genuine safety net. Thirdly, compulsion undermines consumer feedback, and so no differentiation can be made between good and poor programmes presented to those receiving welfare. Fourthly, such coercion may contribute to a culture of resistance among those receiving welfare.|$|E

2500|$|David R. Henderson wrote a {{generally}} positive review in Regulation but criticized the authors for inconsistency {{when talking about}} a central government's role in promoting development. In {{some parts of the}} book, the authors attribute the failure of the states like Afghanistan, Haiti and Nepal to the lack of a strong central government that imposes rule and order. However, {{in other parts of the}} book, the authors seem to embrace weak government for growth, as in the example of Somalia after losing its central government. In addition, Henderson asserts the authors have made two errors in the book about the United States. First, the authors falsely accuse [...] "monopolists" [...] like Rockefeller of being the extractive power. But in fact Rockefeller didn't raise the price of oil but lowered the price to gain market share rather than to extract from the economy. Second, he says <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> <b>are</b> oblivious of the mainstream scholarship on American economic history between the American Civil War and civil movements in America.
