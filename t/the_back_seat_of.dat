However, she is {{approached}} by another patient, Purdue (Michael Massee), who insists that Edward is stealing dreams, but will not steal his. Watts researches the facility's inmates to find who has committed stabbings in the victims' cars, concluding that Purdue is the one this profile fits. Black attempts to warn Stoller, but she has already driven away from the hospital. Black gives chase, scaring her, and she out-paces him before pulling into a filling station.

5|$|Harold is escorted {{back to the}} {{psychiatric}} center where he is tormented by Nurse Innes (Nancy Fish). Later, Mulder finds Innes lying on the floor, half-conscious. Innes claims Harold went berserk and attacked her. One of the other patients, Chuck Forsch, tells Scully that Nurse Innes was trying to poison Harold. Scully slowly realizes that Innes, not Harold, {{was responsible for the}} murders. When Innes attacks Scully with a scalpel, Scully draws her weapon and fires, striking her in the shoulder. While summarizing the case with Mulder, Scully explains that Innes had been taking Harold's unused medication, triggering violent and unpredictable behavior. Scully hypothesizes that Innes committed the murders in order to destroy the love Harold felt towards the young women. Later, Harold's body is discovered in a nearby alley, the apparent victim of respiratory failure. Scully, however, suspects that Harold died from what Innes took away from him. Scully admits to Mulder that she saw the ghost of the fourth victim shortly after she was murdered. Later, Scully sees Harold's spirit sitting in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> her car.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} rolling waves and shots of palm tree-lined roads, and gulls. A posse of skateboarders are also pictured in this scene. At first, the clip appears to {{function}} in small, romantic gestures, reminiscent {{to that of a}} fashion magazine advertisement. The singer is pictured in two visually different love affairs. In the first, Del Rey is shown clinging to a younger, long-haired blond, leather-clad man on a beach, where she narcotically flits around the Pacific Ocean shorefront, and splashes in its waves with him. At the 1:20 mark, the song and its visuals simultaneously switch up, with the singer being pictured donning diamond jewelry, sitting alongside a more mature and svengali-type man who wears sunglasses, as a chauffeured convertible barrels forward in slow motion. Del Rey's love interest in this segment recalls age disparity in sexual relationships, producer Robert Evans, and Scott Weiland. In another scene, the two are depicted nuzzling and smoking in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the car. Del Rey depicts a woozy and solemn persona in these segments, while the pair caress each other under passing streetlights. The clip then returns to the scene of Del Rey and her younger love interest on the beach. The aforementioned segments are intercut with scenes that appear to be shot on a low-quality camcorder.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the younger version of Clarkson sitting at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> a station wagon. Singing the first verse, she {{witnesses}} a depressing scene of her brother quarreling with her sister who are scolded by their mother. She slowly clasps both her hands before the video shifts {{to the present day}} where Clarkson is seen arriving on the red carpet with her publicist for the world premiere of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. After posing for the photographers, she enters the cinema and watches the film. The next scene switches back to the younger Clarkson who is sitting and looking around her neighborhood at her house's rooftop as a plane is seen flying across the sky. The video switches back to the older Clarkson who is now watching the aforementioned film in her laptop inside the plane as it goes through a mild turbulence. Clarkson is also seen reminiscing about her past job as a worker in a movie theater, singing with her co-workers. The next scene shows Clarkson singing with her band in a backyard party which is shown alternately with scenes from the film, as well as a montage of her family and co-workers waving away from her. In the final scene, the younger Clarkson is shown praying by her bedside.|$|E

40|$|On 1 January 1990, the {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belts on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> new (imported) passenger cars was stipulated by law and on 1 April 1992 the use <b>of</b> rear <b>seat</b> belts when present was made compulsory.

The percentage is still low; (2) As regards the front seat in the given period, the percentage increased from 62 % to 66 % in built-up areas and on rural roads no significant change was found, around 80 %; (3) More than 90 % of the drivers and back-seat passengers knew about the law on rear-seat belt use; (4) About 80 % of the persons interviewed have seen publicity regarding seat belts on television; (5) Around 50 % of drivers and back-seat passengers said they 'forgot' to use their seat belts; and (6) around 70 % of the persons interviewed would like an automatic signal to tell them when the seat belt was not used. It was concluded that the possibilities for increasing the use <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belts in front and <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> cars are great. Recommendations were given regarding information campaigns, police enforcement, social coercion and technical provisions...|$|R

He arrives in Sacramento and finds the pet store where Arlen worked. The owner (Maura Tierney) asks Mercer to sing in her children's band, for which she plays {{as part of her}} probation. When he returns to the car, he finds somebody trying to break into it, only to discover that it is Kate. They spend the night at a hotel, but he leaves without her the next morning and catches a train to Los Angeles, California. With the help of a translator, he phones Arlen's last residence and learns from a Hispanic woman that Arlen is working at a hotel in Ensenada, Mexico. Mercer finally meets Arlen (Jsu Garcia) at the hotel in Ensenada, but Arlen assumes Mercer is just there for money. Enraged, Mercer tackles his brother to the ground and gets kicked off the premises. Kate later finds a bloody Mercer sitting {{on the side of a}} road and takes him to a hotel. She tells him that she let him take her car because she was attracted to him, and they have sex. The next day Mercer meets with Arlen again, more amicably, and tells him that he and Kate are driving to Louisiana to spread his mother's ashes.|$|E

5000|$|Furious at the Aronwald murder, {{the heads}} of the other New York [...] "Five Families" [...] demanded that the Colombos kill the Carnini Brothers.

In June 1987, both Carnini brothers were found dead in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> their cars in Brooklyn. Concerned about the loyalty of his assassins, Cacace decided to murder them also. At the Carninis' funeral, Cacace allegedly pointed out Variale and Santora to a second pair of hitmen. In September 1987, Variale and Santora were murdered outside a Brooklyn social club in broad daylight. This extraordinary caution helped to temporarily conceal Cacace's involvement in the Aronwald murder.|$|R
5000|$|While the {{aircraft}} {{involved in the}} Farm Gate operation were often piloted by American [...] "advisers," [...] for training purposes, it was required by Washington that a South Vietnamese national {{be part of the}} crew on board any combat missions. In the event an aircraft did get shot down in hostile territory, the presence of an Asian crewman would be enough to dodge potential accusations of violating the Geneva Accords (actual interpretation of this regulation was somewhat liberal, however). There were some reports of hapless South Vietnamese enlisted men being thrown into <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> T-28s and flown into combat by American pilots after having been told not to touch anything in the cockpit.

40|$|During October 1991, a {{combined}} survey was done into {{the presence and}} use of safety belts and child <b>seats</b> on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> cars. Contrary to previous years, it also looked at the belt use by both drivers and front seat passengers. The use <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belts by car drivers in 1991 was practically {{the same as in}} 1990, and amounted to 77 %. The belt use by drivers on roads within built-up areas increased to 62 %. In view of this, the strong decrease of belt use started in 1990 was stopped in 1991. On roads outside built-up areas, the belt use by front seat passengers decreased to 78 %. An increase of the belt use by front seat passengers to 68 % was found on locations within built-up areas. Differences in seat belt use by car drivers appeared to correlate significantly with the type of the road. Per province, great differences were found in belt use on roads within and outside built-up areas, both for drivers and front seat passengers. In this context, the northern provinces showed the highest percentages of wearing rates. Contrary to locations outside built-up areas, the presence of an occupant on the front <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> the car appeared to influence belt use by the driver. Sex still appeared to influence belt use on the front <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> cars: <b>seat</b> belts were more often worn by women than by men. These percentages were respectively 83 % and 75 % on roads outside built-up areas, and 69 % and 59 % respectively on locations within built-up areas. On the survey locations, it was found that in about 47 % of the cars a safety system was present on <b>the</b> side <b>back</b> <b>seats,</b> and in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> the <b>seat</b> the presence was 34 %. Compared with 1990, this means an increase of the belt use on side <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> 8 % for locations outside built-up areas, and for inside built-up areas an increase of approximately 12 %. These percentages were for the middle <b>of</b> the <b>seat</b> 6 % and 14 % respectively. In comparison with 1990, the use <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> belts on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> cars in 1991 decreased strongly. This use appeared to relate strongly with the age of the car occupants. Compared with 1990, a substantial increase of the use of a safety system on the rear <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> cars in 1991 was found among the children in the age groups up to 5 years old and 5 - 12 years old. The belt use by the driver appeared to have an influence on the use of a safety system by occupants on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> cars. If a safety system is present on the rear seats, the difference in wearing rates between roads outside and within built-up areas amounted to 5 %: 24 % versus 29 %. It is shown that the belts on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> were not often used by adults. In view of the wearing rates among adults, additional policy to be directed at publicity is needed to enhance the use of belts on rear seats...|$|R
