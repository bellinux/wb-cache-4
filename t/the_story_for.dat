5|$|Madlax {{was often}} {{accused of being}} {{secondary}} and reusing Noir stylistic solutions, such as the story premise, the two heroines' appearance, and the musical style. Nevertheless, some sources praised <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>for</b> being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor's, owing to all its episodes and subplots being tightly intertwined and held together by the primary plot.|$|E

5|$|Once filming on {{the movie}} was completed, Berg began to explore {{adapting}} <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>for</b> television. Berg later said he had regretted having to jettison many of the interpersonal topics from the book {{because of the time}} constraints of a feature film. Creating a TV series, particularly one based on fictional characters, allowed him to address many of those elements in-depth.|$|E

5|$|According to Sundaram Balachander's wife Shanta Balachander, the {{director}} had watched Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) at a film festival, {{was inspired by}} it, and wrote a play in the same narrative style, but the script was rejected by All India Radio. Balachander later approached A. V. Meiyappan, the founder of AVM Productions, and narrated <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>for</b> him. Although Meiyappan agreed to produce the story as a film, he was unconvinced with Balachander's idea of making it without songs or stunts; however, he agreed to finance the project because he liked the story and trusted Balachander's talent. Andha Naal thus became the first Tamil film {{that did not have}} any songs or dance sequences, and was the only film directed by Balachander for AVM Productions.|$|E

5|$|Elite Force was one {{of several}} Star Trek games {{announced}} after Activision secured the license to Star Trek video games from Viacom in 1998. The game {{was one of}} the first to license id Tech 3, a game engine by id Software used by a number of video games during the early 2000s. Elite Force was a critical success, and is often praised as the first truly successful Star Trek video game, able to appeal to people who were not Star Trek fans. Raven Software released an expansion pack to the game in May 2001, while Wildstorm adapted <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>for</b> a short graphic novel in July 2000.

5|$|Hamlet {{is one of}} {{the most}} quoted works in the English language, and is often {{included}} on lists of the world's greatest literature.

5|$|In January 2006, Disney bought Pixar in a {{deal that}} put Pixar chiefs Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter {{in charge of all}} Disney Animation. Shortly thereafter, Circle 7 Animation was shut down and its version of Toy Story 3 was cancelled. The {{following}} month, Disney CEO Robert Iger confirmed that Disney {{was in the process of}} transferring the production to Pixar. John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Lee Unkrich visited the house where they first pitched Toy Story and came up with <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>for</b> the film over a weekend. Stanton then wrote a treatment.|$|E
5|$|In November 1953, it was {{suggested}} that the existing two episodes could be combined and followed with a condensed live production of the latter part of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>for</b> a special Christmas omnibus repeat of the serial. This idea was abandoned. Although Cartier and star Reginald Tate were keen to make an all-film omnibus version for television, this also did not come to fruition. In 1963, one of the existing episodes was selected as a representative of early British programming for the Festival of World Television at the National Film Theatre in London.|$|E

5|$|Several {{artists have}} applied Ovid's account to new {{translations}} or reworkings, or adapted <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>for</b> the stage. British poet Ted Hughes (1930–1998) used the myth in his 1997 work Tales from Ovid (1997) {{which was a}} loose translation and retelling of twenty-four tales from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Both Israeli dramatist Hanoch Levin (in The Great Whore of Babylon) and English playwright Joanna Laurens (in The Three Birds) wrote plays based on the story. Most recently the story was adapted into an opera by Scottish composer James Dillon in 2004 and a 1964 vocal composition by American composer Milton Babbitt with text by John Hollander.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin came up {{with the}} idea to write about the behind-the-scenes happenings on a sports show while he was living in a room in the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles writing the {{screenplay}} for The American President. He would work late, with the TV tuned into ESPN, watching continuous replays of SportsCenter. The show inspired him to try to write a feature film about a sports show but he was unable to structure <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>for</b> film, so instead he turned his idea into a TV comedy series. Sports Night was produced by Disney and debuted on the Disney-owned ABC network in the fall of 1998.|$|E
