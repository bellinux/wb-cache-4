40|$|This paper {{presents}} the computer implementation {{process of the}} Panel Method for aerodynamic analysis of three dimensional bodies with or <b>without</b> <b>lift.</b> The computer implementation consists {{in the creation of}} pre and post processing environments and a solver for the solution of the problem in external flow potential over three dimensional bodies with and <b>without</b> <b>lift.</b> For cases in which there’s no lift, a constant distribution of sources over the body (fusaleges, farings, etc.) is used, their intensities calculated in order to guarantee impermeability of the body. For cases in which there is lift, a constant distribution of sources and doublets are used on the body (wings, tails, etc.). The intensity of the sources is solved {{in the same manner as}} cases with no lift. Intensity of doublets is solved in order to satisfy the equality condition regarding pressure on the under and upper side of the trailing edge (Kutta Condition) of the body <b>without</b> <b>lift.</b> An analysis of the aircraft CEA- 308 is shown in order to illustrate the use of the developed program in light aircraft projects...|$|R

5000|$|A snow shovel is {{a shovel}} {{designed}} for snow removal. Snow shovels come {{in several different}} designs, {{each of which is}} designed to move snow in a different way. Removing snow with a snow shovel has health risks, but can also have significant health benefits when the snow shovel is used correctly, especially when a modern kind of snow shovel is used that lets one remove snow <b>without</b> <b>lifting</b> it. These include snow sled shovels, also called snow scoops and sleigh shovels, which are large and deep hopper-like implements fitted with a wide handle and designed to scoop up a load of snow and slide it to another location <b>without</b> <b>lifting.</b>|$|R
