5|$|After {{starting}} the 1996 season with Buffalo, Shuey {{was promoted to}} <b>the</b> <b>Indians,</b> where he pitched to a 5–2 record with a 2.85 ERA. He pitched in the postseason for <b>the</b> <b>Indians,</b> appearing in three games in the 1996 American League Division Series, which <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> lost to the Baltimore Orioles. Shuey received a three-year contract from <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> {{at the start of}} the 1997 season, worth $3,203,000 guaranteed. An option year and performance bonuses made the maximum value of the contract $11,603,000 over four seasons.|$|E

5|$|Although {{other teams}} {{including}} the Kansas City Royals, Baltimore Orioles, and New York Yankees had vied for a Wild Card spot, <b>the</b> <b>Indians,</b> Rangers, and Rays all remained in contention {{until the end}} of the season. Entering the final day of the scheduled regular season, on which all three teams played, <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> had a 91–70 record while both the Rangers and Rays had 90–71 records. These were the best non-division-leading records in the American League. Thus, the possibility existed (had <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> lost and the Rays and Rangers won) for a three-way tie for the two Wild Card spots, which would have required several tie-breaker games to settle. However, all three teams won, leaving <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> definitively in the Wild Card Game at 92–70 and the Rays and Rangers tied at 91–71 for the second spot.|$|E

5|$|Details of the {{forthcoming}} peace treaty arrived late in 1782.

5|$|Firing began {{early on}} the morning of June 5. <b>The</b> <b>Indians</b> did not close, but {{remained}} at a distance of two or three hundred yards. Such long range firing with smooth bore muskets caused little loss to either side. The Americans thought that <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> held back because they had suffered heavy losses on the previous day. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> were buying time, waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Crawford decided to hold his position in the trees and make a surprise attack on <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> after nightfall. At this point, he was still confident of success, although his men were low on ammunition and water. Simon Girty, the British agent and interpreter, rode up with a white flag and called for the Americans to surrender, which was refused.|$|E
