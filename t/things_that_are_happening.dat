500|$|Loeb said in July 2017 that Marvel Television had {{no plans}} for series to {{crossover}} across networks. Specifically for the similarly themed Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors, and Runaways, which all deal with young heroes, Loeb noted [...] "You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>happening</b> in L.A. [...] are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans ... It's being aware of it {{and trying to find}} a way for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense." [...] He added in October that scheduling of each series factors into why crossovers between them are more difficult to pull off, and that network [...] "feelings" [...] need to be considered. He also spoke on why the television series do not show Avengers Tower as it appears in the films when they depict New York City, and stated that Marvel Television wanted to be [...] "less specific" [...] about the television characters' relationships to the tower because that [...] "helps the audience understand that this could be on any street corner" [...] and that the characters could be in an area of the city where you would not be able to see the tower, even though it exists.|$|E
500|$|In Erlewine's opinion, Marquee Moon was {{radical and}} {{groundbreaking}} primarily as [...] "a guitar rock album unlike any other". Verlaine and Lloyd's dual {{playing on the}} record strongly influenced alternative rock {{groups such as the}} Pixies, noise rock acts such as Sonic Youth, and big arena bands like U2. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune wrote that Television [...] "created a new template for guitar rock" [...] because of how Verlaine's improvised playing was weaved together with Lloyd's precisely notated solos, particularly on the title track. As a member of U2, Irish guitarist The Edge simulated Television's guitar sound with an effects pedal. He later said he had wanted to [...] "sound like them" [...] and that Marquee Moons title track had changed his [...] "way of thinking about the guitar". Verlaine's jagged, expressive sound on the album made a great impression on American guitarist John Frusciante when he started developing as a guitarist in his early 20s, as it reminded him that [...] "none of those <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>happening</b> in the physical dimension mean anything, whether it's what kind of guitar you play or how your amp's set up. It's just ideas, you know, emotion." [...] In Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield called Marquee Moon [...] "one of the all-time classic guitar albums" [...] whose tremulous guitar twang was an inspiration behind bands such as R.E.M. and Joy Division. Joy Division's Stephen Morris cited it as one of his favorite albums, while R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe said his love of Marquee Moon was [...] "second only to [...] Horses". English guitarist Will Sergeant said it was also one of his favorite records and that Verlaine and Lloyd's guitar playing was a major influence on his band Echo & the Bunnymen.|$|E

2500|$|The film premiered in 1986 {{and drew}} some {{controversy}} {{due to its}} subject matter. Almodóvar justified his use of violence, explaining [...] "The moral of all my films is {{to get to a}} stage of greater freedom". Almodóvar went on to note: [...] "I have my own morality. And so do my films. If you see Matador through the perspective of traditional morality, it's a dangerous film because it's just a celebration of killing. Matador is like a legend. I don't try to be realistic; it's very abstract, so you don't feel identification with the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>happening,</b> but with the sensibility of this kind of romanticism".|$|E
2500|$|In {{his first}} full week as Secretary, Cisneros was confronted by the {{unprecedented}} growing number of homeless in the country’s cities, and declared homelessness “a highest priority.” [...] He quickly recommended that an economic stimulus package include $100 million to $150 million for homeless programs that mix housing and social services. Cisneros tapped Andrew Cuomo {{to serve as an}} assistant housing secretary, in charge of homelessness. He spent an evening touring a shelter and the streets in Washington D.C. [...] One night in late December 1994, he walked the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul, talking to the homeless and later flopped for the night in a shelter in an effort to understand homelessness firsthand. [...] The next day he announced $7.3 million in HUD for five Minnesota state projects for homeless youth and families. [...] However, his efforts to alleviate the problem were often thwarted by a slow-moving bureaucracy. He described his frustration to Jill Smolowe in Time: [...] "I can't believe how gridlocked the system is ... how irrelevant it is to <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>happening</b> out in the country." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{remains one}} other element {{if we are}} to {{complete}} the parallelism of the old Bible and the new. The Christian Bible ends with a forecast, the Book of Revelation; the Hebrew Bible ended also with forecasts, the Prophets. To that the old Bible owed much of its magic power over men's imaginations and the inspiration it gave them. It was not a dead record, not an accumulation of things finished and of songs sung. It pointed steadily and plainly to the Days to Come as the end and explanation of all that went before. So too our Modern Bible, if it is to hold and rule the imagination of men, must close I think with a Book of Forecasts. We want to make our world think more than it does about the consequences of the lives it leads and the political deeds that it does and that it permits to be done. We want to turn the human imagination round again towards the future which our lives create. We want a collection and digest of forecasts and warnings to complete this modern Bible of ours. Now here I think you will say--and I admit with perfect reason--that I am floating away from any reasonable possibility at all. How can we have forecasts and prophecies of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>happening</b> now? Well, I will make a clean breast of it, and admit that I am asking for something that may be impossible. Nevertheless it is something that is very necessary if men are to remain indeed intelligent co-operating communities. In the past you will find where there have been orderly and successful communities the men in them had an idea of a Destiny, of some object, something that would amount to a criterion and judgment upon their collective conduct. Well, I believe that we {{have to get back to}} something of that sort.|$|E
