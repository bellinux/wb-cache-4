500|$|After repeating to herself, 'Today is your day! You can do it!', Twain {{decided to}} compose a song for self-inspiration. Twain {{described}} the decision to write the song as crucial because it was her first songwriting effort since her separation from Lange. She had to [...] "find [...] as a songwriter" [...] and become independent again. [...] "I was petrified of writing a new song without Mutt. A whole new world for me. It had been many, many years since I had written by myself so that was new and scary", Twain said. Twain found writing the music quite simple, as it only occupied two lines of sheet music. The lyrics then flowed as Why Not? with Shania Twain progressed. [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] inspirited her; hence, she considered sharing it with the series. The concept frightened her: [...] "Sharing that song with other people, exposing, and basically allowing myself to be vulnerable the and judged, it scared <b>the</b> <b>heck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me." [...] She believed it became a natural theme song for the series. She explained, [...] "From the inception of documenting the journey, the song was also created at that moment.

It also stated Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is a truly one-of-a-kind experience that cannot easily be described. Lisa Minot, from The Sun, stated [...] "after a sneak peek, I can say it is the most faithful recreation of JK Rowling's books and movies ever seen. Fans will be in heaven." [...] Leigh Caldwell from Traveling Mamas noted that although The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is ideal for the whole family, it's not designed for anyone under 3 years old." [...] She went on to consolidate others' comments about the area: [...] "there is no doubt that fans of the Harry Potter books and movies are going to enjoy <b>the</b> <b>heck</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a visit to the Wizarding World". Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, criticized the fact that the park was chosen to be in Orlando, rather than in London, stating that it was [...] "utterly mad" [...] to leave it to the Americans [...] "to make money from a great British invention." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ambash {{noted that}} Vause's season three storyline [...] "highlights real issues {{regarding}} prisoners’ safety, especially when no real background checks are performed on new, untrained officers, {{who end up}} with easy access to inmates". Moreover, [...] "it serves {{as a reminder that}} and Chapman have basically switched roles" [...] as Chapman embarked on [...] "the smuggling business and showed little regard for Vause", finding a new sense of power and thrill in her illicit enterprise, while Vause wisely avoided it. Lauren Chval of Chicago Tribune remarked that what is great about Vause is [...] "she knows who she is and what she wants", trusts her instincts and has [...] "never flipped on her feelings for Chapman". Chval praised Prepon in the role, and remarked that Vause is [...] "always more interesting in her scenes without Chapman".Perri Nemiroff of Collider said Prepon has been successful [...] "taking Alex from a strong inmate you don’t want to mess with to someone super vulnerable who’s fearing for her life."Rick Porter of The Hollywood Reporter praised Prepon's performance as Vause, in the season finale, encounters the hitman sent to kill her, writing, [...] "Prepon sells <b>the</b> <b>heck</b> <b>of</b> <b>out</b> Alex's disbelief and fear in the scene." ...|$|R

5000|$|Happy talk, {{also called}} banter, is the {{additional}} and often meaningless commentary interspersed into television news programs by news anchors {{and others on}} set.

Chaney was not so pleased with [...] "We Found Love", to which she gave a [...] "C". She wrote that it was [...] "part old Esther Williams movie, part classic 'SNL' sketch with Harry Shearer and Martin Short and part music video for 'Magic' by the Cars. In short, {{it was kind of}} a train wreck." [...] However, she and Stanhope, who said it was [...] "way too fast-paced", were in the minority. Lynch called it [...] "sheer pleasure" [...] and gave it an [...] "A−", and Slezak was even more enthusiastic with an [...] "A+" [...] grade and described it as a [...] "sublimely, ridiculously, excessively terrific production number" [...] which he placed [...] "in the show's all-time Top 10". VanDerWerff praised the [...] "nice sense of visual spectacle", and Hankinson called it [...] "really fantastic" [...] and [...] "something different".
