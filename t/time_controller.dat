40|$|In this work, {{we present}} the basic ideas {{underlying}} the code generation {{for the implementation}} of <b>timed</b> <b>controllers.</b> We define a simple formalism, inspired by the well-known timed automata to specify a <b>timed</b> <b>controller.</b> The semantics of our new specification language (called ELASTIC) is given by a timed automaton with special Asap flags, and with a parameter δ which intend to model the delays inevitably present in an implementation. The verification is done on this semantic automaton (also called δ-controller), with the tool HyTech which gives, if its algorithm analysis terminates, the range of acceptable values for δ. Then, we propose a transformation of the specification into a program. The main challenge is to show that the produced code can always be simulated by the δ-controller. We show that this is the case in general if a simple condition on the parameter δ is verified by the hardware; as a corollary, the safety properties verified on the specification are preserved by the transformation. It follows that the generated code {{does not need to be}} verified again...|$|R

It is portrayed as being genetically engineered to have an enhanced perception of the space-time vortex, enabling it to direct Dalek strategies involving time travel while limiting temporal destabilisation. The novel describes it as the ultimate form of Dalek life, able to command even the Dalek Supreme, and having a neck bin encircled by diagonally revolving rings of vortex energy.

The feedback controller, of the proportional-integral-derivative type, ensures that manipulator joints follow reference trajectories and the feedback controller achieves robust tracking of step-plus-exponential trajectories, all in real <b>time.</b> The adaptive <b>controller</b> includes adaptive force and position control within a hybrid control architecture. The adaptive controller, for force control, achieves tracking of desired force setpoints, and the adaptive position controller accomplishes tracking of desired position trajectories.
