5|$|By {{the time}} Harding took office, there were calls from foreign governments for {{reduction}} of the massive war debt owed to the United States, and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay. The U.S. refused to consider any multilateral settlement. Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation, but Congress, in 1922, passed a more restrictive bill. Hughes negotiated an agreement for Britain to pay off its war debt over 62 years at low interest, effectively reducing <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the obligations. This agreement, approved by Congress in 1923, set a pattern for negotiations with other nations. Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments {{would result in the}} Dawes Plan of 1924.|$|E
25|$|In this {{equation}} {{the left side}} is <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the draw downs made by the lender and the right side is <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the repayments made by the borrower. In both cases the present value is defined given the APR as the interest rate. So <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the drawdowns is equal to <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the repayments, given the APR as the interest rate.|$|E

50|$|In finance, <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> (NPV) or net {{present worth}} (NPW) is a {{measurement}} of profit calculated by subtracting <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>values</b> (PV) <b>of</b> cash outflows (including initial cost) from <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> cash inflows {{over a period}} of time. Incoming and outgoing cash flows can also be described as benefit and cost cash flows, respectively.|$|R
25|$|The {{formula for}} <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> a regular stream of future {{payments}} (an annuity) {{is derived from}} a sum of the formula for future value of a single future payment, as below, where C is the payment amount and n the period.|$|E
25|$|For {{bonds with}} {{multiple}} coupons, {{it is not}} generally possible to solve for yield in terms of price algebraically. A numerical root-finding technique such as Newton's method must be employed to approximate the yield which renders <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> future cash flows equal to the bond price.|$|E
25|$|Consider a 30-year {{zero-coupon bond}} {{with a face}} value of $100. If the bond is priced at an annual YTM of 10%, it will cost $5.73 today (<b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> this cash flow, 100/(1.1)30 = 5.73). Over the coming 30 years, the price will advance to $100, and the annualized return will be 10%.|$|E
2500|$|The {{internal}} rate {{of return}} on an investment or project is the [...] "annualized effective compounded return rate" [...] or {{rate of return}} that sets <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> all cash flows (both positive and negative) from the investment equal to zero. Equivalently, it is the discount rate at which <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> future cash flows is equal to the initial investment, and it is also the discount rate at which <b>the</b> total <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> costs (negative cash flows) equals <b>the</b> total <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> benefits (positive cash flows).|$|R

The authors find a negative relationship between initial wage levels and wage growth, even after correcting for negative biases in existing estimates of this relationship.

25|$|There are two {{competing}} theories usually advanced for the pricing of credit default swaps. The first, referred to herein as the 'probability model', takes <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> {{a series of}} cashflows weighted by their probability of non-default. This method suggests that credit default swaps should trade at a considerably lower spread than corporate bonds.|$|E
25|$|From 1982 until 2012, most Western economies {{experienced}} {{a period of}} low inflation combined with relatively high returns on investments across all asset classes including government bonds. This brought {{a certain sense of}} complacency amongst some pension actuarial consultants and regulators, making it seem reasonable to use optimistic economic assumptions to calculate <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> future pension liabilities.|$|E
25|$|A {{discount}} rate or capitalization rate {{is used to}} determine <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the expected returns of a business. The {{discount rate}} and capitalization rate {{are closely related to}} each other, but distinguishable. Generally speaking, the discount rate or capitalization rate may be defined as the yield necessary to attract investors to a particular investment, given the risks associated with that investment.|$|E
50|$|Fisher-Weil {{duration}} is a {{refinement of}} Macaulay’s duration which {{takes into account}} the term structure of interest rates. Fisher-Weil duration calculates <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relevant cashflows (more strictly) by using the zero coupon yield for each respective maturity.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> V <b>of</b> any network j to any {{individual}} i {{is equal to}} the sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> benefit of all transactions less <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costs of all transactions on the network over any given period of time t, as shown in the following equation. The <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the entire network is the summary <b>of</b> the <b>value</b> to all users, who are defined as all parties doing transactions on that network.|$|R

25|$|The {{operation}} of evaluating a present value {{into the future}} value is called capitalization (how much will $100 today be worth in 5 years?). The reverse operation which consists in evaluating <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> a future amount of money is called a discounting (how much $100 that will be received in 5 years- at a lottery, for example -are worth today?).|$|E
25|$|In {{this case}} each cash flow grows {{by a factor}} of (1+g). Similar to the formula for an annuity, <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> a growing annuity (PVGA) uses the same {{variables}} with the addition of g as the rate of growth of the annuity (A is the annuity payment in the first period). This is a calculation that is rarely provided for on financial calculators.|$|E
25|$|These {{equations}} {{are frequently}} combined for particular uses. For example, bonds {{can be readily}} priced using these equations. A typical coupon bond is composed of two types of payments: a stream of coupon payments similar to an annuity, and a lump-sum return of capital {{at the end of}} the bond's maturity—that is, a future payment. The two formulas can be combined to determine <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the bond.|$|E

25|$|Economic or bioeconomic {{overfishing}} additionally {{considers the}} cost of fishing when determining acceptable catches. Under this framework, a fishery {{is considered to be}} overfished when catches exceed maximum economic yield where resource rent is at its maximum. Fish are being removed from the fishery so quickly that the profitability of the fishery is sub-optimal. A more dynamic definition of economic overfishing also considers <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the fishery using a relevant discount rate to maximise the flow of resource rent over all future catches.|$|E
25|$|The {{market price}} of a bond is <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> all {{expected}} future interest and principal payments of the bond discounted at the bond's yield to maturity, or rate of return. That relationship {{is the definition of}} the redemption yield on the bond, which is likely to be close to the current market interest rate for other bonds with similar characteristics. (Otherwise there would be arbitrage opportunities.) The yield and {{price of a}} bond are inversely related so that when market interest rates rise, bond prices fall and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Actuarial science {{became a}} formal {{mathematical}} {{discipline in the}} late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial, life insurance, and annuities. These long term coverage required that money be set aside to pay future benefits, such as annuity and death benefits many years into the future. This requires estimating future contingent events, such as the rates of mortality by age, {{as well as the}} development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested. This {{led to the development of}} an important actuarial concept, referred to as <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> a future sum. Certain aspects of the actuarial methods for discounting pension funds have come under criticism from modern financial economics.|$|E

25|$|The {{consistently}} revenue-generating part of {{the company}} may have a much higher credit rating than the company as a whole. For instance, a leasing company may have provided $10m nominal value of leases, and it will receive a cash flow {{over the next five years}} from these. It cannot demand early repayment on the leases and so cannot get its money back early if required. If it could sell the rights to the cash flows from the leases to someone else, it could transform that income stream into a lump sum today (in effect, receiving today <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> a future cash flow). Where the originator is a bank or other organization that must meet capital adequacy requirements, the structure is usually more complex because a separate company is set up to buy the assets.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{government}} is obligated {{under current law}} to make mandatory payments for programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) projects that payouts for these programs will significantly exceed tax revenues over the next 75 years. The Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) payouts already exceed program tax revenues, and social security payouts exceeded payroll taxes in fiscal 2010. These deficits require funding from other tax sources or borrowing. <b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> these deficits or unfunded obligations is an estimated $45.8trillion. This is the amount that {{would have had to}} be set aside in 2009 in order to pay for the unfunded obligations which, under current law, will have to be raised by the government in the future. Approximately $7.7trillion relates to Social Security, while $38.2trillion relates to Medicare and Medicaid. In other words, health care programs will require nearly five times more funding than Social Security. Adding this to the national debt and other federal obligations would bring total obligations to nearly $62trillion. However, these unfunded obligations are not counted in the national debt, as shown in monthly Treasury reports of the national debt.|$|E
25|$|Many factors affect people's {{retirement}} decisions. Retirement funding {{education is}} a big factor that affects the success of an individual’s retirement experience. Social Security clearly {{plays an important role}} because most individuals solely rely on Social Security as their only retirement option, when Social Security’s both trust funds are expected to be depleted by 2034. Knowledge affects an individual’s retirement decisions by simply finding more reliable retirement options such as, Individual Retirement Accounts or Employer-Sponsored Plans. In countries around the world, people {{are much more likely to}} retire at the early and normal retirement ages of the public pension system (e.g., ages 62 and 65 in the U.S.). This pattern cannot be explained by different financial incentives to retire at these ages since typically retirement benefits at these ages are approximately actuarially fair; that is, <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> lifetime pension benefits (pension wealth) conditional on retiring at age a is approximately the same as pension wealth conditional on retiring one year later at age a+1. Nevertheless, a large literature has found that individuals respond significantly to financial incentives relating to retirement (e.g., to discontinuities stemming from the Social Security earnings test or the tax system).|$|E
