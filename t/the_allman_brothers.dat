5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band. It was {{released}} in the United States by Atco Records and Capricorn Records on November 4, 1969 and produced by Adrian Barber. Formed in 1969, <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band came together following various musical pursuits by each individual member. Following his session work in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, Duane Allman moved to Jacksonville, Florida where he led large jam sessions with his new band, one he had envisioned as having two guitarists and two drummers. After rounding out the lineup {{with the addition of}} his brother, Gregg Allman, the band played free shows in public parks and moved to Macon, Georgia, where they were {{to be one of the}} premiere acts on Capricorn.|$|E
5|$|Eat a Peach is {{the third}} studio album by American rock band <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band. Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was {{released}} on February 12, 1972, in the United States by Capricorn Records. Following their artistic and commercial breakthrough {{with the release of}} the live album At Fillmore East (1971), <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band got to work on their third studio album. Many in the band were struggling, however, with heroin addictions, and checked into rehab to confront these problems. Shortly after leaving rehab, group leader and founder Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident in the band's home of Macon, Georgia thus making it the final album to feature the guitarist.|$|E

5|$|Idlewild South is {{the second}} album by American Southern rock band <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band. Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was {{released}} on September 23, 1970, in the United States by Atco Records and Capricorn Records.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{recording}} process, Duane {{was invited to}} join Eric Clapton and his new group Derek & the Dominos on {{the recording}} of their debut album, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. Clapton later formally invited Allman to join the group, but he reluctantly declined, expressing loyalty {{to the members of}} <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> and musical concept that had birthed it.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of their 1969 debut, <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band toured the United States {{extensively}} to promote the album, which had little commercial success. Their performances, however, did create positive word of mouth exposure that extended to more famous musicians, such as Eric Clapton, who invited group leader Duane Allman to contribute to his 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.|$|E
50|$|It was <b>the</b> first <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> song to chart, peaking {{at number}} 92 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1971.|$|R
50|$|Peakin' at the Beacon was <b>the</b> first <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band {{album to}} include Derek Trucks on guitar and Oteil Burbridge on bass, {{and the last}} to include {{founding}} member Dickey Betts.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 TAT {{announced}} that {{they were back in}} the studio recording their second up album and appeared on Warped Tour 2011 bringing some of their new material to the live set along with a handful of LA, NY and UK shows. During this time Tatiana wrote and produced several songs for the soundtrack of Blue Crush 2, the direct-to-DVD sequel of 2002's Blue Crush, which TAT performed along with a cover of <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>brother's</b> Soulshine.|$|R
5|$|Gregg Allman became {{interested}} in the Hammond after Mike Finnigan had introduced him to Jimmy Smith's music, and started to write material with it. His brother Duane specifically requested he play the instrument when forming <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band, and he was presented with a brand new B-3 and Leslie 122RV upon joining. Allman recalls the instrument was cumbersome to transport, particularly on flights of stairs, which often required the whole band's assistance. Author Frank Moriarty considers Allman's Hammond playing a vital ingredient of the band's sound.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> {{started their}} own music festival, The Peach, which {{features}} many associated acts and many genres {{in addition to}} two Allman Brothers performances. They played {{a run at the}} Beacon in 2013 per tradition and after continued to tour. In 2014, Haynes and Derek Trucks announced their intention to depart the group {{at the end of the}} year. The group intended their 2014 run of Beacon shows to be their last, but the residency was cut short when Allman developed bronchitis.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, the Fillmore East closed, and {{the band}} were invited to play a final, invitation-only concert, along with Edgar Winter, the Beach Boys and Country Joe McDonald. The Beach Boys {{initially}} refused to perform unless they headlined the event, but Graham refused, telling them that <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> would be closing the show, and they were free to leave if they disagreed. The Allman Brothers' performance was used for additional tracks when an expanded version of At Fillmore East, The Fillmore Concerts, was reissued on CD.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{dual lead}} guitars was pioneered by Bubble Puppy's Prince and Potter, as {{exhibited}} in live performances {{as early as}} 1967. Two years later, English counterparts, Wishbone Ash and <b>the</b> USA's <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band, would begin using the same technique with great success.|$|R
50|$|Booked by Gulf Artist Productions, {{they shared}} the same stage with many 60’s National Recording Artists, Dave Clark Five, the Shangrilas, Blues Magoos, The Gap, Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs, Tommy James and the Shondells, The Mindbenders, The McCoys, <b>The</b> Doors, <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers,</b> 3 Dog Night, Left Bank and more.|$|R
50|$|Reach for the Sky was <b>the</b> first <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band {{album to}} be {{released}} by a label other than Capricorn Records. It was their second album with Dan Toler on guitar and David Goldflies on bass, and their first studio album to include only songs written by the band members.|$|R
5|$|Montgomery Gentry was an American {{country music}} duo {{consisting}} of vocalists Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry, both natives of Kentucky. Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry began performing in the 1990s {{as part of}} two different bands with Montgomery's brother, John Michael Montgomery. Although Gentry won a talent contest in 1994, he reunited with Eddie Montgomery after Gentry {{was unable to find}} a solo record deal, and Montgomery Gentry was formed in 1999. The duo was known for its Southern rock influences, and collaborated with Charlie Daniels, Toby Keith, Five for Fighting, and members of <b>The</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 1975, {{four days}} after finalizing her divorce from Sonny, Cher married rock {{musician}} Gregg Allman, co-founder of <b>The</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band. She filed for divorce nine days later because of his heroin and liquor problems, but they reconciled within a month. They had one son, Elijah Blue, on July 10, 1976. Sonny and Cher's TV reunion, The Sonny and Cher Show, debuted on CBS in February 1976—the first show ever to star a divorced couple. Although the show was a ratings success on its premiere, Cher and Sonny's insulting onscreen banter about their divorce, her reportedly extravagant lifestyle, and her troubled relationship with Allman caused a public backlash that eventually contributed to the show's cancellation in August 1977.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{a wave of}} singer-songwriters {{who drew}} on the introspective, deeply {{emotional}} and personal lyrics of 1960s folk-rock. They included James Taylor, Carole King and others, all known just as much for their lyric ability as for their performances. The same period saw the rise of bluesy Southern rock and country rock groups like <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. In the 1970s, soft rock developed, a kind of simple, unobtrusive and mellow form of pop-rock, exemplified {{by a number of}} bands like America and Bread, most of whom are little remembered today; many were one-hit wonders. In addition, harder arena rock bands like Chicago and Styx also saw some major success.|$|E
5000|$|In Premier Guitar, John Bohlinger wrote, [...] "Play All Night {{benefits}} {{greatly from}} the warm, round fuzz of Allen Woody's bass, {{a force of}} groove and attitude that you won't find on <b>the</b> other live <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> recordings." ...|$|R
2500|$|Improvised slides are common, {{including}} pipes, rings, spoons, {{and even}} stones. Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett {{was fond of}} using a Zippo lighter as a slide, but this was largely for special effects. [...] Glass bottles, such as beer bottles, are common, and Duane <b>Allman</b> (Derek and <b>the</b> Dominos, <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band) used a glass Coricidin medicine bottle. Blues guitarist CeDell Davis used a butterknife.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, Kid Rock {{went from}} a hard metal rapper to a {{southern}} rocker/country singer using 2001's album Cocky as the transformation album. His next two studio releases 2003's Kid Rock and 2007's Rock N Roll Jesus were mainly straight southern rock jams and country-tinged ballads. His 2008 single [...] "All Summer Long" [...] (which samples [...] "Sweet Home Alabama" [...] and [...] "Werewolves of London") became {{one of his biggest}} hits to date without it being available on iTunes. <b>The</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brother's</b> Dickey Betts joined Kid Rock as part of his Rock N Roll Revival Tour in 2008 and Lynyrd Skynyrd opened for him. In 2009, they relaunched the tour under the same name. In 2010 he released [...] "Born Free" [...] a straight southern rock album without any rap or metal on it. He has remained planted in southern rock since with Rebel Soul (2012) and First Kiss (2015).|$|R
25|$|Rock {{groups from}} Georgia include the Atlanta Rhythm Section, The Black Crowes, and <b>The</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The most {{permanent}} of the Phil Lesh and Friends lineups, {{known as}} the Phil Lesh Quintet (PLQ or just [...] "the Q" [...] for short) played on a mostly-regular basis from September 2000 through December 2003. The members of this incarnation were Lesh, Warren Haynes (guitar & vocals; also of Gov't Mule and <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band), Jimmy Herring (guitar; <b>The</b> Dead, <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band, Aquarium Rescue Unit, and most recently Widespread Panic), Rob Barraco (keyboards;The Dead, the Zen Tricksters, Dark Star Orchestra) and John Molo (drums; Bruce Hornsby and the Range, The Other Ones, Modereko, Keller Williams, David Nelson Band, Jemimah Puddleduck, and John Fogerty).|$|R
50|$|Erik Blicker {{was born}} on November 7, 1964, in New Haven, Connecticut. He {{is one of four}} {{children}} of Fred and Jeanne Blicker. At a young age, Erik Blicker was encouraged to explore the world of music and quickly became hooked on recording as well as playing the guitar. At the age of 14 he started guitar lessons with Jim Shepley, a blues and rock musician who grew up with Duane Allman and is credited with inspiring <b>the</b> iconic <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band.|$|R
50|$|The album {{features}} extended {{jams and}} guitar solos that showcase the virtuosity of Trucks and Haynes. While <b>the</b> original <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band focused both on jazz-based soloing and looser free jamming, the more modern {{version of the}} band is loud and tight throughout. Trucks and Haynes show a great respect for the legacy of Duane Allman and Dickey Betts while still managing to do something original with their guitars. Music writer Robert Christgau cites One Way Out as the band's best live album.|$|R
25|$|Derek Trucks of <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band and the Derek Trucks Band uses a {{modified}} Gibson USA SG '61 reissue with factory Vibrola, {{which has had}} the tailpiece modified and a stopbar tailpiece installed.|$|E
25|$|Crowe's first {{cover story}} was on <b>the</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band. He {{went on the}} road with them for three weeks at the age of 16 and interviewed not only the whole band, but also the entire road crew.|$|E
25|$|Duane Allman (<b>The</b> <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band) used a 1957 Les Paul Goldtop with PAF pickups, a 1959 cherry sunburst Les Paul, a 1958 tobacco sunburst Les Paul and a 1968 cherry SG {{which he}} used for slide guitar.|$|E
25|$|The Open D tuning D–A–D–F–A–D, {{also called}} “Vestopol” tuning, {{is one of}} the most common open tunings used by European and American guitarists working with {{alternate}} tunings. There are countless recorded examples, including Joni Mitchell (“Big Yellow Taxi”), Bruce Cockburn (“Sunwheel Dance”), Leo Kottke (many of his slide tunes), John Fahey (multiple tunes) and many others. <b>The</b> popular <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> instrumental “Little Martha” used an open D tuning raised one half step, giving an open E♭ tuning with the same intervalic relationships as open D.|$|R
50|$|Allman did {{not want}} this tour's road {{expenses}} to mount up, as they had for <b>the</b> last <b>Allman</b> <b>Brothers</b> Band tour. However, this tour too lost money from the start. The Hard Way Tour also led to the final breakup of the couple. While pre-tour publicity had emphasized that Gregg Allman was free from drug and alcohol problems, Cher discovered during the tour that Gregg Allman's drinking had returned, and once the tour was complete, {{she told him that}} their marriage finally was done for good.|$|R
