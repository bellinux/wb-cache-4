5|$|<b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>has</b> {{been criticized}} on {{multiple}} grounds, particularly regarding the ages. Duncan himself noted that {{measurement of the}} northern ages may {{have been affected by}} loss of argon due to low-grade metamorphism, and that there might be bias in respect of stratigraphic position. The latter was demonstrated by a recent study that showed, on the basis of geochemistry, that the Grays River volcanics followed the Siletzia eruptions, and thus are not representative of the initial phase of Siletz magmatism. Recent dating also shows a more monotonic trend of south to north age progression ("younging").|$|E

25|$|Though the {{intellectual}} effect {{of being a}} TCK {{has not yet been}} widely explored, there has been such research in the area. One particular study by Lee and Bain (2007) that was found to have significant findings was conducted on young native Koreans who had recently moved to the United States and were attending school in America. The researchers were looking to see how these students would respond to explicit instruction aimed to work with their originality and fluency and that is specific to TCKs. This was measured through the level of creativity demonstrated in assigned tasks given to the students. TCKs were found to be able to demonstrate significantly higher levels of creativity and originality for problem solving than TCKs not given this same explicit instruction. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>has</b> implications for the ways that TCKs can be instructed differently from the traditional curriculum to enhance their creativity and problem solving abilities because of their third culture experience.|$|E
25|$|One small 2009 {{double-blind}} study of autistic children found that 40 hourly treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres provided {{significant improvement in}} the children's behavior immediately after treatment sessions but <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>has</b> not been independently confirmed. More recent, relatively large-scale controlled studies have also investigated HBOT using treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres and have found less promising results. A 2010 {{double-blind study}} compared HBOT to a placebo treatment in children with autistic disorder. Both direct observational measures of behavioral symptoms and standardized psychological assessments were {{used to evaluate the}} treatment. No {{differences were found between the}} HBOT group and the placebo group on any of the outcome measures. A second 2011 single-subject design study also investigated the effects of 40 HBOT treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres on directly observed behaviors using multiple baselines across 16 participants. Again, no consistent outcomes were observed across any group and further, no significant improvements were observed within any individual participant. Together these studies suggest that HBOT at 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheric pressure does not result in a clinically significant improvement of the behavioral symptoms of autistic disorder.|$|E

500|$|<b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>has</b> been {{extensively}} discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took {{most of his}} data from earlier researchers, notably Adolph Wagner and Henry Morselli, who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant–Catholic differences in suicide seemed {{to be limited to}} German-speaking Europe and thus may have always been the spurious reflection of other factors. Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized {{as an example of the}} logical error termed the ecological fallacy. However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim's work really contained an ecological fallacy. More recent authors such as Berk (2006) have also questioned the micro–macro relations underlying Durkheim's work. Some, such as Inkeles (1959), Johnson (1965) and Gibbs (1968), have claimed that Durkheim's only intent was to explain suicide sociologically within a holistic perspective, emphasizing that [...] "he intended his theory to explain variation among social environments in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals".|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} several {{epidemiological}} studies that say there is {{an increased risk of}} various diseases, especially cancers, among people who live near nuclear facilities. A widely cited 2007 meta-analysis by Baker et al. of 17 research papers was published in the European Journal of Cancer Care. It offered evidence of elevated leukemia rates among children living near 136 nuclear facilities in the United Kingdom, Canada, France, United States, Germany, Japan, and Spain. However <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>has</b> been criticized on several grounds – such as combining heterogeneous data (different age groups, sites that were not nuclear power plants, different zone definitions), arbitrary selection of 17 out of 37 individual studies, exclusion of sites with zero observed cases or deaths, etc. Elevated leukemia rates among children were also found in a 2008 German study by Kaatsch et al. that examined residents living near 16 major nuclear power plants in Germany. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>has</b> also been criticised on several grounds. These 2007 and 2008 results are not consistent with many other studies that have tended not to show such associations. The British Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment issued a study in 2011 of children under five living near 13 nuclear power plants in the UK during the period 1969–2004. [...] The committee found that children living near power plants in Britain are no more likely to develop leukemia than those living elsewhere Similarly, a 1991 study for the National Cancer Institute found no excess cancer mortalities in 107 US counties close to nuclear power plants. However, in view of the ongoing controversy, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has requested the National Academy of Sciences to oversee a state-of-the-art study of cancer risk in populations near NRC-licensed facilities.|$|E

2500|$|In the Near East, in {{southern}} Mesopotamia in particular, cultivation of emmer wheat {{began to decline}} in the Early Bronze Age, from about 3000 BC, and barley became the standard cereal crop. This has been related to increased salinization of irrigated alluvial soils, of which barley is more tolerant, although <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>has</b> been challenged. Emmer had {{a special place in}} ancient Egypt, where it was the main wheat cultivated in Pharaonic times, although cultivated einkorn wheat was grown in great abundance during the Third Dynasty, and large quantities of it were found preserved, along with cultivated emmer wheat and barleys, in the subterranean chambers beneath the Step Pyramid at Saqqara. Neighbouring countries also cultivated einkorn, durum and common wheat. In the absence of any obvious functional explanation, the greater prevalence of emmer wheat in the diet of ancient Egypt may simply reflect a marked culinary or cultural preference, or may reflect growing conditions having changed after the Third Dynasty. Emmer and barley were the primary ingredients in ancient Egyptian bread and beer. Emmer recovered from the Phoenician [...] settlement at Volubilis (in present-day Morocco) has been dated {{to the middle of the}} first millennium BC.|$|E
