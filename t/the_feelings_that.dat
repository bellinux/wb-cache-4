5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E

He focused on {{questioning}} what {{the role of a}} musician was during this period; and attempted to represent the idea of certain types of people existing in 2011, making certain types of music. He believed that the true role of a musician had become strongly evident after the earthquake. The band also tried to express 2011 sonically, through the style of synths that pianist Emi Okazaki created for the songs.|$|E

25|$|The {{impact of}} sexual {{harassment}} can vary. In research {{carried out by the}} EU Agency for Fundamental Human Rights research, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> resulted from the most serious incident of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance and 36% embarrassment. Furthermore, close to one in three women (29 %) who has experienced sexual harassment says that she felt fearful {{as a result of the}} most serious incident, while one in five (20%) victims say that the most serious incident made her feel ashamed of what had taken place. In other situations, harassment may lead to temporary or prolonged stress or depression depending on the recipient's psychological abilities to cope and the type of harassment and the social support or lack thereof for the recipient. Psychologists and social workers report that severe or chronic sexual harassment can have the same psychological effects as rape or sexual assault. Victims who do not submit to harassment may also experience various forms of retaliation, including isolation and bullying.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E

500|$|Flower was {{primarily}} intended to arouse positive emotions in the player, {{rather than to}} be a challenging and [...] "fun" [...] game. This focus was sparked by Chen, who felt that {{the primary purpose of}} entertainment products like video games was <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. The team viewed their efforts as creating a work of art, removing gameplay elements and mechanics that were not provoking the desired response in the players. The music, composed by Vincent Diamante, dynamically responds to the player's actions and corresponds with the emotional cues in the game. Flower was a critical success, to the surprise of the developers. Reviewers praised the game's music, visuals, and gameplay, calling it a unique and compelling emotional experience. It was named the [...] "best independent game of 2009" [...] at the Spike Video Game Awards, and won the [...] "Casual Game of the Year" [...] award by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences.|$|E
500|$|The Green Bag is {{the senior}} class annual at the Baltimore City College. Published {{continuously}} since 1896, it is the oldest publication still in existence at the school {{and is one of}} the oldest high school or college yearbooks in America. G. Warfield Hobbs Jr. (later an Episcopal priest), president of the 1896 senior class and first editor-in-chief of The Green Bag, gave the publication its name in recognition of the role of City College graduates in political leadership. Historically, the famous green [...] "carpet bag" [...] in the 19th century containing the lists of political appointees (also known as [...] "patronage") of the Governor of Maryland to be approved by the General Assembly of Maryland has long been known as the [...] "green bag", though the derivation of the term is unknown.

500|$|The game's {{focus on}} {{emotions}} was sparked by Chen, {{who felt that}} {{the primary purpose of}} entertainment products like video games was <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. Chen tried to make the game focus more on emotions than on a message; he specifically changed the design of Flower when early testers felt there was a message of promoting green energy in the game. To make Flower have the [...] "emotional spectrum" [...] that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a [...] "fun" [...] game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. He summarized this view by saying that the only gameplay mechanic is hitting a flower to trigger a new event. The team specifically cut out deeper gameplay elements because these would have added [...] "challenge" [...] to the game, which, while fun, would not have been relaxing. Sony Santa Monica contracted with Bluepoint Games to create ports of the game for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, which were published in November 2013 to correspond with the release of the PlayStation 4. [...] An iOS version was released in September 2017, published by Annapurna Interactive.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study examines subtle {{discrimination in the}} workplace from the target's perspective and aims to explore the different forms subtle discrimination can take, and the reasons why minority individuals themselves experience specific incidents as discriminatory. Based on in-depth interviews with minority professionals of Turkish and Maghrebi descent in Flanders, we identified a large variety of different forms of subtle discrimination and four major reasons that explain their problematic nature. These reasons involve <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lower status of ethnic minorities is reinforced; feeling treated {{as a representative of}} an ethnic group; <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> specific differences are seen as problematic; and <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> unequal status-quo is maintained.

500|$|One of {{the first}} songs written for the album was [...] "Angel". McLachlan said that writing the song was easy, [...] "a real joyous occasion." [...] It was {{inspired}} by articles that she read in Rolling Stone about musicians who turned to heroin {{to cope with the}} pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosed. She said that she identified with <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> might lead someone to use heroin: [...] "I've been in that place where you're so fucked up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape." [...] She said that the song is about [...] "trying not to take responsibility for other people's shit and trying to love yourself at the same time." [...] Another song that she found easy to write was [...] "Building a Mystery", co-written with her regular collaborator, Canadian musician and producer Pierre Marchand. Marchand heard her playing a guitar riff and suggested adding some lyrics that he had already written. They came up {{with the rest of the}} lyrics together, according to McLachlan, [...] "pretty darn quickly." [...] When the album was finished, McLachlan commented, [...] "I was so happy when I could let it go. I didn't give it another thought when it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|The next game, Flower, was Chen and Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game {{outside the}} safety net of academia". Chen was the {{creative}} director {{in charge of the}} game, while Santiago was the producer and Clark was the lead designer. The company ranged in size from six to nine people at varying stages of the game's development. Flower was intended by Chen to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as [...] "an emotional shelter". Chen described the game as [...] "an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature". He decided on a [...] "nature" [...] theme early in the development process, saying that he [...] "had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal in your living room, it leads you to somewhere else. I thought; wouldn't it be nice if it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature." [...] Chen designed the game around the idea that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. To make Flower have the [...] "emotional spectrum" [...] that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a [...] "fun" [...] game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. In 2008, during Flowers development, Chen was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 {{as one of the top}} 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.|$|E

Heller flew 60 bombing missions from May to October in 1944. Heller {{was able to make}} it out of the war, but it took until 1953 before he could start writing about it. The war experience turned Heller into a [...] "tortured, funny, deeply peculiar human being".|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, when Thomas read Race and Economics by {{economist}} Thomas Sowell, {{he found}} an intellectual foundation for his philosophy. The book criticized social reforms by government and instead argued for individual action to overcome circumstances and adversity. He was also influenced by Ayn Rand, particularly The Fountainhead, and would later require his staffers to watch the 1949 film version. Thomas later said that novelist Richard Wright {{had been the most}} influential writer in his life; Wright's books Native Son and Black Boy [...] "capture a lot of <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> I had inside that you learn how to repress."

I don't know whether I ought {{to say that it}} has given me more pleasure than any of your long poems. Kehama is doubtless more powerful, but I don't feel that firm footing in it that I do in Roderick". An anonymous review in the December 1814 Theatrical Inquisitor argued, [...] "It is scarcely possible to view the errors of exalted genius without breathing a sigh of compassion and regret. The generous mind feels humiliated at the contemplation [...] Such are <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> must be excited by the reader of Southey's poems [...] The story of the present poem is interesting, and would probably have made an excellent romance. It has, however, several capital defects, that make it altogether unfit for an heroic poem".|$|E
