500|$|A {{message from}} the IRA Army Council was issued calling for [...] "the British {{establishment}} to seize the opportunity and to take the steps needed for ending its futile and costly war in Ireland. We again emphasise that they should pursue the path of peace or resign themselves to the path of war". The IRA also attempted to apply indirect pressure to the British government with a statement sent to non-United States foreign-owned businesses in the City, warning that [...] "no one should be misled into underestimating the IRA's intention to mount future planned attacks into the political and financial heart of the British state ... In the context of present political realities, further attacks on the City of London and elsewhere are inevitable. This we feel we are bound to convey to you directly, <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> make fully informed decisions".|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} {{members of the group}} attended the Escuela Elemental and the Escuela Secundaria of the University of Puerto Rico, an institution noted for its progressive and experimental teaching approaches. Vocalist/bassist Willy Rodriguez commented, [...] "It is a school in which you are allowed to decide a few things on your own, you have free time between classes [...] you can do your own things, {{and there is a lot}} of musical culture in the school. It tends <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> explore your artistic interests... There was always an air of liberation, of thinking on your own. I think that influenced a lot in what we do today musically and ideologically." [...] Group members Boris Bilbraut, Willy Rodríguez, Eliut González, Juan Costa, and Ivan Gutiérres began jamming together in 1996, bonding over a shared interest in reggae music, particularly Bob Marley. [...] These rehearsal sessions took place in El Hoyo, a neighborhood in the San Juan metropolitan area.|$|E
500|$|In the Americas, Native American {{nations were}} {{severely}} damaged by European settlers, specifically {{because of the}} Europeans' advanced military technology. Favreau compared the film to the historical confrontation [...] "in the frustration of not having the technology <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> prevail. It's always the low-tech culture that feels powerless when faced with an enemy that has technology on their side." [...] In the film, the cowboys are the low-tech culture, and the aliens with advanced technology possess the belief of Manifest Destiny. Favreau also said of the premise, [...] "It allows the cowboys and Native Americans to come together, which would be impossible had there not been a greater common enemy. It sets the Western {{up in a very}} classic way and then turns it on its ear." [...] When the aliens appear, the film becomes a road movie in which the main characters try to track the aliens, team up with different groups, and ultimately confront the aliens. Favreau compared the gathering to The Magnificent Seven in facing seemingly insurmountable odds in their confrontation.|$|E

40|$|Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) is a {{language}} for understanding concurrent behaviour [1]. This paper discusses {{how and why}} we might construct a CSP model of a Java program and looks {{at some of the}} problems involved that require further research.... 1 Why Model a Java Program in CSP? Java provides support for threading but cannot protect the user from the pitfalls associated with concurrent programming. Tracking down bugs such as race conditions and deadlocks can be extremely difficult; one way of simplifying this might be to construct a model of the program and reason about that. The major benefit of choosing CSP as the modelling language, or more precisely its machine-readable form, is the availability of automated proof tools that support it. One such tool is FDR (Failures/Divergences Refinement). In addition <b>to</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> test assertions about a specification, it includes a debugger for identifying one example of failure if the assertion does not hold.
