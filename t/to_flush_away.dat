Previously, the water would have continued down the creek into the river, and flushed to the Pacific Ocean. The pooling of the water, however, made it extremely difficult for the pollutants to be removed. From 1955 to 1962, open pit mining began on the site. At its peak, the mine discharged 5 tons of iron, [...] of copper, and [...] of zinc into the stream per day. By then, the water flowing down the drainage was so contaminated that it necessitated the {{construction of}} a holding dam, the Spring Creek Dam.|$|E

However, the construction of several reservoirs and drainage systems along its path has alleviated this danger. Several streams emerging from the surrounding mountain ridges have cut small, but partially deep ravines and gullies into the terraced plateaus of the Val Lumnezia.|$|E
50|$|The {{rocket pack}} could be swapped in around 20 minutes by {{removing}} six bolts.

5000|$|Only {{a part of}} the saline {{feed water}} pumped into the {{membrane}} assembly passes through the membrane with the salt removed. The remaining [...] "concentrate" [...] flow passes along the saline side of the membrane <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>away</b> the concentrated salt solution. The percentage of desalinated water produced versus the saline water feed flow is known as the [...] "recovery ratio". This varies with the salinity of the feed water and the system design parameters: typically 20% for small seawater systems, 40% - 50% for larger seawater systems, and 80% - 85% for brackish water. The concentrate flow is at typically only 3 bar / 50 psi less than the feed pressure, and thus still carries much of the high pressure pump input energy.|$|E
50|$|CSOs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with sanitary sewer overflows. Sanitary sewer overflows are caused by sewer system obstructions, damage, or flows in excess of sewer capacity (rather than treatment plant capacity.) Sanitary sewer overflows may occur at any low spot in the sewer system rather than at the CSO relief structures. Absence of a diversion outfall often causes sanitary sewer overflows to flood residential structures and/or flow over traveled road surfaces before reaching natural drainage channels. Sanitary sewer overflows may cause greater health risks and environmental damage than CSOs if they occur during dry weather when there is no precipitation runoff <b>to</b> dilute and <b>flush</b> <b>away</b> sewage pollutants.|$|R
5000|$|All of the {{observed}} ringing rock boulder fields in southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey are a form of felsenmeer. Felsenmeer is a German term meaning [...] "sea of rock". These barren block fields occur in periglacial environments where outcrops of resistant rock are exposed with a slope of less than 25°. Frost wedging breaks up the upper portion of the rock formation, and the slight dip of the field allows the fine weathering materials <b>to</b> be <b>flushed</b> <b>away</b> before soil can develop. Often the boulders are lifted and rotated by the accumulation of snow and ice, leaving {{a considerable amount of}} vacant space between them. The felsenmeer boulder fields form in-situ due to the low slope angles. In situations where the slope angles are steeper than 25°.gravity tends to move the boulders downhill to form scree or talus slopes. In fields where the angle is too flat the spaces between the boulders fills with soil and the boulders break down due to weathering.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reservoir}} is used {{mostly for}} flood control storage, and is rarely filled to its [...] capacity. During the dry season, water from Spring Creek pools in a small, stagnant pond retained behind the dam, depositing contaminated sediment and acidic mine {{waste in the}} reservoir space. When flows from the Shasta Dam, upstream on the Sacramento River, are sufficient <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> contaminated water <b>away,</b> water held in the reservoir is released through the outlet works into the Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. Despite this operation strategy, the reservoir was eventually deemed inadequate for the watershed, and can be filled to capacity by a single heavy storm event. Uncontrollable spills frequently poured into the Sacramento River during floods, through the crest spillway of the dam, which lacks gates. As a result, numerous fish kills have occurred during these sudden releases of contaminants, a major {{one of which was}} in 1969.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century, borough records mention several {{attempts}} {{to improve the}} Beck by scouring, and also the problems of financing these operations. In 1695, three aldermen and three burgesses were appointed to collect contributions towards the maintenance costs. In the 1720s, John Warburton proposed that a boat fitted with an engine like [...] "those used in Holland and Flanders" [...] {{should be used to}} loosen the reeds and silt, and that two locks or floodgates should be used to hold back the water at high tide, and used <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>away</b> the loosened material at low tide. One would be near the Great Bridge, and the second between the Great and Little Bridges. The [...] "engine" [...] mentioned was probably some sort of plough. Contributions towards the estimated cost of £200 were not forthcoming, although the Corporation ordered a plough from Holland in January 1721.|$|E

50|$|Portable oxygen {{concentrators}} {{operate on the}} same principle as a home domestic concentrator, pressure swing adsorption. The atmosphere contains around 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen; the 1% remainder {{is a mixture of}} other gases. An internal air compressor forces this air through a system of chemical filters known as a molecular sieve. This filter is made up of silicate granules called Zeolite which attract (via molecular bond adsorption) nitrogen molecules onto their surfaces more strongly than they attract oxygen molecules - this sieves the nitrogen out of the air, concentrating the oxygen. Part of the oxygen produced is delivered to the patient; part is fed back into the sieves (at greatly reduced pressure) <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>away</b> the accumulated nitrogen, preparing the granule surfaces for the next cycle. Through this process, the system is capable of producing medical-grade oxygen of up to 90% consistently. The latest models can be powered from mains electricity supply, 12v DC (car/boat/aircraft), and battery packs, freeing the patient from relying on using cylinders or other current solutions that put a restriction on time, weight, and size.|$|E

5000|$|Angraecum Veitchii: a very {{rewarding}} orchid. In indirect light and watered/fed regularly this plant will produce blooms annually (usually in Late Winter to Spring - for Australia this occurs in August). The flowers last a while if {{kept in a}} sheltered position and their strong heady fragrance is delightful. They only release their perfume at night. Flowers are large (4 - 9 cm across), waxy, white to greenish cream in colour and borne on stems of seven to ten depending on the faithfulness of your fertilising, watering, and indirect light provision. The leaves are large, thick straps that alternately fan out from a central (monopodal) stem. Pups (keikis) form {{at the base of}} the stem and can either be divided from the parent plant once they have at least three roots of their own or alternatively, left on the plant these will make a stunning specimen as when mature will produce blooms with the parent plant - many award winning angraecum veitchiis are grown as such. In the right conditions these orchids are healthy and require little attention. As they are epiphytes the potting mixture should be loose and free draining. Prolific roots are formed from the base and also amongst the lower half of the foliage. These can be troublesome when moving the plant. Once your angraecum is big it is best to pot it in a heavy terracotta pot or place a brick in the bottom of the pot in order to ensure the plant does not get top heavy and risk snapping when blown over in the wind, especially since they flower during the windier times of the year. When watering a good soaking with a hose or watering-can is best (not just a misting from a spray gun) as this helps <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>away</b> any salts from fertilisers that may be present in the potting mixture and also thoroughly wets the plant. Make sure the roots halfway up the stem get a soaking too, not just the potted roots.|$|E
40|$|Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{accurate}} manufacturing processes available for creating complex or simple shapes and geometries within parts and assemblies. EDM works by eroding material in the path of electrical discharges that form an arc between an electrode tool and the work piece. EDM manufacturing is quite affordable and a very desirable manufacturing process when low counts or high accuracy is required. Turn around time can be fast and depends on manufacturer back log. The EDM system consists of a shaped tool or wire electrode, and the part. The part is connected to a power supply. Sometimes to create a potential difference between the work piece and tool, the work piece is immersed in a dielectric (electrically non-conducting) fluid which is circulated <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>away</b> debris...|$|E
30|$|Wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} is a thermo-electrical process in which material is eroded from the workpiece {{through a series of}} discrete sparks occurring between the workpiece and the wire electrode (tool). The tool is separated by a thin film of dielectric fluid which is continuously fed to the area being machined in order <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>away</b> the eroded particles. The movement of the wire is numerically controlled to achieve the desired three-dimensional shape and accuracy of the workpiece. The most important performance factors effecting WEDM are discharge current, pulse duration, pulse frequency, wire speed, wire tension, type of die electric fluid and dielectric flow rate. However, wire EDM owing a large number of variables and the stochastic nature of the process, even a highly trained operator will still find it difficult to attain an optimal processing and avoid wire breakage.|$|E

The flushed manure and water are drained and delivered to a holding pond. Preferably, the flush water is then recycled from the holding pond for subsequent flushing. In another method, alum is added to a manure slurry in a manure collection pit disposed under a slatted floor on which the swine reside. In either method, alum is added in an amount sufficient to substantially inhibit ammonia volatilization and to decrease soluble phosphorus present to provide a healthy and environmentally safe swine rearing facility and an improved agricultural fertilizer...|$|E
40|$|The Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} {{threatened}} many coastal ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico {{during the spring}} and summer of 2010. Mitigation strategies included the construction of barrier sand berms, the restriction or blocking of inlets, and the diversion of freshwater from rivers to the coastal marshes and into the ocean, in order <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>away</b> the oil, on the premise that these measures could reduce the quantity of oil reaching sensitive coastal environments such as wetlands or estuaries. These projects result in changes to the ecosystems that they were intended to protect. Long-term effects include alterations of the hydrological and ecological characteristics of estuaries, changes in sediment transport along the coastal barrier islands, the loss of sand resources, and adverse impacts to benthic and pelagic organisms. Although there are no easy solutions for minimizing the impacts of the Deepwater Horizon disaster on coastal ecosystems, we recommend that federal, state, and local agencies return to the strategic use of long-term restoration plans for this region...|$|E
40|$|Some {{machining}} process requires coolant {{to reduce the}} cutting temperature and helps <b>to</b> <b>flush</b> <b>away</b> the chips from the cutting zone. However, conventional flood coolant possesses some issues towards workers and the environment, regarding health and waste management. The implementation of Minimal Quantity Lubrication (MQL) as an alternative technique seems to be promising although {{the effectiveness of this}} technique were influenced by several factor. In turning process for instance, the distance of nozzle to the cutting zone contributes to the variation of machining performance. This study is to compare the effect on cutting performance between two internal MQL nozzle designs. The cutting tool holder were modified to have two internal MQL oil channel. The oil channel design were tested and the performance was evaluated in terms of cutting speed and cutting temperature for different cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. The result shows that the single channel performs better in terms of cutting force while dual channel significantly improve the cutting temperature...|$|E
