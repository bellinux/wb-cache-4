40|$|Abstract—Training Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is {{relatively}} slow compared {{to many other}} machine learning algorithms. In this study, we focus on instance selection to improve <b>training</b> <b>speed.</b> We first {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} instance selection algorithms for k-nearest neighbor algorithms with ANN. We then analyze factors in accuracy—distance from decision boundary, dense regions, and class distributions, and propose new instance selection algorithms. We discuss the tradeoff between accuracy and <b>training</b> <b>speed,</b> and introduce a measure for the tradeoff. Our empirical results on real data sets indicate that our proposed RDI is more effective with ANN. Keywords—instance selection; neural networks; <b>training</b> <b>speed</b> I...|$|R

25|$|On simple, usually {{temporary}} layouts, {{power is}} supplied by a power pack consisting of a transformer and rectifier (DC), a rheostat for regulating power to the track (and thus <b>train</b> <b>speed),</b> and reversing to control model direction. On permanent layouts, multiple power supplies are traditionally used, with the trackage divided into electrically isolated sections called blocks; toggle or rotary switches (sometimes relays) are used to select which power supply controls the train in a particular block. With the advent of digital command control, block divisions are largely eliminated, as the computerized controllers can control any train anywhere on the track at any time.|$|E
25|$|The Be'er Sheva North University {{station is}} the {{terminus}} {{of the line}} to Dimona. All stations of Israel Railways can be accessed from Beersheba using transfer stations in Tel Aviv and Lod. Until 2012, the railway line to Beersheba used a slow single-track configuration with sharp curves and many level crossings which limited <b>train</b> <b>speed.</b> Between 2004 and 2012 the line was double tracked and rebuilt using an improved alignment and all its level crossings were grade separated. The rebuilding effort cost NIS 2.8billion and significantly reduced the travel time and greatly increased the train frequency to and from Tel Aviv and Kiryat Motzkin to Beersheba. In addition, Beersheba will be linked to Tel Aviv and Eilat by a new passenger and freight high-speed railway system.|$|E
25|$|The Spirit of Progress {{ushered in}} a {{standard}} of passenger <b>train</b> <b>speed</b> and comfort not previously seen in Australia. Its introduction in November 1937 marked the culmination of many years of preparatory work by the Victorian Railways, from the laying of heavier rail on the North East line, introduction of Automatic Staff Exchange apparatus to allow continuous high speed running between track sections, introduction of high-powered three-cylinder Pacific locomotives, and the testing of air conditioning equipment on passenger rolling stock. Such was the commitment of VR Chief Commissioner Harold Clapp to introducing a world-class train service to Victorian Railways, virtually no detail was overlooked. VR engineers famously road-tested the new train's smoothness on curves by studying a full bowl of soup in the dining car as the train took curves at full speed; if the soup splashed {{over the side of}} the bowl a decision would be taken whether to modify the curve for higher speeds or reduce the speed limit for the curve. Harold Clapp could not, however, take credit for the name for the service; when discussing with his wife his proposed Royal Victorian name (inspired by the LMS Royal Scot), Mrs Clapp suggested, on the spur of the moment, Spirit of Progress.|$|E

500|$|Just {{seven years}} after Robert Fulton proved the {{commercial}} viability of steam-powered ships with his North River Steamboat (more commonly known today as Clermont) in 1807, small wood-burning steamers began to ply the Chesapeake Bay. Before the arrival of railroads and river steamboats in the early 19th century, overland travel was exceedingly slow and tedious. Rivers were the main means of transportation and most cities were founded on them. This was especially so in North America, where journeys over vast distances of hundreds or even thousands of miles required months of hazardous, uncomfortable travel by stagecoach or wagon on rutted, unpaved trails. In the 1830s, railroads were being built, but the technology was crude and average passenger <b>train</b> <b>speed</b> was only [...] Perhaps more importantly, most early railroads did not connect. [...] It would be many years before the various lines were knitted together to make intercity rail travel in the U.S. a reality.
