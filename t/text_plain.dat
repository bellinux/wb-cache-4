40|$|We study quark and lepton {{mass matrix}} textures {{in a model}} {{containing}} an additional $U(1) _X$ gauge symmetry with origins in string compactification. The $U(1) _X$ symmetry is broken near the string scale, and {{we assume that the}} anomalies are canceled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism. We also assume that fermion mass matrices are generated by an additional scalar field through an approach analogous to that of Froggatt and Nielsen. By requiring that supersymmetry not be broken at the high scale, we can derive the vacuum expectation value of this scalar field to then predict fermion masses and mixings for any given $X$ charge assignment. We examine the possible solutions, and although in the simplest model they do not completely agree with experiment, the results are close enough to merit further inspection.

40|$|Abstract—Now a day’s {{providing}} Security {{for data}} is complicated task {{we have so}} many security methods that are implemented and deployed but out of them few are using and serving the needs of society. And we can’t say that any algorithm is perfect and avoids threats. The main goal of any design of any encryption algorithm must be security against unauthorized attacks. Within the last decade, data in both the private and public sectors are increased which requires Availability, Authentication, Confidentiality, Integrity. In this paper we are considering The DES algorithm that defines the mathematical steps that transform original <b>text</b> (<b>plain</b> text) into a cipher text (secret code) and also transform the cipher text back to the original text. Here introduces a new method to enhance the performance of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. This is done by replacing the 8 / 32 S-Box instead of 6 / 4 S-Box. The output of each S-Box undergoes AND and XOR operation before going to the permutation P. In this paper we also proposed a new operation Addition modulo instead predefined XOR operation applied during the 16 round of the standard algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is to examine the effects of {{cognitive}} load theory, particularly the effects of redundancy and cueing, when learning from text and diagrams. A review of the literature on cognitive load and cueing is presented in three sections; the literature on split-attention and redundancy, studies investigating the modality effect, and literature of signaling or cueing related to performance and cognitive load in instructional design. In one experiment three hypotheses were tested; that novice participants would have lower cognitive load, higher recall and higher performance with a) cued text vs. plain text, b) audio text vs. visual text, and c) cued audio text vs. plain audio text. The study sought to confirm existing research on the effects of narration vs. written text on cognitive load, and to extend cognitive load research into the area of signaled text and narration. Although the results for the 3 hypotheses were not statistically significant, there was an indication of a practical trend supporting the effectiveness if cued audio text, where higher scores on the performance test were observed for these participants. Also, learner preferences were measured for the different text presentation methods, and a preference for cueing was strongly indicated, although no preference for audio text vs. visual text was identified. These findings contribute to the theory and practice surrounding the design and development of instruction; particularly instruction that is designed to be offered via the Internet, or web-based instruction. Further exploration into cued audio <b>text,</b> <b>plain</b> audio text, cued visual text and cued audio text, and their impact on cognitive load, recall and performance in instruction is a rich area for future research...|$|E
