Instead of classical dramatic contrasts, <b>thematic</b> <b>action</b> develops towards a definite goal. This type of musical narration often lasts {{to the end of the}} coda, in other cases the constant evolution of a thematic thought or the continual transformation of a motif receives the leading role. In order to obscure the essential events of the works or of the movements Schumann often employs “traditional” formal gestures. One of the most interesting is the repetition of a longer section in different keys, reminding of the exposition-recapitulation duality. The déjà vu feeling was generally one of the starting-point in Schumann's workshop to move away from traditional sonata procedures. Influenced by the narrative content of the works, various strategies were elaborated by him to excite the déjà vu, or to relive musical moments...|$|E

In order to frame this analysis, the dissertation will use Russian directing concepts of character, event and action to show how African American theatre traditions can be reformulated as directing strategies, thus suggesting the existence of a particularly African American directing methodology. The main analytical tool of the dissertation will be Stanislavsky's concept of ""super-super-objective,"" translated here as ""larger thematic action,"" understood as an aesthetic ideal formulated as a call to action. The ultimate goal of the dissertation will be to come to an approximate formulation of Richards' ""larger <b>thematic</b> <b>action.</b> "" Some of the artists interviewed are: Michael Schultz, Douglas Turner Ward, Woodie King, Jr., Dwight Andrews, Stephen Henderson, Thomas Richards, Scott Richards, James Earl Jones, Charles S.

40|$|Participants with a {{cognitive}} impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with discourse impairments early within the disorder. These discourse impairment are associated with declines in episodic, semantic, and working memory. These impairments provide researchers {{with the opportunity to}} examine the linguistic and other cognitive systems responsible for discourse, as well as determine how impairments to other cognitive systems impact discourse. Moreover, since these linguistic impairments are often qualitatively and quantitatively different from healthy aging, researchers may be able to use a multilevel discourse analysis to improve screening methods for cognitive impairment. The purpose of this study, then, is two-fold: (1) determine how participants with AD fit into the construction-integration model of discourse processing with special attention given to the role semantic memory declines have on discourse and (2) determine if a multilevel discourse analysis can discriminate between the participants with AD and healthy controls. Participants include 12 participants with AD and 12 healthy controls matched for age and education. To assess cognitive and linguistic abilities, participants complete three tasks: cognitive tasks, semantic tasks, and a discourse tasks. The cognitive task will include measures of episodic and working memory from the Wechsler Memory Scale - III. The semantic tasks involved the Pyramid and Palm Tree Tests, Boston Naming Tests, and a Category Flunecy Test. The discourse task will require participants to tell a story from two wordless pictures books. The discourse samples were analyzed for micro- and macrolinguistic errors; percentage of living things; percentage of light verbs; and <b>thematic</b> elements and <b>actions.</b> For study aim one, a MANOVA determined that participants with {{a cognitive}} impairment associated with AD produced more micro- and macrolinguistic errors, as well as fewer <b>thematic</b> <b>actions</b> compared with healthy controls.

40|$|Recent studies {{assessing}} {{the role of}} associative/event-based (thematic) and categorical (taxonomic) relations {{in the organization of}} object representations suggest that thematic relationships may influence the perceived similarity of manipulable artifacts. At the same time, evidence suggests that action knowledge is an important component of manipulable artifact representations. However, the role that action plays in processing thematic relationships between objects is unclear. In this study, we assessed healthy and left hemisphere stroke participants to explore three questions: 1. Do participants favor <b>thematic</b> relations involving <b>action</b> (Th+A, e. g., wine bottle – corkscrew), <b>thematic</b> relationships without <b>action</b> (Th-A, e. g., wine bottle – cheese), or taxonomic relationships (Tax, e. g., wine bottle – water bottle) when choosing between them in an association judgment task? 2. Do the underlying constructs of event, action, and categorical relatedness implicitly determine the choices that participants make? 3. Does degraded action knowledge and/or damage to temporo-parietal cortex (a region of the brain associated with action representations) reduce the influence of action on the choice task? Experiment 1 showed that explicit ratings of event, action, and categorical relatedness differentially predicted healthy participants’ choices, with action relatedness determining choices between Th+A and Th-A associations above and beyond event and categorical ratings. Experiment 2 focused more specifically on these Th+A vs. Th-A choices and demonstrated that participants with left temporo-parietal lesions, a brain region known to be involved in sensorimotor processing, were less likely than controls, and tended to be less likely than patients with lesions sparing that region, to implicitly use action knowledge in determining their choices. We conclude that action knowledge plays a critical role in processing of thematic relations for manipulable artifacts...|$|R

In order to change this situation, initiatives were taken by the province in order to reinforce the higher education as well as the socio-economic position of the region based on thorough scientific research. On the basis of the cluster theory by Porter, highlighting the importance of thematic clustering of research and socio-economic activities, analysis is made of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the socio-economic field as well as of the available research expertise in the higher education institutions; this in close collaboration with the socio-economic partners and employers/employees from the various provincial sub-regions. It resulted in a growth plan containing several <b>thematic</b> spearhead <b>actions.</b> In the elaboration of the growth plan, emphasis is laid on the coherence and mutual reinforcement of the entire innovation chain going from knowledge development to knowledge application and spreading. A concrete initiative contributing to the realization of this plan are the easily accessible expertise and services centres (LEDs) set up on the initiative of the province. Thematically, they complement the expertise present in the higher education institutions and meet the actual needs of small and medium entrepreneurs in the region. Entrepreneurs or organizations can appeal to the network for innovation questions and they can leave the elaboration to research groups. Both partners are in a win- win situation: the entrepreneur who often does not have the means for R&D can innovate after all and the research groups in the higher education institutions are given the possibility to accumulate and develop their scientific knowledge. It is clear that a close collaboration between higher education and the socio-economic field has a surplus value for both actors...|$|R

Set in the 1930s, {{the novel}} is a distillation of the psychosexual and racist stereotypes of the Dragon Lady seductress and of the ruthless Mongol who threaten Western civilisation. The story is told in the genre's traditional first-person narrative of Sir John Weymouth-Smythe, an anti-hero who is simultaneously a lecher and a prude, continually torn between sensual desire and Victorian sensibility. The plot concerns Weymouth-Smythe's quest for the Spear of Destiny, a relic with supernatural power, which gives the possessor control of the world. Throughout the story, Weymouth-Smythe spends much time battling the nominal villain, Chou en Shu, for possession of the Spear of Destiny. In {{the course of the}} <b>action,</b> <b>thematic</b> developments reveal that the Yellow Peril is not the villain, but the (Nazi) Germans who were ostensible allies of the British anti-hero, Weymouth-Smythe, in the quest for the Spear of Destiny.

However, there is little rigorous empirical research investigating teachers’ thoughts and actions during online tutorials. Taking a sociocultural perspective, this study explores the interplay between the attention focus of language teachers during synchronous online tutorials and their reflections on their own teaching practices. Eyetracking data show that patterns of attention focus on {{different areas of the}} screen (representing technical facilities, social interaction and content) are related to practitioners’ experience in online teaching including familiarity with a particular platform. In particular, those with less online teaching experience display greater attention to technical areas than their more experienced colleagues.

By 2020 thanks to the European Community and the Mayors agreement in 2008, cities aiming to be smart (for energy management,transport, digital technologies, social policy) will focus on sustainable development, by innovations and adequate partners. The general goal of resource saving and use of renewable energy has become a strategic necessity, fully involving architecture, whose environmental load in industrialized countries has become unsustainable. The national regulatory framework is constantly evolving, because the new European Directive 31 / 2010 /CE, repealing the E. D. 91 / 2002 /CE, obliges from January 2021 energy consumption close to zero for all new buildings. Objectives can only be achieved with the contribution of all actors of the building process and the use of effective tools for management and control of environmental quality, associated with the construction activity. Within this framework planning and building tools are essential, whose regulatory strategies are also activated at the regional scale. In Italy, many regions have begun to address the problem, for which there is a wide range of regional regulations and building regulation (R. E.) where sustainability criteria were introduced, assigning volume premiums or economic incentives, aimed at promoting the reduction of energy consumption. The paper presents the first results of the research, aimed to produce guidelines, useful for eco-building regulations, for the Sicilian regional context, such as basic regulation instruments of constructive activity, oriented towards sustainability, with the support of environmental assessment criteria.

40|$|Background: The author {{identified}} that most large organisations use employee surveys yet many report difficulties {{in using the}} findings. This led to an investigation into a solution that could provide guidance on how to take action from employee surveys. Purpose: To provide guidance that could facilitate action on employee surveys. Literature Review: The literature identifies barriers to survey action including lack of a clear purpose and inadequate allocation of responsibility. A review examined a range of change models and noted {{the value of a}} staged approach for effective implementation. Although the literature provided no appropriate model, it highlighted factors relating to successful organisational change. Method: The research examined transcripts of interviews that contained experienced managers' perceptions of the facilitators of survey <b>action.</b> <b>Thematic</b> analysis identified the main facilitators of action from these managers' views, and in interpreting this material developed a 'Framework to Facilitate Action from Employee Surveys'. This Framework was then critiqued, using the Delphi technique, by experts in the management of change. Findings and Recommendations: Reflection on the findings, noted congruence between themes in the literature and the managers' views. In additional, detailed information from the transcripts gave a particular slant to many aspects of change, noting for instance the requirement for three different types of leader to ensure survey action. This information, backed by further analysis of the literature, is developed into a sequential framework for action. The basic Framework stages, shown below, have additional information added, based on the experts' comments to give greater impact to the purpose of change, and the Framework's flexibility. Framework to Facilitate Survey Action Stage 1 : Responsibilities of Three Leaders Promote Survey Purpose as Action Stage 2 : Plan and Prepare for Action with Tasks and Resources Allocated Stage 3 : Conduct Survey and Disseminate Results with Targeted Communications Stage 4 : Implement Action: Set Standards, Monitor and Review Progress Stage 5 : Provide Support: Encourage Persistence and Maintain Action Conclusion: To survive in a competitive climate most organisations have to change rapidly. A well constructed survey should be able to harness the view of employees and use these for the benefit of both the institution and the individual. The use of the Framework should provide a worthwhile and innovative approach to the organisational development of many organisations. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} research explored {{end of life}} care provided to people dying with a non malignant disease in two Australian rural, residential aged care facilities. Residential aged care facilities provide {{end of life care}} for many people dying from non malignant diseases. The illness trajectory in non malignant diseases can be difficult to predict and symptom management can be challenging. Further, as the Australian population ages, the demand for optimal end of life care for frail, older people is anticipated to increase. Therefore, this study aimed to explore issues as identified by nurses and relatives of residents dying from a non malignant disease in order to examine ways in which nurses can provide nursing care that maximises the likelihood of a good death, identify the barriers nurses perceive to prevent optimal end of life care to dying residents, and explore the relationships between nurses and relatives of the dying resident, with the intention of improving care. Following ethical clearance, 14 aged care staff overall within both facilities were recruited to the project. Participants included Registered Nurses, Enrolled Nurses, Assistants in Nursing and other aged care staff personnel, all of whom were in a carer relationship with a dying resident. In addition, eight relatives of dying residents were interviewed, using individual, face to face, semi structured interviews. Taylor’s (2006) 13 step action research and reflection method was incorporated into five main phases, including foundation building, reflection on practice stories, identifying <b>thematic</b> concerns, <b>action</b> plan creation, implementation and critical reflection. In both facilities, group meetings were held weekly for up to 19 weeks. Data were gathered using combinations of reflective drawing, practice stories, interviews and surveys. Relatives’ interview transcripts were incorporated into the nurses’ group meetings, so that end of life care issues of importance to relatives were shared, with the intention of assisting the nurses to examine the nature of aged care nursing and relationships that occur with relatives of the dying resident. Thematic analysis was conducted and through group consensus, themes and subthemes emerged from the practice stories indicating aspects of end of life care requiring further improvement. Major thematic concerns were prioritised for action, which included considering the possibility of addressing staff debriefing and better pain management. Through collaborative processes, action plans were created, implemented and evaluated, with participants reporting varying degrees of success in attempting to improve these aspects of care. This project demonstrated that the delivery of end of life care to residents in these rural, residential aged care facilities was inconsistent and of varying quality. Grief and loss permeated aged care work and affected both staff and relatives of the dying resident. Some of the barriers identified in delivering effective end of life care included hierarchical structures, poor staff attitudes, doctors’ prescribing practices, lack of communication within the team and limited palliative care knowledge and services. Poor pain management practices at end of life were related to numerous issues, including the demands of managing more complex conditions, a lack of implementation of evidence based recommendations, and staff knowledge deficits. Although this project highlighted care deficits within two specified Australian aged care facilities, literature supports the contention that issues exist nationally and internationally within other aged care facilities and systems, in relation to caring for people dying from non malignant causes. The failure to adequately address dying in older people is reflective of aged care industries, which are challenged to meet the increased complexity of delivering optimal end of life care. Further, when end of life care guidelines are available, they are not being enacted effectively. This action research and reflection project suggests that the enormity of these problems requires sustainable practice changes, which will embed and facilitate effective palliative care within aged care institutions. This project demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} establish a working relationship with aged care nurses, with no prior knowledge of action research or reflective processes, to influence end of life care nursing practices. The gains achieved in this action research and reflection project can be sustained in practice, if these specific aged care facilities continue to prioritise grief and loss issues, and implement a range of strategies to address pain management, such as standardised assessment tools, end of life clinical pathways, and ongoing audits and case reviews. Critical to the success of these initiatives is the support for staff, who deliver end of life care, to believe they have a voice and feel supported by their facilities, to constantly examine clinical practices and plan and implement strategies to improve care. The practical strategies generated and used in this project can be utilised in other aged care facilities by nurses, educators, managers and other health professionals, with whom they resonate...|$|R
40|$|Thomas Mann’s {{repeated}} and lifelong {{insistence on the}} musical aspect of hís writing provokes the question what can be meant by this “musical” quality in his work. With his models, Schopenhauer and Wagner, in mind the suggestion is put forward that an investigation into Mann’s method, of integrating the various aspects of his work along quasi-musical lines will provide some rewarding insights. The investigation proceeds from a general consideration of the structural possibilities open to the novelist. The major theories {{on the structure of}} the novel are briefly discussed with particular attention to the questions of the effects of series and system, of the formation of thematic spheres, and of the influence of the narrator on such spheres {{as well as on the}} aspect of time in the novel. Structure is discussed in the two major divisions of inner and outer structure, and definitions of these are proposed. Mann’s first novel, Buddenbrooks, is used to show his treatment of a traditional novel structure and his first extended use of the technique of repetition, quotation and leitmotif, which became the basis of his later structural technique. Starting from the vista of musical possibilities which opened to Mann after the completion of Buddenbrooks, the relationships between the techniques of musical and literary composition are discussed in some detail. The application of musical principle in literature is shown in Mann’s novelle Tonio Kruger which is seen as a summary of his new view of literary technique. The development of this technique is shown in the novel Roy- al Highness which is investigated as a closely integrated system of themes and discussed from the view point of musical technique. The fully musical style is shown in Mann’s major novel, The Magic Mountain, as a dialectical system of thought integrated through the use of musical principles. The development from a simple transference of musical patterns to literature into a constellation of ideas presented through a quasi-musical technique of composition is discussed in connection with this novel. With reference to Mann’s earlier demand for minimum action in the novel a further step in the development of his technique is show to have been taken with his four-volume novel Joseph and His Brothers. Here the action is no longer limited in order to permit full treatment of the thematic material. Detailed investigation shows a gain in scope and depth through the integration of the <b>action</b> into the <b>thematic</b> constellation. The <b>action</b> itself with its repetitions and variations of basic roles and situations is now seen as a formal pattern and treated as one of the major themes of the novel. After a brief discussion of the novel Lotte in Weimar which departs from the “web-of-themes” style, a final metamorphosis of the musical technique is delineated in Mann’s novel Doctor Faustus, which treats music itself as one of its themes. These themes form a constellation patterned on the tone-row system of Schroenbergrs’s music. They are connected and integrated in the musical style of that system and are presented dynamically in a shifting perspective which brings different themes into the foreground and shows the whole constellation under varying aspects. The overall investigation underlines how the various ideas and themes derive their meaning from their position in musically integrated, formally patterned, constellations of ideas. Thesis (Ph. D.)
