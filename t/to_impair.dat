5|$|Jayakumar {{said that}} while the Government {{recognized}} that the subjective test enhanced the potential for abuse of executive discretion under the ISA, the best safeguard against such abuse of power was not to give the courts powers of judicial review because an unscrupulous government could still tamper with the composition of the courts <b>to</b> <b>impair</b> this judicial check. Instead, the crucial safeguard was for the electorate to make wise voting choices to put an honest and incorruptible government into power.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Nine-E was {{influenced}} by a high pressure area located over Mexico, causing it to move 16mph (26km/h) to the north-west. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hernan overnight as the storm became more organized. Although Hernan was located over warm waters, moderate wind shear prevented the storm from intensifying quickly, and the storm slowed. Hernan slowly became better organized throughout the night, but wind shear continued <b>to</b> <b>impair</b> Hernan through the morning; as a result, most of the tropical cyclone forecast models did not predict Hernan to become a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} raid inland and against RAF airfields came on 12 August, and the Luftwaffe quickly {{escalated}} its offensive. The Germans did not achieve {{a degree of}} success commensurate with their exertions on this date. Nevertheless, in the belief they were having considerable effect on Fighter Command, they prepared to launch their all-out assault on the RAF the following day. By 13 August, German air strength had reached acceptable levels. After bringing its serviceable rates up, the Luftwaffe carried out heavy attacks under the codename Adlertag (or Eagle Day), with 71 per cent of its bomber force, 85 per cent of its Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter units, and 83 per cent of its Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter/fighter-bomber units operational. The day went badly for the Germans, who failed <b>to</b> <b>impair</b> Fighter Command and its bases or command and control system. This was {{due in large part}} to poor intelligence, which failed to identify Fighter Command airfields and distinguish them from those of Bomber and Coastal Commands. Still, the Germans pursued their strategy against Fighter Command on 15 August, suffering 76 losses. Undeterred, they prepared to make another large-scale attack on RAF bases on 18 August. The month of August witnessed an escalation in air combat, as the Germans made a concentrated effort against Fighter Command.|$|E
