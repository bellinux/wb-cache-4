Typically these nests only have one entrance and it faces the tree trunk. The outside of the nest is made from leaves and twigs. The inside of the nest has a lining that is created from bark and moss pieces.

50|$|Revisiting {{the first}} story arc from Grant Morrison's run on the Marvel Comics title New X-Men, Professor X is holding {{a gun to his}} head, ready to shoot himself in order to prevent the twin sister he killed in the womb from make her way to Cerebra (in order to take over his mind). The psychic backlashed knocked out Jean Grey and put her in a coma while {{encasing}} her inside the Phoenix Egg. 10 years after the death of Professor X, Magneto has his own institute with 90% mutant students, as well as his own team of X-Men consisting of the students who attended Xorn’s Special Class in the original run. A group calling themselves The Patient show up to commit violence on the mutants. They’re presumably humans who have genetically given themselves powers and they want to kill off the real mutants. Magneto shows up with his X-Men, all young and with a few familiar faces like Angel Salvadore, Basilisk, Beak, Dust, Glob Herman, Ernst, No-Girl, Redneck, the Stepford Cuckoos, and Tattoo. Another group of middle-age X-Men eventually do show up, albeit late and pathetic. Cyclops pretends like he’s still the guy leading an entire race, but he just makes a fool of himself. Magneto establishes here that Cyclops and Emma Frost are basically a bunch of has-beens since their powers are fading away. Even the rest of Magneto’s team goes {{out of their way to}} berate them and not in a very good way. Meanwhile, at a mutant medical center, Beast is helping out a couple of prospective parents. Apparently, <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> their child is a mutant. In a domain where mutants are the majority, just being normal is basically a handicap so <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> their kid has that advantage. Later, Wolverine is approached by Cyclops at a bar saying he has a mission and it involves Jean Grey. As it turns out Magneto has had Jean Grey locked away at the school for quite some time now. Magneto then explains to Esme Cuckoo that Jean Grey fell into a coma after Professor X killed himself. Apparently, their minds were linked during the struggle against Cassandra Nova. Now she’s stuck in this pseudo-Phoenix Egg and he wants to wake her up. Unbeknownst to him, Cyclops had an informant inside his ranks and discovered Jean was in his possession. To try and save Jean, Cyclops assembled the old X-Men Emma Frost and Wolverine and released Xorn from his prison that was run by the U-Men so that he could help them.|$|E
50|$|Lydia is {{introduced}} to the first officer Mr. Watterson and then sees the other passengers who will be traveling with her. She immediately recognizes {{two of them to}} be the two men who had asked if she was all right previously on the docks in Boston. The two men are Mr. James Staniford and Mr. Charles Dunham. The third man Lydia does not recognize; his name is Mr. Hicks. Staniford and Dunham are both well to do men from New England who are in their late twenties. Mr. Hicks is also a young man but he does not look well when Lydia sees him. Captain Jenness explains that Hicks is a drunk and he is aboard the ship trying to straighten himself up. Dunham and Staniford, once in their room, show some disgust that Lydia is such a young girl yet she is being treated so well already. They also look down on Hicks and treat him as if he is of a lower class. Staniford and Dunham are very interested in knowing more about Lydia and <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that she feels comfortable on the ship after finding out that she will be the only woman on board, they even comment on her unmistakable beauty to each other.

5000|$|The {{name and}} crest were {{unveiled}} on January 30, 2016. San Francisco Deltas CEO Brian Helmick wrote [...] "DELTA means CHANGE. In {{the city of}} change and innovation, {{our goal is to}} take risks and grow the world's sport for fans in the entire Bay Area." [...] during a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) session in February 2017. When coming up with name and crest, the operations team listened to a lot of fan input before making a decision. The name came about through eight major points: 1) No animals, there are too many animal team names; 2) Don't copy European Club Soccer in terms of naming, be original; 3) Europe is known for crests and nobility, but the USA is not; 4) With 40% of the people living in San Francisco not being born in the USA, <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> the name can be pronounced in most languages (e.g. [...] "th" [...] doesn't exist in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, etc.); 5) Less is more, don't make it complicated; 6) Take risks and be different, SF is all about taking risks and being different; 7) Don't manufacture history, own the fact that you're a new team, pick a name and let your actions develop your brand and not your colors, font type, design ,etc; 8) Don't over-explain things, let fans create their own relationship with the club for their own reasons. The fourth letter in the Greek alphabet is Delta and the symbol is a triangle and has connections with both soccer (Cruyff and possession football) and SF (Twin Peaks, Transamerica Pyramid, the towers and cables of the bridges form triangles, etc.).|$|E
