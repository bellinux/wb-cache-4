5|$|The {{pancreatic}} islets {{make up the}} endocrine part of the pancreas, and synthesize and secrete hormones including insulin into <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b> There {{is evidence}} that the beta cells in the islets that synthesize insulin contain dopamine receptors, and that dopamine acts {{to reduce the amount of}} insulin they release. The source of their dopamine input is not clearly established—it may come from dopamine that circulates in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.|$|E
5|$|Clearing waste: CSF {{allows for}} the removal of waste {{products}} from the brain, and is critical in the brain's lymphatic system. Metabolic waste products diffuse rapidly into the CSF and are removed into <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> as CSF is absorbed.|$|E
5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis {{is achieved by}} instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream,</b> such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} later takes a mysterious turn as it shows no {{connection}} between the lower alien forms and higher alien forms. Eventually, however, it is found {{the leaders of the}} invasion are the Micronoids, a race of sapient single-celled organisms that live in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams</b> of <b>the</b> other aliens; the ultimate goal of the invasion is to inject Micronoids into <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams</b> of important figures, allowing them to control Mega-Primus through psionic domination of their hosts. The player is eventually tasked with invading the aliens' homeworld and destroying their side of the gate as the only way to stop the Micronoid infestation.|$|R
40|$|Mice were {{infected}} intravenously with a sublethal dose of Listeria monocytogenes cells and then levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams,</b> spleens, and livers were monitored. The maximum level of TNF was detected at 72 h in the spleens and livers, but TNF was never detected in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams.</b> IL- 6 appeared in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams</b> and spleens and peaked at 48 h. The maximum level of IFN-gamma could be detected {{in all three}} specimens, and the highest titer was shown in the spleens. Endogenous TNF production was suppressed by in vivo administration of anti-CD 4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) or anti-asialo GM 1 antibody but not by anti-CD 8 MAb, whereas none of these antibodies suppressed endogenous IL- 6 production. Endogenous production of neither IL- 6 nor IFN-gamma was inhibited in rabbit anti-recombinant mouse TNF-alpha antibody-treated mice. Similarly, production of TNF and IL- 6 did not decrease in anti-mouse IFN-gamma MAb-treated animals, but TNF production was augmented in these animals. These {{results suggest that the}} these endogenous cytokines are produced by different mechanisms in L. monocytogenes infection...|$|R
5|$|In {{the heart}} of lungfish, the septum extends part-way into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of {{separation}} between <b>the</b> de-oxygenated <b>bloodstream</b> destined for <b>the</b> lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered {{to the rest of}} the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between <b>the</b> two <b>bloodstreams</b> than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle does seem to maintain more of a separation between <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams.</b> Also, <b>the</b> original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep <b>the</b> two <b>bloodstreams</b> separate.|$|R
5|$|When ingested, {{only about}} 0.05% of {{samarium}} salts is absorbed into <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> {{and the remainder}} is excreted. From the blood, about 45% goes to the liver and 45% is deposited {{on the surface of}} the bones where it remains for about 10 years; the balance 10% is excreted.|$|E
5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b> When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> {{in order to}} modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development. The table of human serpins (below) provides examples {{of the range of}} functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some of}} the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E
5000|$|PSGs are {{extremely}} vital to development {{and health of}} a fetus. Specifically they are important in inducing, enhancing or inhibiting an immune response. PSGs regulate lymphocytes and without {{the presence of the}} PSGs the fetus would be susceptible to various types of immune attacks from <b>the</b> maternal <b>bloodstream.</b> [...] This includes immune responses to things such as inflammation, infection, and trauma which may occur during pregnancy. In addition PSG presence within <b>the</b> maternal <b>bloodstream</b> can induce <b>the</b> secretion of growth factors affecting fetal growth. Low levels of PSGs in <b>the</b> maternal <b>bloodstream</b> are associated with higher occurrences of abortion, fetal retardation, low birth weight and hypoxia.|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{emergence}} of MDR-TB, surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It involves removal of infected chest cavities ("bullae") in the lungs {{to reduce the number of}} bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b> Hopes of completely eliminating TB were ended with the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Concentrations of {{midazolam}} or {{its major}} metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, may {{be measured in}} plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor for safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. Patients with renal dysfunction may exhibit prolongation of elimination half-life for both the parent drug and its active metabolite, with accumulation of these two substances in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> {{and the appearance of}} adverse depressant effects.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream,</b> as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream.</b>|$|E
25|$|Single {{positive}} thymocytes {{remain in}} the medulla for 1–2 weeks, surveying self-antigens to test for autoreactivity. During this time they undergo final maturational changes, and then exit the thymus using S1P and CCR7.

40|$|It {{has been}} presumed that gamma {{interferon}} (IFN-gamma), which plays {{an essential role}} in antilisterial resistance, is produced late in Listeria monocytogenes infection. In the present study, however, IFN-gamma was detected in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams</b> and spleens of mice from days 1 to 4 of L. monocytogenes infection by both a double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an immunohistochemical technique, suggesting that endogenous IFN-gamma is produced early but not late in L. monocytogenes infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} and roles of endogenous gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in both lethal and nonlethal infections of Staphylococcus aureus were investigated in mice. In {{the case of}} nonlethal infection, although no bacteria were detected in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams,</b> bacteria that colonized and proliferated persistently for 3 weeks {{were found in the}} kidneys. All mice given lethal injections died within 7 days, and large numbers of bacteria were detected in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams,</b> spleens, and kidneys. The first peaks of IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL- 6 were observed in <b>the</b> <b>bloodstreams</b> and spleens of the mice with nonlethal and lethal infections within 24 h. Thereafter, in the nonlethal cases, IFN-gamma, TNF, and IL- 6 peaked again in the spleens and kidneys during the period of maximum growth of bacteria in the kidneys, although only IL- 6 was detected in the sera. In contrast, in the case of lethal infection, the titers of IFN-gamma and IL- 6 in the sera and TNF in the kidneys peaked before death. Effects of in vivo administration of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against IFN-gamma and TNF on the fates of S. aureus-infected mice were studied. In the nonlethal infections, anti-TNF alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) MAb-treated mice, but not anti-IFN-gamma MAb-treated mice, {{died as a result of}} worsening infection, suggesting that endogenous TNF plays a protective role in host resistance to S. aureus infection. In the mice that received lethal doses, injection of anti-TNF-alpha MAb accelerated death. However, although injection of anti-IFN-gamma MAb inhibited host resistance of the infected mice early in infection, most of the animals survived the lethal infection by injection of anti-IFN-gamma MAb, suggesting that endogenous IFN-gamma plays a detrimental role in S. aureus infection. Thus, this study demonstrated that IFN-gamma and TNF play different roles in S. aureus infection...|$|R

5|$|In 1985 {{biochemist}} David Dolphin {{proposed a}} link between the rare blood disorder porphyria and vampire folklore.

5|$|Malaria {{infection}} develops via two phases: {{one that}} involves the liver (exoerythrocytic phase), and one that involves red blood cells, or erythrocytes (erythrocytic phase). When an infected mosquito pierces a person's skin to take a blood meal, sporozoites in the mosquito's saliva enter <b>the</b> <b>bloodstream</b> and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes, multiplying asexually and asymptomatically {{for a period of}} 8–30 days.|$|E

50|$|Since fetal and {{maternal}} blood cells {{have the same}} life expectancy in <b>the</b> maternal <b>bloodstream,</b> {{it is possible to}} obtain informative results from a KB stain for a fair period of time after a stillbirth. However, if the mother and fetus are ABO incompatible, it is more crucial to quickly perform the KB stain following a stillbirth, as the fetal red blood cells will be eliminated from <b>the</b> maternal <b>bloodstream</b> very quickly, causing the KB stain to underestimate the degree of FMH, if any.|$|R
