50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} shafts - the input shaft, the output shaft, and the intermediate shaft. This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate <b>shift</b> <b>fork</b> shafts, which hold three <b>shift</b> <b>forks</b> to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} the three gear shafts. The <b>shift</b> <b>forks</b> are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds the input shaft in the clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. The input shaft carries the 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, the intermediate shaft carries the 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and the output shaft carries the 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|R

50|$|Shift quality: Shift {{quality is}} the driver’s {{perception}} of the vehicle to an automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> event. This {{is influenced by the}} powertrain (engine, transmission), and the vehicle (driveline, suspension, engine and powertrain mounts, etc.) Shift feel is both a tactile (felt) and audible (heard) response of the vehicle. Shift quality is experienced as various events: <b>Transmission</b> <b>shifts</b> are felt as an upshift at acceleration (1-2), or a downshift maneuver in passing (4-2). Shift engagements of the vehicle are also evaluated, as in Park to Reverse, etc.|$|R

50|$|The 409 was {{the last}} Bristol V8 to feature {{dashboard}} transmission selector buttons. The subsequent Bristol 410 sported a central <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> lever, {{as well as a}} more streamlined frontal design.|$|R
40|$|The {{neural network}} control model of {{automobile}} automatic transmission has been developed, which make the optimum shift {{decision based on}} the vehicle velocity, the vehicle acceleration and the throttle opening. The MAX-MIN ant syste (MMAS) is introduced to train the neural network weights and thresholds. The basic theory and steps of MMAS algorithm are given, and applied in the automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> control. Experimental {{results show that the}} automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> control system based on MMAS, comparing to the system based on ACO-BP, has better capability of gear recognition, and can make shift decision promptly and effectively. </em...|$|R
5000|$|In 1938, {{the company}} offered a {{remote-controlled}} [...] "Miracle-Shift" [...] transmission which featured a dashboard-mounted shifter. The unit was discontinued in 1939 when the <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> lever {{was moved to}} the steering column.|$|R
50|$|Automatic <b>Transmission</b> <b>shift</b> lock was {{mechanism}} {{instead of}} an electrical control, a unique method that deregulation was mechanically wire extending from the brake pedal. This was also {{the advantage of being}} unaffected by the battery.|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{motorcycles}} have a sequential manual <b>transmission</b> <b>shifted</b> by a foot lever. Some motorcycles, {{and many}} scooters, use a continuously variable transmission. Other types of automatic transmission and semi-automatic transmission {{are also in}} use.|$|R
50|$|In 2014 GM has {{recalled}} the vehicle regarding {{a condition in}} which the <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> cable may fracture. The fracture prevents the driver from selecting gears and may cause the vehicle to move in an unintended direction.|$|R
5000|$|The Tremec TR-6060 {{six-speed}} {{manual transmission}} features six forward speeds and one reverse speed. It {{is derived from}} the Tremec T-56 6-speed manual transmission. As usual, the forward helical cut gears are synchronized however, the reverse gear operates through a fully synchronized constant-mesh system. The TR-6060 contains removable wear pads on the <b>shift</b> <b>forks,</b> and uses aluminum alloys for the main case, extension housing, and clutch housing. It is manufactured by TREMEC (formerly Transmission Technologies Corporation) and is rated for [...] of torque.|$|R
50|$|Hewland Mk.III of 1962 {{became the}} first product for the public, which {{utilised}} the magnesium alloy case of the Beetle transaxle to house 5 pairs of bespoke straight-cut constant mesh spur gears with dog rings operated by custom-made brass <b>shift</b> <b>forks.</b> Gear selector shaft was located in the nose housing, unmodified as in the Beetle set up, facing rear-ward {{at the tail end}} of the box in the front-side-back position on a midship engine racing cars. The elimination of synchromesh parts provided the space for an additional pair of gears for the 5th speed.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  6, the {{simulation}} and experimental results consist well with each other. Both curves from simulations and experiments {{are similar to}} pulse curves. However, {{the tops of the}} experimental curves are not quite stable comparing to the simulation ones. The reason for the instability is high stiffness of hydraulic system. There will be disturbance when the pistons of pneumatic- hydraulic <b>transmission</b> sharply <b>shift.</b> In addition, slight lag happens when the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifts</b> phase, and that is because in the hydraulic chambers the left hydraulic fluid left blocks the motion of the pistons.|$|R
25|$|The direct-shift gearbox uses a {{floor-mounted}} <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> lever, {{very similar}} to that of a conventional automatic transmission. The lever is operated in a straight 'fore and aft' plane (without any 'dog-leg' offset movements), and uses an additional button to help prevent an inadvertent selection of an inappropriate shift lever position.|$|R
50|$|Generally speaking, {{overdrive}} is {{the highest}} gear in the transmission. Overdrive allows the engine to operate at a lower RPM for a given road speed. This allows the vehicle to achieve better fuel efficiency, and often quieter operation on the highway. When it is switched on, an automatic <b>transmission</b> can <b>shift</b> into overdrive mode after a certain speed is reached (usually 70+ km/h mph or more depending on the load). When it is off, the automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> {{is limited to the}} lower gears. Overdrive should usually be selected when the average speed is above 70 km/h (40-45 mph).|$|R

50|$|A dog-leg gearbox is {{a manual}} <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> pattern {{distinguished}} by an up-over-up shift between {{first and second}} gear. The layout derives its name from a dog's hind leg, with its sharp angles. Dog leg gearboxes have fallen out of fashion primarily because most manual performance cars now have six-speed gearboxes, which are unsuited to the dog-leg layout.|$|R
50|$|The Police Interceptor engine {{calibration}} {{includes a}} slightly higher idle speed (by approximately 40 rpm) and minor changes in the emissions settings. The computer is tuned for more aggressive <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> points, and the transmission itself is built for firmer and harder shifts. The EGR system is controlled differently on 03+ vehicles than on 03+ non-police vehicles.|$|R
40|$|Neural {{networks}} {{have already been}} applied to <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> control, with its nonlinear fitting feature. To solve the problem that the network parameters highly depend on human prior knowledge, ant colony algorithm is often chosen to optimize the parameters. In order to achieve the global optimization with better performance, the MAX-MIN ant system (MMAS) is applied in BP neural network control model of automobile automatic transmission, which makes the optimum shift decision based on the vehicle velocity, the vehicle acceleration and the throttle opening, namingly three-parameter model in shift control domain. MMAS is used to search the optimal initial weights and thresholds of back-propagation (BP) neural networks. Results on field data show that the automatic <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> control system based on MMAS and BP networks, comparing to the system based on traditional ant coolly optimization algorithm and BP, can accelerate convergence and better network performance...|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis {{deals with}} design of {{manipulator}} which manipulate {{the types of}} <b>shift</b> <b>forks</b> 1 / 5, 2 / 4, 3 / 7 and 6 /R. The machine takes parts from the belt, which transports them from mark station. Parts are moved to the straightening machine by manipulator. Straightened parts are transported on the storage place, from which are sorted into the boxes and palletized by robot. As a part of work is the proposal of alternativ solutions, selecting the best solution, {{the design of the}} chosen variant and technical calculations of the main parts of the manipulator.

50|$|Shift by wire is {{the system}} by which the {{transmission}} modes are engaged/changed in an automobile through electronic controls without any mechanical linkage between the gear shifting lever and the <b>transmission.</b> The <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> was traditionally accomplished by mechanical links to put the vehicle in Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive positions through a lever mounted on the steering column or a gear shifter near the center console.|$|R
5000|$|Fluid Drive {{could also}} be mated to the {{semi-automatic}} transmission, which was not automatic in any way {{and should not be}} confused with Fluid Drive. With the semi-automatic <b>transmissions,</b> the driver <b>shifted</b> manually, selecting reverse or a low range and a high range. Each 'range' had two speeds. To shift between them, the driver accelerated then released pressure on the accelerator. In high range, this shift point was about 23 mph (37 kmh). The <b>transmission</b> <b>shifted</b> into high speed range, the driver then depressed the accelerator pedal, and continued accelerating. The solenoids on the transmission connected to the carburetor and ignition system and momentarily interrupted engine operation to allow trouble-free shifting.|$|R
40|$|A vehicle {{comparison}} methodology {{based on}} the Otto-Engine Equivalent (OEE) vehicle concept is described. As an illustration of this methodology, the concept is used to make projections of the fuel economy potential of passenger cars using various alternative power systems. Sensitivities of OEE vehicle results to assumptions made in the calculational procedure are discussed. Factors considered include engine torque boundary, rear axle ratio, performance criteria, engine transient response, and <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> logic...|$|R
50|$|Toyota {{announced}} a voluntary recall of 2005 to 2008 Toyota Corollas and Matrixes equipped with 1ZZ-FE engines. The issue involves the engine control module, and includes {{the potential for}} it to develop a crack on the module's circuit board, which can result in the car not starting, the <b>transmission</b> <b>shifting</b> harshly, or the engine stalling. Additionally, Pontiac {{announced a}} voluntary recall of Pontiac Vibes from years 2005 to 2008 for the same issue.|$|R

50|$|A {{parking pawl}} is a device fitted to a motor vehicle's {{automatic}} transmission {{in order for}} it to lock up the transmission. It is engaged when the <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> lever selector {{is placed in the}} Park position, which is always the first position (topmost on a column shift, frontmost on a floor shift) in all cars sold in the United States since 1965 (when the order was standardised by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)) through SAE J915, and in most other vehicles worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Electrohydraulic manual {{transmission}} {{is a type}} of semi-automatic transmission system, which uses an automated clutch unlike conventional {{manual transmission}}s where the driver operates the clutch. The clutch is controlled by electronic computers and hydraulics. To change gears, the driver selects the desired gear with the <b>transmission</b> <b>shift</b> lever, and the system automatically operates the clutch and throttle to match revs and engage the clutch again. Also, many such transmissions operate in sequential mode where the driver can only upshift or downshift by one gear at a time.|$|R
