5|$|The {{increased}} osmolal gap {{is caused}} by the ethylene glycol itself. As the metabolism of ethylene glycol progresses <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> ethylene glycol and this will decrease the blood ethylene glycol concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful. Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, or methanol or conditions such as alcoholic or diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Two hazards {{are uniquely}} {{identified}} with the dam. One is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, {{and the other is}} that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion, depositing about 40million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> sediment downstream.|$|E
25|$|In Singapore, judges {{can only}} be removed for misbehaviour or incapacity. Removal of a judge of the Supreme Court may only be {{effected}} upon the recommendation of a tribunal {{of his or her}} peers. Such a system is arguably better than a system of removal by politicians in securing judicial independence as <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> exploitation by politicians seeking to influence judges.|$|E

25|$|Various {{species of}} plants and animals, {{including}} humans, have different lifespans. Evolutionary theory states that organisms that, {{by virtue of their}} defenses or lifestyle, live for long periods and avoid accidents, disease, predation, etc. are likely to have genes that code for slow aging, which often translates to good cellular repair. One theory is that if predation or accidental deaths prevent most individuals from living to an old age, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> natural selection to increase the intrinsic life span. That finding was supported in a classic study of opossums by Austad; however, the opposite relationship was found in an equally prominent study of guppies by Reznick.|$|E
500|$|Politics {{dominated}} {{network news}} in 1992. Jennings moderated the final debate among the Democratic presidential candidates in March, and anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: Who Is Ross Perot? and a subsequent 90-minute town forum with Perot and a studio audience in June. On September 9, 1992, ABC {{announced that it}} would be switching the format of its political coverage to give less recognition to staged sound bites. [...] "We're aware that a lot of you are turned off by the political process and that many of you put {{at least some of the}} blame on us," [...] Jennings told viewers on World News Tonight. [...] "We'll only devote time to a candidate's daily routine if it is more than routine. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> attention to staged appearances and sound bites designed exclusively for television." [...] After Bill Clinton was elected as president in November 1992, Jennings featured the new administration in two of his specials for children; he anchored President Clinton: Answering Children's Questions in February 1993; and Kids in the Crossfire: Violence in America in November 1993, a live special from a Washington, D.C. junior high school which featured Attorney General Janet Reno and rapper MC Lyte.|$|E

2500|$|Currently, {{there is}} a new field of gaming called Neurogaming, which uses {{non-invasive}} BCI in order to improve gameplay so that users can interact with a console without the use of a traditional controller. Some Neurogaming software use a player's brain waves, heart rate, expressions, pupil dilation, and even emotions to complete tasks or affect the mood of the game. For example, game developers at Emotiv have created non-invasive BCI that will determine the mood of a player and adjust music or scenery accordingly. This new form of interaction between player and software will enable a player to have a more realistic gaming experience. Because <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>less</b> disconnect between a player and console, Neurogaming will allow individuals to utilize their [...] "psychological state" [...] and have their reactions transfer to games in real-time.|$|E
