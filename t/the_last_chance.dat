5|$|Both Internazionale and Celtic {{had been}} {{performing}} well domestically throughout the season. Only {{a few days}} before the final Internazionale had been on the verge of winning a historic treble but losses in their last two games knocked them out of the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia and cost them the Scudetto. The European Cup was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>chance</b> for them to redeem what had initially been such a promising season. Celtic came into the final having already won the First Division, the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup as well as the Glasgow Cup earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|However, Liverpool did {{score from}} their next attack. Gerrard played a {{ball into the}} West Ham penalty area, which went {{over the head of}} defender Scaloni and was met by striker Djibril Cissé, who scored to make it 2–1. Ashton came close to {{extending}} West Ham's lead in the 37th minute, but his effort went wide of the post after beating goalkeeper Reina. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>chance</b> of the half came in the 44th minute when Liverpool defender Steve Finnan sliced a clearance straight to striker Harewood, however his shot went out for a throw-in.|$|E

5|$|Gauri {{tried for}} several weeks to persuade Chrisye to commit to the concert, and {{following}} Chrisye's introduction to Erwin Gutawa, who was scheduled to handle the arrangements, Jay Subyakto succeeded in convincing him {{that it might be}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>chance</b> to revive his career. Lacking the necessary funding, they approached RCTI in search of sponsorship but were refused, and laughingly told that they should try holding a concert at the National Monument. Undeterred, Chrisye, Subaktyo, and Gutawa put together a group of artists and began rehearsals. Around the time of RCTI's fourth anniversary, the television station relented and agreed to fund the concert as part of their celebrations; the thousands of tickets available sold out within a week.|$|E
5|$|Milan almost {{took the}} lead in the 70th minute, after Dudek dropped a low cross towards Shevchenko, whose effort was cleared off the line by Traore. Gerrard then had a chance to score but he sent his shot over the crossbar. About ten minutes later García could not control a pass from Gerrard which led to a Milan attack, Crespo played the ball back to Kaka, whose {{subsequent}} shot was blocked by Jamie Carragher. A number of substitutions were made before the end of full-time with Liverpool replacing Milan Baroš with Djibril Cissé, while Milan replaced Hernán Crespo and Clarence Seedorf with Jon Dahl Tomasson and Serginho respectively. Milan had <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>chance</b> before full-time but Kaka failed to direct Jaap Stam's header towards goal, meaning the final would go to extra time for the 13th time in the competition's history.|$|E
5|$|Oshawa's hopes in the Cup Final {{were damaged}} when Orr {{suffered}} a groin injury against Shawinigan, an injury that is painful and weakens a player's skating ability. To promote the event, held in Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, the Generals had advertised {{it would be}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>chance</b> to see Orr in junior and were anxious for him to play. Bruins' management demanded Orr not play in the Final, not wanting to risk further damage to their property. Orr and his parents, however, were adamant he be allowed {{to play for the}} national championship. As he had not signed to the Bruins, they threatened he would never play for Boston if he was held out. Blair decided to defy the Bruins' ownership and let Orr play. While Orr dressed and played some, he was not a factor and Edmonton defeated Oshawa for the Cup. Oshawa coach Bep Guidolin was fired for letting Orr play, while Blair left the organization of his own accord to join the expansion Minnesota North Stars.|$|E

The team, which was bounced from Regions, came through by winning <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>chance</b> Challenge Round, qualifying them for the 2009 Ontario Scotties Tournament of Hearts.

The team shocked the curling world by winning the event, having to defeat their club mates, the World #1 ranked Rachel Homan rink in the final.

The race dipped into Spain for some 50 kilometres at the summit, the fourth country visited in this year's Tour.

He submitted a plan to Hanoi in May 1967. After Thanh's death in July, Giáp was assigned to implement this plan, now known as the Tet Offensive. The Parrot's Beak, an area in Cambodia only 30 miles from Saigon, was prepared as a base of operations. Funeral processions were used to smuggle weapons into Saigon. Việt Cộng entered the cities concealed among civilians returning home for Tết. The U.S. and South Vietnamese expected that an announced seven-day truce would be observed during Vietnam's main holiday.|$|E

She received the damehood from Governor Chris Patten in the Government House on 19 April 1997.
