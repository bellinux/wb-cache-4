5|$|From December 12, 1994, to January 2000, the PGSO did not hire any new deputies or {{civilian}} employees, leaving <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> with 92 vacant {{positions that}} needed to be filled. Over that period, 66 deputies left <b>the</b> <b>agency,</b> some retiring routinely, others leaving due to increased workloads caused by vacant positions. In some cases, deputies worked sixteen hours in one day, eight in courtrooms, and eight serving warrants. In December 1994, <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> had 248 deputies, whereas on January 20, 2000, it only had 192 deputies, with 20 leaving from November 1998 to January 2000.

Computers were also in short supply, and the few that were in use were outdated and obsolete.|$|E

5|$|On November9, {{an area of}} disorganized convection, or thunderstorms, persisted about 1175km (730mi) {{southeast}} of Palau. The system consisted of a broad circulation, affected to its detriment by moderate wind shear.

Late on November10, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), meaning <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> anticipated a tropical depression would develop within 24hours.

Once all three gangs are fully exterminated, in the closing cutscene of the game, the Director reveals to the Agent {{that there was an}} ulterior motive for the Agency's actions: <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> had secretly empowered the three gangs in the first place to instill fear in Pacific City's residents, thus creating a need for <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> to control the city, and acceptance in the populace when they did take over. <b>The</b> <b>Agency</b> Director's comments suggest that <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> will replicate this plan in other cities across the globe to create a New World Order.|$|E

5|$|After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), many Poles {{believed}} that revolutionary France, whose public opinion was very {{sympathetic to the}} ideals of the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, would come to Poland's aid.
