500|$|... "Summertime" [...] was {{the only}} song which {{appeared}} on the soundtrack album of The Fighting Temptations {{but not in the}} movie itself. As a whole, seven tracks featured the vocals of Beyoncé. The latter has a starring role in the film, along with a choir made up of gospel, R and hip-hop recording artists. Faith Evans, Angie Stone, Melba Moore, Rev. Shirley Caesar, The O'Jays, Montell Jordan, T-Bone, and Zane are all seen on the film and perform on the soundtrack. [...] "Summertime" [...] was written by Beyoncé, Angela Beyincé, Sean Combs, Steven [...] "Steven J." [...] Jordan, Adonis Shropshire, Varick [...] "Smitty" [...] Smith and Mario Winans while production was handled by Winans and P. Diddy. Tim Sendra of Allmusic describes [...] "Summertime" [...] as an R [...] "sweet love song" [...] with lush sampled strings and acoustic guitars. The lyrics of the song do not reveal the film's plot, but they do tell that it has been a year since Darrin and Lilly met and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> closer which could possibly be referring to their marriage. According to Dani Boobyer of the UK-based website The Situation, its lyrics make reference to [...] "failing in love in the summer sun." ...|$|E

Cohen had previously received a credit for [...] "Hex and the City", the first segment of [...] "Treehouse of Horror XII" [...] which aired the previous year. [...] "Brawl in the Family" [...] originally aired on January 6, 2002 on the Fox network. It was the first episode for which current showrunner Al Jean served as sole showrunner. It was the second of his episodes to air however, since the Christmas-themed [...] "She of Little Faith", the second episode he produced, was chosen to air first as it would coincide with the holiday. The idea for the episode was pitched by Jean, who wanted to make a follow-up to the season 10 episode [...] "Viva Ned Flanders". In it, Homer takes Ned to Las Vegas to teach him how to have fun. While there, the two get intoxicated and wake up the next morning to find that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> married to two cocktail waitresses, Amber and Ginger. The episode ends with Homer and Ned walking home from Vegas. Jean felt that the ending to [...] "Viva Ned Flanders" [...] was [...] "a bit loose" [...] because [...] "...if you leave a wife in Vegas, they track you down." [...] He pitched [...] "Brawl in the Family" [...] in order to [...] "resolve it [...]" [...] Amber and Ginger were portrayed by Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Luke Duke (Tom Wopat) is the dark-haired, older Duke boy. More {{mature and}} {{rational}} than his cousin Bo, he is typically {{the one who}} thinks of the plan that will get the two out of whatever trouble <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> into. Luke wears a checked blue shirt (a plain blue shirt in most, though not all, second-season episodes) and a denim jacket over it in first season and a few later second-season which means he wears Double Denim episodes and he also wears Dark Blue jeans with a belt with a fish belt buckle with black boots and later brown boots {{and a few other}} checker and plaid shirts in later episodes and seasons of the show. He is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a former boxer. Luke was the first Duke to perform the [...] "hood slide" [...] across The General Lee, which is seen in the opening credits of the show (a shot taken from the second episode, [...] "Daisy's Song") and later told by Tom Wopat to be an accident, because his foot got caught {{on the side of the}} General Lee when he attempted to jump across the hood; he also caught his thigh on the hood's radio antenna, cutting himself, resulting in such antennas being removed from later versions of the General Lee which those later versions looked similar to the ones in The Dukes of Hazzard film. However, the [...] "hood slide" [...] quickly proved popular and became a regular staple of episodes. The only episode to directly reference the age difference between Luke and Bo is in the seventh season opener, the [...] "flashback" [...] episode [...] "Happy Birthday, General Lee," [...] where it is stated that Luke had already been in the Marines while Bo was in his last year at high school.

He took great delight here, and, had he lived to enjoy it in peace, had purposed to make it another thing than it was.

This Beat is in effect the object of their devotion, the idol which they adore: for, let them be never so far distant from it, East, West, North, or South of it, they will be sure to bow down towards it; but when they are at the Beat, they may go on which side they please and pay their Sallah towards it.[FN#14] Sometimes there are several hundreds at Towoaf at once, especially after Acshamnomas, or fourth time of service, which is after candle-lighting (as you heard before), and these both men and women, but the women walk on the outside the men, and the men nearest to the Beat. In so great a resort as this, it is not to be supposed that every individual person can come to kiss the stone afore-mentioned; therefore, in such a case, the lifting up the hands towards it, smoothing down their faces, and using a short expression of devotion, as Allah-waick barick, i.e. Blessed God, or Allah cabor, i.e. Great God, some such like; and so passing by it till opportunity of kissing it offers, is thought sufficient.[FN#15] But when there are but few men at Towoaf, then the women get opportunity to kiss the said stone, and when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> it, they close in with it as they come round, and walk round as quick as they can to come to it again, and keep possession of it for a considerable time. The men, when they see that the women have got the place, will be so civil as to pass by and give them leave to take their fill, as I may say in their Towoaf or walking round, during which they are using some formal expressions. When the women are at the stone, then it is esteemed a very rude and abominable thing to go near them, respecting the time and place.|$|E
