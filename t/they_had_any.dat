5|$|The {{three species}} of vampire bats are all endemic to Latin America, {{and there is}} no {{evidence}} to suggest that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> Old World relatives within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the Oxford English Dictionary records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The vampire bat's bite is usually not harmful to a person, but the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.|$|E

25|$|In 1977 rumours began {{circulating}} in the Rhodesian press that Walls had become deeply {{pessimistic about the}} future of Rhodesia, and that he had been quietly preparing to abandon the country and personally relocate his family into South Africa, and had covertly purchased property there for this purpose. Seeking to scotch these allegations, with the attenuation they would have to the military morale of the troops still fighting under his command, he publicly issued a denial <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> basis in truth.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} Suzanne Degnan's disappearance, several {{calls to}} the Degnan {{residence}} demanding ransom payment but without leaving further instructions or further conversation were made. The mystery of who placed those calls was answered. While checking out local persons of interest to see if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> connection to the Degnan case, they picked up a local boy named Theodore Campbell. Under questioning, he admitted that another local teenager, named Vincent Costello, had killed Suzanne Degnan. The Chicago Tribune declared the Degnan case solved.|$|E

25|$|By early 1827 the Army {{reported}} that the Seminoles were on the reservation and Florida was peaceful. This peace lasted for five years, during which time there were repeated calls for the Seminoles to be sent west of the Mississippi. The Seminoles were opposed to the move, and especially to the suggestion {{that they should be}} placed on the Creek reservation. Most whites regarded the Seminoles as simply Creeks who had recently moved to Florida, while the Seminoles claimed Florida as their home and denied that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> connection with the Creeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Sir Terry Farrell and built by John Laing. The developer Regalian Properties approached the government in 1987 to see if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> interest in the proposed building. At the same time, MI5 was seeking alternative accommodation and co-location of the two services was studied. In the end this proposal was abandoned {{due to the lack}} of buildings of adequate size (existing or proposed) and the security considerations of providing a single target for attacks. In December 1987, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government approved the purchase of the new building for SIS.|$|E
25|$|Italy {{had called}} on the PLO to {{publicly}} declare if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> involvement. In response Yasser Arafat denounced the hijacking and offered to assist in negotiating for a peaceful conclusion to the incident. Arafat sent two men to Egypt to join a joint negotiating team alongside Italians and Egyptians – one of his advisors and PLO executive committee member Hani al-Hassan and Abu Abbas. At Port Said, Egypt, these two joined the PLO representative from Cairo – Zohdi al-Qoudra. (It is unknown if Arafat was ignorant of Abbas involvement or if {{he was sent to}} insure the incident would end quickly).|$|E

25|$|In {{all these}} cases, the father might dower her. If he did not, on his death the {{brothers}} were obligated to do so, {{giving her a}} full child's share if a wife, a concubine or a vestal, but one-third of a child's share {{if she were a}} hierodule or a Marduk priestess. The latter had the privilege of exemption from state dues and absolute disposal of her property. All other daughters had only a life interest in their dowry, which reverted to their family if childless or went to their children if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any.</b> A father might, however, execute a deed granting a daughter power to leave her property to a favorite brother or sister.|$|E
25|$|The union hired Clarence Darrow {{to defend}} the McNamaras. Darrow, however, {{concluded}} that the brothers faced a strong chance of receiving {{the death penalty for}} the crime; he therefore made a clumsy attempt, in broad daylight in downtown Los Angeles, to bribe one of the jurors. As it turned out, it was a trap and Darrow was arrested. Now more desperate than ever, he persuaded the McNamaras to plead guilty on the basis of an unwritten plea bargain that would have freed John. Once they pleaded guilty, however, the authorities denied that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> deal at all. John McNamara served nearly ten years, while his brother spent his remaining years in prison.|$|E
25|$|Metacomet {{was brought}} before a public court, where court {{officials}} {{admitted that they}} had no proof, but warned that they would confiscate Wampanoag land and guns if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> further reports that he was conspiring to start a war. Not long after, Sassamon's body was found in the ice-covered Assawompset Pond. There was some dispute at the time as to whether his death was the result of accident or murder. Plymouth Colony officials arrested three Wampanoags on the testimony of an Indian witness, including one of Metacomet's counselors, and a jury that included six Indian elders convicted the men of Sassamon's murder. They were executed by hanging on June 8, 1675 (O.S.) at Plymouth.|$|E

25|$|A second {{opportunity}} for globalization of neuroinformatics {{occurred when the}} participating governments of the Mega Science Forum (MSF) of the OECD were asked if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> new scientific initiatives to bring forward for scientific cooperation around the globe. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy requested that agencies {{in the federal government}} meet at NIH to decide if cooperation were needed that would be of global benefit. The NIH held a series of meetings in which proposals from different agencies were discussed. The proposal recommendation from the U.S. for the MSF was a combination of the NSF and NIH proposals. Jim Edwards of NSF supported databases and data-sharing in the area of biodiversity; Koslow proposed the HPG as a model for sharing neuroscientific data, with the new moniker of neuroinformatics.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Marie-José Malis toured, with a French-language version {{created with}} the help of Alain Badiou, {{explicitly}} asking whether there were any other possibility than the death of the Prince, and making discussion on the topic part of the experience of the play. The day before the staging in Arles, on May 14, 2009, she held a public discussion in the theatre, asking the public whether <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> suggestions as to how the play should end, as she herself was still undecided as to how to end the play. This fostering of discussion was itself an important element of the re-staging of the play. In the event, on that first night in Arles at least, the Prince and Natalia and a soldier friendly to their cause shoot {{their way out of the}} place in which the Prince is to be executed.|$|E
25|$|Those mining {{communities}} {{had good}} working class values {{and a sense}} of family values. The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were able to deal with the few troublesome kids. If <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> problems they would take the kid round the back and give them a good clip round the ear {{and that would be the}} end of that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous as a result of the strike.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two major}} {{databases}} that track radiation accidents: The American ORISE REAC/TS and the European IRSN ACCIRAD. REAC/TS shows 417 accidents occurring between 1944 and 2000, causing about 3000 cases of acute radiation syndrome, of which 127 were fatal. ACCIRAD lists 580 accidents with 180 ARS fatalities for an almost identical period. The two deliberate bombings {{are not included in}} either database, nor are any possible radiation-induced cancers from low doses. The detailed accounting is difficult because of confounding factors. ARS may be accompanied by conventional injuries such as steam burns, or may occur in someone with a pre-existing condition undergoing radiotherapy. There may be multiple causes for death, and the contribution from radiation may be unclear. Some documents may incorrectly refer to radiation-induced cancers as radiation poisoning, or may count all overexposed individuals as survivors without mentioning if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> symptoms of ARS. The table below attempts to catalog some cases of ARS. Many of these incidents involved additional fatalities from other causes, such as cancer, which are excluded from this table.|$|E
25|$|Antonio's {{parents were}} Alessandro Stradivari, son of Giulio Cesare Stradivari, and Anna Moroni, {{daughter}} of Leonardo Moroni. They married on 30 August 1622, and {{had at least}} three children between 1623 and 1628: Giuseppe Giulia Cesare, Carlo Felice, and Giovanni Battista. The baptismal records of the parish of S. Prospero then stop, and it is unknown whether <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> children from 1628 to 1644. This blank in the records {{may be due to}} the family leaving Cremona in response to war, famine, and plague in the city from 1628 to 1630, or the records may have been lost due to clerical reforms imposed by Joseph II of Austria in 1788. The latter explanation is supported by the word Cremonensis (of Cremona) on many of Stradivari's labels, which suggests that he was born in the city instead of merely moving back there to work. Antonio was born in 1644, a fact deducible from later violins. However, there are no records or information available on his early childhood, and the first evidence of his presence in Cremona is the label of his oldest surviving violin from 1666.|$|E
25|$|Edmund Tilney lived a {{life which}} was spent in {{balancing}} one controversy against another. On the one hand he had the Lord Treasurer to contend with, {{and on the other}} there was the Lord Chamberlain from whom he took direct orders. Following his appointment as the Master, he grew increasingly popular and married Dame Mary Braye in 1583. She was the fourth wife of Sir Edmund Braye. There are no other details about whether <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> children or not. Even in his will written in 1610, {{there is no mention of}} either his wife or any issue. He spent the latter part of his life fighting various lawsuits and claims over property and debt. Towards the end, his financial circumstances had become severely strained. He lost a few properties through lawsuits as well. In his will he wished to be buried near his father without much pomp and ceremony. He bequeathed money to a few poor parishes, some servants and to his cousin Thomas Tilney. He lived in the town of Leatherhead, Surrey, in the building known as the Mansion House. In the 1990s, a new Wetherspoons in the Leatherhead High Street was named after him. He is buried in St. Leonard's Church, Streatham, London. A monument was erected in his memory.|$|E
