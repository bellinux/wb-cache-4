5|$|A hybrid eclipse (also called annular/total eclipse) shifts {{between a}} total and annular eclipse. At certain {{points on the}} surface of Earth, it appears as a <b>total</b> <b>eclipse,</b> whereas at other points it appears as annular. Hybrid eclipses are {{comparatively}} rare.|$|E

50|$|The {{eclipse of}} July 28, 1851 {{was part of}} Saros Series 143, a {{sequence}} of seventy-two partial and <b>total</b> solar <b>eclipses</b> occurring between 1617 and 2897. The only <b>total</b> <b>eclipses</b> in this cycle occurred between 1797 and 1995.|$|R
5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are rare}} events. Although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, it is {{estimated}} that they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years, on average. The <b>total</b> <b>eclipse</b> lasts for only a maximum of a few minutes at any location, because the Moon's umbra moves eastward at over 1700km/h. Totality currently can never last more than 7min 32s. This value changes over the millennia and is currently decreasing. By the 8th millennium, the longest theoretically possible <b>total</b> <b>eclipse</b> will be less than 7min 2s. The last time an eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred was June 30, 1973 (7 min 3 sec). Observers aboard a Concorde supersonic aircraft were able to stretch totality for this eclipse to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the Moon's umbra. The next <b>total</b> <b>eclipse</b> exceeding seven minutes in duration will not occur until June 25, 2150. The longest total solar eclipse during the 11,000 year period from 3000 BC to at least 8000 AD will occur on July 16, 2186, when totality will last 7min 29s. For comparison, the longest <b>total</b> <b>eclipse</b> of the 20th century at 7min 8s occurred on June 20, 1955, and there are no total solar eclipses over 7min in duration in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Observations of eclipses from {{spacecraft}} or artificial satellites orbiting {{above the}} Earth's atmosphere {{are not subject}} to weather conditions. The crew of Gemini 12 observed a total solar eclipse from space in 1966. The partial phase of the 1999 <b>total</b> <b>eclipse</b> was visible from Mir.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, {{but not as much}} as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in early July, a <b>total</b> <b>eclipse</b> is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E

5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a <b>total</b> <b>eclipse,</b> the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} the Earth, {{and it is this}} effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a <b>total</b> <b>eclipse</b> occurs.|$|E
5|$|Central eclipse {{is often}} used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or <b>total</b> <b>eclipse),</b> but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.|$|E

5|$|DiCaprio's first {{effort of}} 1995 was Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead, a western film. Sony Pictures was dubious over DiCaprio's casting, {{and as a}} result, co-star Sharon Stone decided to pay the actor's salary herself. The film was {{released}} to a dismal box office performance, barely grossing US$18.5 million in the US, and received mixed reviews from critics. DiCaprio next starred in <b>Total</b> <b>Eclipse,</b> a fictionalized account of the homosexual relationship between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. He replaced River Phoenix, who died during pre-production on the project. A minor art-house success, the film grossed US$0.34 million throughout its domestic theatrical run.|$|E
5|$|During the 21st century, {{there will}} be 224 solar eclipses of which 77 will be partial, 72 will be annular, 68 will be total and 7 will be hybrids between total and annular eclipses. Of these, two annular and one <b>total</b> <b>eclipse</b> will be non-central, {{in the sense that}} the very center (axis) of the moon's shadow will miss the earth (for more {{information}} see gamma). In the 21st century the greatest number of eclipses in one year is four, in 2011, 2029, 2047, 2065, 2076, and 2094. The predictions given here are by Fred Espenak of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagrams}} to {{the right}} show the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth during a solar eclipse. The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the umbra, where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon. The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a <b>total</b> <b>eclipse</b> can be seen. The larger light gray area is the penumbra, in which a partial eclipse can be seen. An observer in the antumbra, the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.|$|E

5|$|The {{first known}} {{telescopic}} observation {{of a total}} solar eclipse was made in France in 1706. Nine years later, English astronomer Edmund Halley accurately predicted and observed the solar eclipse of May 3, 1715. By the mid-19th century, scientific understanding of the Sun was improving through observations of the Sun's corona during solar eclipses. The corona was identified {{as part of the}} Sun's atmosphere in 1842, and the first photograph (or daguerreotype) of a <b>total</b> <b>eclipse</b> was taken of the solar eclipse of July 28, 1851. Spectroscope observations were made of the solar eclipse of August 18, 1868, which helped to determine the chemical composition of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from {{a large part of the}} Earth outside of the track of an annular or <b>total</b> <b>eclipse.</b> However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a <b>total</b> <b>eclipse</b> and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo DiCaprio is an American {{actor and}} {{producer}} who {{started his career}} performing as a child on television. He appeared on the shows The New Lassie (1989) and Santa Barbara (1990) and also had long running roles in the comedy-drama Parenthood (1990) and the sitcom Growing Pains (1991), before making his film debut in the 1991 direct-to-video release Critters 3. Two years later, he played Tobias Wolff opposite Robert De Niro in This Boy's Life (1993). He followed this with a supporting role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 1995, DiCaprio played the American author Jim Carroll in The Basketball Diaries and the French poet Arthur Rimbaud in <b>Total</b> <b>Eclipse.</b> The following year he played Romeo Montague in the Baz Luhrmann-directed film Romeo + Juliet (1996). DiCaprio starred opposite Kate Winslet in the James Cameron-directed film Titanic (1997). The film became the highest grossing at the worldwide box-office, and made him famous globally.
