Both the NBER's statistical indicator approach and <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>approach</b> are used to identify the leading indicators of rail freight traffic cycles from a set of leading economic indicators published by the Department of Commerce. The concepts and empirical results obtained by these two procedures are compared and contrasted. The interesting findings are: (1) the composite index of 12 leading indicators performs very well as a qualitative and quantitative predictor and (2) the empirical results obtained by the NBER approach are, in general, consistent with those obtained by the <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>approach.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for understanding the cross- section and <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>approaches</b> which {{have been used to}} test the convergence hypothesis. First, we present two definitions of convergence which capture the implications of the neoclassical growth model for the relationship between current and future cross-country output differences. Second, we identify how the cross-section and <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>approaches</b> relate to these definitions. Cross-section tests are shown to be associated with a weaker notion of convergence than <b>time</b> <b>series</b> tests. Third, we show how these alternative approaches make different assumptions on whether the data are well characterized by a limiting distribution. As a result, the choice of an appropriate testing framework is shown to depend on both the specific null and alternative hypotheses under consideration {{as well as on the}} initial conditions characterizing the data being studied. ...|$|R

40|$|Fuzzy <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>approaches</b> have an {{important}} deficiency according to classical <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>approaches.</b> This deficiency {{comes from the fact}} that all of the fuzzy <b>time</b> <b>series</b> models developed in the literature use autoregressive (AR) variables, without any studies that also make use of moving averages (MAs) variables with the exception of only one study (Egrioglu et al.

40|$|Control charts are {{regularly}} developed {{with the assumption}} that the process observations have an independent relationship. However, a common occurrence in certain industries is the collection of autocorrelated data. Two approaches are investigated that deal with this issue. The <b>time</b> <b>series</b> <b>approach</b> is based on modeling the data with an appropriate time series model to remove the autocorrelative structure. The EWMA approach is based on modeling the observations as a weighted average of previous data. The residuals from the two approaches are plotted on control charts and the average run lengths are compared. Both methods are applied to simulations that generate in-control data and data that have strategically located nonstandard conditions. The nonstandard conditions simulated are process change, linear drift, mean shift, and variance shift.
