25|$|After the Revolution, Americans who commented {{generally}} held positive {{views of}} the Polish people. Polish music such as mazurkas and krakowiaks were popular in the U.S. during the antebellum period.

25|$|Experimental warming {{has been}} shown to start {{flowering}} substantially earlier than control cushions experiencing ambient temperature. Both the male and female phases developed faster in the OTCs and capsules (fruits) matured earlier, and the cushions produced more mature seeds and had a higher seed/ovule ratio contributing to an overall positive reproductive response. However, a study on four populations across a latitudinal gradient in North America showed that southern populations of moss campion had lower survival and recruitment, but higher individual growth rates than more northern populations. Furthermore, vital rates such as growth, survival, and fruits per area were shown to increase in moderately warmer years yet declined in the very warmest years, suggesting that a change in climate into warmer conditions or more frequent unusually warm summers may eventually lead to negative impacts. Another study showed that while the short term responses were positive, they <b>turned</b> <b>negative</b> on medium-term, suggestion that moss campion may be at risk in future global warming.|$|E
40|$|People {{not only}} seek to avoid losses or secure gains; they also {{attempt to create}} {{opportunities}} for obtaining positive outcomes. When distributing money between gambles with equal probabilities, people often invest in <b>turning</b> <b>negative</b> gambles into positive ones, even {{at a cost of}} reduced expected value. Results of an experiment revealed that (1) the preference to <b>turn</b> a <b>negative</b> outcome into a positive outcome exists when people’s ability to do so depends on their performance levels (rather than merely on their choice), (2) this preference is amplified when the likelihood to <b>turn</b> <b>negative</b> into positive is high rather than low, and (3) this preference is attenuated when people can lie about their performance levels, allowing them to <b>turn</b> <b>negative</b> into positive not by performing better but rather by lying about how well they performed...|$|R

They had taken political control of the small nearby town of Antelope, Oregon (population 75), the name of which they changed to [...] "Rajneesh".

500|$|The 1989 [...] "Otaku Murderer" [...] case gave a {{negative}} connotation to the fandom {{from which it}} has not fully recovered. The usage of [...] "(interest) otaku", however, is used for teasing or self-deprecation, but the unqualified term remains negative. The identification of otaku <b>turned</b> <b>negative</b> in late 2004 when Kaoru Kobayashi kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and murdered a seven-year-old first-grade student. Japanese journalist Akihiro Ōtani suspected that Kobayashi's crime was committed {{by a member of}} the figure moe zoku even before his arrest. Although Kobayashi was not an otaku, the degree of social hostility against otaku increased. Otaku were seen by law enforcement as possible suspects for sex crimes, and local governments called for stricter laws controlling the depiction of eroticism in otaku materials.|$|E
500|$|Local radio {{broadcasters}} {{were reluctant}} to play the EP's single, [...] "Dog Beats", because Inner City Posse's members were white. While trying to get stations to play the single, Bruce learned {{that one of the}} stations he and Abbiss visited would be interviewing local rapper Esham, who Bruce considered to be a [...] "superstar"; Bruce had recently begun to collect Esham's albums, as he had done with other local rappers; {{by the time he had}} discovered Esham, the rapper had released two full-length albums and three EPs. Bruce met Esham for the first time at the station and praised him. Esham wished Bruce well and Bruce gave the rapper a copy of Dog Beats; this began the friendship and professional relationship between Psychopathic Records and Esham's label, Reel Life Productions. Growing popularity in the local music scene <b>turned</b> <b>negative</b> for the group's gang, which became the target of growing violence. After receiving jail sentences, the group members abandoned gang life.|$|E

2500|$|After the British conquest, French {{immigration}} to Canada continued {{on a small}} scale until the start of the wars between France and Britain, 1792–1815. During this time French books circulated widely, and the French Revolution led many conservative refugees to seek asylum in Canada. The Anglophone population of Canada also grew rapidly after the American Revolution. Francophone opinion among the rural habitants towards France <b>turned</b> <b>negative</b> after 1793. As English subjects, the habitants, led by their conservative priest and landowners, rejected the revolution's impiety, regicide, and anti-Catholic persecution. The habitants supported Britain in the War of 1812 against the United States. Many Canadians also speak French from their settlement in Canada in, 1534 ...|$|E
2500|$|Historians have debated {{just why}} Johnson quit {{a few days}} after his weak showing in New Hampshire. Jeff Shesol says Johnson wanted out of the White House but also wanted vindication; when the {{indicators}} <b>turned</b> <b>negative</b> he decided to leave. Lewis L. Gould maintains that Johnson had neglected the party, was hurting it by his Vietnam policies, and underestimated McCarthy's strength until the very last minute, when {{it was too late for}} Johnson to recover. Randall Bennett Woods said Johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal. [...] Robert Dallek writes that Johnson had no further domestic goals, and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity. [...] His health was not good, and he was preoccupied with the Kennedy campaign; his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink. [...] Leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker. [...] Anthony J. Bennett, however, claims Johnson [...] "had been forced out of a re-election race in 1968 by outrage over his policy in Southeast Asia".|$|E

40|$|For {{the first}} order Metal Insulator Transitions we show that {{together}} with the d. c conductance zero {{there is a second}} critical point, where the dielectric constant becomes zero and further <b>turns</b> <b>negative.</b> At this point the metallic reflectivity sharply increases. The two points can be separated by a Phase Separation State in a 3 D disordered system, but may tend to merge in 2 D. For illustration we evaluate the dielectric function in a simple effective medium approximation and show that at the second point it <b>turns</b> <b>negative.</b> We reproduce the experimental data on a typical Mott insulator like MnO, demonstrating the presence of the two points clearly. We discuss other experiments for studies of the phase separation state and a similar phase separation in superconductors with insulating inclusions. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
