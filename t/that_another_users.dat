30|$|Besides {{the basic}} {{function}} of posting a Twitter message (called “tweet”), {{and the possibility}} to follow and be followed by other users, Twitter provides several other specific features. Three of these are “replies”, “mentions” and “retweets”. Replying to a user by starting a tweet with an @ sign followed by the user name (@user) {{makes it possible to}} address a user directly via the public Twitter feed. To mention <b>another</b> <b>user,</b> works in a similar way; it also includes @user but not {{at the beginning of a}} tweet. The difference is that a reply is directed to the other user and therefore seen by him or her, while a mention is not directed at the user. You could also say a reply is a message for someone while a mention is a message about someone [20]. By using the retweet function a user spreads the original message from <b>another</b> <b>user</b> by resending it. While mentioning is a way of referring to <b>another</b> <b>user</b> without necessarily sharing the same opinion, a retweet can be seen as an informal recommendation of a message <b>that</b> <b>another</b> <b>user</b> finds important, interesting or at least entertaining. Therefore the retweet function is a key mechanism for information diffusion and raising content visibility on Twitter [36, 47].|$|R

It also presents the first concise distillation of the key ideas in AURA, integrating ideas from previous specialized publications. ...|$|R
30|$|Data {{manipulation}} {{attacks on}} the ECG sensor measurements require the adversary to replace the victim’s ECG measurements with <b>that</b> of <b>another</b> <b>user.</b> The victims here are the 33 users in the training group whose ECG signals are altered.

40|$|AbstractDue to its popularity, social {{networks}} (SNs) {{have been subject}} to different analyses. A research field in this area is the identification of several types of users and groups. To make the identification process easier, a SN is usually represented through a graph. Usual tools to analyze a graph are the centrality measures, which identify the most important vertices. One of these measures is the PageRank (a measure originally designed to classify web pages). Informally, {{in the context of a}} SN, the PageRank of a user i represents the probability <b>that</b> <b>another</b> <b>user</b> of the SN is seeing the page of i after a considerable time of navigation in the SN. In this paper, we define a new type of user in a SN: the best current friend. Informally, the idea is to identify, among the friends of a user i, who is the friend k that would generate the highest decrease in the PageRank of i if k stops being his/her friend.

We simulate data manipulation attacks on ECG sensor measurements in three ways: (1) by replacing legitimate ECG measurements of a user (referred to as the victim when appropriate) with <b>that</b> of <b>another</b> <b>user</b> in the training group, (2) by replacing legitimate ECG of a user with that of users in the external group, and (3) by replacing legitimate ECG measurements of a user with synthetic ECG obtained from a generative model parameterized based on a victim’s own ECG data to impersonate them.|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} {{field in}} the area of social networks (SNs) is the identification of some types of users and groups. To facilitate this process, a SN is usually represented by a graph.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} fair resource allocation in a system containing different resource types, where each user may have different demands for each resource. To address this problem, we propose Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF), a generalization of max-min fairness to multiple resource types. We show that DRF, unlike other possible policies, satisfies several highly desirable properties. First, DRF incentivizes users to share resources, by ensuring that no user is better off if resources are equally partitioned among them. Second, DRF is strategy-proof, as a user cannot increase her allocation by lying about her requirements. Third, DRF is envyfree, as no user would want to trade her allocation with <b>that</b> of <b>another</b> <b>user.</b> Finally, DRF allocations are Pareto efficient, as {{it is not possible}} to improve the allocation of a user without decreasing the allocation of <b>another</b> <b>user.</b> We have implemented DRF in the Mesos cluster resource manager, and show that it leads to better throughput and fairness than the slot-based fair sharing schemes in current cluster schedulers. ...|$|R

Official White House assistant press secretary Frank Benenati made a statement {{that no one has}} ever been blocked from Obama's account, with other users on Twitter challenging Beneati's statement regarding the matter. Pearson denounced the claim made by the White House, stated that they were lying about him. [...] "They lied about Benghazi," [...] he said, [...] "They lied about the IRS. They lie about every issue of importance to the American people." [...] A subsequent tweet by Pearson revealed that he was still following the personal Twitter account of Obama, and there was no timestamp or external information on the screenshoted tweet. In addition to the White House denying the claims made by Pearson, Oliver Darcy, a reporter for The Blaze, reported the incident to be false. When blocked by an account on Twitter, the blocked user can't see the tweets of the account that blocked them, but it was seen that Pearson was still following the presidential Twitter account Obama, in contradiction to earlier claims.

50|$|Following the {{widespread}} use of procedural languages, object-oriented programming (OOP) languages were created, such as Simula, Smalltalk, C++, C#, Eiffel, PHP, and Java.

The only way <b>that</b> <b>another</b> object or <b>user</b> can access the data is via the object's methods. Thus, the inner workings of an object may be changed without affecting any code that uses the object.

The need for every object to have associative methods leads some skeptics to associate OOP with software bloat; an attempt to resolve this dilemma came through polymorphism.|$|R
