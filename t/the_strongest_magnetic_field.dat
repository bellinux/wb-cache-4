30|$|Analysis of {{the effects}} of the mass loading, and the {{resulting}} electromagnetic asymmetries, at Mars and Venus are more difficult to perform than the test seen in Fig. 3 because the planets form impenetrable surfaces and have conducting ionospheres. A planetary ionosphere forms an effective obstacle against the solar wind flow which, in turn, forms a bow shock. Moreover, part of the solar wind protons flows around the planets while some of the protons can hit the atmosphere and become fast hydrogen atoms. For example, one may pose a question: Does <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> on the +Esw hemisphere exist, because the magnetic flux tubes that move toward − Esw direction are strongly “packed up” against the obstacle on the +Esw hemisphere?

On the other hand, it is known that the term −α 2 /(2 mr 2) provide an attraction even for the positron. Thus, in one-dimensional case this attraction leads to the existence of the bound states of the same charge (e. g. e + p,lepton−lepton,antilepton− antilepton atoms), because in one-dimensional case any attraction is enough for bound states formation. Thus, we prove that in <b>the</b> <b>strong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> bound states of the same charge exist. Below we calculate energy levels of these bound states. Dirac equation for an electron in case of attractive potential has been derived in [1][2] where, however, relativistic term (the second term in the formula (2) below) has been neglected. In [3] this term has been taken into account. However in [3] repulsive Coulomb potential has not been considered.

Our main results are: i) the CNM mass fraction diminishes with the increase in magnetic field intensity. ii) There is a preferred alignment between CNM structures and B⃗ in all our B_ 0 range but the preference weakens as B_ 0 increases.
