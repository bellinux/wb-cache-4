40|$|Abstract. The {{conversion}} efficiency of heat to electricity {{is the basic}} parameter of thermoelectric element, thermoelectric unicouple and thermoelectric devices. In principle, the heat to electricity {{conversion efficiency}} of thermoelectric element {{has been defined as}} the electrical output power of the element divided by its thermal input power. Due to the heat loss by convection and radiation heat transfer the test result of the heat to electricity conversion efficiency has a large errors. The authors present a test method for heat to electricity conversion efficiency of thermoelectric unicouple. The thermal input <b>power</b> of <b>thermoelectric</b> unicouple has been divided into the electrical output power plus thermal output power out of the cold end of the unicouple. The later has been determined by a <b>thermoelectric</b> thermal <b>power</b> <b>meter.</b> The method avoids the difficulties to measure the input thermal power into the hot side of the unicouple, so that the convection and radiation heat lose out of the unicouple side can be ignored. Owing to Seebeck Coefficient of the thermoelectric semiconductor materials could be many times of the metals, the <b>thermoelectric</b> thermal <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> has high sensitivity, so that high test precision could be gained in test for conversion efficiency of thermoelectric unicouple. The paper presents some test results for heat to electricity conversion efficiency of thermoelectric unicouple, and discusses about the factors which affect the test results...|$|R

30|$|<b>Thermoelectric</b> <b>power</b> (S) of Rb 3 C 60 fullerides in the {{metallic}} phase is theoretically estimated. We first develop a Hamiltonian model that incorporates the scattering rates within the relaxation time approximation {{to estimate the}} phonon-drag <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>power</b> (Sphdrag) incorporating the scattering of phonons with defects, electrons as carriers, grain boundaries, and phonon-phonon interactions. As a next step, Mott expression within parabolic band approximation is {{used to analyze the}} electron diffusive <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>power</b> (Scdiff) using Fermi energy as electron parameter, and Scdiff shows a linear temperature dependence. The Sphdrag is nonzero in both normal and superconducting states. Its behavior is determined by competition among the several operating scattering rates for heat carriers and a balance between diffusive carrier and phonon-drag contributions. Acoustic phonons are effectively scattered by various scatterers for the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>power.</b> S infers a change in slope above transition temperature and becomes almost linear above 70 K.|$|R
30|$|The {{anomalous}} behavior around 70 K {{is attributed}} to electron-phonon interactions.
