5|$|Fan {{interest}} in attending games had begun declining throughout MLB in the late-1940s, and the Yankees faced a drop-off in their crowds after 1947, when they sold about 2.2 million tickets.

The Yankees joined <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>New</b> York City franchises in allowing game telecasts. This was a departure from the team's strategy when radio broadcasts were introduced. Regular season games of the Yankees were not broadcast until 1939, as management believed that fewer fans would attend games if they could listen on radios.|$|E

5|$|Opening across 2,602 North American theaters, The Boy Next Door was {{projected}} {{to pull in}} $12–15million over its opening weekend.

The Hollywood Reporter revealed that 45 percent of the film's opening week audience was Hispanic, while 71 percent of the overall audience was female. The film became Lopez's best opening weekend for a January release, beating her romantic comedy The Wedding Planner (2001) which opened with $13.5million. It was also her best opening weekend for a thriller film, ahead of Angel Eyes (2001, $9.2million), Enough (2002, $14million), and Parker (2013, $7million). Furthermore, it is Lopez's biggest live-action opening since 2005's Monster-in-Law.

It is now placed in the genus Setophaga along with about thirty other species, after having been classified in Dendroica for some time.

It is usually considered an early offshoot among this group of species, but genetic studies suggest a close relation to Grace's warbler.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of The Rescuers signaled {{the beginning of}} a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio: as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired, they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, and Glen Keane. The new animators, culled from the animation program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Woolie Reitherman got their first chances to prove themselves as a group with the animated sequences in Disney's live-action/animated hybrid feature Pete's Dragon (1977), the animation for which was directed by Don Bluth. In September 1979, dissatisfied with what they felt was a stagnation {{in the development of the}} art of animation at Disney, Bluth and several of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>new</b> guard animators quit to start their own studio, Don Bluth Productions, which became Disney's chief competitor in the animation field during the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|In 1898 {{the firm}} {{designed}} StOswald's Chambers in StWerburgh Street, Chester, {{and this was}} followed by further buildings in the city. In 1902–03 Douglas built St John the Evangelist's Church, in the village of his birth, Sandiway. It was built on land owned by Douglas and he paid for the cost of the chancel and the lych gate. In 1899 the Diamond Jubilee Memorial Clock, constructed in open wrought iron, was erected on the Eastgate in Chester to commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. In 1898–1901 Chester's public baths were built; this was an unusual work for Douglas as it involved specialist engineering work. During this period one of Douglas's most important secular buildings was designed, St Deiniol's Library, at Hawarden, Flintshire, for W.E.Gladstone and his family. The first phase was constructed between 1899 and 1902, and the library was completed in 1904–06. Around this time the practice was commissioned to work on two churches in association with Gladstone; StEthelwold's (1898–1902) was a new church at Shotton in Flintshire, and additions were made to StMatthew's at Buckley, also in Flintshire, between 1897 and 1905. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>new</b> churches built during this period were Douglas's only Scottish church, the Episcopal Church (1903) in Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire, and StMatthew's Church (1910–11) in Saltney, Flintshire. Alterations were made and furniture was designed for other churches. Douglas's last major project was the addition of a tower to his church of StPaul's at Colwyn Bay, but he died before this could be completed.|$|E
5|$|The new league {{began on}} 12 September 2003 when Sheffield Steelers, {{who went on}} to become the inaugural league champions, {{defeated}} the newly formed London Racers 6–1 at Alexandra Palace. The Racers endured a difficult first season, moving to a different rink only weeks into the season and having to wait 40 games to record a win, a 3–0 victory over Cardiff Devils. The Racers finished the season with 10 points, 38 points behind second bottom Basingstoke. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>new</b> team, Manchester Phoenix fared slightly better, qualifying for the playoff finals after finishing sixth in the league, where they were defeated 6–1 by Nottingham in the semi final. The club played at the 17,500 capacity MEN Arena which had been home to Manchester Storm, but Phoenix crowds averaged 2,250, well below the break-even mark of 3,000. Late in the season, Phoenix choose to play a game at IceSheffield rather than pay the considerable cost of hiring the arena for a mid-week game (which usually had lower attendances). In the close season they allowed fans to vote on the option of either suspending playing operations while a new rink was constructed or playing in exile away from Manchester while a new rink was built. Supporters opted to suspend playing operations pending the construction of a new facility.|$|E
