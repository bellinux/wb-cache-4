25|$|Obviously {{it was one}} {{of those}} things that {{reinforce}} that I can't have alcohol. I got away from the one thing <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> on the straight and narrow and that was my relationship with the Lord. That should always come first. Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, I have not had another thought like that. I know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E
500|$|Sanz {{was born}} in Madrid, Spain, on December 18, 1968, the {{youngest}} son of María Pizarro and Jesús Sánchez. He {{grew up in the}} neighborhood of Moratalaz in eastern Madrid. Sanz recalled that [...] "Back then, kids grew up on the street...I was a bit like the group troubadour; the one who played the guitar and sang. <b>That</b> <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> out of a lot of trouble." [...] Sanz's father, a door-to-door book salesman, played guitar professionally, which inspired seven-year-old Sanz to learn to play the instrument. He pursued the instrument with an intensity that eventually frustrated his mother, who broke his guitar one morning after his playing kept the family from sleeping.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{stated that}} this episode gave her [...] "hope for this procedural {{that the pilot}} didn't". She called the storyline [...] "heartbreaking", [...] "sad", shocking", and [...] "chilling" [...] and added that there were [...] "plenty of twists and turns <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> guessing throughout the hour". She was upset that Al Chapman was the murderer, saying {{that it would have}} been [...] "wonderful to see Brian, Linda's bad tempered, control freak of an ex hauled away in cuffs". She added that the look that Eric Singleton gave Detective Baker was [...] "positively evil". She praised the interaction between the Megan and the rest of the main cast, saying, [...] "We got to know more about the cast of characters in Megan's office and Curtis was the standout. Last week Megan questioned Curtis' abilities as a doctor. This week, Curtis not only proved her wrong but turned out to be the much needed comic relief delivering some of the best lines of the night". She finished, [...] ""Letting Go" [...] definitely left me looking forward to what this new hit show has in store for us next". After the ratings for [...] "Pilot" [...] were high, Matt Roush of TV Guide hoped that Body of Proof would [...] "continue to improve" [...] adding that he preferred this episode to [...] "Pilot", despite the lower ratings.|$|E

2500|$|Bunyan's army service {{provided}} him with a knowledge of military language which he then used in his book The Holy War, and also exposed him to {{the ideas of the}} various religious sects and radical groups he came across in Newport Pagnell. The garrison town also gave him opportunities to indulge in the sort of behaviour he would later confess to in Grace Abounding: [...] "So that until I came to the state of Marriage, I was the very ringleader of all the Youth <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> company, in all manner of vice and ungodliness". Bunyan spent nearly three years in the army, leaving in 1647 to return to Elstow and his trade as a tinker. His father had remarried and had more children and Bunyan moved from Bunyan's End to a cottage in Elstow High Street.|$|E
2500|$|On reflection, Hantuchová {{said that}} 2012 was a {{difficult}} year for her. She struggled with niggling injuries even before she fractured her foot and was forced out for two months. As a result, her form was inconsistent and she suffered ten first round defeats. She said: [...] "I think 2012 has been a difficult year for me. Had a great start to the season, making the final in Brisbane, winning in Pattaya and feeling very good about my game, but unfortunately, suffered a fracture stress... <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> away from the tracks for two months." [...] However, she said that playing in the Olympics at Wimbledon, where she reached the third round, was a [...] "special moment". In an interview {{at the end of}} the year, Hantuchová reflected on turning 30 the following April, saying that it was [...] "just a number" [...] and that she wanted to keep playing as long as possible and break back into the top 10.|$|E

On 26 November, in an interview with Robin Oakley on Radio 4, he said [...] "To be honest I found it intellectually numbing, and tedious in the extreme. I most certainly won't miss the constituency work. I've got to tell you that honestly. It's 22 years of the same cases, but just the faces and the people changing. It might sound a little disparaging to say this about people's lives and their problems and we did deal with them ... but I got no satisfaction from this at all. I really didn't. And all you were was a sort of high-powered social worker and perhaps not even a good one at that. I will miss being chairman of the works of art committee [...] [...] [...] because I was having so much intellectual enjoyment, and indeed just straightforward fun, out of reorganising our collection, and <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> in touch with history." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, my boy, I {{have known}} it from the first. It is only my intense desire {{to see you again}} <b>that</b> has <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> up. The doctor said he did not expect that I should last {{more than two or three}} days, at most.|$|R
6000|$|... "You fiend {{in human}} form, what is it, I wonder, <b>that</b> has <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> so long from {{destroying}} you and myself too? Oh! {{you need not}} laugh; I {{have the means to}} do it, if I choose: I have had them for twenty years." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{acknowledge}} that, sir," [...] Ralph said earnestly; [...] "and I {{feel very}} grateful.

6000|$|... "I {{do nothing}} of the sort," [...] he assured her indignantly. [...] "I eat and drink {{whatever}} I fancy.

60|$|My {{injuries}} {{were much more}} showy than serious, and I could {{have been taken to}} Lady Grove next day, but Beatrice would not permit <b>that,</b> and <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> at Bedley Corner three clear days.

6000|$|... "To {{tell the}} truth, 'Tave," [...] said Teddy, with quiet candour, [...] "it wasn't for the salary. <b>That</b> about <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> in cigars and sunburn lotions.

6000|$|... 'And is {{it because}} you like <b>me</b> <b>that</b> you have <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> here?' Laura asked. She got up, leaning {{against the side of}} the box; she had pulled the curtain far forward and was out of sight of the house.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I swear I will! {{not a word}} nor a look if I {{can help}} it. No one guesses, and if it {{troubles}} no one, is there any harm in my keeping this, and taking comfort in the pretty fancy <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> sane in that cursed place?' ...|$|E
