5|$|Following the {{approval}} of the new Constitution, the 2009 general election was called. The opposition sought <b>to</b> <b>delay</b> <b>the</b> election by demanding a new biometric registry system, hoping that it would give them time to form a united front against MAS. Many MAS activists reacted violently against the demands, and attempting to prevent this. Morales went on a five-day hunger strike in April 2009 to push the opposition to rescind their demands. He also agreed to allow for the introduction of a new voter registry, but insisted that it was rushed through so as not <b>to</b> <b>delay</b> <b>the</b> election. Morales and the MAS won with a landslide majority, polling 64.2%, while voter participation had reached an all-time high of 90%. His primary opponent, Reyes Villa, gained 27% of the vote.

A prototype boiler {{was supposed to}} have been built ashore for evaluation, but it was not completed until early 1941, which further complicated the production plan.|$|E

The German division went on to frustrate the Allied attempt to advance on Rome during the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944.|$|E
