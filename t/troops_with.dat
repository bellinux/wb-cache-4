5|$|News {{then reached}} Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulantii were in open revolt against his authority.

Both Beach Recce Groups field a team of divers to clear mines, barriers and other obstacles from landing beaches.|$|R
5|$|The French {{suffered}} {{in the course of}} a ruinous retreat, including from the harshness of the Russian Winter. The Armée had begun as over 400,000 frontline <b>troops,</b> <b>with</b> fewer than 40,000 crossing the Berezina River in November 1812. The Russians had lost 150,000 in battle and hundreds of thousands of civilians.|$|E

5|$|During heavy rains, it {{was much}} more {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent <b>troops,</b> <b>with</b> lighter equipment, were able to flee into the bush (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E
5|$|For most of 1650, a Venetian {{fleet of}} 41 vessels {{maintained}} the blockade of the Dardanelles, prohibiting Haideragazade Mehmed Pasha from sailing for Crete. He was replaced {{late in the}} year by Hozamzade Ali Pasha, governor of Rhodes, who used a clever ploy to get through the blockade: waiting until winter, when the Venetians withdrew their forces, he assembled a small number of ships and embarked several thousand <b>troops</b> <b>with</b> many provisions on them, and sailed unmolested to Crete.|$|E
5|$|Four EEF {{infantry}} brigades of 10,000 rifles attacked four Ottoman regiments of 4,500 rifleswhich were {{reinforced by}} two divisions to over 8,000. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The attacks {{were to be}} carried out by well-prepared <b>troops,</b> <b>with</b> overwhelming artillery support and six Mark IV tanks. These attacks were designed to keep the Gaza garrison of 8,000 riflemen supported by 116 guns in place after the capture of Beersheba and during preparations for the main EEF attacks on Hareira and Sheria.|$|E
50|$|A {{regiment}} is {{organised into}} three reconnaissance squadrons, each <b>with</b> three reconnaissance <b>troops</b> of four Scimitars and a guided weapons troop of four Strikers.

The main combat strength is thus 12 Strikers and 36 Scimitars.|$|R
50|$|The RSTA Squadron is {{commanded}} by a Major {{and consists of}} 87 men: the RSTA squadron staff acts also as the Joint Fires Cell for its Marine Combat Group coordinating all types of fire support.

5|$|In April 2015, {{the federal}} Ministry of Defence {{launched}} its new Guulwade Plan (Victory Plan), {{which provides a}} roadmap for long-term development of the military. It was formulated with technical support from UNSOM. The framework stipulates that international partners are slated to provide capacity-building as well as assistance for joint operations to 10,900 Somali national army <b>troops,</b> <b>with</b> these units drawn from various regions in the country.|$|E
5|$|Patton's {{colorful}} image, hard-driving {{personality and}} {{success as a}} commander were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements. His philosophy of leading from the front {{and his ability to}} inspire <b>troops</b> <b>with</b> vulgarity-ridden speeches, such as a famous address to the Third Army, attracted favorable attention. His strong emphasis on rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective. While Allied leaders held sharply differing opinions on Patton, he was regarded highly by his opponents in the German High Command. A popular, award-winning biographical film released in 1970 helped transform Patton into an American hero.|$|E
5|$|Scouts South Africa is {{actively}} involved in community work, particularly {{in the rural areas}} of South Africa. In some rural areas, such as the greater Tzaneen area, there are <b>Troops</b> <b>with</b> over 100 Scouts. Rural Troops are often limited in their activities by funding and lack of equipment. Their programme focuses on educating the Scouts in becoming good citizens and in the dangers of HIV. Educating Scouts in HIV and AIDS is vitally important due to the large number of infections in both rural and urban areas of South Africa.|$|E

5|$|The French {{forces were}} now {{east of the}} Prussians, behind their lines. Theoretically the Prussians could have marched {{straight}} towards Paris unopposed, but this course was never seriously considered: the threat to their lines of supply and communication was too great to be ignored. The unfavorable situation was compounded by bad weather and an alarming increase in sickness among the <b>troops.</b> <b>With</b> few other options available, Brunswick turned back and prepared to do battle.|$|E
5|$|The Notitia lists a few {{units of}} presumably light {{infantry}} with names denoting specialist function: superventores and praeventores ("interceptors") exculcatores ("trackers"), exploratores ("scouts"). At the same time, Ammianus describes light-armed <b>troops</b> <b>with</b> various terms: velites, leves armaturae, exculcatores, expediti. It is unclear from the context {{whether any of}} these were independent units, specialist sub-units, or indeed just detachments of ordinary troops specially armed for a particular operation. The Notitia evidence implies that, {{at least in some}} cases, Ammianus could be referring to independent units.|$|E
5|$|The few Turks {{who survived}} the {{massacre}} fled into the mountains, where the majority {{were killed by the}} local population. Ali, who spoke Romanian put on some peasant clothes and fled to Wallachia. Some 30,000 Turks died in the battle, whereas Báthory lost 8,000 Hungarians and some 2,000 Transylvanian Saxons and Transylvanian Wallachians. The two commanders feasted together with their <b>troops,</b> <b>with</b> Kinizsi dancing with a dead Turk as his companion.|$|E
