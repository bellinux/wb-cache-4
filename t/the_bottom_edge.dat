5|$|According to the CBS document, the {{original}} Bhutanese flag was a bicolour square flag divided diagonally {{from the lower}} hoist to the upper fly. The field of yellow extended from the hoist to the upper fly, and the red field extended from the fly end to the lower hoist. In {{the centre of the}} flag, at the convergence of the yellow and red fields, is a green Druk, located parallel to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> and facing the fly.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Ark Royal, the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds. As the Swordfish approached, Bismarck fired her main battery at Sheffield, straddling the cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on Sheffield, killing {{three men and}} wounding several others. Sheffield quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; Bismarck began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers. One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{returned}} to active service after the United States {{declared war on}} Germany on 6 April 1917, entering World War I. She was assigned to Division 4 of the Battleship Force, based at Tangier Sound in Chesapeake Bay. She spent the war as a training ship for gunners and engine room personnel. During this time, Vice Admiral Albert W. Grant, the commander of Battleship Force 1, instituted a program to reinforce the bulkheads of the ships under his command. This improved their ability to absorb underwater damage and remain afloat. On 29 September 1918, while cruising off Fenwick Island with the destroyer , she struck a naval mine that had been laid by the U-boat U-117, which inflicted serious damage but caused no casualties. The explosion tore a gaping hole in the hull from frame 5 to frame 16, and from the keel to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> of the armor belt. The bow flooded, but the repaired bulkheads prevented the flooding from spreading. Reduced to a speed of , Minnesota {{made it back to}} the Philadelphia Navy Yard where repairs were effected. The work lasted for five months, by which time Germany had signed the Armistice that ended the war.|$|E

The choli may be sewn so that the elaborately woven borders of the sari material form <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> choli sleeves. However, cholis need not match the sari. There is a growing trend towards stretchy, comfortable cholis made from knit materials.|$|R
5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, and the face is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown carapace, reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair that makes them look about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange carapace and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown carapace and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E

While not widespread, some users found the lighting to be inconsistent, causing <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> to cast irregular shadows. Also, some users complained that the light can only be dimmed, not turned off completely.|$|E
5000|$|All {{stringer}} {{and some}} block pallets have [...] "unidirectional bases," [...] i.e. bottom boards oriented in one direction. While automated handling equipment {{can be designed}} for this, often it can operate faster and more effectively if <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edges</b> of a pallet have bottom boards oriented in both directions. For example, it may not need to turn a pallet to rack it, and operation is less sensitive to pallet orientation.|$|R

25|$|Wooden wedges may {{be forced}} between the stage and <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> of the wagon perimeter. Ideally, the wedges are driven under the wagon {{to the extent that}} the wagon is {{supported}} by the wedges instead of its casters. Wedges are typically used in pairs, on opposite sides of the wagon so that the wagon can't slip off the wedges.|$|E
25|$|An older {{method of}} {{harvesting}} {{is to use}} a sweep net, which operates a bit like a purse seine net. The sweep net is a big net with weights along <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge.</b> It is stretched across the pen with <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> extending {{to the bottom of the}} pen. Lines attached to the bottom corners are raised, herding some fish into the purse, where they are netted. Before killing, the fish are usually rendered unconscious in water saturated in carbon dioxide, although this practice is being phased out in some countries due to ethical and product quality concerns. More advanced systems use a percussive-stun harvest system that kills the fish instantly and humanely with a blow to the head from a pneumatic piston. They are then bled by cutting the gill arches and immediately immersing them in iced water. Harvesting and killing methods are designed to minimise scale loss, and avoid the fish releasing stress hormones, which negatively affect flesh quality.|$|E
25|$|The medal is {{a silver}} or bronze disk, 36 millimetres in diameter, with a {{straight}} clasp suspender without swivel. The medal was designed by W. McMillan and struck by the Royal Mint. The recipient's name, rank, service number and unit are impressed on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> of the medal. On medals awarded to Army officers, {{with the exception of}} the Royal Artillery, the name of the regiment or corps was omitted.|$|E
5000|$|The binder got {{its name}} because it was sold in {{combination}} with pocket folders designed by Mead called [...] "Trappers", which differed from other pocket folders in that the pockets' three sides connected with <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> outside <b>edge,</b> and top (as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>bottom,</b> outside <b>edge,</b> and spine) of the folders. This design prevented papers from {{falling out of the}} Trapper's pockets when it was closed. Trappers were three-hole punched so that they could be put in any 3-ring binder, including a Trapper Keeper.|$|R
50|$|Along <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> side, {{located near}} the user's ears, are a pair of small, red 3D audio speakers. The speakers, {{competing}} against typical sound systems, do not obstruct external sounds, allowing the user to hear virtual sounds, along with the environment. Using head-related transfer functions, the HoloLens generates binaural audio, which can simulate spatial effects; meaning the user, virtually, can perceive and locate a sound, as though it is coming from a virtual pinpoint or location.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{variation}} {{is called a}} reverse tooth blade. On reverse tooth blades, <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> 3/4" [...] of the teeth are reversed (point up). This arrangement helps to reduce splintering on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edges</b> of <b>the</b> cut. However, it does not clear sawdust out of the cut {{as well as a}} regular blade, so cutting is slower and produces more heat. This heat reduces blade life and makes scorching of the workpiece more likely. Reverse tooth blades are especially useful when cutting softwood and plywood such as Baltic birch.|$|R
25|$|The {{single side}} door, {{which had been}} {{introduced}} to around 6½ per cent of Mark B production vehicles after November 1951, became a standard fixture on the Mark C. Because the car's monocoque construction depended principally upon its skin for rigidity, the size of door was severely limited and to overcome the resulting decrease in structural rigidity, vertical steel strengthening brackets were fitted either side and along <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> of the door aperture.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting in the helmet. This {{can be a}} real {{emergency}} and life-threatening if not handled effectively, as the diver can aspirate the vomit and asphyxiate. Once again, the action is to open the free flow valve, preferably before vomiting, and to inhale as carefully as possible. If there is no free flow valve, as on a full face mask, the purge button should clear the demand valve and oro-nasal mask, and the mask can be rinsed by lifting <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> away from the face to let in some water, before purging again.|$|E

25|$|The {{image is}} of a funeral {{procession}} of beings, possibly celestial, {{led by an}} angel-figure floating above the ground. The profiles of the figures suggest pre-Columbian art, and possibly an ancient Egyptian influence, as well. The angel-figure {{as well as the}} mourners have luminous peaks above their heads, in a re-imagining of halos. The shapes of the peaks are repeated by tongues of fire that point up from <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> of the painting. The image strongly suggests an afterworld, {{but it is not clear}} from the image whether the environment correlates to tradition Christian understandings of heaven or hell. Xul Solar provides his viewer with a new image of an afterlife.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{clearing}} differ between the half mask, which covers {{the eyes and}} nose, and the full-face mask, which also covers the mouth. If the mask has a purge valve and the strap tension is correct, the diver holds the head so that the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good fit on the diver's face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> of the skirt. It {{may be necessary to}} press {{the upper part of the}} mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the fit is not perfect, or the strap is too low, contact pressure of the top edge against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.|$|E
25|$|The epigastric {{region is}} the upper central square and {{contains}} <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> {{of the liver}} {{as well as the}} upper areas of the stomach. The diaphragm curves like an upside down U over these three regions. The central right region is called the right lumbar region and contains the ascending colon and the right edge of the small intestines. The central square contains the transverse colon and the upper regions of the small intestines. The left lumbar region contains the left edge of the transverse colon and the left edge of the small intestine. The lower right square is the right iliac region and contains the right pelvic bones and the ascending colon. The lower left square is the left iliac region and contains the left pelvic bone and the lower left regions of the small intestine. The lower central square contains the bottom of the pubic bones, upper regions of the bladder and the lower region of the small intestine.|$|E
50|$|The plow blade is {{positioned}} {{in such a}} way that <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edges</b> run horizontally and the upper edges slope up and away from their crux at an angle nearly 30 degrees above horizontal. The front faces and top edges of the blade are painted safety yellow, evoking the tradition of public works. The back of the blade is painted dark gray. The plow head is suspended from the I-beam frame with a steel chain, giving it freedom to swing gently up and down. The tire is attached to the support structure with steel bolts.|$|R

25|$|To {{see that}} the Petersen graph has no Hamiltonian cycle C, {{consider}} the edges in the cut disconnecting the inner 5-cycle from the outer one. If there is a Hamiltonian cycle, an even number of these edges must be chosen. If only {{two of them are}} chosen, their end-vertices must be adjacent in the two 5-cycles, which is not possible. Hence 4 of them are chosen. Assume that the top edge of the cut is not chosen (all the other cases are the same by symmetry). Of the 5 edges in the outer cycle, the two top edges must be chosen, the two side edges must not be chosen, and hence <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>edge</b> must be chosen. The top two edges in the inner cycle must be chosen, but this completes a non-spanning cycle, which cannot be part of a Hamiltonian cycle. Alternatively, we can also describe the ten-vertex 3-regular graphs that do have a Hamiltonian cycle and show that none of them is the Petersen graph, by finding a cycle in each of them that is shorter than any cycle in the Petersen graph. Any ten-vertex Hamiltonian 3-regular graph consists of a ten-vertex cycle C plus five chords. If any chord connects two vertices at distance two or three along C from each other, the graph has a 3-cycle or 4-cycle, and therefore cannot be the Petersen graph. If two chords connect opposite vertices of C to vertices at distance four along C, there is again a 4-cycle. The only remaining case is a Möbius ladder formed by connecting each pair of opposite vertices by a chord, which again has a 4-cycle. Since the Petersen graph has girth five, it cannot be formed in this way and has no Hamiltonian cycle.|$|E
