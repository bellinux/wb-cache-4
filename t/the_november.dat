5|$|A {{featured}} preliminary {{match on}} Turning Point's card {{was for the}} TNA X Division Championship, in which the champion, Petey Williams, defended the championship against Chris Sabin. The match was promoted for Turning Point on <b>the</b> <b>November</b> 12 episode of Impact!. In the weeks leading to the encounter, Sabin stated {{he had found a}} counter to Williams' finishing maneuver the Canadian Destroyer, which was thought to be uncounterable. The Canadian Destroyer involves Williams grabbing an opponent with his legs around their head, jumping over their back, causing them to perform a backflip, and forcing their head into the mat after they make the full rotation. Making true to his word, Sabin countered the move three times before Turning Point; one on <b>the</b> <b>November</b> 12, one of <b>the</b> <b>November</b> 19, and the last on <b>the</b> <b>November</b> 30 episodes of Impact!.|$|E
