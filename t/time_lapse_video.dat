40|$|The {{topic of}} this master's thesis is the <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> from {{stationary}} camera images. Unwanted phenomena, which arise in <b>time</b> <b>lapse,</b> were analyzed and algorithms {{to overcome these}} limitations were designed.

The resulting application creates <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> from the <b>video</b> input and allows users to choose the processing technique including the setting of appropriate parameters...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a graphical {{model for the}} joint segmentation and tracking of E. coli cells from <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>videos.</b> In our setup cells are grown in narrow columns (growth channels) in a so-called “Mother Machine” [1]. In these growth channels, cells are vertically aligned, grow and divide over time, and eventually leave the channel at the top. The model is built on a large set of cell segmentation hypotheses for each video frame that we extract from data using a novel parametric max-flow variation. Possible tracking assignments between segments across time, including cell identity mapping, cell division, and cell exit events are enumerated. Each such assignment is represented as a binary decision variable with unary costs based on image and object features of the involved segments. We find a cost-minimal and consistent solution by solving an integer linear program. We {{introduce a}} new and important type of constraint that ensures that cells exit the Mother Machine in the correct order. Our method finds a globally optimal tracking solution with an accuracy of <[*] 95 % (1. 22 times the inter-observer error) and is on average 2 [*]−[*] 11 {{times faster than the}} microscope produces the raw data...|$|R

40|$|Chlamydia, {{the most}} common sexually {{transmitted}} pathogen, is an exquisitely adapted Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium. Intracellular Chlamydia trachomatis replicate in a specialized vacuole, termed inclusion, which shields the bacterium from antimicrobial immunity of the host cells and acts as a signalling interface. Previously it was shown {{that members of the}} interferon induced guanylate binding protein (mGBP) family, in particular murine GBP 1 and mGBP 2, were found to accumulate at the bacterial inclusions, similar to previously published recruitment of GBPs to the parasitophorous vacuole of Toxoplasma gondii. Here, we provide a wide comparison of mGBPs roles within the host cell in the context of Chlamydia and Toxoplasma infection. By confocal microscopy on fixed and living infected cells we show localization of mGBP 3, mGBP 6, mGBP 7, mGBP 9, and mGBP 10, in addition to mGBP 1 and mGBP 2, at chlamydia inclusions. In <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>videos</b> using GFP expressing Chlamydia we show rapid and transient dynamics of mGBP 9 accumulation onto chlamydia inclusions. Taken together this study reveals a broad activation of mGBP recruitment towards Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions after infection and provides evidence for time limited action of mGBP 9 at the chlamydia inclusion...|$|R

40|$|The {{transport}} system of cheilostome bryozoans is unusual among long-distance {{transport system}}s. In these colonial animals, {{a network of}} strands (the funicular system) carries nutrients to non-feeding individuals and to the growing edge of the colony. However a complex of cells appears to plug the pores that connect individuals. Focusing on the cheilostome, Membranipora membranacea, we used <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> movies to test whether there were contractions/dilations of funicular strands, as expected if muscular pumping were to move material through the strands, and to test whether cells or large vesicles moved directionally along the strands, potentially carrying nutrients. Neither contractions/dilations of the funicular strands, nor persistent movement of particles or other features along the strands, were visible in <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>videos</b> (10 to 120 min at 4 to 10 sec per frame). The only visible movements were rare back-and-forth movements along the strands, or shaking of the strands. We injected materials that differed in molecular/particle size to investigate the specificity of transport at pore plates. Both fluorescein (367 Da; as sodium salt) and fluorescein-dextran (70, 000 Da) moved between individuals; however 2. 0 μm fluorescent polystyrene beads did not. The fact that both fluorescein and fluorescein-dextran were transported suggests that transmembrane channel or transporter proteins are not required for transport; however {{there may be an}} upper size limit (< 2 μm) caused by something other than the pore itself. Our results are consistent with some transport mechanisms (e. g. paracellular diffusion or transcytosis at the pore plate) but inconsistent with others (muscularly-pumped flow along funicular strands, cell crawling, or transmembrane transport via transporter or channel proteins) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new method that improves upon the existing approaches to developing collaborative tools. The new method uses automatically inferred and manually recorded design rationale to intelligently filter {{the information that}} is shared by a collaborative tool. This re{{presents a}}n improvement upon the existing {{state of the art}} in collaborative engineering tools. To demonstrate the viability of the method three collaborative tools were created. The first is a multi-user collaborative design environment tool named SimulPart and built upon the NX CAD package. SimulPart uses the new method to limit the amount of communication required to keep every user in synch during a multi-user co-design session. The second implementation is a visual history tool named VisiHistory that allows designers to watch <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>videos</b> of the creation of a design that are automatically generated using the new method. The final tool is an intelligent user directory named SmartHelp that uses the new method to allow designers to identify which of their peers have expertise in certain CAD operations. Validation was performed for each of these tools by benchmarking the tool against the leading commercial solution or industry process. The results of the validation showed that the new method does in fact offer a superior collaborative solution as it outperforms the existing tools and methods in several key collaborative metrics. As a result of this work future efforts are encouraged into both improving upon the quality of the inferred design rationale and increasing the functionality of the three tools created using the new method...|$|R

40|$|Contagious Matters {{attempts}} to associate biological matter, specifically cancer cells, {{with the concept}} of contagion, by using my working methodology, Microethnography. This method-in-development, in its relational co-existence with ethnography, navigates or explores the micro world by examining micro matters' social activities. This social proliferation of cancer amongst itself, other cells (i. e. fibroblasts) and its ecology, promotes an often-unobserved form of social amalgamation that can be described as a contagious event or events. The re-suspension of the concept of contagion through the use of both the sciences and ethnography via this hybrid methodology will hopefully bring to light new forms of evaluating things beyond the scope of purely human existence and experience. As part of the research creation project, Contagious Matters, this multimedia installation brings together the micro and macro worlds of cancer culture. The two installations merge technology, science, art and culture through the use of traditional artistic media/practice and scientific media/practice. My paintings represent a micro culture fixed in time and space through scientific/digital practice, and captures the essence of what cancer culture looks like on a cellular level, rendered in large scale. The animation, projected onto the painted substrates, act as a live feed in order to witness the often-unseen live culture. The <b>time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>videos</b> of live HeLa cells, which I cultured in a lab and recorded, exemplify the cell's communicative properties within its ecology over space and time. This visual use of my developing methodology {{attempts to}} re-suspend the concept of contagion via cancer's movement and rapid growth within its ecology and allows viewers to think about the concept of contagion as a social event and not merely as a physiological one. The installations include an audio recording of my mother, who battled cancer over the past four years, and focuses on how the disease socially and physiologically impacted her existence. This fusion of the seen and unseen, between the micro and the macro worlds, reverses itself in this creative exploration, where the voice is a mere aural presence versus that of the seen micro matter...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{infection}} process and ethylene production by Fusarium oxysporum (Schlect.) f. sp. tulipae Apt. (F. o. t.) in tulip bulbs after harvest. This dissertation aimed: 1) to develop screening assays {{to study the}} infection and ethylene evolution of F. o. t. in tulip bulbs, 2) to determine the degree of resistance to Fusarium between several cutlivars, and members of lineages of cultivar sports, and 3) to generate a profile of metabolites of two cultivars (one susceptible, and one resistant) involved in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway of F. o. t., and compounds involved in confering resistance to this pathogen. Chapter 2 presents a literature review. Chapter 3 describes a multi-step procedure to isolate, characterize and identify Fusarium strains allegedly causing Fusarium rot in tulip bulbs. Chapter 4 evaluates various inoculation methods on {{the time course of}} fresh weight loss and ethylene production by F. o. t. Moist incubation conditions free of condensation led to healthy fungal development. Change in fresh weight {{can be used as a}} predictor of ethylene production by the fungus. Chapter 5 explores the correlation between ethylene evolution, visual infection rating, and FW loss of 38 cultivars and 2 species when inoculated with F. o. t. A Disease Severity Index (DSI) was developed to determine the degree of resistance to F. o. t. Cultivars and species ranged from resistant to susceptible. <b>Time</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>videos</b> show the infection process by F. o. t. in a susceptible cultivar and fungal growth suppression in a resistant cultivar. Chapter 6 presents the ethylene production in-vitro by F. o. t. in organs explants, and ethylene production in organs from whole inoculated bulbs. Results in organs from whole inoculated bulbs were similar to the in-vitro assay, however, biological contamination created experimental noise. Amino acid content and tulipaline-A in crude extracts from organs of two cultivars before inoculation did not correspond to ethylene production and fungal biomass of F. o. t. We postulate that tulipaline-A is a phytoanticipin in tulip bulbs, which in resistant cultivars may increase to fungitoxic levels under pathogen attack as a result of tuliposide breakdown by enzyme activity or chemical depolymerization by pH change in the tissue...|$|R
