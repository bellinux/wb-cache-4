No soldiers were killed, though some were badly bloodied. Three more prisoners subsequently died. Kurnaz {{said that people}} from the cellblock of these prisoners <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> events. They described the metal shutters being closed. They said that night, soldiers carried three of the prisoners out of their cells dead, with pieces of torn sheet in their mouths and other torn sheets binding their arms and legs. US authorities said these three prisoners had committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|On April 25, 1972, George McGovern won the Massachusetts {{primary and}} Novak phoned Democratic {{politicians}} around the country, who agreed with his assessment that traditional blue collar Democrat voters {{were unaware of}} McGovern’s true beliefs. On April 27, 1972, Novak reported in a column that an unnamed Democratic senator had <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> McGovern. “The people don’t know McGovern is for amnesty, abortion, and legalization of pot,” the senator said. “Once middle America—Catholic middle America, in particular—finds this out, he’s dead.” The label stuck and McGovern {{became known as the}} candidate of “amnesty, abortion, and acid,” leading to his defeat that November in a 49 state landslide loss.|$|E

He said he had been beaten and taken to the ranch where he was told to pose with the exhumed bodies. When asked if he had ever met Constanzo, he stated that he had seen him in person at the ranch with the Hernándezes but never talked to him. Martínez Salinas said he was arrested one afternoon at Elio's in-law's house when {{he was looking for a}} car piece for his vehicle. He said he had known Aldrete years before, since he had dated one of her sisters when he was young. He said that he had never heard Aldrete talk about the cult. He said she had talked about her school and marriage. He also said that Elio and Ovidio never invited him to the cult or <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E

It was nice being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character. Because actors, a lot of times, think about their characters more than the writers because they’re focused on that single character for months of their lives, if not years. He was all prepared for this." ...|$|E
500|$|The role of Frank, the suicidal Proust scholar, was {{originally}} written for Bill Murray, {{and there was}} also studio pressure for Robin Williams. The directing duo chose Steve Carell for the role a few months before filming began, and in an interview revealed: [...] "When we met with Steve Carell, we didn't know he could do this based upon what he had done. But when we met with him and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the character, the tone of the movie and the way we were approaching it, he was right on the same page with us". Although known to Comedy Central viewers for many years as a correspondent on the highly rated satirical news program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, at the time Carell was cast for Little Miss Sunshine, he was relatively unknown in Hollywood. Producers of the film were worried that he was not a big enough star and did not have much acting experience.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Jennings {{recalled}} the restrictions of the Nashville establishment: [...] "They wouldn't {{let you do}} anything. You had to dress a certain way: {{you had to do}} everything a certain way.... They kept trying to destroy me.... I just went about my business and did things my way.... You start messing with my music, I get mean." [...] By 1972, after the release of Ladies Love Outlaws, his recording contract was nearing an end. Sick with hepatitis, Jennings was hospitalized. Afflicted by disease, and the music industry, he was considering retirement. Albright visited him and convinced him to continue. Albright <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> making Neil Reshen his new manager. Meanwhile, Jennings requested a US$25,000 royalty advance from RCA Records to cover his living expenses during his recovery. The same day he met Rashen, RCA sent Jerry Bradley to offer Jennings US$5,000 as a bonus for signing a new 5% royalty deal with RCA, the same terms he had accepted in 1965. After reviewing with Reshen, he rejected the offer and hired Reshen.|$|E

500|$|While in prison, Cox mailed several {{letters to}} the St. Petersburg Times in 2008 in which he accused {{politician}} Kevin White of taking bribes from him during Cox's criminal career. He claims he made payoffs to White, an ultimately successful candidate for the Tampa City Council, in 2002 and 2003. Cox said White {{told him he could}} not receive the money directly, and suggested that Cox have friends donate $500 each, and then reimburse them. Records and statements from those who donated show that Cox did in fact make numerous contributions to White's campaign, and reimbursed others who did so as well. White, he claims, agreed to vote to rezone vacant properties in Tampa and Ybor City. When Cox was first arrested, the FBI <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> White, whom they were also investigating, and he told them the same information. He claimed to have paid him $7,000 in cash in addition to the recorded contributions he arranged. When White and a fellow City Council member were told Cox's contributions might have been illegal in 2004, his colleague told the police, while White kept silent. White has denied that he knew these contributions were reimbursed, and called Cox's accusations [...] "the jailhouse ramblings of a reputed con man." [...] White said he befriended Cox when he came to believe the con man was interested in revitalizing Tampa Heights. Cox had fled the Tampa area before White cast any rezoning votes, so there is no voting record which could help confirm the validity of his accusations. In 2012, White, who had gone on to serve as Hillsborough County Commissioner, was convicted of unrelated federal bribery and corruption charges and sentenced to three years in federal prison.|$|E

She was in Medina to found the second of her convents for women. She immediately <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> her reformation projects for the Order: she was seeking to restore {{the purity of the}} Carmelite Order by restarting observance of its [...] "Primitive Rule" [...] of 1209, observance of which had been relaxed by Pope Eugene IV in 1432.|$|E
