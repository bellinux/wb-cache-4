5|$|Several {{of these}} rights {{regulate}} pre-trial procedure: {{access to a}} non-excessive bail, the right to indictment by a grand jury, the right to an information (charging document), <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> speedy trial, {{and the right to}} be tried in a specific venue. Several of these rights are trial rights: the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses at trial, the right to confront witnesses at trial, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> public trial, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> trial by an impartial petit jury selected from a specific geography, and the right not to be compelled to testify against oneself. Others, such as the assistance of counsel and due process rights, have application throughout the proceeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground of}} fettering {{discretion}} {{on this basis}} is distinct from <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair hearing. The latter relates to a separate ground of judicial review, namely, procedural impropriety, and particularly the audi alteram partem ("hear the other side") principle.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} article, {{cataloguing}} {{the rights of}} man, Mason derived the following articles, which make clear {{that the role of}} government is to secure and protect those rights, and if it fails to do so, the {{people have a right to}} amend or abolish it. Property could not be taken for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives. If accused, a person had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> speedy and local trial, based on an accusation made known to him, with the right to call for evidence and witnesses in his favor.|$|E

5|$|On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts {{became the}} first state in the U.S. to legalize {{same-sex}} marriage after a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling in November 2003 determined that the exclusion of same-sex couples from <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> civil marriage was unconstitutional. This decision was eventually superseded by the U.S. Supreme Court's affirmation of same-sex marriage in the United States in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Act of Parliament {{governing}} the enclosure of Portishead {{was passed in}} 1814, and stipulated <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> public wharf, although there is historical evidence of nautical connections {{dating back to the}} Patent Rolls of 1331. Around the 1860s, {{at the height of the}} iron and steel era, a pier and a deep-water dock were built by the Bristol & Portishead Pier and Railway to accommodate the large ships that had difficulty in reaching Bristol Harbour. They brought valuable cargoes from across the globe and exported local products overseas. Ships carrying coal were commonplace in Portishead Docks.|$|E

5|$|Another rivalry {{leading up}} to the event was between The Undertaker and Batista over the World Heavyweight Championship. At the Royal Rumble in January, The Undertaker won the 2007 Royal Rumble match. As a result, he was given <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> title match at WrestleMania for any of WWE's three major championships (ECW World, World Heavyweight, or WWE). On the February 5 episode of Raw, Undertaker teased all three World Champions (Bobby Lashley, Batista, and John Cena). Undertaker then chose World Heavyweight Champion Batista as his {{opponent}} to face at WrestleMania 23. At WrestleMania, The Undertaker defeated Batista to win the World Heavyweight Championship to extend his WrestleMania undefeated streak to 15-0. Their rivalry, however, did not end, as General Manager Theodore Long booked a Last Man Standing match—a match where the first person unable to respond to a ten count by the referee lost—between The Undertaker and Batista at Backlash.|$|E
5|$|Chesney {{served as}} a royal justice in Lincolnshire during his bishopric, and {{maintained}} {{a close relationship with}} his nephew, Foliot. He was also an early patron of Thomas Becket, and gave the young cleric an office in his diocese early in Becket's career. Although shown favour by King Stephen of England, including <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mint, Chesney was present at the coronation of King Henry II of England in 1154 and went on to serve Henry as a royal justice. Around 1160, Chesney became embroiled in a dispute with St Albans Abbey in the diocese of Lincoln, over his right as bishop to supervise the abbey. The dispute was eventually settled when the abbey granted Chesney land in return for his relinquishing any right to oversee St Albans.|$|E
5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates {{wanted to bring}} the Convention's business {{to an end and}} return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to go home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E

5|$|Dietrich v The Queen, is an {{important}} legal case, stemming from an incident that took place on 17 December 1986, that was decided in the High Court of Australia on 13 November 1992. It concerned the nature of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair trial, {{and under what circumstances}} indigent defendants (defendants who cannot afford legal representation) should be provided with legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented. It is {{an important}} case in Australian criminal law, and also in Australian constitutional law, since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Friday {{was known}} at Hayes for his {{excessive}} drinking, {{and on one}} occasion the team started a match a player short because Friday had not turned up. When he finally arrived, eighty minutes after kick-off, his intoxication was obvious, {{but he was still}} sent onto the pitch with the match still goalless. The opposition paid him little attention and Friday scored a late winning goal. Hayes were drawn to play Football League Fourth Division club Reading in the FA Cup's second round on 9 December 1972; the team managed to draw 0–0 at Reading and earn <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> replay at home, which they lost 1–0 three days later. Although Hayes had lost, the interest of Reading manager Charlie Hurley was piqued. Hurley travelled to Hayes more than once to watch Friday. Having researched the player's background, he was cautious about signing him, but was impressed all the same by his on-field performances.|$|E
5|$|Heydrich's widow Lina won <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pension {{following}} {{a series of}} court cases against the West German government in 1956 and 1959. She was declared entitled to a substantial pension as her husband was a German general killed in action. The government had previously declined to pay due to Heydrich's role in the Holocaust. The couple had four children: Klaus, born in 1933, killed in a traffic accident in 1943; Heider, born in 1934; Silke, born in 1939; and Marte, born shortly after her father's death in 1942. Lina wrote a memoir, Leben mit einem Kriegsverbrecher (Living With a War Criminal), {{which was published in}} 1976. She remarried once and died in 1985.|$|E

5|$|John's {{attempt to}} impose de Gray's {{election}} as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 {{was the beginning}} of the king's long quarrel with Pope Innocent III. After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. John postponed a decision while delegations from the bishops of England and the monks of the cathedral chapter went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> say in who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior, but according to canon law the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a say in the election, as the archbishop was a major tenant-in-chief and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisers.|$|E
5|$|Navarro stated, on 21 August 2010, {{that the}} case was stagnating because an {{official}} interpreter was unable to be found for the case in Peru. The Peruvian association of translators and interpreters and the Dutch embassy both separately stated {{at the time that}} they have been unable to locate one to officially translate Spanish into Dutch. Unlike Aruba and the United States, Peru does not guarantee <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> speedy trial. On 6 September, a Peruvian appeals court voted 2 to 1 to reject Van der Sloot's motion that he is being unlawfully held. Because 3 votes are required for a decision, if a fourth judge voted in Van der Sloot's favor, a fifth judge would be required to break the tie. Peruvian statutes permit a suspect to be detained for up to 18 months for interrogation, though Navarro expressed skepticism that law enforcement officers would do so with his client.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{is one of}} {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do not have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the conviction of a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E

5|$|On the June 30 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, a match between six wrestlers {{for a new}} top-tier SmackDown! {{championship}} was held. JBL, one of the participants, was victorious in the match, but Theodore Long {{announced that he was}} still not the champion. Instead he had won <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> match against the World Heavyweight champion, Batista, who was SmackDown!'s final 2005 draft pick, making the World Heavyweight Championship exclusive to SmackDown!. The following week, it was announced Batista would meet JBL at The Great American Bash with the World Heavyweight championship on the line. At the Great American Bash, Batista was disqualified for attacking JBL with a chair and JBL was declared the winner. In WWE, a title cannot be won by disqualification, but only by pinfall or submission (the normal scoring conditions in professional wrestling matches). As a result, Batista retained the title.|$|E
