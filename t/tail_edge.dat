The bag-net should be of strong spunyarn, or (still better) of hide [...] "such as those hides of the wild cattle of the Pampas, which the tobacconists receive from South America," [...] cut into thongs, and netted close. It should be loosely laced together with a thong at the <b>tail</b> <b>edge</b> in order to be opened easily, when brought on board, without canting the net over, and pouring the contents roughly out through the mouth. The dragging-rope should be strong, and at least three times as long as the perpendicular depth of the water in which you are working; if, indeed, there is much breeze, or any swell at all, still more line should be veered out. The inboard end should be made fast somewhere in the stern sheets, the dredge hove to windward, the boat put before the wind; and you may then amuse yourself as you will for the next quarter of an hour, provided that you have got ready various wide-mouthed bottles for the more delicate monsters, and a couple of buckets, to receive the large lumps of oysters and serpulae which you will probably bring to the surface.|$|E

The CFD RANS-SST with a commercial code ANSYS CFX simulation is performed for the fully submerged NACA 0012 aerofoil of 150 mm chord length with three <b>tailing</b> <b>edge</b> shapes: standard straight line, saw-toothed and sine-curved shapes. The results show that a 25 % increment of drag coefficient for saw-toothed <b>tailing</b> <b>edge</b> shape compared to the standard <b>tailing</b> <b>edge</b> shapes at Re = 5. 25 × 104, and the increase of 14 % at Re = 1. 05 × 105 and 2. 10 × 105. At Re= 5. 25 × 104, the sine-curved <b>tailing</b> <b>edge</b> shape also caused a 16 % of drag increment comparing with the standard <b>tailing</b> <b>edge,</b> while at = 1. 05 × 105 and 2. 10 × 105, the sine-curved <b>tailing</b> <b>edge</b> provided same drag results as the standard <b>tailing</b> <b>edge.</b> The result suggests that, in term of drag reduction, there is no benefit of using the alternative <b>tailing</b> <b>edge</b> shapes for NACA 0012...|$|R

For example, one notation records that [...] "Què (雀) sent 250 (tortoise shells)", identifying this as, perhaps, a statelet within the Shang sphere of influence. These notations were generally made {{on the back of the}} shell's bridge (called bridge notations), the lower carapace, or the xiphiplastron (<b>tail</b> <b>edge).</b> Some shells may have been from locally raised tortoises, however. Scapula notations were near the socket or a lower edge. Some of these notations were not carved after being written with a brush, proving (along with other evidence) the use of the writing brush in Shang times. Scapulae are assumed to have generally come from the Shang's own livestock, perhaps those used in ritual sacrifice, although there are records of cattle sent as tribute as well, including some recorded via marginal notations.|$|E

40|$|Sexual {{selection}} and aerodynamic forces affecting structural {{properties of the}} flight feathers of birds are poorly understood. Here, we compared the structural features of the innermost primary wing feather (P 1) and the sexually dimorphic outermost (Ta 6) and monomorphic second outermost (Ta 5) tail feathers of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from a Romanian population to investigate how sexual {{selection and}} resistance to aerodynamic forces affect structural differences among these feathers. Furthermore, we compared structural proper-ties of Ta 6 of barn swallows from six European populations. Finally, we determined the rela-tionship between feather growth bars width (GBW) and the structural properties of tail feathers. The structure of P 1 indicates strong resistance against aerodynamic forces, while the narrow rachis, low vane density and low bending stiffness of tail feathers suggest reduced resistance against airflow. The highly elongated Ta 6 is characterized by structural modifications such as large rachis width and increased barbule density {{in relation to the}} less elongated Ta 5, which can be explained by increased length and/or high aerodynamic forces acting at the leading <b>tail</b> <b>edge.</b> However, these changes in Ta 6 structure do not allo...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) {{resonance}} on the optical absorption spectra of strongly biased superlattices are theoretically investigated. Exciton Fano resonance (FR) states in this system are calculated based on the multichannel scattering theory. When the bias of a static electric field (F) is applied such that a WSL subband state is energetically aligned with its adjacent ones, resulting in an anticrossing with strong repulsion due to Zener resonance, we obtain the following findings. (i) The onset of exciton absorption noticeably shifts toward the lower energy side, accompanying the oscillation {{of the magnitude of}} the absorption tail with the change in F. However, for the anticrossing, this effect is limited to a small localized region of F. In fact, a slight change in F away from the anticrossing leads to a peculiar suppression of the redshift of the absorption <b>tail</b> <b>edge.</b> (ii) The absorption intensities and the positions of the FR states vary in an irregular manner due to the Zener breakdown as F traverses the anticrossing region. For instances in a certain WSL state, the oscillator strength is reduced by a large extent only in the anticrossing region, followed by recovery of the intensity out of this region. Moreover, the changes in Fano’s q values with respect to F are also discussed. As described in (i) and (ii), these two effects on the exciton spectra are due to the delocalization of WSL wave functions across several periods that accompany the strong anticrossing...|$|E

The inconsistency in sexual dimorphism and in change in quality traits of Ta 6 among six European populations shows that multiple factors may contribute to shaping population differences. In general, the difference in quality traits between tail feathers cannot be explained by the GBW of feathers. Our results show that the material and structural properties of wing and tail feathers of barn swallows change as a result of aerodynamic forces and sexual selection, although the result of these changes can be contrasting.

40|$|Climate warming {{leads to}} {{permafrost}} degradation and permafrost melting phase transition, {{resulting in an}} increasing number of landslides. This study uses the road segments and road area at the intersection between Bei’an-Heihe Highway and the northwest section of the Lesser Khingan Range in north China as the study area. By means of geological survey combined with meteorological data, we analyzed the impact of climate change on landslide movement in the permafrost zone. Over a 60 year period, the average annual temperature of the study area has increased by 3. 2 °C, and permafrost degradation is severe. Loose soil on the hillside surface provides appropriate conditions for the infiltration of atmospheric precipitation and snowmelt, and seepage from thawing permafrost. As it infiltrates downwards, water is blocked by the underlying permafrost or dense soil, and infiltrates along this barrier layer toward lower positions，forming a potential sliding zone. The representative Landslide in the study area was examined in detail. Displacement monitoring points were set up {{on the surface of the}} landslide mass, and at the trailing edge of the landslide mass. The data collected were used to investigate the relationship between landslide movement and pore water pressure at the <b>tailing</b> <b>edge</b> as well as the ground temperature. The results show that the landslide movement process changes with the season, showing a notable annual cyclical characteristic and seasonal activity. Landslide movement is characterized by low angles and intermittence. The time of slide occurrence and the slip rate show a corresponding relationship with the pore water pressure at the <b>tailing</b> <b>edge</b> of the landslide mass. The seepage of water from thawing into the landslide mass will influence the pore water pressure at the <b>tailing</b> <b>edge</b> of the landslide mass, and is the main cause of landslide movement...|$|R

The distribution of M 130 and PP 1 C as well as myosin II was examined in smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting after differential extraction. Myosin and M 130 colocalized with actin stress fibers in permeabilized cells. However, in nonpermeabilized cells the staining for myosin and M 130 was different, with myosin mostly at {{the periphery of the}} cell and the M 130 appearing diffusely throughout the cytoplasm. Accordingly, most M 130 was recovered in a soluble fraction during permeabilization of cells, but the conditions used affected the solubility of both M 130 and myosin. The PP 1 C alpha isoform colocalized with M 130 and also was in the nucleus, whereas the PP 1 C delta isoform was localized prominently in the nucleus and in focal adhesions. In migrating cells, M 130 concentrated in the <b>tailing</b> <b>edge</b> and was depleted from the leading half of the cell, where double staining showed myosin II was present.
