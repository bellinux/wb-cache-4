5|$|While {{previous}} games {{used only}} a simple life bar, Snake Eater also {{keeps track of}} injuries over the entire body. For example, a long fall could fracture Snake's leg, slowing him down until the injury is properly treated with a splint and bandage.

5|$|Born in Sylvan Lake, New York, {{he played}} {{organized}} baseball {{from the time}} that he was a child, from playing in the local sandlots to the semi-professional Actives of Wappingers Falls, New York. On July 7, , while running the bases, he collided at home plate with a catcher, named Johnny Quigley, of the Clippers of Harlem. Quigley was knocked unconscious, having suffered a traumatic head injury, and later died from <b>these</b> <b>injuries</b> on August 12. The 19-year-old Brouthers was cleared of any wrongdoing by the authorities.|$|E
5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar and bolts inserted around his spine. According to Brown, <b>these</b> <b>injuries</b> {{made it impossible to}} for him to assault V. N. as described in the police report. The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a decision as to whether the evidence was submissable at a later date.|$|E
30|$|Ischemia/reperfusion {{injuries}} {{can lead}} to cellular necrosis or apoptosis, {{also referred to as}} programmed cell death. The development of apoptosis is dependent on several cellular processes, including mitochondria dysfunction, activation of caspase enzymes, and other cellular energy metabolism disorders. Hypothermia has been observed to affect almost all of <b>these</b> <b>injury</b> processes, thereby preventing the initiation or interrupting {{the early stages of the}} apoptotic pathway [25]. The window of opportunity to initiate therapeutic hypothermia to mitigate apoptosis after anoxia is broad, as apoptosis begins relatively late and continues for a long duration. Therefore, mitigating the effects of <b>these</b> <b>injury</b> processes of the apoptotic pathway is a viable treatment for neuroprotection in patients.|$|R

5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. His right eye was battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All <b>these</b> <b>injuries</b> occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E

5|$|Laffoon's early {{education}} was {{obtained in the}} public schools of Madisonville. While there, one of his teachers was his sister, Susan Isabella Laffoon, who was only 16 years old. At age 15, while plowing a field, Laffoon was kicked in the hip by a mule, requiring a six-week stay in a Nashville hospital. In the winter of the same year, he slipped on some ice and re-injured the hip. As a result of <b>these</b> <b>injuries,</b> his right leg was one-and-a-half inches shorter than his left leg, requiring him to wear special shoes and walk with a cane and a limp {{for the rest of his}} life. After his injury, Laffoon's parents decided that he could not make his living as a farmer and sent him to the private school of W. C. O'Bryan. By age 17, he was teaching in the common schools of Charleston in Hopkins County.|$|E

5|$|In July 2007, DiBiase {{signed a}} {{developmental}} deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and debuted in their training territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). He made his FCW debut on August 4 in a tag team match, {{in which he}} and Jake Hager defeated Keith Walker and Heath Miller. In October, DiBiase {{became a member of}} the Next Generation Hart Foundation faction alongside Harry Smith, TJ Wilson, Nattie Neidhart, and Teddy Hart. He quickly separated from the group, however, and gained Maryse as a valet. On December 18, 2007, DiBiase defeated TJ Wilson to win the FCW Southern Heavyweight Championship in New Port Richey, Florida. DiBiase, however, was unable to defend it due to an injury sustained, so he awarded the championship to his partner Heath Miller on January 19, 2008. As of March 2008, DiBiase had suffered from a multitude of injuries including sciatica, a fractured left knee, separated ribs, broken finger, and bone spurs in his elbow. Due to <b>these</b> <b>injuries,</b> DiBiase competed sporadically in FCW for the next few months, competing in both tag team and singles competition.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 2014, a {{day after}} the Twitter controversy, Sunanda was found dead in room number 345 of the Leela Palace hotel in Chanakyapuri, New Delhi, where the couple had shifted to, as their house was being renovated and painted. Shashi Tharoor {{discovered}} her body, when she did not wake up from her sleep in the evening. He informed the Delhi Police, who recovered the body from the hotel and sent it for postmortem. According to initial reports, Sunanda was suspected to have committed suicide. Later reports stated that {{the cause of death was}} unnatural; the doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences gave a preliminary autopsy report that revealed injury marks on her body. They said that <b>these</b> <b>injuries</b> may or may not be the cause of death. The autopsy indicated that she died of drug overdose, most likely a combination of sedatives, other strong medicines and probably alcohol. An investigation has been ordered by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to examine the cause of poisoning and to ascertain if it was murder or suicide. Her body was cremated at Lodhi Crematorium in South Delhi.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{prominent}} in the ocean waters surrounding Hilton Head Island, the stingray serves as a fascination and painful natural encounter for many beach goers. Small stingrays inhabit the quieter, shallow region of ocean floor just beyond the break of the surf, typically buried beneath {{a thin layer of}} sand. Stingrays are a type of demersal, cartilaginous fish common to the South Carolina coast as well as other areas on the Atlantic shoreline. Typically, stingrays avoid contact with humans unless they are accidentally stepped upon, a situation often ending in a stingray injury, where the stingray punctures the human with its poisonous barb. While <b>these</b> <b>injuries</b> are extremely painful, they are not usually life-threatening {{as long as they are}} properly attended to by a medical professional. One complaint shared by many Hilton Head Island tourists is that the lifeguards maintain a poor alert system for notifying swimmers when numerous stingrays have been sighted within a specific stretch of the shore. This lack of notification on days when multiple sightings are reported can sometimes end in a high number of stingray injuries that might have otherwise been avoided; in 2009, 121 people were treated for stingray injuries.|$|E

5|$|The next season, Ottawa {{would be}} {{challenged}} {{to repeat the}} success they had in 2011–12, due to long-term injuries to key players such as Erik Karlsson, Jason Spezza, Milan Michalek and Craig Anderson. Despite <b>these</b> <b>injuries,</b> the Senators would finish seventh in the Eastern Conference and head coach Paul MacLean {{would go on to}} win the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's coach of the year. Ottawa would play the second-seeded Montreal Canadiens {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, eventually winning in five games, blowing out Montreal 6–1 in games three and five. The Senators would advance to play the top-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round, this time losing in five games. During the off-season, the Senators traded veteran defenceman Sergei Gonchar to the Dallas Stars in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick in 2013. July 5, 2013 would be a day of mixed emotions for the city and fans, as long-time captain Daniel Alfredsson signed a one-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings, leaving Ottawa after 17 seasons with the Senators and 14 as captain. The signing shocked numerous fans across the city and many within the Senators organization. The day finished optimistically however, as Murray acquired star forward Bobby Ryan from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for forwards Jakob Silfverberg, Stefan Noesen and a first-round draft pick in 2014. Murray would also sign free agent forward Clarke MacArthur to a two-year contract that same day and would sign free agent defenceman Joe Corvo to a one-year contract three days later on July 8.|$|E

40|$|Ischaemia-reperfusion {{and toxic}} injury are {{leading causes of}} acute renal failure (ARF). Both of <b>these</b> <b>injury</b> {{initiators}} use secondary mediators of damage in oxygen-derived free radicals. Several recent publications about ischaemia-reperfusion and toxin-induced ARF have indicated that plasma membrane structures called caveolae, and their proteins, the caveolins, are potential participants in protecting or repairing renal tissues. Caveolae and caveolins have previously been ascribed many functions, a number of which may mediate cell death or survival of injured renal cells. This review proposes possible pathophysiological mechanisms by which altered caveolin- 1 expression and localization may affect renal cell survival following oxidative stress...|$|R
