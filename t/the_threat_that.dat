5|$|For {{the second}} Test, Bradman {{returned}} to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract. England continued to use bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings. In the second innings, against the full Bodyline attack, he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. Critics began to believe bodyline was not quite <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> had been perceived and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. However, the pitch was slightly slower than others in the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|In 1451, {{the very}} {{powerful}} Bosnian regional lord Herzeg Stjepan Vukčić Kosača attacked Dubrovnik, and laid siege to the city. He had earlier been made a Ragusan nobleman and, consequently, the Ragusan government now proclaimed him a traitor. A reward of 15,000 ducats, a palace in Dubrovnik worth 2,000 ducats, {{and an annual}} income of 300 ducats was offered to anyone who would kill him, along {{with the promise of}} hereditary Ragusan nobility which also helped hold this promise to whoever did the deed. Stjepan was so scared by <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> he finally raised the siege.|$|E

As Rivoli neared completion, HMS Victorious was dispatched from the Mediterranean Fleet to intercept her should she leave port. Victorious was commanded by John Talbot, a successful and popular officer who had distinguished himself with the capture of the French frigate Ville de Milan in 1805 and his service in the Dardanelles Operation of 1807. Talbot was accompanied by the 18-gun brig HMS Weazel under Commander John William Andrew.|$|E
5|$|The native Mesolithic {{populations were}} slow in {{gradually}} assimilating the agricultural way of life, beginning {{with just the}} use of ceramics. It took a thousand years into the Neolithic period before they adopted animal husbandry (which became especially important to them) and plant cultivation to any appreciable degree. When they eventually developed interest in the more fertile areas utilized by the late Danubian cultures, they became <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> compelled the Danubian farmers to fortify their settlements. The native post-Mesolithic groups expanded beyond the traditional Danubian areas of agricultural development, moving also into ecologically less favorable environments, which included utilization of sandy soils.|$|E
5|$|At 16:45, Tung {{was forced}} at gunpoint {{to talk to}} Diệm on the phone, telling the {{president}} that he had ordered his special forces to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy for Tung, because the special forces' commander had disguised his men in regular army uniforms and framed the generals for the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids in August. The generals {{were well aware of}} <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces. At nightfall, Nhung took Tung, and his brother and deputy, Major Lê Quang Triệu, with their hands tied, to a jeep and drove them {{to the edge of the}} air base.

5|$|Possible {{motivations for}} this {{complete}} rebuilding by Al-Adil include the damage the old citadel may have sustained from earthquakes in 1200 and 1201 and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> other Ayyubid princes continued to pose toward Al-Adil. The most likely motivation {{is that the}} defences of the old citadel became obsolete due to the introduction in the 12th century of the counterweight trebuchet, a siege engine easily capable of reducing thick stone walls to rubble. The new citadel introduced {{a number of important}} changes to the defensive system, including higher and thicker walls, a wide moat surrounding the citadel, and numerous closely spaced, high, massive towers. Unlike the older towers, these were square rather than round in design. The towers contained platforms on which trebuchets could be placed. Due to their high position, these trebuchets could outrange enemy artillery and thereby prevent them from breaching the walls.|$|E
5|$|The Seventeenth Amendment, {{ratified}} in 1913, {{gave the}} people the right to elect senators, but this made little difference in South Carolina, where the Democratic primary remained decisive. Tillman in 1914 announced plans to retire when his term expired in 1919, but the war and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> Blease would win the open seat caused him to announce his candidacy for a fifth term in March 1918. Tillman remained {{for the most part}} in Washington, and did not campaign, but came to Columbia for the state Democratic convention in May to discredit rumors about his health, which was indeed poor. He got Wilson to persuade one of his rivals, Congressman Asbury F. Lever, to abandon the race, and considered how to do the same to Blease. These plans had not yet come to fruition when Tillman was stricken by a cerebral hemorrhage at the end of June, and died July 3, 1918 in Washington, D.C. He is buried in Ebenezer Cemetery, Trenton, South Carolina.|$|E

They installed the commemorative plaque on the wall which was unveiled on 9 June 1893. By 1908 the campaign, chaired by the Earl of Lytton, had gained public support including that of archbichops of Canterbury and York, and raised the funds needed to purchase the property.|$|E

5|$|The next day, on Christmas, Aya and her partner, Daniel, {{go to see}} a {{scientist}} at the Museum of Natural History named Dr. Klamp. He teaches the protagonists about mitochondria, {{but they do not}} find his information useful since it does not explain the previous night's events. Later that day, they hear that Eve is in Central Park, and to make matters worse, an audience has gathered at the park's theater intending to see a performance that Melissa Pearce was to give. Aya enters Central Park alone as Daniel is unable to pass through the entrance without spontaneously combusting. She makes it to the theater, but is too late to stop Eve, who causes the theater audience's mitochondria to rebel against their hosts and turns the crowd into a slimy orange mass. Aya chases after Eve and is knocked unconscious after a fight with her aboard a horse-drawn carriage. Daniel discovers that his son, Ben, was at the park, but had left the audience at the Central Park theater when he began to feel ill and when his mother began to act strange. He also learns that Manhattan is being evacuated due to <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> Eve poses.|$|E
5|$|The pope {{referred}} {{the dispute}} to a council of English prelates, which met at Windsor during Whitsuntide in 1072. The council {{decided that the}} Archbishop of Canterbury was the superior of the Archbishop of York and further ruled that York had no rights south of the Humber River. This meant that the disputed bishoprics {{were taken from the}} province of York, an outcome that probably had the support of the King, who aimed to prevent the separation of the north from the rest of England. By depriving the Archbishop of suffragans, William limited York's power and separatist tendencies. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter commented that by requiring Thomas to obey Canterbury, the King removed <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> Thomas might crown someone else as King of England– such as the Danish king. However, the council of Windsor also ruled that York's province included Scotland. Although Thomas was required to profess obedience to Lanfranc and Lanfranc's successors, the obedience did not mention nor was held to acknowledge any primacy of Canterbury, and it did not bind Thomas' successors.|$|E
5|$|This changed dramatically, however, {{following}} {{the entry of}} Japan into the war on 8 December 1941, with the attack on Pearl Harbor and on the British forces in Malaya.

In April 1942, the threat of invasion of Australia seemed very real {{following the}} loss of Malaya and Singapore and the subsequent Japanese landings in New Guinea. Seeing <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese posed to Australia, the government had begun to bring AIF units back from the Middle East but the bulk of the forces immediately available for the defence of Australia came from the militia, which was at that stage an organisation of some 265,000 men organised into five infantry and two cavalry divisions.|$|E

The English bowlers used Bodyline intermittently in the first match, to the crowd's vocal displeasure. Behind the scenes, administrators began to express concerns to each other. Yet the English tactics still did not earn universal disapproval; former Australian captain Monty Noble praised the English bowling. For the second Test, Bradman returned to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract. England continued to use Bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings. In the second innings, against the full Bodyline attack, he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. Critics began to believe Bodyline was not quite <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> had been perceived and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored.

5|$|Despite heavy {{casualties}} {{during the}} initial attack, the Germans were able to land reinforcements and {{the situation on the}} island quickly deteriorated for the Allies. The brigade had abandoned its initial positions and moved to a new location to the west of Galatas to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>that</b> it would become separated from the 5th Infantry Brigade. On 25 May, the 18th Battalion had to deal with a full-scale attack by Fallschirmjäger. This caused heavy casualties and a large portion of one of the battalion's companies was captured. Despite reinforcements arriving from the 20th Battalion and the best efforts of Gray in rounding up stragglers, the Galatas position was breached and the township captured. Some battalion personnel, led by Gray, along with the bulk of the 23rd Battalion, participated in an attack that briefly re-took the township but it later had to be abandoned again after further fighting. The battalion was then withdrawn to the east as the order to evacuate Crete was received, making its way towards Suda Bay, where Allied ships were taking troops off the beaches. Along the way, they were subjected to heavy air raids, one of which killed a company commander, Captain Jack Lyon, the Member of Parliament for the Waitemata electorate.|$|E
