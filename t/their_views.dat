5|$|The {{description}} of feathered dinosaurs {{has not been}} without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that some purported feather-like fossils {{are the result of}} the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin, and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but convergent with dinosaurs. However, <b>their</b> <b>views</b> have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, {{to the point that the}} scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} told CanWest News Service that {{he hoped}} the documentary would provoke a wider discussion about freedom of speech, sexual slang and its media use.

5|$|The {{second part}} of the strategy, {{contrasting}} Aberhart's proposals with Douglas's, failed largely because both men were too evasive in their statements to make any kind of direct comparison of <b>their</b> <b>views.</b> Lakeland College historian Franklin Foster offers an additional explanation: when Albertans were exposed to the charismatic evangelist Aberhart and the dry technocrat Douglas, they preferred the former, irrespective of credentials or economic expertise.|$|E
5|$|The war of 1918 led to {{disintegration}} within both socialist and the non-socialist factions.

5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold <b>their</b> <b>views.</b> He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{of science}} differ in <b>their</b> <b>views</b> of the {{significance}} of the scientific accomplishments in the medieval Islamic world. The traditionalist view, exemplified by Bertrand Russell, holds that Islamic science, while admirable in many technical ways, lacked the intellectual energy required for innovation and was chiefly important for preserving ancient knowledge, and handing it on to medieval Europe. The revisionist view, exemplified by Abdus Salam, George Saliba and John M. Hobson holds that a Muslim scientific revolution occurred during the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Donald Routledge Hill and Ahmad Y Hassan argue that Islam was the driving force behind these scientific achievements.|$|E

5|$|Implementation of the Bland–Allison Act {{did not end}} {{calls for}} free silver. The 1880s saw a steep decline in the prices of grain and other {{agricultural}} commodities. Silver advocates argued that this dropoff, which caused the price of grain to fall below its cost of production, {{was caused by the}} failure of the government to adequately increase the money supply, which had remained steady on a per capita basis. Advocates of the gold standard attributed the decline to advances in production and transportation. The late 19th century saw divergent views in economics as the laissez-faire orthodoxy was questioned by younger economists, and both sides found ample support for <b>their</b> <b>views</b> from theorists.|$|E
5|$|In 1886 {{a colonel}} renowned {{for lack of}} {{discipline}} published newspaper articles criticizing the Minister of War, an act of insubordination forbidden by law. Instead of being punished, the colonel was supported by his commander, Field Marshal (nowadays Divisional General) Deodoro da Fonseca. The minister, {{as well as the}} conservative cabinet headed by João Maurício Wanderley, decided not to penalize the colonel in an attempt to quiet dissention. However, the cabinet went further and removed any constraint on military officers broadcasting <b>their</b> <b>views.</b> In consequence of this policy, subordinates were thenceforth able to publicly criticize their superiors, thus undermining both military and political authority, including that of the cabinet itself.|$|E
