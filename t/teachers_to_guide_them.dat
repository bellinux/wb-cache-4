40|$|Problem Statement: Education {{of gifted}} has {{attracted}} attention {{for a few}} decades. Components of gifted education environments like identification, differentiation of teaching processes, social-emotional characteristics of gifted students and educating teachers of gifted students etc. have been studied in different studies. Gifted students have different learning needs apart from their pers. So teachers of gifted students should master on characteristics of gifted students and learning needs of them. Gifted students have intrinsic interest and motivation toward science and these students need their <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>them</b> effectively. So their teachers should have positive viewpoint and attitudes about science. Purpose of the Study: The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the pre-service gifted education teachers ’ self-efficacy toward science teaching and scientific attitudes based on different variables (gender, grade level, etc.) and to assert the relationship between self-efficacy and scientific attitude. Method: The general model of the research was a quantitative study, and ninety undergraduate students in the Gifted Education program were voluntarily participated in this study. The data were collected by the use of Scientific Attitude Inventory and the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument. The researcher used an unpaired t-test, analysis of variance and a correlation method to analyze the data.

40|$|M. Ed. Education is South Africa is {{characterized}} by ineffective teaching practices that prevent the pupils from learning in a meaningful and reasonably satisfying way [...] Ostensive methods of teaching that prevent pupil participation are emphasized while heuristic methods are disregarded, and in the process, concept teaching is neglected. To solve this problem, the following aims have been generated: 1. 3. 1 Training senior primary school teachers {{in the teaching of}} concepts to increase pupil learning This could be a more effective and relevant strategy which could be applied to curb the ostensive methods of teaching used by most teachers as indicated already in par. 1. 2 above, as well as poor classroom organization. As Bruner (1967) avers, concept teaching offers the following benefits: "The pupils are equiped with thinking skills which are helpful in the process of discriminating, classifying and categorizing. The ability to categorize data helps the learner in problem-solving and reduces the necessity to re-learn what was previously learned. This refers to all the situations, events and symbols which have the same set of general characteristics. " 1. 3. 2 Provision of in-service training opportunities to limit incompetent teaching This would help to remedy the ills and frustrations brought about the fact that poorly qualified teachers have been given the opportunity to provide tuition to the pupils who defintely need only the best <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>them</b> towards what they ought to be. Because {{it is not possible to}} get rid of all the poorly qualified teachers, what could be done is what Bester (1988 : 5) suggests: " [...] . hef die bestaande onderwysers se vlakke van vaardigheid en bevoegdheid op. " An intensive in-service training programme is therefore, suggested as a collaborative effort to improve educational effectiveness. The most urgent of needs identified is the training of teachers in the concept approach to teaching, as indicated in par. 1. 3. 1. In the process of upgrading the teachers' classroom skills, the pupils' potential to learn effectively have a chance of increasing. Teaching is a multi-faceted process that also involves the pupil. For the pupil to be able to learn effectively, he must be actively involved in the teaching-learning process. As Astin, Green and Korn (1987 : 15) maintain: "The student has a role to play in the process, too: There must be a commitment and involvement on his or her part for effective learning to happen. " The aim of this investigation is not only to provide the teachers with demonstrations and lectures that emphasize theories of how to teach but to focus on the teacher as a unique individual with needs that have to be addressed, someone with strengths as well as weaknesses (Main, 1985; 15). In the process of developing classroom teaching techniques and promoting personal development, the ideal would be to encourage peer coaching so as to overcome teacher isolation. Peer coaching, according to Munro and Elliott (1987 : 25 - 28), is a method of improving teacher effectiveness, in which teachers work with one or more colleagues to achieve specific instructional goals and key skills, through a process of regular observation and feedback and by using specific materials to support them. Teachers would, therefore, be brought together as fellow participants in a context in which each of them needs to learn about teaching. They meet as teachers and at the same time as 'teachers-as-learners'. 1. 3. 3 The use of micro-teaching for training purposes In using " [...] . specific materials to support them [...] . " as indicated by Munro and Elliott (1987) the specific material applicable in this investigation is the micro-teaching technique used as a training modality in training the teachers in concept teaching. In so doing, an attempt is being made to come to terms with the root problem linked to teacher inadequacy...|$|E
40|$|In {{a nation}} in which our schools are {{increasingly}} populated with children from diverse ethnic, religious, and socio-economic backgrounds, we know little about the multicultural knowledge and practices of the predominantly White, European-American, middle-class female teachers who teach them. This descriptive, naturalistic study in a graduate college classroom investigated the multicultural frameworks and stances of five White, European-American middle-class women and one White, European-American middle-class man as they studied in a graduate course in multicultural children 2 ̆ 7 s literature taught from a critical perspective. The White, European-American middle-class teacher educator 2 ̆ 7 s experience was also documented. Over six months, data, field notes, student writing, transcribed interviews, and anonymous course evaluations, were gathered and analyzed according to the methods of portraiture and grounded theory. Students exhibited {{a wide range of}} responses to taking a critical approach to multicultural children 2 ̆ 7 s literature that spanned from resistance to acceptance. A grounded theory of multicultural journeying was developed based on the three milestones of initial understanding, dissonance, and evolved understanding that emerged from the conceptual categories of the study. Six developmental constructs of multicultural teacher wayfarers were identified, including: novice-in-stasis, novice-in-movement, apprentice-in-stasis, apprentice-in-movement, expert-in-stasis, and expert-in-movement. It was determined that in order for <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> adopt a multicultural philosophy, they required: (1) access to multicultural picture books and peritextual resources; (2) a discourse community in which they felt secure co-constructing knowledge and taking risks; (3) reflection/action based assignments which enabled them to contemplate their beliefs and act upon their developing understandings; and (4) an engaged <b>teacher</b> educator <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>them.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{teaching}} of English {{as a foreign}} language in Indonesia is emphasized on the {{teaching of}} reading comprehension. This skill {{is considered to be}} very important especially for students who will continue their study to the higher education. The 1994 English curriculum states that the main objective of teaching English at senior high school is to enable the students to comprehend the English reading passages well to prepare them for their further study since most references and textbooks used at higher education are usually written in English. The teaching of English in senior high school comprises the four language skills namely speaking, listening, writing and reading with reading as the main emphasis. However, the writer found out that many senior high school students still have difficulties to comprehend the reading passages given because their <b>teachers</b> failed <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> relate the passage with their background knowledge. In this study the writer observes several teachers’ teaching strategies in reading and analyses the result using Zhenyu’s criteria in teaching strategies. The result of this observational study can be concluded that most teachers used teaching strategies, which are similar to Zhenyu’s strategies. However, they should also make the strategies used appropriate wit the classroom condition, the topic of the reading passage discussed and the available time given. Besides that, the use of another material could be very important in supporting the students to comprehend the reading passages better and increase their knowledge and information. Finally, she hopes {{that there would be a}} future research using experimental studies to show explicitly whether Zhenyu’s teaching strategies can really develop students’ reading comprehension achievement...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} students’ and instructors’ perceptions regarding the effectiveness of implementing active learning strategies in higher education courses conducted at a tertiary institution in Lebanon. Design/methodology/approach – Pre-service education students completed a questionnaire, professors were interviewed, and class sessions were observed. Findings – Main findings indicate that the majority of the learners as well as the instructors favoured active learning and are strong proponents of putting into effect this approach in all their courses. These findings indicate the positive perceptions towards active learning strategies and the possible impact that these perceptions have on students’ performance and learning. Research limitations/implications – Three major limitations have influenced the efficiency of this study. The number of participants is rather small. Only 37 education students were involved in this study. Furthermore, an additional limitation is that all the participants were females. Yet, it is worth noting that the majority of the students, who are majoring in education at that particular university, are females. Finally, it is worth mentioning that one of the researchers conducted the non-participant observations which might have influenced the data in one way or another. Practical implications – Implications from the results of the study are far reaching. A major implication is for the programmes to reconsider the organization of the classrooms to have rooms that allows for cooperative and group work. Also, classroom organization should be student centred with the teacher’s place not necessarily at the front of the room but possibly at different places in the room or even sitting with the student for some of the assignments. A second implication is that the classroom is to be viewed as a learning situation where the teacher is a guide, a facilitator in the teaching/learning context which would be blended with the lecture method when needed. A further implication is that teacher professional development is a priority for the agenda of educational institutions to help promote teaching effectiveness of this clearly important active learning. After all, the students are doing the learning and the <b>teachers</b> need <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>them</b> in this process. Originality/value – The main value of this paper is to encourage university faculty members to change their teaching methods in order to engage and motivate learners. PublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 141 p. This dissertation examined contexts of education that are perceived to influence effective teaching practices. The No Child Left Behind legislation, with accountability as a major piece and the lack of funding for public schools, necessitates that all districts and schools improve student achievement using funding more efficiently. This can be accomplished by providing the best educational contexts <b>to</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> increase effectiveness of teaching which results in improved student achievement. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify those educational contexts that result in teacher effectiveness and provide for a more efficient use of funds. Participants of this study have been highly recognized for their effectiveness. A mixed-method research design was employed beginning with phenomenological data from each participant through one-on-one interviews. An outline of categorical educational contexts was constructed and presented to interviewees. Research questions addressed each category and individual perceptions were recorded. Participants were also presented with an open-ended research question regarding any other contexts that were not mentioned that increased their effectiveness. Tables were constructed and an analysis was completed on all constructed categorical educational contexts, including other contexts that emerged from the interviews. A binomial and principal component analysis was conducted on all as well, to narrow the field of contexts. The results presented contexts as additional training before entering the classroom and additional degrees after the start of teaching to be important. Perceptions on professional development concluded that adults maintain different learning styles; therefore, a wide variety of trainings are necessary. In addition, when content is relevant, professional development is more likely <b>to</b> promote <b>teacher</b> effectiveness. Results included the perception that all new <b>teachers</b> need someone <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>them</b> as they begin their careers. Most importantly it was found that the support of the building administrator greatly impacts the development of teacher effectiveness. It is therefore recommended that the contexts of education perceived to influence effective teaching practices include trainings that are more applicable in the classroom, relevant staff development and addressing the importance of the role of the administrator in developing effective teachers...|$|R
