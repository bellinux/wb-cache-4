5|$|Once a {{proclamation}} {{had been}} issued ordering the Army Reserve {{to be called}} out for permanent service, the Crown was legally permitted to order the Army Council to issue directions to embody {{all or part of}} the Territorial Force. If no such order was forthcoming, however, then unless Parliament directed otherwise the Army Council was <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> direction for the embodiment of the entire Force. If Parliament was not sitting at the time of the proclamation, it was to resume its session within ten days. The Crown was able <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> proclamation disembodying the whole Force, and until such proclamation was issued the Army Council was permitted to embody or disembody such elements of the Force as they saw fit.|$|E

5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, was {{convinced}} that the company had been treated wrongly and insisted in bringing it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E
5|$|A keen geographer, Towner {{would often}} {{disappear}} into the bush for weeks on end, for study or exploration. As {{a fellow of the}} Royal Geographical Society of Australia and member of the Royal Historical Society of New South Wales, he took a particular interest in researching the life of the explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell. In 1946, he successfully lobbied the Australian Government <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> postage stamp commemorating the centenary of Mitchell's discoveries in central Queensland. He addressed the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in Brisbane in 1955, and was awarded the Dr Thomson Foundation Gold Medal for his geographical work the following year. Towner's address was published in 1957, in a booklet entitled Lake Eyre and its Tributaries.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance was observed on November19 about 800km (500mi) southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. The disturbance tracked westward, gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November22. After passing south of Sri Lanka, it became disorganized and {{was no longer}} considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone. The circulation associated with the system continued westward, reorganizing on November26 in the Arabian Sea. Despite being located unusually close to the equator, the disturbance maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and diffluence aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing.|$|E

5|$|Before Tropical Storm Danielle {{moved through}} the Lesser Antilles, a small-craft {{advisory}} was issued, and later, gale warnings were posted for Barbados as well as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On Saint Vincent, {{the threat of the}} storm forced the closure of the main commercial airport, as well as schools, businesses, and stores. Further west, Danielle briefly posed a threat to Jamaica, prompting officials in that country <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm watch. Two months earlier, the precursor to Tropical Storm Andrew killed 49people on the island; to avoid a recurrence, the Jamaican government worked to evacuate fishermen from two small islands as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the last}} male {{member of the}} House of Árpád, Andrew was elected king {{after the death of}} King Ladislaus IV in 1290. He was the first Hungarian monarch <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> {{coronation}} diploma confirming the privileges of the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretenders—Albert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer—challenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule.|$|E
5|$|By February17, 80percent of {{the grid}} was restored; however, only 10percent homes were {{actually}} connected. The presence of dead vegetation {{left behind by the}} storm created fire hazards across the island, prompting the government <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> ban on burning. The Seventh Day Adventist church primary school resumed classes on February15 despite losing a building. All other schools suspended activities until February22; however, the approach of Tropical Depression 11F delayed this until the following day. On February23, the European Union provided US$110,000 in emergency funds to the Cook Islands. Habitat for Humanity later sought to assist in the rebuilding process in April, with a funding goal of NZ$300,000 (US$210,000).|$|E

5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar and bolts inserted around his spine. According to Brown, these injuries {{made it impossible to}} for him to assault V. N. as described in the police report. The Naha court panel of three judges agreed <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> decision as to whether the evidence was submissable at a later date.|$|E
5|$|Few crashes {{have been}} {{attributed}} to design flaws of the 747. The Tenerife airport disaster resulted from pilot error and communications failure, while the Japan Airlines Flight 123 and China Airlines Flight 611 crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair. United Airlines Flight 811, which suffered an explosive decompression mid-flight on February 24, 1989, led the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) <b>to</b> <b>issue</b> <b>a</b> recommendation that 747-200 cargo doors similar to those on the Flight 811 aircraft be modified. Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had strayed into Soviet territory, causing U.S. President Ronald Reagan to authorize the then-strictly military global positioning system (GPS) for civilian use.|$|E
