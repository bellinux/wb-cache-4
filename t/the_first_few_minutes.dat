40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of optical emission detected during <b>the</b> critical <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> after <b>the</b> onset of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) defines two broad classes: prompt optical emission correlated with prompt gamma-ray emission, and early optical afterglow emission uncorrelated with the gamma-ray emission. The standard theoretical interpretation attributes prompt emission to internal shocks in the ultra-relativistic outflow {{generated by the}} internal engine; early afterglow emission is attributed to shocks generated by interaction with the surrounding medium. Here we report on observations of a bright GRB that, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, clearly show the temporal relationship and relative strength of the two optical components. The observations indicate that early afterglow emission {{can be understood as}} reverberation of the energy input measured by prompt emission. Measurements of the early afterglow reverberations therefore probe the structure of the environment around the burst, whereas the subsequent response to late-time impulsive energy releases reveals how earlier flaring episodes have altered the jet and environment parameters. Many GRBs are generated by the death of massive stars that were born and died before the Universe was ten per cent of its current age, so GRB afterglow reverberations provide clues about the environments around some of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> stars.

40|$|The {{antiwear}} and antioxidant additives, zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZDDPs), are {{an essential}} ingredient in engine oil formulations, {{and have been}} in use for many years. These additives function by forming antiwear films on surfaces in sliding contact, and thus reduce friction and wear. Among the surface techniques employed, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (including EXAFS and XANES) has been mainly used because of its high resolution, low detection limit and non-destructive characteristics.;This is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time that P and S L-edge XANES spectroscopy {{has been used to}} analyze antiwear films and thermal films. About two hundred antiwear films and thermally prepared films have been measured by XANES spectroscopy. It has been found that longer rubbing time, higher concentration of ZDDP, moderate temperature and higher load help to form long chain phosphates. Sulphur species in most of the cases is sulphide. The presence of sulphate in very short rubbing time or high temperature films is likely from sulphur in base oil.;The chemical composition of additives also affects their behaviour. Secondary ZDDP tends to form long chain polyphosphate while primary ZDDP and aryl ZDDP, in most of the cases, form short chain polyphosphate. The chemical state of sulphur in the same film resembles ZnS or alkyl sulphide. It seems that Zn acts as an antioxidant for sulphur and also catalyses the polymerization of phosphates. These properties are more significant for secondary ZDDP than for primary ZDDP. The presence of detergents and dispersant reduce the amount of unreacted ZDDP on the rubbing surface. The addition of the detergent and dispersant may change the polymerization of phosphate in the antiwear films. The S signals are much weaker than P signals and sulphur is in the reduced sulphide form.;Depth profiling results from XPS showed that the antiwear film formed in 30 minutes is shorter than that formed in 12 hours. The measurements of wear scar widths are general consistent with the XANES study and the results of other researchers. It seems that after film formation in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> a <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> further rubbing doesn 2 ̆ 7 t increase wear significantly...|$|R

Eight McA (44 ± 4 yr) and {{a control group}} of six mitochondrial myopathy patients (51 ± 6 yr) performed two repetitions (CWR 1 and CWR 2) of 6 -min constant work rate exercise (∼ 50 % of peak work rate) separated by 6 -min (SHORT) or 18 -min (LONG) recovery. Pulmonary O 2 uptake (VO 2), HR, cardiac output, rates of perceived exertion, vastus lateralis oxygenation {changes in deoxygenated Hb and myoglobin Mb concentrations, A[deoxy(Hb+Mb) ], by near-infrared spectroscopy} were determined. In McA, VO 2 (0. 86 ± 0. 2 vs. 0. 95 ± 0. 1 l/min), HR (113 ± 10 vs. 150 ± 13 beats/min), cardiac output (11. 6 ± 0. 6 vs. 15. 0 ± 0. 8 l/min), and rates of perceived exertion (11 ± 2 vs. 14 ± 3) were lower, whereas A[deoxy(Hb+Mb) ] was higher (14. 7 ± 2. 3 vs. - 0. 1 ± 4. 6 %) in CWR 2 -SHORT vs. CWR 1; the "overshoot" of A[deoxy(Hb+Mb) ] and the "slow component" of VO 2 kinetics disappeared in CWR 2 -SHORT.

40|$|We {{model the}} time-variable {{absorption}} of Fe[*]ii, Fe[*]iii, Si[*]ii, C[*]ii and Cr[*]ii detected in Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) spectra of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 080310, with the afterglow radiation exciting and ionizing {{the interstellar medium}} in the host galaxy at a redshift of z = 2. 42743. To estimate the rest-frame afterglow brightness {{as a function of}} time, we use a combination of the optical VRI photometry obtained by the RAPTOR-T telescope array, which is presented in this paper, and Swift’s X-Ray Telescope (XRT) observations. Excitation alone, which has been successfully applied for a handful of other GRBs, fails to describe the observed column density evolution in the case of GRB[*] 080310. Inclusion of ionization is required to explain the column density decrease of all observed Fe[*]ii levels (including the ground state 6 D 9 / 2) and increase of the Fe[*]iii 7 S 3 level. The large population of ions in this latter level (up to 10 % of all Fe[*]iii) can only be explained through ionization of Fe[*]ii, as a large fraction of the ionized Fe[*]ii ions (we calculate 31 % using the Flexible Atomic and Cowan codes) initially populate the 7 S 3 level of Fe[*]iii rather than the ground state. This channel for producing a significant Fe[*]iii 7 S 3 level population may be relevant for other objects in which absorption lines from this level, the UV 34 triplet, are observed, such as broad absorption line (BAL) quasars and η Carinae. This provides conclusive evidence for time-variable ionization in the circumburst medium, which to date has not been convincingly detected. However, the best-fit distance of the neutral absorbing cloud to the GRB is 200 - 400 pc, i. e. similar to GRB-absorber distance estimates for GRBs without any evidence for ionization. We find that the presence of time-varying ionization in GRB[*] 080310 is likely due to a combination of the super-solar iron abundance ([Fe/H] = + 0. 2) and the low H[*]i column density (log N(H[*]i) = 18. 7) in the host of GRB[*] 080310. Finally, the modelling provides indications for the presence of an additional cloud at 10 - 50 pc from the GRB with log N(H[*]i) ~ 19 - 20 before the burst, which became fully ionized by the radiation released during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> tens of <b>minutes</b> after the GRB...|$|R

40|$|A module that dissolves {{oxygen in}} water at {{concentrations}} approaching saturation, without generating bubbles of oxygen gas, {{has been developed}} as a prototype of improved oxygenators for water-disinfection and water-purification systems that utilize photocatalyzed redox reactions. Depending on the specific nature of a water-treatment system, it is desirable to prevent the formation of bubbles for one or more reasons: (1) Bubbles can remove some organic contaminants from the liquid phase to the gas phase, thereby introducing a gas-treatment problem that complicates the overall water-treatment problem; and/or (2) in some systems (e. g., those that must function in microgravity or in any orientation in normal Earth gravity), bubbles can interfere with {{the flow of the}} liquid phase. The present oxygenation module (see Figure 1) is a modified version of a commercial module that contains > 100 hollow polypropylene fibers with a nominal pore size of 0. 05 m and a total surface area of 0. 5 m 2. The module was originally designed for oxygenation in a bioreactor, with no water flowing around or inside the tubes. The modification, made to enable the use of the module to oxygenate flowing water, consisted mainly in the encapsulation of the fibers in a tube of Tygon polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with an inside diameter of 1 in. (approx. = 25 mm). In operation, water is pumped along the insides of the hollow fibers and oxygen gas is supplied to the space outside the hollow tubes inside the PVC tube. In tests, the pressure drops of water and oxygen in the module were found to be close to zero at water-flow rates ranging up to 320 mL/min and oxygen-flow rates up to 27 mL/min. Under all test conditions, no bubbles were observed at the water outlet. In some tests, flow rates were chosen to obtain dissolved-oxygen concentrations between 25 and 31 parts per million (ppm). approaching the saturation level of approx. = 35 ppm at a temperature of 20 C and pressure of 1 atm (approx. = 0. 1 MPa). As one would expect, it was observed that the time needed to bring a flow of water from an initial low dissolved-oxygen concentration (e. g., 5 ppm) to a steady high dissolved-oxygen concentration at or near the saturation level depends on the rates of flow of both oxygen and water, among other things. Figure 2 shows the results of an experiment in which a greater flow of oxygen was used during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> tens of <b>minutes</b> to bring the concentration up to approx. = 25 ppm, then a lesser flow was used to maintain the concentration...|$|R
