25|$|Cary Grant said of Stewart's acting technique:He had {{the ability}} to talk naturally.

25|$|In February, Natural Disasters' manager Jimmy Hart led Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase & Irwin R. Schyster) to the WWF tag team titles as they {{defeated}} the Legion of Doom {{after which the}} L.O.D. briefly left the WWF. The Natural Disasters were outraged that their manager would go behind their backs and get another team {{a shot at the}} title, the storyline explanation was <b>that</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Hart used the Disasters' guaranteed return match for Money Inc. When the Natural Disasters challenged Money Inc. they won the fan support as they fired manager Jimmy Hart. The Disasters would first get their hands on Money Inc. at WrestleMania VIII where once again the Natural Disasters would win the match but not the titles as the champions were counted out. The Disasters did not let the setback stop them as they challenged for the titles repeatedly until they won them on July 20, 1992.|$|E

60|$|Jimmy {{said he had}} none, {{and five}} minutes later Anthea {{appeared}}. She stood near the door looking at the men, and saw <b>that</b> <b>Jimmy's</b> face was darkly flushed.

25|$|After Petree's team {{began to}} run into {{financial}} problems, Nemechek's team was left without a sponsor and he left for Haas-Carter Motorsports {{to take over the}} No. 26 Kmart-sponsored Ford Taurus <b>that</b> <b>Jimmy</b> Spencer had left to drive for Chip Ganassi Racing. However, Nemechek went from one financial problem to another as Kmart filed for bankruptcy early in the 2002 season and stopped sponsoring the Haas-Carter team. This forced Haas-Carter to scale back its operations to one team and Nemechek was released in favor of keeping Todd Bodine, who was driving the team's other car, in the fold. Nemechek found an opportunity almost immediately as Johnny Benson, who was the driver of the No. 10 Valvoline Pontiac for MBV Motorsports, was injured in a crash and required a substitute. After driving several races in the No. 10 Nemechek was hired by Hendrick Motorsports to replace Jerry Nadeau in the No. 25 UAW/Delphi-sponsored Chevrolet. Nemechek drove the remainder of the season for Hendrick and performed well enough to earn a full-time ride the next season.|$|E
25|$|Tensely, {{people watch}} for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, {{if not for the}} {{pleasure}} of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign <b>that</b> <b>Jimmy</b> is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E
25|$|Eager {{to expand}} his control, Jimmy turns his {{attention}} to the Preppies, the clique that consists of rich students. Just as he begins to win them over, Gary tricks them into turning against him. In response, Jimmy signs up for a boxing tournament hosted by the Preppies' leader, Derby Harrington (John Lavelle). Though he wins, the Preppies refuse to accept defeat and gang up on him, resulting in a massive fight that ends with Jimmy declaring himself the new leader. With the Preppies subdued, Jimmy then sets out to conquer their rivals, the Greasers. Johnny Vincent (Rocco Rosanio), their leader, asks Jimmy to help him expose an affair between his girlfriend Lola Lombardi (Phoebe Strole), and Gord Vendome (Andrew Gehling), a member of the Preppies. The Preppies, angered by Jimmy's betrayal, abandon him, but he gradually wins back their trust. Gary manages to convince Johnny <b>that</b> <b>Jimmy</b> wants Lola, so he sets an ambush for him in a scrapyard. With Petey's help, Johnny is defeated and the Greasers recognize Jimmy as their superior. During this, Jimmy helps out a homeless man who pretend to be Santa Claus.|$|E
50|$|Jimmy P Brown II {{has made}} several {{references}} to Queensrÿche {{throughout his career}} in Deliverance, {{not the least of}} which is the band name itself, taken from the title to track 3 on Queensrÿche's 1984 album, The Warning. Jimmy has never been bashful about honoring other musicians who have influenced him greatly. Along with his true musical heroes, David Bowie and Terry Scott Taylor, there is no question <b>that</b> <b>Jimmy's</b> greatest band influence will always be Queensrÿche.|$|R

25|$|John Henry Irons tests Jimmy's powers using metahuman biofeedback, but {{the display}} generates {{complicated}} {{images of the}} Source Wall and alternate Earths. On his way home, Jimmy meets two members of Cadmus, who offer their assistance, take him back to their HQ, and run tests on him. Jimmy's powers go haywire, and he runs off to keep himself from hurting anyone. He encounters the Newsboy Legion, who offer him shelter. Jimmy encounters Forager, who asks for help in stopping {{the killing of the}} New Gods. On Apokolips, Jimmy and Forager fight Parademons and are overpowered and taken prisoner. The Monitors decide <b>that</b> <b>Jimmy</b> is not meant to control his powers and that he is being manipulated. Jimmy is sent to the slave pits, where his overseers are ordered to torture him; Mister Miracle comes to his aid. Unable to discern the nature of Jimmy's powers with his Mother Box, Mister Miracle gambles by dropping Olsen into a fire pit. Jimmy survives by assuming a turtle-like form. Jimmy locates Forager, who then attacks him. Jimmy duplicates the powers of a Mother Box to restore Forager's sanity. When the two of them are confronted by Bernadeth, Jimmy manages to open a Boom Tube and returns to Earth with Forager, whereupon he kisses her.|$|E
25|$|Another trope of operas is the deus ex machina, {{in which}} the protagonist is saved {{at the last minute}} by divine intervention. This is a useful {{technique}} to quickly wrap up a story and make a happy ending, and has been used in drama many times. In Mahagonny, though there are no supernatural occurrences for most of the opera, there is in fact a deus ex machina; God himself comes to Mahagonny right before Jimmy is executed. The typical opera would have God solving all the problems {{just in time for the}} end of the opera, but Mahagonnys god does not. He does not even acknowledge <b>that</b> <b>Jimmy</b> is tied up and ready to be killed, but at least tries to fix the moral problems in Mahagonny. He tries to convince them to give up their degraded way of life, but the residents all refuse the offer. God then tells them literally to go to hell, but the people are not even offended; they proclaim that they already are in hell so that is no punishment. After fixing nothing, God then lets Jimmy have his say. Jimmy realizes that money did not buy him happiness or freedom, and he has learned his lesson. However, God does not spare him even then, and Jimmy is executed off-stage.|$|E
