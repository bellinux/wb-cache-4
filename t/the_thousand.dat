5|$|At the time, Akersbanerne {{was working}} on {{building}} the Lambertseter Line, which is located further east in Aker. This caused an uproar amongst the residents in the Ekeberg area, who wanted the Ekeberg Line extended, in {{what became known as}} <b>the</b> <b>thousand</b> meter, before the construction of the Lambertseter Line. The municipality therefore granted free municipal land and a grant of NOK50,000 for expropriation. Construction started in July 1940, after having been delayed by the German occupation of Norway. The construction included a new double track from Holtet to Bråten. During the construction at Sæter, the trams turned at Bråten and backed to Sæter, where they used the turning loop. <b>The</b> <b>thousand</b> meter extension to Ljabru opened on 17 September 1941.|$|E
5|$|Finally, on October 11, 1968, <b>the</b> <b>Thousand</b> Islands Bypass opened. This final {{piece was}} commemorated with a plaque to signify the {{completion}} of Highway401.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} National Treasures {{writings}} {{that do not}} fit {{in any of the}} above categories, all originating in China.

5|$|When Adolf Hitler rose to power, Joseph Goebbels became Minister of Propaganda and {{banned the}} film in Germany, {{suggesting}} that the film would undermine the audience's confidence in its statesmen. The French-language and German-language versions of the film were released in Europe while several versions of the film were released in the United States to mixed reception with each re-release. The sequel <b>The</b> <b>Thousand</b> Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960) was also directed by Lang. Modern reception {{of the film is}} favorable with critics, while the film has influenced filmmakers including Claude Chabrol and Artur Brauner.|$|E

After a battle at the town of Shallows, Drizzt believes the other Companions of the Hall to have fallen in battle, and he sets off into the wilderness to fight all orcs in vengeance. The Lone Drow (2003) continues this storyline as the still-living Companions protect Mithril Hall from orc attacks {{without the aid of}} Drizzt.

In 1924, as Minister for Housing, Denny was {{closely associated with}} <b>the</b> <b>Thousand</b> Homes Scheme, which aimed to provide affordable housing, particularly for returned soldiers and their families, and lower income groups. The land used for this development {{was the site of}} the Mitcham military camp at which Denny had trained before embarking for service overseas. Denny's work on the Scheme resulted in a clash with former Premier Sir Henry Barwell, whom he sued for libel after Barwell made statements suggesting that Denny had made false statements to induce merchants to provide goods and services. Barwell later apologised for his comments.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, 1860 {{a revolt}} against the Bourbon regime broke out.

Garibaldi {{announced that he was}} assuming dictatorship over Sicily in the name of King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia. On May 15, the Redshirts fought the Battle of Calatafimi and within weeks Palermo was freed. FrancisII of the Two Sicilies tried to regain control of the Kingdom. On June 25, 1860 he restored the constitution of the Kingdom, adopted the Italian tricolour as the national flag, and promised special institutions for the Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|Thousands {{are counted}} separately, and <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> count precedes <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} number (to the right, since Hebrew is read from right to left). [...] There are no special marks to signify that the “count” is {{starting}} over with thousands, which can theoretically lead to ambiguity, although a single quote mark is sometimes used after the letter. [...] When specifying years of the Hebrew calendar in the present millennium, writers usually omit <b>the</b> <b>thousands</b> (which is presently 5 [...] ), {{but if they do}} not this is accepted to mean 5 * 1000, with no ambiguity.

When hot air is {{retained in the}} heart it is the stage when it makes entry into the Sahasrara Chakra, <b>the</b> <b>thousand</b> petaled lotus, that then emerges in an inverted form. When the vital air is held in the abode of Brahman (Atman), which is the heart, according to verses 12.15–22, the fire located {{in the region of}} Susumna, which is between the eyebrows glows. These exercises, which stimulates the heart with vital air and fire, lead to the perception of light internally and externally. At this stage one should behold with the mind's eye, the fire-like glowing moon in the forehead, and meditate on the inner self in the Chitta (mind).|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{until the}} Heian period, the {{language}} of government and ritual was Classical Chinese in which was composed decrees, codes, commands, communications and certificates. Consequently, Chinese books were essential {{for the education of}} the (male) aristocracy, and beginning readers studied books such as the Mencius or <b>the</b> <b>Thousand</b> Character Classic. Towards the end of the 7th century, to prepare selected sons of the nobility for a government career, Emperor Tenji established the Daigaku-ryō ("Academy"). At first the curriculum consisted mainly of Confucian Classics and Chinese history. Chinese learning thrived in the 9th century, and the Academy's curriculum saw a rise in literary composition based on the Chinese books Wen Xuan, Records of the Grand Historian and the Books of Han and Later Han. Unlike in China at the time, Classical Confucian studies, especially the historical and political side of Confucianism, were still held in high esteem in the Heian period with commentaries used for study dating to the Han Dynasty. In fact, one of the Japanese emperor's prescribed activities was listening to lectures on the Chinese classics, histories, and poetic anthologies.|$|E
5|$|Marsalas keel {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 15 February 1911, {{the same day as}} Nino Bixio. Work on Marsala proceeded slower than on her sister, and she was launched on 24 March 1912, where she was named for the city where Giuseppe Garibaldi launched the Expedition of <b>the</b> <b>Thousand</b> in 1860. After completing fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 4 August 1914. Italy declared neutrality at the start of World War I in August 1914, but by May 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic, which could also be easily seeded with minefields. The threat from these underwater weapons was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.|$|E
