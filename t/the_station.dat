5|$|A station {{house is}} located above both platforms, {{containing}} a crossover, waiting area and fare control. The single street staircase outside of fare control {{goes down to}} West Road by the intersection of Noel Road next to the Rockaway-bound platform. This platform also has a set of exit-only turnstiles leading directly to this staircase so riders exiting <b>the</b> <b>station</b> on this side {{do not have to}} go through <b>the</b> <b>station</b> house. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> house is heated, while the platforms feature passenger-activated heaters; these heaters, and the doors separating <b>the</b> <b>station</b> house and staircases, were not originally part of <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> <b>The</b> <b>station</b> house used to have 1950s-era signage at its front entrance reading, but now only has modern MTA entrance signs.|$|E
5|$|Access {{to parts}} of <b>the</b> <b>station</b> is {{difficult}} for people with physical disability. The introduction of lifts in 2010 made the taxi rank and underground station accessible from the concourse, though customers found them unreliable and frequently broken down. Wayfindr technology was introduced to <b>the</b> <b>station</b> in 2015 to help the visually impaired navigate <b>the</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Transport for London (TfL), <b>the</b> <b>station</b> is at {{capacity}} {{because of}} the large number of passengers leaving and entering <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> as well as the large numbers of passengers changing between lines. Currently, everyone who uses <b>the</b> <b>station</b> has to pass through the intermediate concourse {{at the bottom of the}} main escalators. This causes congestion and delays.|$|E
40|$|A {{system is}} {{presented}} for synchronizing a signal at a remotely located slave <b>station</b> with <b>the</b> phase {{and frequency of}} a signal generated at a master <b>station.</b> <b>The</b> signal transmitted at <b>the</b> master <b>station</b> and received by <b>the</b> slave <b>station</b> provides compensation for the phase shift caused by the transmission path delays between the master and slave <b>station.</b> <b>The</b> slave <b>station</b> transmits a signal to <b>the</b> master <b>station</b> at a frequency {{that is different from}} the frequency of the signal being transmitted by <b>the</b> master <b>station.</b> <b>The</b> signal transmitted by <b>the</b> slave <b>station</b> is received by <b>the</b> master <b>station</b> while <b>the</b> master <b>station</b> transmitter is off.

5|$|Around the 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was modernized. After water {{shorted out}} old wires in <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> on March 11, 1999, a major fire {{occurred}} originating in an equipment {{room on the}} station's lower level. A 1930s-era relay room, which controlled the interlocking north of <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> was destroyed in the fire. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> was closed for several months, with G service suspended south of Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets and F trains simply bypassing <b>the</b> <b>station</b> at a lower-than-normal operating speed. Signals and switches at <b>the</b> <b>station</b> were replaced and modernized after the fire, and again in Fall 2008 when the relay room was rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|Bakers Dolphin number 66 {{bus from}} Nailsea to Congresbury via Portbury, Portishead, Clevedon and Yatton stops at <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> with seven {{services}} Monday to Saturday in each direction. There are also services connecting <b>the</b> <b>station</b> with local destinations towards Bristol and Weston-super-Mare operated by First West of England that {{leave from the}} main road outside <b>the</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
5|$|Built {{as a local}} station, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was {{constructed}} with bellmouth provisions to allow conversion into an express station. A close observation of both ends of this station reveals that the tunnel wall extends outward to allow space for the two side platforms to be replaced with island platforms, with the local tracks taking the side platforms' place. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> would have accommodated a major system expansion, with additional service coming from the Roosevelt Avenue Terminal station and the former LIRR Rockaway Line. Requests to convert <b>the</b> <b>station</b> were also put forward by the local community shortly after <b>the</b> <b>station</b> opened, due to heavy bus traffic feeding into <b>the</b> <b>station</b> and overcrowding at the Roosevelt Avenue express stop.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, Jamieson sold <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> to CHUM Limited. During CHUM's ownership, <b>the</b> Q Radio <b>stations</b> became oldies stations, while a new co-owned {{country music}} FM station, CKIX, was launched. In 1990, <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> were sold again to Newcap Broadcasting, which quickly {{converted}} <b>the</b> AM <b>stations</b> outside St. John's to country music (fed from CKIX). Two of <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> were closed soon after, {{while the others}} eventually converted to FM.|$|R

5|$|Coal is now {{delivered}} to <b>the</b> <b>station</b> mainly using rail transport and is unloaded at <b>the</b> <b>station</b> using a merry-go-round system. Trains supplying <b>the</b> <b>station</b> use the Newbiggin and Lynemouth branch {{line of the}} Blyth and Tyne Railway, which also serves the smelter. This line was originally used to export coal from the local coalfield, and also had passenger services. These passenger services ceased in 1964, and now the line is only used to serve the power station and smelter. Coal from the local opencast mines is brought to <b>the</b> <b>station</b> by road using heavy goods vehicles. Coal is graded and washed at <b>the</b> <b>station</b> prior to being burned.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Sloatsburg station {{dates back}} to the 1830s, when <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was built along the Erie Railroad. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> served the line heading to Port Jervis northward, along with a stagecoach to Greenwood Lake three times a day. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> was {{populated}} by fishermen {{on their way to the}} lake, but has been the site of several accidents. These calamities include a derailed milk train in 1843 and a fatal accident between the train line and several mules and their owner in 1855. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> became part of Metro-North in 1983, when the service was created. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> was listed under a revitalization plan in 2005 to help serve its commuters.|$|E
5|$|Construction of <b>the</b> <b>station</b> {{started in}} 1918 and was {{finished}} in 1921. <b>The</b> <b>station,</b> excluding its water tower and restaurant, cost 117,062 Norwegian krone (NOK) {{to build and}} took 26,883 man-hours. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> and axillary buildings were designed by Gudmund Hoel of NSB Arkitektkontor. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> opened with {{the first part of}} the Rauma Line on 19 November 1921. It remained the terminus until 25 November 1923, when the next section, to Verma Station, opened.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{work on the}} Goods Office was completed, {{construction}} of <b>the</b> new <b>station</b> commenced in January 1963, next to <b>the</b> existing <b>station.</b> <b>The</b> old <b>station</b> remained in use while <b>the</b> new <b>station</b> was being built until 10 June 1963 when {{the first section of}} <b>the</b> new <b>station</b> was brought into service. At this time, <b>the</b> old <b>station</b> was demolished in stages {{to make way for the}} {{construction of}} the remainder of <b>the</b> new <b>station.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Leader sold <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> in 1953. Though <b>the</b> FM <b>station</b> changed call letters a {{few times}} (and {{frequency}} once), <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> remained linked until 1997, when owner Sabre Communications sold WCLI to Eolin Broadcasting Inc.|$|R
50|$|She {{served on}} <b>the</b> East Indies <b>Station</b> and <b>the</b> China <b>Station</b> between 1860 and 1861.

She left <b>the</b> Australia <b>Station</b> on November 1868 and returned to <b>the</b> Pacific <b>Station</b> in early 1869.|$|R
5|$|During the 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> {{became one}} of the UK's least {{efficient}} power stations. In 1998, plans were announced to use <b>the</b> <b>station</b> as a test-bed for clean coal technology, but the plans did not come to fruition. In 1999, then owners Innogy plc decided to take Blyth A out of operation, while Blyth B began operating only at times of peak demand, because the stations had become surplus to their generating needs. From 1 April 2000 onwards <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was taken out of service for the summer months, because of the low demand for electricity at that time of year. However, staff were retained to maintain <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> Innogy plc then began looking for a buyer for <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> to decide the site's future. They had been in talks with American based NRG Energy, over a £410million purchase of <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> along with the Killingholme Power Station in North Lincolnshire. There had also been rumours that a deal had been made to convert <b>the</b> <b>station</b> into a waste-to-energy plant. However, any plans to save <b>the</b> <b>station</b> fell through and the generation of electricity at <b>the</b> <b>station</b> ceased on 31 January 2001, after 43years of operating, resulting in the loss of 131jobs.|$|E
5|$|Facilities at <b>the</b> <b>station</b> {{are minimal}} - there are metal and glass shelters on each platform, and some seating. A small ticket office {{operates}} on platform 1 on weekday afternoons, {{but there are}} no other facilities for buying tickets and <b>the</b> <b>station</b> is generally unstaffed. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms, as well as dot-matrix displays showing the next trains on each platform. A small pay and display car park with 30 spaces is to the north of <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> as are racks for eight bicycles. CCTV cameras are in operation at <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> There is a bus stop located in <b>the</b> <b>station</b> car park however at present no buses serve it.|$|E
5|$|Following the docking, Mirs {{attitude}} control system was used to spin <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> to provide spin-stabilisation {{in order to further}} conserve the fuel, as <b>the</b> <b>station</b> had descended to an altitude at which its gyroscopes could not be used for {{attitude control}}. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> would remain in this spin until the deorbit manoeuvres began.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Stations</b> of <b>the</b> Resurrection {{complement}} <b>the</b> <b>Stations</b> of <b>the</b> Cross or Via Crucis (the term Via Lucis is intentionally {{reminiscent of}} this), a traditional Catholic devotion commemorating the Passion of Jesus. Unlike the traditional form of <b>the</b> <b>Stations</b> of <b>the</b> Cross—though {{in common with}} the revised form of that devotion introduced by Pope John Paul II on Good Friday 1991—all <b>the</b> <b>Stations</b> of <b>the</b> Resurrection are based on scripturally-recorded incidents contained in the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> {{was subject}} of a {{terrorist}} attack. A non-Norwegian man had called the Norwegian police 7.49 in the morning, claiming that he had planted a bomb on <b>the</b> <b>station</b> which would detonate 8.00, eleven minutes later. All traffic on the Østfold Line was stopped, and <b>the</b> <b>station</b> investigated, but no bombs were found.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2013, {{work had}} resumed {{in the tunnel}} segment between 99th Street and 105th Street, {{involving}} the addition of track and signals, mechanical and plumbing equipment, and upgrading the tunnels to meet modern fire code standards. , <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was 65% excavated. Rails for the line had arrived and were being stored in <b>the</b> <b>station</b> cavern; {{about one-third of the}} rails for the line had arrived by then, enough for tracks to be laid from 105th to 87th Streets. By spring 2014, the mezzanine was completed, and roof slabs were being installed; tracks and signal brackets were also installed north of <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> By April 2015, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was 67% complete, and by April 2016, <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was 91% complete. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> was scheduled to be completed by June 2016, but this was later pushed back to fall 2016.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{finalized}} {{plans to}} overhaul <b>the</b> <b>station</b> completely. In 1999, the MTA requested $125 {{million in federal}} funding for the renovation. As part of renovation, a group of satellite dishes was proposed for <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> By this point, the New York City Transit Police were operating from a tent adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> and there were vestiges of a carousel within <b>the</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... {{there is}} no universally-agreed list of <b>Stations</b> of <b>the</b> Resurrection, nor have any Church {{authorities}} sought to impose a definitive list, {{and as a result}} some churches have commissioned sets of sculptures for <b>the</b> <b>Stations</b> according to their own distinctive scheme which may not be followed elsewhere. (This is similar to the history of <b>the</b> <b>Stations</b> of <b>the</b> Cross, which attained their normative form only after many centuries of widely varying local practice.) As to <b>the</b> number of <b>Stations,</b> however, there is general agreement that in order to emphasise the complementarity between <b>the</b> <b>Stations</b> of <b>the</b> Cross and <b>the</b> <b>Stations</b> of <b>the</b> Resurrection there should be fourteen <b>Stations</b> of <b>the</b> Resurrection, as is traditionally the case with <b>the</b> <b>Stations</b> of <b>the</b> Cross.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the opening}} of long-distance <b>station,</b> <b>the</b> three-track <b>station</b> opened in 1972 (now <b>the</b> {{regional}} <b>station)</b> has only been used by regional and S-Bahn traffic. Between 1985 and 1999, <b>the</b> regional <b>station</b> had been used by Intercity and later by Intercity-Express services. Until December 2010 some long-distance trains used <b>the</b> regional <b>station</b> at night, when <b>the</b> long-distance <b>station</b> was closed. <b>The</b> long-distance <b>station</b> is now also open at night, so scheduled long-distance trains no longer stop at <b>the</b> regional <b>station.</b> <b>The</b> Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed line opened in August 2002, {{three years after the}} line between the Raunheim curve and the Frankfurt Cross tunnel through <b>the</b> new <b>station.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2003, EBI {{sold all}} of <b>the</b> <b>stations</b> to Route 81 Radio, based in Hazleton, Pennsylvania.

5|$|Nordberg Station {{was located}} in the steep road named Borgestadveien, that passed <b>the</b> <b>station</b> in a level crossing. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> served the local senior center named Nordberghjemmet, and was the most used of all {{stations}} among residents living in Nordberg. After the 1992 closure, very little remains from <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> aside from a pedestrians' underpass.|$|E
5|$|Photovoltaic (PV) arrays powered Mir. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> used a 28volt DC supply which {{provided}} 5-, 10-, 20- and 50-amp taps. When <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was illuminated by sunlight, several solar arrays {{mounted on the}} pressurised modules provided power to Mirs systems and charged the nickel-cadmium storage batteries installed throughout <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> The arrays rotated in only one degree of freedom over a 180° arc, and tracked the sun using sun sensors and motors installed in the array mounts. <b>The</b> <b>station</b> itself also had to be oriented to ensure optimum illumination of the arrays. When the station's all-sky sensor detected that Mir had entered Earth's shadow, the arrays were rotated to the optimum angle predicted for reacquiring the sun once <b>the</b> <b>station</b> passed out of the shadow. The batteries, each of 60Ah capacity, were then used to power <b>the</b> <b>station</b> until the arrays recovered their maximum output on the day side of Earth.|$|E
