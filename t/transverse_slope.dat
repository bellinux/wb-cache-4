50|$|Cross slope, {{cross fall}} or camber is a {{geometric}} feature of pavement surfaces: the <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> {{with respect to}} the horizon. It is a very important safety factor. Cross slope is provided to provide a drainage gradient so that water will run off the surface to a drainage system such as a street gutter or ditch. Inadequate cross slope will contribute to aquaplaning. On straight sections of normal two-lane roads, the pavement cross section is usually highest in the center and drains to both sides. In horizontal curves, the cross slope is banked into superelevation to reduce steering effort and lateral force required to go around the curve. All water drains {{to the inside of the}} curve. If the cross slope magnitude oscillates within 1 - 25 m, the body and payload of high (heavy) vehicles will experience high roll vibration.|$|E

The objective of the current research is to quantify the <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> effect for a large range of flow conditions and sediment sizes, using an annular flume. Preliminary results show that the <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> is related to helical flow intensity and sediment size.

40|$|The <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> {{effect is}} one of the most {{important}} parameters in the modelling of fluvial morphology. It determines to a large extent the properties and patterns of channels and bars, bifurcation stability, and grain sorting. Quantification of the <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> effect has been realized by mathematical modelling in combination with bed levelling experiments in straight and curved flumes. Though an inverse dependence on the square root of Shields’ number is generally accepted, current <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> predictors contain multiple calibration factors due to a lack of experimental data and limitations in chosen transport conditions. In this thesis experiments are conducted in a carousel with of which the lid and floor can be rotated independently, which allows the generation of a wide range of secondary flow intensities. This ability leads to the possibility of conducting experiments under a much wider range of morphological conditions compared to regular flumes, as different bend radii and straight channels can be simulated. The presence of helical flow allows the self-formation of a <b>transverse</b> <b>slope.</b> Over 100 experiments were conducted using 1 mm or 4 mm grains. The resulting bed slope effect was derived from bed elevation measurements in combination with 1 D calculation of helical flow. The results show a large dependence of the <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> effect on sediment transport mode. Transition from rolling sediment to saltation led to an increase in magnitude and a lower sensitivity to Shields’ number. Similarity of the <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> effect between grain sizes was found by relating the slope effect to the ratio between Shields’ number and the critical Shields number of sediment transport initiation.

40|$|The floods of the River Rhine and the River Meuse in 1993 and 1995 {{pointed out}} the {{importance}} of river intervention works to maintain safety for surrounding inhabitants. To predict the consequences of such engineering measures on river morphology, numerical computer models are used. Due to the high socio-economic value of the Dutch river system {{and the importance of}} continuous navigability, possible disturbances in this system have to be carefully analysed. To gain a higher accuracy, the gradation of sediment has recently been implemented in these models. An important factor in river bed morphology is the gravitational influence on the direction of sediment transport e. g. in river bends and on side banks. This influence is modelled using deterministic formulae for uniform sediment. The main objective {{of this study is to}} review the applicability to widely graded sediment of the present formulae for <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> effects. This is done by comparing the measurements of a laboratory experiment to an analytical model and to the output of numerical simulations. The laboratory research that was conducted at the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of Delft University of Technology, consisted of four levelling experiments at different flow velocities and with different sediment compositions. Three experiments were done using a tri-modal sediment mixture and one experiment with a uniform mixture. A transversely sloping profile that is derived from the analytical model, was constructed from the sand mixture in a laboratory flume. A uniform flow was then created and the movement of the bed was measured as it slowly levelled towards a cross-sectional horizontal equilibrium. The analytical model is a first order approximation of a small transverse distortion, derived from the continuity and transport equations using the deterministic formula of Talmon for the <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> effect. As this model is representing only uniform sediment, a numerical simulation in Delft 3 D, using graded sediment calculations, is added using the formulae of Koch and Flokstra and of Parker and Andrews for <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> effects. When comparing the development of the measured transverse profiles to the models, a good agreement is found for the experiment with uniform sediment, but a constant underestimation of the involved timescales is found for the tri-modal mixture. In order to find a better agreement of the numerical model, the parameters of the Koch and Flokstra formula for <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> effect were varied to fit the timescales of the simulations for the tri-modal mixture to that of the experiments. Considering the design and the execution of the levelling experiments it can be concluded from this study that the method used is adequate. Considering the morphological modelling of <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> effects it can be concluded that none of the tested formulae for <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> effect can accurately predict the transverse deviation of sediment transport within their default parameter range.

40|$|Channel {{curvature}} produces secondary {{currents and}} a <b>transverse</b> <b>sloping</b> channel bed, along which the depth increases towards the outer bank. As a result deep pools tend to form {{adjacent to the}} outer bank, promoting bank collapse. The interaction of sediment grains with the primary and secondary flow and the <b>transverse</b> <b>sloping</b> bed also causes meanders to move different grain sizes in different proportions and directions, resulting in a consistent sorting pattern. Several models {{have been developed to}} describe this process, but they all have the potential to over-predict pool depth because they cannot account for the influence of erodible banks. In reality, bank collapse might lead {{to the development of a}} wider, shallower cross-section and any resulting flow depth discrepancy can bias associated predictions of flow, sediment transport, and grain-size sorting. While bed topography, sediment transport and grain sorting in bends will partly be controlled by the sedimentary characteristics of the bank materials, the magnitude of this effect has not previously been explored. This paper reports the development of a model of flow, sediment transport, grain-size sorting, and bed topography for river bends with erodible banks. The model is tested via intercomparison of predicted and observed bed topography in one low-energy (5 · 3 W m- 2 specific stream power) and one high-energy (43 · 4 W m- 2) study reach, namely the River South Esk in Scotland and Goodwin Creek in Mississippi, respectively. Model predictions of bed topography are found to be satisfactory, at least close to the apices of bends. Finally, the model is used in sensitivity analyses that provide insight into the influence of bank erodibility on equilibrium meander morphology and associated patterns of grain-size sorting. The sensitivity of meander response to bank cohesion is found to increase as a function of the available stream power within the two study bends. <br/...|$|R

In examining the causes of this type of wear, {{it can be said that}} the wheels of the train input forces when they pass through an arch on a line, which includes the centrifugal force and the forces of the arch itself, and it must be taken into consideration that the centrifugal forces are caused by the <b>transverse</b> <b>slope.</b> If the <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> of curved lines is less and line width is more than a limit value, the wear rate decreases [9]. In some lines, <b>transverse</b> <b>slope</b> is practically considered more than the balanced amount which intends to help move trains pass faster. In this case, the internal rail has a greater burden to bear, causing more wear and a greater chance of breaking, as it appears with a vertical slit in the crown.

Run-off in the rainy season decreased the ground level by between 38 and 58 mm along the truck ruts, and the soil loss was different in each type of road.

40|$|Abstract According to the Bagnold {{hypothesis}} for equilibrium bedload transport, {{a necessary}} constraint {{for the maintenance}} of equilibrium bedload transport is that the fluid shear stress at the bed must be reduced to the critical, or threshold value associated with incipient motion of grains. It was shown in a companion paper to the present one, however that the Bagnold hypothesis breaks down when applied to equilibrium bedload transport on beds with <b>transverse</b> <b>slopes</b> above a relatively modest value that is well below the angle of repose. This failure motivates the abandonment of the Bagnold constraint, even for nearly horizontal beds. The constraint is replaced with an entrainment formulation, according to which a dynamic equilibrium is maintained by a balance between entrainment of bed grains into the bedload layer and deposition of bedload grains onto the bed. The entrainment function is formulated so that the entrainment rate is an increasing function of the excess of the fluid shear stress at the bed over the threshold value. The formulation is implemented {{with the aid of a}} unique set of laboratory data that characterizes equilibrium bedload transport at relatively low shear stresses for streamwise angles of bed inclination varying from nearly 0 ° to 22 °. The formulation is shown to provide a description of bedload transport on nearly horizontal beds that fits the data as well as that resulting from the Bagnold constraint. The entrainment formulation has the added advantage of not requiring the unrealistically high dynamic coefficient of Coulomb friction resulting from the Bagnold constraint. Finally...|$|R
