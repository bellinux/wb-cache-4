500|$|Officially it {{was called}} a [...] "planned withdrawal" [...] (...). But {{to me it was}} so much bullshit. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> heard on the radio, in the 'news from the front' (Wehrmachtbericht) about the [...] "successful front correction" [...] in our Yelnya {{defensive}} lines and the enormous losses we inflicted on the enemy. But no single word was heard about a retreat, about the hopelessness of the situation, about the mental and emotional numbness of the German soldiers. In short, it was again a [...] "victory". But we on the front line were running back like rabbits in front of the fox. This metamorphosis of the truth from [...] "all shit" [...] to [...] "it was a victory" [...] baffled me, and those of my comrades who dared to think.|$|E
500|$|Horses {{were used}} {{extensively}} for military trains. [...] They {{were used to}} pull ambulances, carry supplies and [...] [...] At {{the beginning of the}} war, the German army depended upon horses to pull its field kitchens, as well as the ammunition wagons for artillery brigades. The Royal Corps of Signals used horses to pull cable wagons, and the promptness of messengers and dispatch riders depended on their mounts. [...] Horses often drew artillery and steady animals were crucial to artillery effectiveness. The deep mud common {{in some parts of the}} front, caused by damaged drainage systems flooding nearby areas, made horses and mules vital, as they were the only means of getting supplies to the front and guns moved from place to place. After the April 1917 Battle of Vimy Ridge, one Canadian soldier recalled, [...] "the horses were up to their bellies in mud. We'd put them on a picket line between the wagon wheels at night and they'd be sunk in over their fetlocks <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>We</b> had to shoot quite a number." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{story that}} we were sunk was a coward's trick—spreading anxiety and fear among the innocent.... <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> issued a denial and ... on October 4 we spread panic and chaos in the Norwegian {{shipping}} lanes. Only one thing we regret. We kept looking for the Tirpitz but either she wouldn't or couldn't come out.... Meanwhile the Ranger, still very much afloat, is doing her job." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> as <b>we</b> know, war was {{declared}} by France against Germany, the French garrison left Rome, and on September 20 the Italians marched in.|$|R
30|$|Finally, driving {{pressure}} was measured at 24  h {{of the beginning}} of the protocol. Ideally, we should consider some average exposition during the whole mechanical ventilation period. In this study, however, similarly to the previous study of Amato et al. [20], the values of {{driving pressure}} measured at day-one were strongly correlated to the levels measured during <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>days.</b> <b>We</b> may not exclude, however, that additional adjustments in mechanical ventilation after 24  h of the protocol could also be associated with late pulmonary function and structure.|$|R
6000|$|Just {{before leaving}} for <b>the</b> train <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> called on Osmond Button, who clung to my father with piteous intensity. [...] "Stay another day," [...] he pleaded, but father would not listen to any postponement.|$|R
2500|$|... "We got our things {{packed up}} {{and took care of}} the wounded the best we could, and left <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>We</b> could have killed all the men that got into holes on the hill, but they were glad to let us alone, and so we let them alone too. Rain-in-the-Face was with me in the fight. There were twelve hundred of us. Might be no more than one {{thousand}} in the fight. Many of our Indians were out on a hunt." ...|$|E
2500|$|I do {{have the}} {{original}} tape that was running {{at the time we}} ran down [...] "Stairway To Heaven" [...] completely with the band. I'd worked it all out already the night before with John Paul Jones, written down the changes and things. All this time we were all living in a house and keeping pretty regular hours together, so <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> started running it down. There was only one place where there was a slight rerun. For some unknown reason Bonzo couldn't get the timing right on the twelve-string part before the solo. Other than that it flowed very quickly.|$|E
2500|$|We spent {{this winter}} very joyously and of good times, {{due to the}} L'Odre de l Bon Temps that I {{established}} here, which each person finds useful for their health and more beneficial than any sort of medicine {{that we could have}} used. The Order was presented as a Chain of office that we placed with some small ceremony, at the neck of one of our people, charging him that day with going hunting; <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> gave it to another and thus consequently: all who wished to try would do their best and bring the most beautiful hunt: We don't find it half bad , as well as the Indians who were with us. (Voyages of Champlain: 1613) ...|$|E
60|$|It rained all <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> and <b>we</b> {{were forced}} to remain in camp, which was dismal business; but we made the best of it, doing some mending of clothes and tackle during the long hours.|$|R
60|$|Max {{left for}} Halifax in <b>the</b> morning. <b>Next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> got a wire {{saying it was}} all right. The evening of the {{following}} day {{he was back in}} Spencervale. Ismay and I put him in a chair and glared at him impatiently.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{told me he}} was goin' to the Engadine," [...] said Tertius. [...] "Sat on my cot smokin' a cigarette, and makin' {{me laugh}} till I cried. Macnamara bundled the whole lot of us down to <b>the</b> plains <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>We</b> were a walkin' hospital." ...|$|R
2500|$|June Juanico [...] "recalls a {{time when}} she stood up to Elvis in front of his band of hangers-on, who even then were {{beginning}} to accompany him everywhere. He grabbed her arm, took her into the bathroom and declared: 'Look, you are so right, I am really sorry.' He kept her there for five minutes, then swaggered out, his image intact." [...] Julie Parrish, Presley's co-star in Paradise Hawaiian Style, relates, [...] "One time on set I had a real pain in my side – a side-effect, I think – and Elvis scooped me up, carried me into his trailer and shut the door. Outside the crew was waiting and wondering, but Elvis was oblivious to the innuendo. He placed his hand over my side and tried to do some healing on me." [...] Playboy star and actress June Wilkinson remembered that she [...] "met Elvis on the set of King Creole. He invited me to dinner at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. ... Then Elvis gave me a tour of his suite, sat me on the bed in his bedroom and sang to me for two hours. That was it. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> ... <b>we</b> had dinner again. He was very sweet, and he was friendly. He had more than sex on his mind. He got me to the airport on time, and our paths never crossed again." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> waited, and the next, {{and still}} {{he made no}} sign.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> {{all took}} a long walk on the beach, picking up shells.|$|E
60|$|I was too drowsy {{and cold}} to answer, {{and how we}} got the team into the stables or even found Fairmead I do not remember; but we {{probably}} did it by force of habit, and it was high noon <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> before <b>we</b> awakened.|$|R
60|$|Edward {{went to bed}} {{somewhat}} dispirited; but, quickly falling asleep, {{was visited}} with such a pleasant dream of the sunshine and of his dearest friends that he felt the happier for it all <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> And <b>we</b> hope to find him still happy when we meet again.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is a sad}} {{moment for}} us as we know many of our staff are London based {{and will not be}} able to make the move with us. Also during this period of the move for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 15-30 <b>days</b> <b>we</b> will be {{reducing}} our broadcasting hours." ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> {{learned what}} was Spugg's {{answer to the}} German's capture of William and Henry.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> bade {{farewell}} to Glasgow, overwhelmed with kindness to the last, and only oppressed by the thought, how little that was satisfactory {{we were able}} to give in return.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> got an {{unsigned}} letter. In it Sobber said that, by hook or by crook, {{he intended}} to get possession of the treasure, and for the Rovers to beware," ...|$|E
60|$|Fortunately, nothing happened, and at Silverton {{we changed}} to a real train, with a real engine, and as we dropped into Las Animas Cañon we left December behind. At six o'clock we emerged from the cañon at Durango into genial September--or so it seemed after our day of midwinter in <b>the</b> heights. <b>Next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> {{returned}} to Colorado Springs.|$|R
60|$|It was in {{the early}} forenoon of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> that <b>we</b> made <b>the</b> great departure. Since dawn Professor Challenger had been acutely uneasy, {{continually}} scanning each bank of the river. Suddenly he gave an exclamation of satisfaction and pointed to a single tree, which projected at a peculiar angle {{over the side of the}} stream.|$|R
60|$|It was on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> that <b>we</b> {{left behind}} us those islands which Captain Smith told me were the West Indies, and the seaman who {{stood at the}} helm when I came on deck to get water for my master, said we were {{steering}} a northerly course, which would soon bring us {{to the land of}} Virginia.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> {{could only}} travel till breakfast-time, {{as the wind}} again {{increased}} so much as to oblige us to put ashore. We comforted ourselves, however, {{with the prospect of}} a good mutton-chop.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>we</b> {{heard from}} our {{informer}} at Kensington that the Queen was somewhat better, {{and had been}} up for an hour, though she was not well enough yet to receive any visitor.|$|E
60|$|We soon got {{acquaintance}} with these gentlemen, {{who were going}} to Paris, as well as we; so <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> made up our company with them, and were a pretty troop of five gentlemen and four servants.|$|E
6000|$|... "The oxen can haul them," [...] Harding replied. [...] "We'll {{get nothing}} done for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few <b>days,</b> and <b>we</b> have our hands plumb full this winter." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{uncle and}} myself then {{consulted}} on the expediency of using broken English {{with these two}} old men, of which, at first, we saw no necessity; but when we remembered that others might join us, and that our communication with the two might be frequent for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few <b>days,</b> <b>we</b> changed our minds, and determined rigidly to observe our incognitos.|$|R
60|$|In due course, my friend, {{the writer}} of the letter from which I have quoted, arrived in London, and on <b>the</b> very <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> {{paid a visit to}} a learned {{acquaintance}} well versed in Hieroglyphics and Demotic writing. The anxiety with which we watched him skilfully damping and unfolding one of the rolls and peering through his gold-rimmed glasses at the mysterious characters may well be imagined.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> {{came into}} the creek's mouth, where we found six to eight fathom water within a cable's length of the shore, and found fresh water enough, but no people or cattle, though an {{excellent}} country for both.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> reached {{our good}} Chilian's mansion-house, or palace, for such {{it might be}} called, {{considering}} the place, and considering the entertainment; for now he had some time to provide for us, knowing we would come back again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Since {{you will}} be obliged to go with us, you had better wait until to-morrow. You can have the tubing started on the road at the same time, and on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>we</b> can shoot the well," [...] {{suggested}} George.|$|E
60|$|So, {{since it}} was {{dangerous}} to linger, lest the darkness should overtake us on our return journey, we descended the peak again, reaching the cave about sunset. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> four <b>days</b> <b>we</b> spent in the same way. Every morning we crawled up those wearisome banks of snow, and every afternoon we slid and tobogganed down them again, till I grew heartily tired of the exercise.|$|R
6000|$|... "I needn't {{remind you}} that you've an {{appointment}} with Horsfield about the smelter, and there's a meeting of <b>the</b> board <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> If <b>we</b> started now and caught the first steamer across, you wouldn't {{have much time to}} spare." ...|$|R
