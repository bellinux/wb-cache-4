40|$|AbstractHelical vortices, as {{one kind}} of {{secondary}} flows, are recently observed downstream of the short twisted tape. The behaviors of vortices, which have significant effects on the efficiency of twisted tape, are not well understood. As such, the formation and development of helical vortices induced by the short twisted tape are studied numerically. The results show that two symmetrical stable helical vortices are present downstream of the twisted tape. The values of radial velocities cannot be neglected due {{to the presence of}} the vortices. The vortices form in the twisted tape and remain the structure downstream of the twisted tape. Torsion promotes the formation <b>of</b> helical vortices. <b>The</b> <b>intensities</b> <b>of</b> helical vortices decay along the streamwise direction.

5|$|On average, {{the light}} that Gliese 581d {{receives}} from its star has about 30% of <b>the</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> light the Earth receives from the Sun. By comparison, sunlight on Mars has about 40% of <b>the</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> that on Earth. That might {{seem to suggest that}} Gliese 581d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life. However, an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures. For example, Earth's own mean temperature would be about −18°C without any greenhouse gases, ranging from around 100°C on the day side to −150°C at night, much like that found on the Moon. If the atmosphere of Gliese 581d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect, and the planet's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels (as Earth's does via plate tectonics), then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle, conceivably allowing the planet to support life. Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest, however, that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet, unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected.|$|E
