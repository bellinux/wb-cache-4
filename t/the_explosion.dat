5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had {{a conflict of interest}} in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b> After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> using an electrical or chemical detonator.|$|E
5|$|Efforts began {{shortly after}} <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> to clear debris, repair buildings, and {{establish}} temporary housing for survivors left homeless by <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b> By late January 1918, around 5,000 were still without shelter. A reconstruction committee under Colonel Robert Low constructed 832 new housing units, which were furnished by the Massachusetts-Halifax Relief Fund.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people in}} Halifax at first {{believed}} <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> {{to be the}} result of a German attack. The Halifax Herald continued to propagate this belief for some time, for example reporting that Germans had mocked victims of <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b> While John Johansen, the Norwegian helmsman of Imo, was being treated for serious injuries sustained during <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> it was reported to the military police that he had been behaving suspiciously. Johansen was arrested on suspicions of being a German spy when a search turned up a letter on his person, supposedly written in German. It turned out that the letter was actually written in Norwegian. Immediately following <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> most of the German survivors in Halifax had been rounded up and imprisoned. Eventually the fear dissipated as the real cause of <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> became known, although rumours of German involvement persisted.|$|E
5|$|Soon after <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> Thompson was {{informed}} by an Iowa crewman that the Navy was conducting a dishonest {{investigation into the}} cause of the tragedy. Thompson, a producer for the television newsmagazine 60 Minutes, later produced several television reports which disputed the Navy's conclusions as to what had caused <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{investigation}} into <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> {{conducted by the}} U.S. Navy, concluded {{that one of the}} gun turret crew members, Clayton Hartwig, who died in <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> had deliberately caused it. During the investigation, numerous leaks to the media, later attributed to U.S. Navy officers and investigators, implied that Hartwig and another sailor, Kendall Truitt, had engaged in a homosexual relationship and that Hartwig had caused <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> after their relationship had soured. In its report, however, the U.S. Navy concluded that the evidence did not show that Hartwig was homosexual but that he was suicidal and had caused <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> with either an electronic or chemical detonator.|$|E
50|$|September 10, 2007: Pemex {{reported}} explosions due {{to sabotage}} on several pipelines {{located in the}} key energy producing state of Veracruz and further inland in Tlaxcala. According to reports, there were six explosions targeting pipelines carrying natural gas, propane, and crude oil. The effects of <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> were so severe that they caused the evacuation of over 20,000 people from <b>the</b> area. <b>The</b> <b>explosions</b> caused {{millions of dollars in}} damages to Pemex equipment. Additionally, it is estimated <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> cost <b>the</b> Mexican economy $100 million a day as over 2,500 businesses were effected and 60% of Mexico's steel industry was shuttered. On September 11, 2007 the EPR claimed responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>explosions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Immediately after <b>the</b> <b>explosions,</b> <b>the</b> {{remainder}} of the flotilla attempted to rescue the crew. Just after 20:00, Max Schultz exploded and sank, probably striking a mine. What followed was confusion. There were many erroneous reports of air attack, submarines detected and torpedoes; ships dashed back and forth. Theodor Riedel dropped depth charges on a supposed submarine and <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> temporarily jammed its rudder.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> was not {{immediately}} known, but an investigation concluded in February 2016 that an overheated container of dry nitrocellulose {{was the cause of}} <b>the</b> initial <b>explosion.</b>|$|R

5|$|According to Thompson, the Navy {{immediately}} began efforts {{to cover up}} the cause of <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b> Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into trying to prove that one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had intentionally caused <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b> After learning that Hartwig had named another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy on himself, Milligan enlisted the help of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.|$|E

5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused {{himself from the}} trial {{and was replaced by}} Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received in the days before <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E

25|$|It was {{immediately}} apparent that <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> were <b>the</b> {{result of an}} attempted terrorist attack, but it was initially unclear whether <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> were a serious attempt to repeat 7 July bombings or were merely a symbolic attack or hoax intended to cause panic rather than mass casualties. The explosives used by the bombers consisted of Chapatti flour powder mixed with liquid hydrogen peroxide, detonated by a booster charge. This {{was not the same}} explosive mixture used by the bombers in the 7/7 bombings two weeks earlier, which had used TATP. It was later confirmed that substantial improvised explosive devices capable of causing significant numbers of casualties had in fact been involved, but had failed to explode. <b>The</b> <b>explosions</b> were caused by detonators which failed to detonate the main explosive charge. Police later disclosed that some of the devices used had survived <b>the</b> <b>explosions</b> and were available for forensic investigation.|$|R
5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. <b>The</b> <b>explosion</b> flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had gone as far as Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze. <b>The</b> <b>explosion</b> shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused <b>the</b> <b>explosion.</b> A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused {{an explosion in the}} gun breech.
