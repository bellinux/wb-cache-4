5|$|The police {{continued}} the investigation, {{under pressure to}} finish quickly. Two reconstructions of the murder were conducted, drawing hundreds of spectators. One was done with Sumaji {{playing the role of}} the murderer, without his lawyers' knowledge; when <b>the</b> <b>counsel</b> found out, they removed him from the reconstruction. Eventually, police agreed to a deal with <b>the</b> <b>counsel,</b> in which Sumaji's pre-trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from his lawyers to not sue for wrongful arrest. Sumaji was released on 17 December, awaiting trial. In early 1997, Sumaji's case was refused by the prosecutor's office several times due to weak evidence.|$|E

5|$|As soon as Kantakouzenos left Constantinople in July 1341 to {{campaign}} against the Empire's enemies who were assaulting it, Apokaukos made his first moves. Although as commander of the fleet it was his duty to guard the Dardanelles against any attempt by Turks to cross into Europe, he deliberately allowed this to happen in order to cause disruption in Thrace. Apokaukos tried to kidnap the young John V, but failed {{and was forced to}} flee to his house at Epibatai. However, when Kantakouzenos returned victorious to the capital, instead of depriving Apokaukos of his offices, and against <b>the</b> <b>counsel</b> of his friends, he pardoned his protégé. Apokaukos put on an exaggerated display of deference to Kantakouzenos, who allowed him to resume his offices and return to Constantinople, while Kantakouzenos left on yet another campaign.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, Germany and Italy were {{becoming}} more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany annexed Austria, again provoking little response from other European powers. Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the Sudetenland, {{an area of}} Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German population; and soon Britain and France followed <b>the</b> <b>counsel</b> of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement, which was made against {{the wishes of the}} Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands. Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary and Poland annexed Czechoslovakia's Zaolzie region.|$|E

Columbanus had arrived in Francia in about 590, after leaving Bangor along with twelve companions and going into voluntary exile. Upon Columbanus's arrival, he was encouraged to stay, and in about 592 settled at Annegay, but was then forced to find an alternative site for a monastery at Luxeuil, when lay people and the sick continually sought <b>the</b> <b>counsel</b> of himself and his fellow monks.|$|E

A total of 205 respondents were randomly chosen to answer the Comprehensive Scale of Psychotheraphy Session Contructs (CSPSC) questionnaire as well as the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES) questionnaire.

5|$|General Marshall was Truman's {{principal}} adviser {{on foreign policy}} matters, influencing such decisions as the U.S. choice against offering direct military aid to Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist Chinese forces in the Chinese Civil War against their communist opponents. Marshall's opinion was contrary to <b>the</b> <b>counsel</b> of almost all of Truman's other advisers—Marshall thought propping up Chiang's forces would drain U.S. resources that were needed in Europe to deter the Soviets. When the communists {{took control of the}} mainland, establishing the People's Republic of China and driving the Nationalists to Taiwan, Truman would have been willing to maintain some relationship between the U.S. and the new government but Mao was unwilling. On June 27, 1950, after the outbreak of fighting in Korea, Truman ordered the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent further conflict between the communist government on the China mainland and the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan.|$|E

5|$|With the {{question}} of the episcopal exemption decided in Evesham's favour, the alliance between Norreis and his monks dissolved. The monks again complained of their abbot's behaviour to the new papal legate, John of Sancta Maria. The legate ordered an investigation, the result being a written agreement between the two parties. Norreis gave gifts to the legate's nephew, refused to sign the agreement, and took revenge on his opponents by expelling Thomas of Marlborough and his allies from the monastery. Thirty monks followed Thomas into exile, and Norreis pursued them with soldiers who were defeated by the monks. A compromise was eventually reached, Norreis agreeing that the revenues of the abbey would be split with the monks, that officials of the abbey would be appointed by the abbot but with the advice and consent of the monks, and that the abbot would not admit or expel monks without taking <b>the</b> <b>counsel</b> of his monks nor dispose of the monastic property without the consent of his subordinates. Although the issue of the monks' support was temporarily solved, the issue of the disputed properties between Mauger and the monastery continued. Norreis appears to have been willing to compromise with the bishop, but the monks refused.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore, with five grade twelve students, their understandings of <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> relationships they shared with their counsellors in a single northern B. C. secondary school setting. The investigation was guided by four questions: (1) What conditions make it possible for the students to talk to a school counsellor? (2) What conditions give students the confidence to share private and confidential information with their counsellor? (3) What are the critical incidents during their <b>counselling</b> which affected <b>the</b> development of <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> relationship? (4) What were the characteristic elements that constituted <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> relationship between a school counsellor and a student client? Participants were identified by their school counsellors based on the following criteria: (1) the students were grade twelve students, (2) they were familiar with <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> programme in their school, (3) they had developed a personal <b>counselling</b> relationship with <b>the</b> students, (4) the students could articulate their understandings of those relationships, and (5) they had not had a <b>counselling</b> relationship with <b>the</b> researcher. A series of open ended, in-depth interviews were conducted with the students. Grounded Theory method was used to analyse the data that was transcribed from these interviews. A conceptual model of <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> relationship was developed consisting of five stages: the Motivating Stage, the Initiating Stage, the Comfort Stage, the Working Alliance Stage, and the Change Stage. Each stage was further divided into Key Categories and Subsidiary Categories that provided insights into conditions that fostered the development of <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> relationship in <b>the</b> secondary school setting. The search for comfort in <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> relationship was a constant theme throughout all stages and was identified as the core concept of the model. Several implications for practice were identified and included: (1) the centrality of <b>the</b> personal <b>counselling</b> relationship to <b>the</b> school counsellor's role, (2) the conflict between supervisory roles {{and the development of a}} personal <b>counselling</b> relationship, (3) <b>the</b> advantages of a multifaceted role for school counsellors, (4) <b>the</b> role of <b>counselling</b> as an arena of comfort, (5) the importance of giving students a role in <b>the</b> design of <b>counselling</b> services, (6) <b>the</b> importance of a professional friendship in <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> relationship, and (7) the importance of clearly articulated professional identities for school counsellors.

Following the recruitment and interviews of nine participants, four themes emerged, which revealed the different aspects of counselling experiences.

Overall, this thesis provides insight into <b>the</b> <b>counselling</b> experience of nine Aboriginal participants who received counselling from non-Aboriginal counsellors.
