5|$|Benjamin Grayson {{constructed}} Grayson's Tavern in Danville {{sometime around}} 1785. The asymmetrical, ell-shaped building faces south onto Walnut Street with a front entrance {{on the south}} and a side entrance on the west, which opens onto Constitution Square. The Mary Akin Memorial Herb Garden, located behind Grayson's Tavern, features a variety of herbs that were commonly cultivated in the area during the late 18th and early 19th century, including chives, fennel, honeysuckle, lavender, rosemary, sage, and thyme. <b>The</b> <b>garden</b> <b>is</b> maintained by the Garden Club of Danville and named for one of its long-time members.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{there were}} servants quarters and spaces {{on the ground}} floor, and a library in the north room on the second floor, {{as well as a}} sitting room over the octagonal drawing room. According to Repton, the design should allow ground floor rooms where <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>is</b> visible and directly accessible, meaning that servants quarters needed to be placed in their own wing, but without prominence so as to maintain the hierarchy. In the south-east corner of the building there was a gothic loggia which was glazed in the 19th century to create a conservatory, some time after the conservatory in the American Garden was removed.|$|E
5|$|Julianna Helt {{from the}} Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found that time travel forms a central theme as Miranda {{constantly}} wonders how time travel could be possible.

Marcus explains:"So <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>is</b> where they appear when they get {{home at the end}} of the book. Remember? They land in the broccoli. So if they had gotten home five minutes before they left, like those ladies promised they would, then they would have seen themselves get back. Before they did".|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>garden</b> <b>was</b> {{first opened}} to the public in 1967, under <b>the</b> National <b>Gardens</b> Scheme.A small nursery was started in 1979.

5|$|Suggesting {{the passing}} of a single day, The Loves of the Plants is divided into four cantos, all written in heroic couplets. A preface to the poem {{outlines}} the basics of the Linnaean classification system. Guiding the reader through <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>is</b> a “Botanic Muse” who is described as Linnaeus's inspiration. Interspersed between the cantos are dialogues on poetic theory between the poet and his bookseller. The poem is not a narrative; instead, reminiscent of the picaresque tradition, it consists of discrete descriptions of eighty-three separate species which are accompanied by extensive explanatory footnotes.|$|E
5|$|The {{kitchen garden}} {{provides}} produce for the property's restaurant {{located in the}} adjacent Strode House; this includes many types of fruit and vegetables.

50|$|After the flood, staff {{rallied to}} clean and rebuild <b>the</b> space. <b>The</b> <b>garden</b> <b>was</b> in disarray, with trees toppled and newly {{installed}} beds destroyed. Over a dozen trees were lost and entire sections of <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>were</b> replanted with evergreen trees and new shrubs. <b>The</b> <b>garden</b> <b>was</b> partially redesigned. During the clean-up, Pioneer held a 200-person nighttime event using LED lighting.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1971, <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> <b>were</b> {{practically}} abandoned when {{an article}} about <b>the</b> <b>Gardens</b> <b>was</b> published which brought Gaudí's authorship to light.

5|$|Parsifal {{wonders if}} <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>is</b> {{a dream and}} asks {{how it is that}} Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (""), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had {{abandoned}} and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. He thinks himself very stupid to have forgotten her. Kundry says this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand his mother's love. As they kiss Parsifal suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas' name: he feels the wounded king's pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony (""). Filled with this compassion, Parsifal rejects Kundry's advances.|$|E
5|$|South of the loggia is the Dutch Tea Garden, {{which was}} laid out by C.E.Mallows in about 1905. The garden {{contains}} the Tea House which was designed by John Douglas. This has a cruciform plan and is a half-timbered building on a sandstone plinth. The roof is of red tiles, and sweeps upwards to a small spire surmounted by a weathercock. It is listed at GradeII. In the centre of <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>is</b> a statue of Mercury {{and in front of}} the Tea House are two stone Talbots. To the north of the Tea House, on the path leading to the Broad Walk, is a pair of wrought iron gates made in 1913 for the 2ndDuke. The gates and their overthrow are listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|The 2-acre (1 ha) walled {{kitchen garden}} {{was built in}} the early 1700s to provide fruit and {{vegetables}} for the estate. The Victorian head gardener's cottage is built into the southern wall. Alongside the west wall is a private path, known as the Colonel's Walk, used by the family to bypass the kitchen garden on their way to church. There are traces of original chimneys built into the wall supporting espaliered fruit trees, located there in order to maintain an optimum temperature for year-round growth. One of these chimneys has been restored. <b>The</b> <b>garden</b> <b>is</b> still in use today and includes traditional and exotic varieties , and fruit bushes, some of which are used to make jams and chutneys for sale in the hall's tearooms.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Shakespeare <b>Garden</b> in Evanston, Illinois <b>is</b> a Shakespeare <b>garden</b> on <b>the</b> {{campus of}} Northwestern University. Planned in 1915 and built from 1916 to 1929, <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first Shakespeare <b>Garden</b> in <b>the</b> United States. <b>The</b> <b>garden</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by landscape architect Jens Jensen and <b>was</b> constructed by <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> Club of Evanston, which still maintains the area.

5|$|The {{entrance}} gate from this palace, which was earlier {{the main gate}} and which has carved ornamentation, leads to the royal baths and then to an elegant small dwelling unit built within a garden in typical Mughal architectural style; this had been built exclusively for Rai Parveen, the female escort of the Raja Indrajit; her large-size portrait in a revealing and seductive attire adorns hall in this Mahal. She was a poet and musician. The building is a double storied structure built with bricks, rising to {{the height of the}} trees in the well tended garden called Anand Mahal. <b>The</b> <b>garden</b> <b>is</b> laid out with octagonal flower beds and has good network of water supply. There are niches in the Mahal which permit natural light to the main hall and smaller rooms.|$|E
5|$|Although a court roll of 1389 {{mentions}} two gardens, {{there is}} no record of where these were sited, nor is there any record of when the terraces were constructed. The basic layout as known today was certainly in place by about 1730, {{as can be seen in}} a portrait of the house from that period. Later in the 18th century, the space behind the great pilastered wall was infilled to make the top terrace, which has wide views across the valley to the Mendip Hills beyond. The Octagon, a garden pavilion, was built about the same time, as was the more rustic summer house which faces it down the long grassy walk of the Pretty Terrace. Further modifications involved facing the lower retaining wall with rosy pink bricks, which were also used to build a double flight of steps below the Octagon. <b>The</b> <b>garden</b> <b>is</b> still largely in its 18th-century form, though small ponds and fountains were added in the 19th century and the once open hillside behind is now thickly wooded. A single rose arbour remained from the Edwardian garden but was on the verge of collapse when it was replaced with a new one in 2009, marking 300 years of the Elton family's presence at Clevedon Court.|$|E
