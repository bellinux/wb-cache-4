5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is any real basis to them.|$|E

5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in {{whether there is a}} national security issue involved.|$|E

This article, therefore, offers a different approach to immigration justice. It presents a case against legitimate states having discretionary control over immigration by showing both how ethical limits on enforcement circumscribe the options legitimate states have in determining their immigration policy and how all immigrants (including undocumented immigrants) are entitled to certain protections against a state’s enforcement apparatus...|$|R

25|$|To {{generate}} {{an image of}} the cardiovascular system, including the arteries and veins (angiography) an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest. A second image is then taken of the same region after an iodinated contrast agent has been injected into the blood vessels within this area. These two images are then digitally subtracted, leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels. The radiologist or surgeon then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is any damage or blockage of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has found}} a genetic {{component}} in sleep paralysis. The characteristic fragmentation of REM sleep, hypnopompic, and hypnagogic hallucinations have a heritable component in other parasomnias, which lends credence {{to the idea that}} sleep paralysis is also genetic. Twin studies have shown that if one twin of a monozygotic pair experiences sleep paralysis that other twin is very likely to experience it as well. The identification of a genetic component means that there is some sort of disruption of function at the physiological level. Further studies must be conducted <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is a mistake in the signaling pathway for arousal as suggested by the first theory presented, or whether the regulation of melatonin or the neural populations themselves have been disrupted.|$|E

But this equivalence does not hold true for other types of drawing. For instance, although the crossing number of a graph (the minimum number of crossings in a drawing with arbitrarily curved edges) may be determined in NP, it is complete for the existential theory of the reals <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> exists a drawing achieving a given bound on the rectilinear crossing number (the minimum number of pairs of edges that cross in any drawing with edges drawn as straight line segments {{in the plane}}).|$|E
25|$|In the 1993 case of Kamal Jit Singh v.

Therefore, a court is entitled <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> are objective grounds for the Minister's satisfaction that a person {{has been associated with}} criminal activities and that his or her detention is necessary. On the other hand, it was held by the High Court in Re Wong Sin Yee that the judicial process is unsuitable for reaching decisions on questions of public safety, peace and good order. Therefore, the court will not quash the Minister's decision to detain a person unless it is so outrageous in its defiance of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the studies of canine personality, {{there has been some}} research <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> are breed differences in aggression. In a study published in 2008, aggression was divided into four categories: aggression directed at strangers, owner, strange dogs and rivalry with other household dogs. This study found that the Doberman Pinscher ranked relatively high on stranger-directed aggression, but extremely low on owner-directed aggression. The Doberman Pinscher ranked as average on dog-directed aggression and dog rivalry. Looking only at bites and attempted bites, Doberman Pinschers rank as far less aggressive towards humans, and show less aggression than many breeds without a reputation (e.g., Cocker Spaniel, Dalmatian, and Great Dane). This study concluded that aggression has a genetic basis, that the Doberman shows a distinctive pattern of aggression depending on the situation, and that contemporary Doberman Pinschers are not an aggressive breed overall. In regards to Dobermans attacking owners, it is rare and usually in the case of over discipline. Dobermans accept physical punishment to an extent. However, when they consider it to no longer be punishment, but an attack on themselves, they will defend themselves.|$|E
30|$|The reduced {{model with}} {{artificial}} spikes {{reveals that the}} external pulses push the reset point of the limit cycle to a higher place on the slow manifold than {{when there is no}} external pulse, effectively extending the interspike interval. To understand sparse entrainment, which requires studying both inputs and outputs, we utilized geometric singular perturbation theory on the E-I network model. We showed that the timing of the singular orbit crossing the branches of the fold is essential <b>to</b> <b>determining</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is entrainment in the system at its singular limit. The position of the fold is influenced by the maximal conductance of the M-current and therefore alters the spike order. The M-current also changes the bifurcation structure such that the system becomes bistable, which further increases the robustness of the system’s ability to be entrained to external pulses. Bifurcation analysis and numerical continuation show that increasing the maximal conductance of the M-current or the potassium current expands the bistability region significantly.|$|R

It is concluded, however, that there is a disconnect between how entrepreneurship in ASM has been interpreted and projected by proponents of the AMV on the one hand, and the form it has mostly taken in practice on the other hand. This gulf must be rapidly bridged if ASM is to have a transformative impact, economically, in the region...|$|R
