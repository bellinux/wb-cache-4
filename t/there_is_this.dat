25|$|Around 400 {{million years}} ago, a small {{continent}} long and narrow collided with proto North America. This created folding and faulting, as compression occurred. Then around 350 million years ago, the African plate collided with North America creating the folding and faulting in the Appalachians. But when the African plate {{pulled away from}} North America, an aborted rift valley was created. This half , starts east of Boonton and goes {{through the middle of}} Parsippany, south to Morristown, to the south end of Great Swamp. From Parsippany and the Boonton area the half graben goes east to the western side of Paterson, where there was another fault by the lava flows. East of the Ramapo Fault is where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> aborted rift valley.|$|E
25|$|A {{great many}} individuals, {{ever since the}} rise of the {{mathematical}} method, have, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I shall call each of these persons a paradoxer, and his system a paradox. I use the word in the old sense: a paradox is something which is apart from general opinion, either in subject matter, method, or conclusion. Many of the things brought forward would now be called crotchets, which is the nearest word we have to old paradox. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> difference, that by calling a thing a crotchet we mean to speak lightly of it; which was not the necessary sense of paradox. Thus in the 16th century many spoke of the earth's motion as the paradox of Copernicus and held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some I think who even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century the deprivation of meaning took place, in England at least.|$|E
25|$|There is no very {{definite}} {{statement as}} to the material which was in most common use {{for the purposes of}} writing {{at the start of the}} early writing systems. In all ages it has been customary to engrave on stone or metal, or other durable material, with the view of securing the permanency of the record; and accordingly, in the very commencement of the national history of Israel, it is read of the two tables of the law written in stone, and of a subsequent writing of the law on stone. In the latter case <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> peculiarity, that plaster (sic, lime or gypsum) was used along with stone, a combination of materials which is illustrated by comparison of the practice of the Egyptian engravers, who, having first carefully smoothed the stone, filled up the faulty places with gypsum or cement, in order to obtain a perfectly uniform surface on which to execute their engravings. Metals, such as stamped coins, are mentioned as a material of writing; they include lead, brass, and gold. To the engraving of gems there is reference also, such as with seals or signets.|$|E

25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E

Home and his followers claimed {{that some of the}} séances took place in [...] "light" [...] but this {{was nothing more than a}} few candles, or some glow from a fireplace or open window. Home would adjust the lighting to his needs with no objections from his séance sitters. For example, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> report from a witness: [...] "The room was very dark...

500|$|Inspired by Badu's {{creativity}} and their time listening to music, Chavarria added special effects and delays to the tracks by using and manipulating {{a variety of}} plug-ins and guitar pedals, subsequently reworking effects frequency and modulation parameters. Chavarria said {{they were able to}} expand on the producers' tracks rather than change them, because [...] "Erykah made this record to display to the world that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> whole group of producers out there who are outside of the mainstream making great music." [...] Badu said of the approach, [...] "I work in layers. The first layer is the track. The second layer is the songs. The third would be the musicians who add a certain nuance. And when they play, they play like they are a sample. Or we take a piece of what they played, and we sample and loop it." ...|$|E

She said, [...] "I think the way Steve [...] has played Brax, there is definitely enough there for Charlie {{to see that he}} has a heart and to see the good side in him as well." [...] Discussing the plot in which Charlie tried to keep Ruby away from Casey, Anderson said, [...] "I think she's also telling herself to stay away from Brax, but Charlie can't get him out of her head." [...] Colin Vickery of The Daily Telegraph said Darryl had turned Charlie's [...] "safe police world" [...] upside down, and Anderson told him, [...] "What is wonderful about this relationship is that it is forbidden love. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> element of danger that brings excitement along with it." [...] She described the relationship as [...] "fun and flirty" [...] and said it shows another layer to Charlie, as it has brought out her fun side. The arrival of Darryl's ex-girlfriend Tegan Callahan (Saskia Burmeister) causes Charlie and Darryl to split. However, Vickery said it was obvious that Charlie cannot stay away from Darryl for long.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} theodicy was {{expanded}} mainly {{with the thought}} of Weber and his addition of ethical considerations to the subject of religion. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> ethical part of religion, including [...] "(1) soteriology and (2) theodicy. These mean, respectively, how people understand themselves {{to be able to be}} in a correct relationship with supernatural powers, and how to explain evil – or why bad things seem to happen to those who seem to be good people". There is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class. [...] "Theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil.... In contrast, theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved." [...] Weber also writes that [...] "the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies, which emphasise that prosperity is a blessing of God... theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next." [...] Thus these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion.|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, Marvel {{announced}} that Alan Silvestri, who scored Captain America: The First Avenger, would write and compose the score for The Avengers. Silvestri said, [...] "I've worked on films where {{there have been}} a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together." [...] Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England. Whedon said, [...] "The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [...] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [...] school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love." ...|$|E

500|$|Clarke {{explores the}} limits of [...] "English" [...] magic through the {{characters}} of Stephen Black and Vinculus. As Clarke explains, [...] "If you put a fairy next {{to a person who}} is also outside English society...suddenly the fact that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> alien race seems more believable, because you've got another alien {{and the two of them}} can talk about the English in this very natural way." [...] The gentleman with the thistle-down hair sees Stephen as a noble savage and enslaves him—like Lady Pole, Stephen is silenced. Both [...] "suffer under a silencing spell that mimics gaps in the historical record". Furthermore, the gentleman's desire to acquire Stephen for his dancing hall is reminiscent of the English objectification of black slaves. Stephen vows to hate all white Englishmen after he discovers that they enslaved his mother, but when the gentleman shows him the hanging of the white Vinculus, he weeps. Both Strange and Norrell see the essence of Englishness in the Raven King, a character who was raised by fairies and could not speak English. As Elizabeth Hoiem explains, [...] "The most English of all Englishmen, then, is both king and slave, in many ways indistinguishable from Stephen Black. This paradox is what ultimately resolves the plot. When Strange and Norrell summon 'the nameless slave', the Raven King's powerful alliances with nature are transferred to Stephen Black, allowing Stephen to kill the Gentleman and free himself from slavery." [...] In the end, it is Strange and Norrell who are trapped in everlasting darkness while the silenced women, people of colour, and poor whites defeat the antagonist.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both sides accuse {{each other}} of using underhanded tactics {{to pack the}} {{commission}} with countries sympathetic to their position.

We in the Caribbean feel highly offended." [...] Moreover, there are no developing countries who support an anti-whaling stance. The BBC reported that [...] "Some countries recently admitted to the European Union have been advised by a [...] "word in the ear" [...] {{that it would be}} [...] "a good idea" [...] for them to join the IWC.

[...] In Australia, National Nine News reported that [...] "New Zealand is questioning pro-whaling support among Pacific Island states with the opposition calling for a rethink of foreign aid." [...] It is expected that more countries in the future will join IWC including some landlocked countries. Currently, there are 8 landlocked IWC members.
