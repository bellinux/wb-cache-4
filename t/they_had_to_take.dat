500|$|After Great Britain {{lost the}} American colonies, a second {{generation}} of Scottish intellectuals saved Britain from stagnation and reinforced a self-confidence that allowed the country to manage a world empire during the Victorian era. Scots in India, like James Mill, led the British idea of 'liberal' imperialism, that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over indigenous cultures and run their society for their own good, the white-nationalist euphemism [...] "the white man's burden".

500|$|Sophiatown, {{unlike other}} townships in South Africa, was a {{freehold}} township, {{which meant that}} it was one of the rare places in South African urban areas where blacks were allowed to own land. This was land that never belonged to the Johannesburg municipality, and so it never developed the form of municipal [...] "matchbox" [...] houses, built row upon row, with the same uniformity and lack of character. The houses were built according to people's ability to pay, tastes, and cultural background. Some houses were built of brick and had four or more rooms; some were much smaller. Others were built like homes in the rural areas; others still were single room shacks put together with corrugated iron and scrap sheet metal. The majority of the families living in Sophiatown were tenants and sub-tenants. [...] Eight or nine people lived in a single room and the houses hid backyards full of shanties built of cardboard and flattened kerosene cans, since many Black property owners in Sophiatown were poor. In order to pay back the mortgages on their properties, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> in paying tenants.|$|E

500|$|A dress {{rehearsal}} {{was held on}} May 2, two days before taping. Several NBC executives watched the rehearsal and were concerned that Monica did not care enough about Paul to sleep with him on their first date. NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer believed that the audience would perceive her as [...] "a slut". Crane, Kauffman and Warner Bros. executives disagreed, and surveyed the other people watching the rehearsal to support their position. Despite the audience agreeing with them, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> NBC's considerations into account in case they lost the commission; they rewrote Monica's lines to show that she cared about Paul. NBC also wanted a scene removed that implied the supposedly-impotent Paul was getting an erection, as it would violate network standards. Crane and Kauffman rewrote the scene and found they preferred the new version, as it made the scene [...] "smart and subtler". They sought to protect {{other parts of the}} script, some major and some minor; NBC wanted two of the pilot's three storylines downplayed to subplots, but the writers were adamant that all three should carry equal weight. They also favored not cutting the [...] "Mr. Potato Head" [...] line. Their final script draft was completed on May 3.|$|E
500|$|But {{there are}} other {{explanations}} for the missing rations. The inexperienced New Guinea Force staff assumed that the supplies they despatched would arrive, but this {{was far from the}} case with air dropping, the techniques for which had yet to be properly developed. Kienzle picked what he thought were good drop zones, but the air crews sometimes found them restricted or dangerous. The aircraft had to fly low over the drop zone, at about , and slow, at about [...] <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the wind into account, as it might cause parachuted packages to miss the drop zone. The load would be placed in the doorway, and three or four men would push it out when the pilot gave the signal. The pilot would fly level or with the nose slightly down, so that cargo would not hit the tail of the aircraft. The pilot would retract the landing gear if it was down, and climb to gain altitude. Multiple passes over the drop zone might be required. Heavy loads were not practical for air dropping missions, since the aircraft had to arrive low and slow over the drop zone, but higher speed was required for greater weight. Nor could an overloaded aircraft climb or dive quickly. The 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons were still based in Queensland and not at Port Moresby, so the aircrew were there on short rotations. Their learning process was therefore fitful and slow. Men from various Army and RAAF units assisted the aircrew in the task of pushing stores out of the aircraft.|$|E

Peel recalled, [...] "I {{was one of the}} first lot on Radio 1 and I think it was mainly because ...

2500|$|In 2004, Gasiorowski edited {{a book on}} {{the coup}} arguing that [...] "the climate of intense cold war rivalry between the superpowers, {{together}} with Iran's strategic vital location between the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf oil fields, led U.S. officials to believe that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> whatever steps were necessary to prevent Iran from falling into Soviet hands." [...] While [...] "these concerns seem vastly overblown today" [...] the pattern of [...] "the 1945–46 Azerbaijan crisis, the consolidation of Soviet control in Eastern Europe, the communist triumph in China, and the Korean War—and with the Red Scare at its height in the United States" [...] would not allow U.S. officials to risk allowing the Tudeh Party to gain power in Iran. Furthermore, [...] "U.S. officials believed that resolving the oil dispute was essential for restoring stability in Iran, and after March 1953 it appeared that the dispute could be resolved only at the expense either of Britain or of Mosaddeq." [...] He concludes [...] "it was geostrategic considerations, rather than a desire to destroy Mosaddeq's movement, to establish a dictatorship in Iran or to gain control over Iran's oil, that persuaded U.S. officials to undertake the coup." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{demotion}} from first-class cricket in 1886 had stung {{the pride}} of Somerset, and they were determined to regain first-class status. Plans were immediately put into action to turn things around, with a nineteen-year lease taken on their ground, and a declaration from club-secretary Henry Murray-Anderdon: [...] "There's only one way we'll do it, we must demonstrate that we are good enough." [...] Thirteen fixtures were arranged against a variety of first-class and other second-class counties. Their first match of the season was at Lord's Cricket Ground, against a Middlesex team {{that was part of}} the inaugural official County Championship. The Middlesex side, which contained four players with Test caps, dismissed Somerset for 133 in their first-innings, Nichols one of James Phillips' seven victims. Nichols' three wickets helped to limit the Londoners to 132, giving Somerset a first-innings lead, albeit by a single run. After a second-innings in which Somerset scored 208, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> all ten Middlesex wickets for less than 209 to secure the win.
