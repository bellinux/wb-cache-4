In this paper, we present an extension of these models, which seeks to cover all population and includes server allocation to the facilities. This new model is intended {{for the design of}} service networks, including health and EMS services, banking or distributed <b>ticket-selling</b> <b>services.</b> As opposed to the previous Maximal Covering model, the model presented here is a Set Covering formulation, which locates the least number of facilities and allocates the minimum number of servers (clerks, tellers, machines) to them, so to minimize queuing effects. For a better understanding, a first model is presented, in which the number of servers allocated to each facility is fixed. We then formulate a Location Set Covering model with a variable (optimal) number of servers per service center (or facility). A new heuristic, with good performance on a 55 -node network, is developed and tested...|$|E
