5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
500|$|On September 28, in a MSNBC Town Hall, Johnson {{was asked}} by Chris Matthews to name a world leader he respected, he tried to name Vicente Fox, a former President of Mexico, but could not {{remember}} his name. The following day, he tweeted, [...] "It's been almost 24 hours...and I still can't {{come up with a}} foreign leader I look up to." [...] Later in a CNN interview, he expanded upon his reluctance to endorse political leaders, [...] "I held {{a lot of people in}} this country on pedestals and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to meet them up front and personal and I find out that they're all about getting re-elected, that they're not about issues, a lot of empty suits that I held up on pedestals." ...|$|E
500|$|Darla {{is first}} {{killed in the}} seventh episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In that episode, it is {{revealed}} that Darla was once romantically involved with Angel and that she made him a vampire. Angel stakes her through the heart. Benz was asked {{to return to the}} role three years later, but not on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Joss Whedon wanted her to appear on the spin-off Angel, which focused on Angel's adventures in Los Angeles. Benz said in an interview: I was shocked, really. When they sent me the script [...] I kept asking, 'Where's Darla?' I remember calling my agent asking, 'Are you sure they want me for this episode because I can't seem to find me?' And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to the last page and there I am... naked in a box. Awesome. It was exciting.|$|E

Knowin' it's all {{up with me}} I deserted my post when I heard the Injuns choppin' on the fence where it was on fire last night. But I only--run--because--they're gettin' in." ...|$|R

500|$|Malone {{credited}} Howarth's versatility {{with the}} reason he was cast as Todd. [...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. All I knew was that my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> called to read another day." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Russian Roulette" [...] {{begins with}} a [...] "searing" [...] guitar solo that later {{transitions}} into a [...] "pulsing" [...] beat which stays constant {{until the end of}} the song. The single opens with the lyrics, [...] "Take a breath/ Take it deep/ Calm yourself/ He says to me/ If you play/ You play for keeps/ Take the gun/ And count to three." [...] The metaphor about the game of Russian roulette is also present in the chorus in which Rihanna sings, [...] "And you can see my heart beating/ You can see it through my chest/ I said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving/ I know that I must pass this test/ So just pull the trigger." [...] In the upcoming verse, the character that the singer portrays in the song it's scared that the man talking to her will always have a power over, [...] "Say a prayer to yourself/ He says close your eyes/ Sometimes it helps/ And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a scary thought/ That he's here means he's never lost." [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] ends with a sound of a gun shot, which according to Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club extends the drama accompanied by [...] "harrowing scenarios and tremulous vocals".|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{walked a}} step ahead of us, but when he noticed me hurrying to catch up, he {{shortened}} his stride to accommodate mine. I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware. Fannie called his attention to what I was doing, so he stopped short, bent low over me, his eyes wide and rows of brilliant teeth showing in a wide smile. When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, we continued walking in silence. [...] "Can I call you Uncle Billy?" [...] I asked. [...] "Why sure you can", he replied... "But <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to call you darlin.'" [...] It was a deal. From then on, whenever we walked together it was hand in hand, and I was always his [...] "darlin.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who knows {{but what}} I {{may go to}} work to-morrow, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> won't <b>get</b> much chance to look around," [...] he {{reasoned}} to himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I'm {{trying to}} do," [...] said Mr. Foss; [...] "my death o' cold. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> sha'n't <b>get</b> {{five years for}} bigamy," [...] he added bitterly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish they}} had some oars," [...] said Marco, [...] "and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> would <b>get</b> a crew of boys, and teach them to manage a boat man-o'-war fashion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I don't {{know any}} reason why I shouldn't, and now and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> the hack-saw and cut one or two across. When I go {{shooting}} it's a deer I want." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I hae a saxpence {{under my}} thumb, [...] <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> credit in ilka town; [...] But when I am puir they bid me gae by-- [...] Oh, poverty parts good company! [...] OLD SONG.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps so," [...] {{said the}} mother; [...] "but if they do, it will punish them {{for being so}} naughty. I always let them fight it out, {{because they are so}} sore {{for a day or two}} {{afterward}} that they have to keep quiet, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a little rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sam, one {{of these}} days you'll be stoppin' a high inshoot with your eye," [...] sagely remarked Daddy Howarth. [...] "An' <b>then</b> where'll <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a catcher for the Natchez game?" ...|$|R
50|$|If I cannot go to work, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> {{will not}} <b>get</b> paid.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I mean to come again," [...] {{continued}} Rollo, [...] "and {{bring my}} pressing book, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> as many specimens as I please. Wouldn't you, uncle George?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh,” {{she cried}} suddenly, “I remember—I was angry with you! I didn’t {{expect to see}} you. But I didn’t really mind about it at all. Every now and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> mad like that and work it off on any one that’s handy. But it’s over in three minutes and I never think of it again. I confess I was mad last night; I could have shot the old woman.” ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{undermining}} my moral character, {{this book}} is. It {{is responsible for}} at least ten per cent. of the bad language that I use every year. It leads me into drink and gambling. I am continually finding myself with some {{three or four hours}} to wait at dismal provincial railway stations. I read all the advertisements on both platforms, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> wild and reckless, and plunge into the railway hotel and play billiards with the landlord for threes of Scotch.|$|E
60|$|Mother, he is gone! Gone, {{and left}} no trace. The scent was cold when I came. To-day I am {{out of bed}} {{for the first time}} since. I wish I were not a boy; then I could stand shocks better. They all think he went west. I start to-night, in a wagon--two or three hours of that, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a train. I don't know where I'm going, but I must go; to try to keep still would be torture.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, if I do not wake up, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> {{will not}} <b>get</b> paid.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} to put up with you," [...] she replied coldly, [...] "until you see fit to go {{elsewhere}} and leave me in peace, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>get</b> along very well alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, Fred. I am {{not afraid}} of that crowd, and the more they talk the better I'll like it, for <b>then</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> some sort of line on what they are aiming at." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see I build my blind," [...] said he to Harry, [...] "and then I don't {{come here}} till I've {{sprinkled}} my corn {{for about a}} week, and got the turkeys used to comin' this way after it. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back o' that thar at night and wait till the airly mornin', when they're sartin to come gobblin' along, till I {{can get a good}} crack at 'em." [...] With this he sat down on a log, which Harry could scarcely see, so dark was it in the woods by this time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{never mind}} me," [...] said Miss Ruey, briskly. [...] "I've got the big Bible, and I can sing a hymn or two by myself. My voice ain't quite {{what it used}} to be, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a good deal of {{pleasure}} out of it." [...] Aunt Ruey, it must be known, had in her youth been one of the foremost leaders in the [...] "singers' seats," [...] and now was in the habit of speaking of herself much as a retired prima donna might, whose past successes were yet in the minds of her generation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, by chance. There {{were lots}} of places in construing, where I should have broken down if I had {{happened}} to be set on in them; {{it was only a}} wonder I did not in that chorus, for I had only looked at it twice; but Everard asked me nothing but what I knew; and now and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> into a funny state, when nothing is too hard for me, and that was how it was yesterday evening. Generally, I feel as dull as a post," [...] said Norman, yawning and stretching; [...] "I could not make a nonsense hexameter this minute, if I was to die for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{extraordinary}} what bad luck I have," [...] he said, one day. [...] "I almost always win {{at the beginning}} of the evening; and <b>then,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> thoroughly set, my winnings are swept away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Thank you, but I don’t wish to run {{the least}} risk. I will remain where I am till it <b>gets</b> dark; <b>I</b> can very well sleep the time away till <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> sha’n’t <b>get</b> much sleep to-night.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am not wearied of the world, for indeed, as you say, I {{know nothing}} of it. I am here by accident, as {{you were in the}} {{stoppage}} to-day. It will disperse, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>get</b> on.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Mouse dear, I'm so {{bored by}} everybody--every sort of everybody.... Of course I don't mean you; you're a good pal.... Oh--Paris is too complex--especially when you can't quite get the nasal vowels--and New York is too {{youthful}} and earnest; and Dos Puentes, California, will be plain hell.... And all my little parties--I start out on them happily, always, as naive as a kiddy {{going to a}} birthday party, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> there and find I can't even dance square dances, as the kiddy does, and go home--Oh damn it, damn it, damn it! Am I shocking you? Well, what do I care if I shock everybody!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] He resumed; [...] "it's {{too big a}} sacrifice! You {{like people}} about you and would see nobody but me and the hired man, while I admit I'm enough to jar a woman's nerves. Then think of the work; the manual work. You couldn't live as the bachelors live among dust and dirt, and it's a big {{undertaking}} to keep a homestead clean when you can't get proper help. Besides, there's the baking, cooking, and washing, while you have done nothing but superintend. I'd hate to see you worn and tired, and you know you're not so patient <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> slack if things go wrong, and if I slouched about, brooding, when I ought to be at work, it would make you worse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Barung the Sultan tear {{his clothes}} too, and say--'Run away, Fung,' and my half-wife, she tear {{her clothes and}} say nothing, but run like antelope. So they all run toward east, where great river is, and leave me alone. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> up and run too--toward west, for I know from Black Windows," [...] and he pointed to Higgs, [...] "when we shut up {{together}} in belly of god before he let down to lions, what all this game mean, and therefore not frightened. Well, I run, meeting no one in night, till I come to pass, run up it, and find guards, to whom I tell story, so they not kill me, but let me through, and at last I come here, quite safe, without Fung wife, thank God, and that end of tale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I've {{got about}} {{fourteen}} hundred pounds left. Two can live just as cheaply as one. That'll keep us till I'm qualified and have got through with my hospital appointments, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> an assistantship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, father, suppose I do {{not start}} until it <b>gets</b> dark, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> home without {{attracting}} notice. There I {{can put on}} a suit of my old clothes, and bring my uniform out in my valise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I'll do," [...] said Marco, [...] "and <b>then,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> home, I'll give {{some of them}} to my cousins. They will like them, because they came from Canada. But I can't put a great many into such a press." ...|$|R
