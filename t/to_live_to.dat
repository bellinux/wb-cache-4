5|$|Banksia paludosa {{subspecies}} paludosa is a slow-growing shrub which regenerates from bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} lignotuber. After fire, plants take around {{three years to}} flower significantly, but are flowering well by five years afterwards. Flowerhead numbers dwindle by fourteen years post bushfire. Plants are estimated <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>to</b> around 60 years of age. Seedlings also appear from seed dispersed after bushfire. All banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots {{in response to the}} nutrient-poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus).|$|E

5|$|There was {{initially}} confusion as various conflicting reports of Nhung's demise surfaced, one source telling journalists that Nhung {{lived in a}} cottage within the grounds of Minh's villa and shot himself outside his house.

Other reports at the time said that Nhung was found dead as a result of strangulation at the Joint General Staff headquarters. According to variations of this line, Nhung either hanged himself in custody or was murdered by an unknown hand.|$|E

5|$|When Taft {{became chief}} justice, {{the court did}} not have its own {{building}} and met in the Capitol. Its offices were cluttered and overcrowded, but Fuller and White had been opposed to proposals to move the court to its own building.

Cass Gilbert had prepared plans for the building, and was hired by the government as architect. Taft had hoped <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>to</b> see the court move into the new building, but it did not do so until 1935, after Taft's death.|$|E

ABC bought the show from Nixon in December 1974 when they purchased all stock to her Creative Horizons, Inc.
