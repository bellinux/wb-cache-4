5|$|On 2 June 2009, it was {{announced}} that the new album title would be In This Light and on <b>This</b> <b>Evening</b> and that they would be the first band to play at the new O2 Academy Birmingham. Through producer Flood's heavy usage of synthesisers, the album provided a synthpop/post-punk sound to Editors' production. Flood, who is famous for collaborating with electronic music influenced bands like U2, Depeche Mode, The Killers and Erasure, helped develop synthetic elements on the album, which resulted in a mixed reception from long-term fans as to the group's new direction.|$|E

Some people were casting da others {{composed}} poems.

The queen gave gift of robes and baby dresses to the highest ranked ladies; lined kimonos to those of 4th rank; and hakama to the lesser sixth ranked ladies.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Rink - A game of Hockey will {{be played}} at the Victoria Skating Rink <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> between two nines chose from among the members. Good fun may be expected, {{as some of the}} players are reputed to be {{exceedingly}} expert at the game. Some fears have been expressed on the part of intending spectators that accidents were likely to occur through the ball flying about in too lively a manner, to the imminent danger of lookers on, but we understand that the game {{will be played}} with a flat circular piece of wood, thus preventing all danger of its leaving the surface of the ice. Subscribers will be admitted on presentation of their tickets.|$|E

5|$|Since Deep Blue's {{victory over}} Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, IBM {{had been on}} the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the {{restaurant}} they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> hiatus: Ken Jennings, who was then {{in the middle of his}} successful 74-game run on Jeopardy!. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy! with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer. In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond. To compete successfully on Jeopardy!, Watson would need to respond in no more than a few seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.|$|E

500|$|Lead singer Smith {{announced}} that the band would explore a new direction on their next album, pursuing a new, rawer sound.

The band's third album, In This Light and on <b>This</b> <b>Evening,</b> {{was released in}} October 2009 and went straight to number 1 in the UK Album Chart.

500|$|The Marine Brigade commander, General Khang, {{appealed to}} the US Embassy in Saigon to not allow Khiêm to leave Washington. As a result of this, Taylor messaged the State Department: [...] "Regardless [...] what {{ultimate}} outcome may be we feel Khiêm's arrival here ... would only add tinder to what <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> appears to be very explosive situation with possibilities of internecine strife between armed forces units ... Urge he not [...] try return [...] Saigon until situation more clarified." [...] More generally, Westmoreland and Taylor by now decided it was imperative that Thảo and Phát fail, while Khánh should also be deposed by someone else amidst the chaos. Westmoreland gave orders to US officers who were advising South Vietnamese units to stop work if the unit was {{being used in the}} coup, and pretend to be neutral even though the American high command had already decided to intervene.|$|E

She also performed the song {{as part of the}} tour in Kiev, Ukraine, on October 20 and 21. The last date was held on October 24 in Abu Dhabi, at the Emirates Palace Hotel. On November 23, Aguilera promoted her greatest hits album by performing at the 36th Annual American Music Awards. She opened the show with a seven-minute medley including six of her greatest hits. The Los Angeles Times Todd Martens commented about the performance: [...] "Things get started in familiar territory, with an Aguilera medley, the first of what is sure to be many whiplash-inducing musical performances <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> But unlike her MTV VMA run-down, Aguilera backs into [...] "Genie in a Bottle" [...] rather than opening with it. [...] Opening with the ballad allowed Aguilera to flex her vocal muscles, but the zipping between songs never allowed her - or her background dancers - to catch a groove".|$|E

500|$|Some media sources {{proposed}} that the dress {{could be interpreted as}} anti-vegan. Vegetarian singer Morrissey stated that he felt the dress was acceptable {{as long as it was}} a social or political statement, and not just a [...] "loony idea", pointing out that artist Linder Sterling had previously worn a meat dress in 1982 to protest against what she believed to be the perception of women by men. Ellen DeGeneres presented Gaga with a bikini made of vegetables when the singer appeared on her talk show, and the singer used the platform to respond to the controversy surrounding the dress saying, [...] "... it has many interpretations. For me <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> if we don't stand up for what we believe in and if we don't fight for our rights pretty soon, we're going to have as much rights as the meat on our own bones. And, I am not a piece of meat." [...] She explained further that she was also using the dress to highlight her distaste for the US military's [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy.|$|E
500|$|The {{basis for}} Southey wishing {{to write an}} epic poem came from his private reading of {{literature}} while attending Westminster School as a boy. In particular, the subject was suggested by a school friend that {{claimed to be a}} descendant of Madoc's brother, Rhodri, and Southey began to write a prose version of the story in 1789. In 1794, the 20-year-old Southey was attempting to publish works to raise money to support himself and Samuel Taylor Coleridge in an expedition to America to establish a Pantisocracy, a democratic form of government that the two invented. One of the poems he sought to publish was Madoc, which was an epic that he started working on while at school but he never finished. Southey and Coleridge were able to complete the poem Joan of Arc by summer 1795 while Southey worked on Madoc. However, in his notebook he claimed on 22 February 1797. [...] "This morning I began the study of law, <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> I began Madoc." [...] During 1797, Southey had given up his ideas of Pantisocracy and was studying to become a lawyer. He spent the rest of his time working on other publications, such as a translating part of Jacques Necker's On the French Revolution. Southey continued to work on Madoc through 1798, and started his mornings by working on the poem.|$|E
