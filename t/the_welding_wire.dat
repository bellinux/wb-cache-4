There are advantages to both block types {{that must be addressed}} during design. Typically construction costs are lower for small blocks because they can be placed by hand rather than using equipment. Large blocks require less construction time but are usually more expensive to fabricate. Oldcastle is a precast company that has several modular block designs.

Through interpretation of the ICP-OES analytical data, an overview regarding the lubricant content of Na, K and Ca present on six wire surfaces could be made.

40|$|Fusion welding {{of steel}} {{pressure}} vessels provides {{one of the}} most economic methods for creating such structures. However, the highly localised heat distribution, at the fused region gives rise to non-uniform heating / expansion and cooling / contraction of the weld and the surrounding base material, consequently giving rise to residual stresses and distortion. Several techniques are available to minimize welding distortions and residual stresses [1]. One feasible and efficient mitigation technique, that alters the inherent residual stresses developed during welding, includes the use of low transformation start temperature welding wire [2 e 4]. By altering the filler material and metallurgical transformations developed at the fusion zone and heat affected zone, wielded regions at the weld line can give rise to compressive residual stresses [2]. Consequently by establishing the appropriate chemical composition of <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> <b>wire,</b> a significant reduction in welding distortions can be achieved. This study focuses on establishing the merits of using different filler materials to minimize welding residual stresses and distortion through a thermal-metallurgical-elasto-plastic numerical parametric study. Numerical modelling of butt welded structures using three different filler materials is considered and the applicability of using low transformation temperature welding wire is investigated. The predicted residual stresses and distortions give a significant advance in understanding and control of welding distortion in welded fabrications. The chemical composition of the filler material and ultimately fused zone composition, leading to reductions in residual stresses and distortions is identified...|$|E

However to ensure that this level of optimisation and quality can be maintained the focus of research has moved towards the occupational health and safety of the welder. Fume formation rates of welding consumables is one of the areas of interest. Copper has long been used in the production of welding wires firstly as a drawing aid but of late as a protective coating on carbon steel wires to improve the shelf life of the product and secondly to decrease the electrical contact resistance. Previous studies of the fume formation rate (FFR) have indicated that copper coated welding wires produce more fume than un-coppered wires. The copper content of welding wires is defined as a total value that will include the base metal copper content and the added copper in the coating. The initial investigation focussed on the determination of the FFR of a group of welding wires of known chemical composition welded using a fixed set of welding parameters. The wires were further characterised by determining the quality and appearance of their surface condition and the possible influence that this may have had on the FFR results. The tests confirmed that there was an increase in the FFR with the copper coated wires, however a large variation in results was observed. It was further noted that the un-coppered wires were very unstable during the welding process, indicating that the welding parameters may not have been optimised for these wires. To eliminate fluctuations caused by variations in the chemical composition and manufacturing process that may have influenced the FFR a group of wires were specifically manufactured for this investigation. These wires originated from the same base material and were manufactured following the same manufacturing route. The major difference was that the amount of copper deposited on two of the wires was accurately controlled to deliver two levels of total copper content. In addition to the control of the basic chemical composition of the wires, FFR testing was performed using an “auto-control” unit developed by the University of Wollongong to maintain optimum welding parameters. The results of this testing indicated that the increase in FFR for coppered wires varied from 18 % to 32 %. The second part of the investigation concentrated on finding an explanation for the increased FFR as a result of increased copper content in <b>the</b> <b>welding</b> <b>wire.</b> Several hypothesis were developed and tested and the most likely explanation for the increase in the FFR seemed {{to be related to the}} increase in the droplet temperature between a copper coated and uncoated welding wire. This increase in temperature would lead to a higher evaporation rate with a resultant increase in the FFR. The thesis explores possible reasons for an increase in temperature...|$|E
40|$|Nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloys are {{qualified}} for orthodontics {{due to their}} unique shape memory effect, low elastic modulus, excellent springback and superelasticity. Up to now, wires of this type could only be joined via clamp- or crimp-connection. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate <b>the</b> laser <b>welding</b> of NiTi-wires and their mechanical properties. Material and method: 8 products of 3 different manufacturers with different dimensions were joined by use of a Nd:YAG-Laser. Two wire segments of 2 cm length were welded along a 3 mm parallel overlapping area with varying power settings (220 - 235 V) and pulse duration (1, 5 - 3, 5 ms). Each 5 samples were <b>welded</b> using <b>the</b> same laser settings. The elastic qualities of <b>the</b> <b>welded</b> and unwelded specimens were examined at an ambient temperature of 37 degrees in the computer-controlled bending test FLEX. Results: 796 of the 800 tests could be successfully joined. Power settings < 230 V and pulse durations < 3, 5 ms turned out to be ideal regarding the joint-solidity. 571 of the samples broke during bending up to 80 °. Mostly the fracture was localized in the margin areas of <b>the</b> <b>weld.</b> Only groups with &# 61619; 4 of 5 samples remaining intact were examined in the following (n= 110) : The stress/strain curves of <b>the</b> <b>welded</b> <b>wires</b> showed a change of the mechanical properties in comparison to unwelded wires: The average torque, which is necessary to apply forces within the scope of an orthodontic treatment, increased. Stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>welded</b> <b>wires</b> escalated due to the doubled thickness of <b>the</b> <b>weld.</b> <b>The</b> forces ocurring during bending partially exceeded the limit, which is recommended for orthodontic treatment. This could cause unwanted side-effects like root resorption. Furthermore, the pseudo-elastic plateau, which is clinically useful due to the constant force effect, is significantly shortened. In summary the super-elastic behavior of laser-welded orthodontic NiTi wires is restricted with consecutive limitation of the potential therapeutical benefit. Most probably these effects are caused by local alterations of the alloy composition and the length of <b>the</b> <b>weld.</b> Conclusions: Laser welding of NiTi-wires is feasible but worsens mechanical properties. Alteration of the alloy and the length of <b>the</b> <b>weld</b> seem to be the most influencing factors. The presented results suggest the application of NiTi-welding to be suitable for orthodontics, but a definite recommendation can not yet been pronounced...|$|R
40|$|Solid electrode-wires, {{intended}} for MAG welding, {{are made of}} common and low-alloy constructional steels and are usually coated with a thin copper film whose role is to ensure good electrical contact in the contact tube (the current terminal), {{a low level of}} resistance to feed in the spiral of <b>the</b> MAG <b>welding</b> clamp, and a temporary anticorrosion protection. The present paper contains results of the investigations into the properties of film coatings on G 3 Sil-EN 440 solid wires. The assessment of the wire properties was based on the criteria established {{in the course of the}} experimentation.
