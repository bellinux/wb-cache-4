However, Spanish sparrows (Passer hispaniolensis, n = 128) and <b>trumpeter</b> <b>finches</b> (Bucanetes githagineus, n = 228), which inhabit the same steppe habitats associated with goat husbandry, did not have poxlike lesions. Histopathology and electron microscopy confirmed poxvirus in the lesions, whereas serology using standard, fowl poxvirus- and pigeon poxvirus-based diagnostic agar gel immunodiffusion techniques was negative, likely because of the limited (74. 6 % pipit; 74. 9 % lark) similarity between the viruses in our species and fowlpox virus on which the serologic tests rely. On the basis of polymerase chain reaction analyses, the virus isolated from dried lesions of C. rufescens has 80. 5 % similarity with the virus isolated from A. berthelotti and 91. 3 % similarity with canarypox, whereas A. berthelotti poxvirus has only 80 % similarity with canarypox. We have two distinct and possibly new avian poxviruses. Both poultry and the wild birds on the farms were heavily infested by fleas, which may have acted as vectors in transmission of poxvirus. Disease prevalence in these Canary Island passerines is higher than that described in song birds in Hawaii that are now threatened, endangered, or extinct. Environmental and biological factors contributing to increased disease susceptibility of these isolated populations must be investigated. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Phylogeographical {{studies are}} common in boreal and {{temperate}} species from the Palaearctic, but scarce in arid-adapted species. We used nuclear and mitochondrial markers to investigate phylogeography and to estimate chronology of colonization events of the <b>trumpeter</b> <b>finch</b> Bucanetes githagineus, an arid-adapted bird. We used 271 samples from 16 populations, {{most of which were}} fresh samples but including some museum specimens. Microsatellite data showed no clear grouping according to the sampling locations. Microsatellite and mitochondrial data showed the clearest differentiation between Maghreb and Canary Islands and between Maghreb and Western Sahara. Mitochondrial data suggest differentiation between different Maghreb populations and among Maghreb and Near East populations, between Iberian Peninsula and Canary Islands, as well as between Western Sahara and Maghreb. Our coalescence analyses indicate that the <b>trumpeter</b> <b>finch</b> colonized North Africa during the humid Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS 5) period of the Sahara region 125 000 years ago. We constructed an ecological niche model (ENM) to estimate the geographical distribution of climatically suitable habitats for the <b>trumpeter</b> <b>finch.</b> We tested whether changes in the species range in relation to glacial‚Äìinterglacial cycles could be responsible for observed patterns of genetic diversity and structure. Modelling results matched with those from genetic data as the species' potential range increases in interglacial scenarios (in the present climatic scenario and during MIS 5) and decreases in glacial climates (during the last glacial maximum, LGM, 21 000 years ago). Our results suggest that the <b>trumpeter</b> <b>finch</b> responded to Pleistocene climatic changes by expanding and contracting its range. R.

40|$|Reproductive {{performance}} in birds depends on several factors, {{one of the}} most important being the time of breeding. Birds try to fit offspring birth and growth to peak vegetative production in order to assure fledgling survival. In arid environments, where weather conditions are often extreme, birds must face unpredictable abiotic conditions. This study uses a border population of the <b>trumpeter</b> <b>finch</b> (Bucanetes githagineus) as a model to test whether climate variables (rainfall and temperature) influence breeding parameters by comparing 2 years with very different weather. The study was carried out in the Tabernas desert (southeastern Spain) in 2004 and 2005. A comparison of laying dates in the 2 years shows a 40 -day delay in the date of the first clutch in the coldest year (mean minimum temperature 3 C lower in 2005 than in 2004). However, once the breeding season started, the number of clutches, clutch size, duration of the incubation period, nestling phase, fledgling rates and productivity were similar. One likely explanation for this delay is that low temperatures did not allow the germination of Diplotaxis sp., a plant forming the bulk of the <b>trumpeter</b> <b>finch</b> diet during spring. Its absence could prevent onset of breeding, although other temperature-related factors could also be involved. Although rainfall has frequently been reported as a limiting factor for arid bird species, our 2 -year study shows that temperature can also influence the breeding biology of arid bird species, by affecting its timing. This work was supported by Spanish Ministry of Education and Science projects REN 2002 - 00169 and CGL 2005 - 01771 /BOS.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that in harsh environments seed contents, specifically water, and handling time will determine food preferences in an arid bird species, the <b>trumpeter</b> <b>finch.</b> Rape (69. 9 %) and canary (23. 9 %) were the most commonly consumed seeds. Mean handling time differed among the tested seed types. There existed a non-linear inverse relationship between mean handling time of different seeds and their selectiveness by individuals. Data estimated from five hypothetical diets and their respective nutritional intakes indicate that this arid land passerine selects a balanced diet optimizing energy and total water intake (energy and water gain per unit of time), rather than a diet that maximizes just energy intake. For birds inhabiting arid and semiarid habitats, food selection should be highly adaptive as selected food items must maximize energy intake rate, but also must contain or produce adequate water to satisfy metabolic requirements.

40|$|Methodology: Sampled 271 birds from 16 populations. Samples {{include both}} fresh and 142 museum samples. Fresh samples were {{obtained}} mainly by mist-netting, but also occasionally by 143 sampling a single chick from every nest. DNA was extracted {{with the standard}} phenol-chloroform method. Museum samples were extracted in a separate room using a fume hood with UV-light exposure prior to 147 the extraction. Seven microsatellite loci; Lox 1, Lox 2 and Lox 8 (Piertney et al. 1998), Ppi 2 (Mart√≠nez et 148 al. 1999), Pocc 6 (Bensch et al. 1997), Pdo 5 (Griffith et al. 1999) and Pk 12 (GenBank accession no. 149 AF 041466) were amplified using the procedure detailed in Barrientos et al. (2009 b). Microsatellites 150 were run on ABI 3730 and scored with GeneMapper v. 3. 7 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). 151 Part of the mitochondrial control region was amplified using primers TrfinchL 20 and 152 passeriformesH 830 which amplify most of 153 domains I and II of the control region. The museum samples were amplified {{in two or three}} fragments using primers TrfinchL 20 and TrfinchH 465, TrfinchL 410 and PasseriformesH 830, TrfinchL 20 and 155 TrfinchH 262, TrfinchL 208 and TrfinchH 465, TrfinchL 410 and TrfinchH 649 or TrfinchL 585 and 156 PasseriformesH 830. PCR was performed in 10 Œºl volumes 157 containing about 50 ng of template DNA (1 - 5 Œºl), 0. 5 ŒºM of each primer (0. 5 Œºl each), 0. 2 mM of each 158 dNTP (1 Œºl), 1 ŒºL of 10 x PCR buffer (2. 0 mM MgCl 2) and 0. 06 Œºl of DNA-polymerase (Biotools, 5 U/ 159 Œºl). The PCR protocol was 94 ¬∫C for 2 min followed by 37 cycles of 94 ¬∫C for 30 s, 50 ¬∫C for 45 s and 160 72 ¬∫C for 30 s with a final extension in 72 ¬∫C for 5 min. The Egyptian samples required a secondary PCR 161 using 1 ŒºL of the primary PCR product as template. Sequencing of the PCR-products was performed 162 with BigDye v. 3. 1 using primers TrfinchH 262, TrfinchH 465, TrfinchL 410, TrfinchL 585 or 163 PasseriformesH 830. Half of the museum samples were sequenced twice to check for consistency of the 164 sequences. Sequencing reactions were run on an ABI 3730. All sequences are available in GenBank 165 (accession numbers JX 452830 -JX 453004 and JX 453005 -JX 453016).
