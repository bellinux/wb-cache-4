40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} liability for past environmental contamination in the privatization processes of Central and Eastern Europe. The theoretical section establishes a link between a risk-averse investor’s amount of information regarding the extent of past environmental contamination (and its cleanup costs) and <b>the</b> <b>investor’s</b> willingness {{to pay for a}} particular enterprise, i. e., bid. As <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> obtains a more precise estimate of the uncertain cleanup costs, <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> faces less risk; therefore, <b>the</b> <b>investor’s</b> risk premium falls and <b>the</b> <b>investor’s</b> bid rises.

40|$|Abstract: The {{literature}} on venture financing mainly focuses on entrepreneurial moral hazard. <b>The</b> <b>investor,</b> however, may behave opportunistically, too. We {{look at the}} case where <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> demands a higher share on the venture’s return before financing the next stage. Possibly, the staging of capital is the most salient feature of venture financing. The entrepreneur {{may be forced to}} accept <b>the</b> <b>investor’s</b> offer, when she is supposed to lose something by changing <b>the</b> <b>investor.</b> For instance, if the property rights on the invention are not sufficiently protected − because the entrepreneur has not filed for a patent or the invention does not meet the legal requirements for patent protection − <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> may use <b>the</b> idea for his own purposes once the entrepreneur terminates the relationship. This threat may force the entrepreneur to continue although <b>the</b> <b>investor</b> demands a higher share. As a consequence, she sticks with <b>the</b> <b>investor,</b> however, she may not choose the efficient level of specific investments, rather she underinvests. The impact of patent law is important. In the law and economics literature patent law is primarily seen as an instrument balancing the trade-off between settin...|$|R
