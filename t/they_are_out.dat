5|$|The film {{begins with}} two {{unemployed}} parents obtaining employment {{in an upcoming}} theater production. Shortly after returning home, the landlady shows up and demands the rent, but can not collect. She gives them one week, but the theater production does not manifest and the parents again search for work. While <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out,</b> the landlady finds a tenant and puts the children out on the street. They end up dancing for an organ grinder and are saved by a theater manager who puts them on his vaudeville bill. The parents come into a fortune and are reunited by their children at the theater. The film was met with positive reviews and some criticism for its acting and scenario, but the industry had reasons to encourage the success of Edwin Thanhouser's company. A print of the film exists, {{but it was the}} subject of nitrate deterioration.|$|E
5|$|Dawn of Mana {{opens on}} the fictional island of Illusia, {{a place where}} the giant Mana Tree lies dormant. Much of the story takes place on Fa'Diel, a {{continent}} composed of the five nations of Jadd, Topple, Ishe, Wendell, and Lorimar. At the start of the game Ritzia, a Maiden in charge of tending to the Tree, and Keldric, her knight and the player-controlled character, have left their village to find Ritzia's missing pet. While <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out,</b> Illusia is attacked by King Stroud of Lorimar. The pair rush to the Tree of Mana, thinking that Stroud intends to attack the legendary beast that lies sleeping underneath its roots. While searching for the beast, Keldric finds a seed of the Tree, which attaches to his arm and can transform into a slingshot, a whip, or a sword. They also find Faye, a spirit child, who can cast magic and joins them. When they reach the center of the labyrinth of roots, Stroud's men catch up to them; they had been searching for Ritzia, not the beast. Stroud intends to open a portal to Mavolia, a land of darkness sealed away for centuries, and believes Ritzia is part of the key as a Maiden had been a part of opening the portal before. Stroud leaves with Ritzia to find the rest of the key, and Keldric and Faye chase after them.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament adds new modes: Leagues, Time Trials, Single Race, and Tournaments. In League mode, players {{compete for}} points in divisions. Seasons consist of four races. Players {{with the most}} points {{at the end of}} the season are {{promoted}} to the next division, and players with the least are relegated. Time Trial mode is where players race alone (although some tracks have a Shadow Racer representing the best time) for the best time, or to practise driving. Single Race is where players compete in a series of rounds in which vehicles begin at the centre of the scree, and get further apart as the race progresses. If a vehicle goes off the screen, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of the race unless they have travelled the furthest. The game ends when only one player remains. Tournaments are a fixed race series played in the same manner as Single Races. The winner is the first player to win a set number of times. There are two multiplayer-only modes: Knockout and Share Games. Knockout involves a series of races similar to tournament mode, with winners progressing to the next round and losers knocked out. Share Games is similar to Single Race, but cars are coloured according to team, with each team's finishing position depending on which member performs the best. The Mega Drive J-Cart provides two controller ports, enabling up to eight players in multiplayer by two players sharing the controllers. The Game Gear version retains the console sharing (two player sharing one console) function of the original, and two units can be linked.|$|E

Participants have their mail collected and regular exterior inspections conducted on their homes while <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of Kingston. Staff ensure doors are closed and locked, windows are closed and intact, snow is stomped down, and examine the premise for signs of break-in. The program typically reaches its capacity of 200 homes each year.|$|E

25|$|When {{they get}} to the lake, George pulls the car's choke to feign it is out of gas in order to hide the car in the woods. He acts visibly nervous when he rents a boat from a man who seems to deduce that George gave him a false name; the man's suspicions are aroused more when George asks him whether any other boaters are on the lake (none are). While <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> on the lake, Alice confesses her dreams about their happy future {{together}} with their child. As George apparently takes pity on her, and, judging from his attitude, decides not to carry out his murderous plan, Alice tries to stand up in the boat, causing it to capsize, and Alice drowns.|$|E
25|$|Porous bass trap {{absorbers}} {{need to be}} {{very thick}} to be effective at lower frequencies so they tend to be allocated either as diagonal wedges in the corners or as thick rectangular bulk behind false walls where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of the way and less likely to disrupt higher frequencies or room function. Air gap behind a porous panel absorber e.g. straddling a corner also helps to ensure it protrudes more into the room where there is more air velocity, improving its velocity-based absorption and extending its bandwidth while inducing some ripple in its absorption spectrum. Resonant bass trap absorbers need to be at a pressure maximum and tend to be thinner, so they are more conveniently and effectively positioned flat against a wall in a corner where the pressure is maximum, rather than straddling a corner where there is more velocity.|$|E

500|$|Aided by Gilmer's findings, Stan Love filed unsuccessfully for conservatorship on May 17, 1990. A {{press conference}} with Stan at the lectern {{featured}} an unexpected appearance from Brian. While {{reading from a}} piece of paper, Brian was given a microphone and said: [...] "I {{have heard of the}} charges made by Stan Love, and I think they are outrageous, which means <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of the ballpark... I feel great." [...] Audree, Carl, Carnie, and Wendy Wilson then contested Landy's control of Brian, pursuing legal action on May 7, 1991. The ruling was finalized on February 3, 1992 when Landy was barred by court order from contacting Brian, leaving his affairs to the hands of conservator Jerome S. Billet. In December 1992, Landy was fined $1,000 for violating the court order when he visited Brian in June for his birthday.|$|E
500|$|The poem centres on {{humanity}} and human nature. When the poet sees the figures, {{he wants to}} know their names and laments his ignorance. Eventually, he realizes that they are representative of Love, Ambition, and Poetry. While he longs, he fears <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of reach and therefore tries to reject them. He argues that love is what he needs least and dismisses it by questioning what [...] "love" [...] actually means ("What is Love? and where is it?"). He rejects ambition, but it requires more work ("And for that poor Ambition—it springs / From a man's little heart's short fever-fit;"). Unlike the personas of Love and Ambition, the narrator is unable to find a reason to banish Poesy (Poetry), which reflects the poets' inner conflict: should he abandon poetry to focus on a career in which he can earn a decent living? Keats's sought to write great poetry but feared his pursuit of literary prominence was based on a delusional view of his own merit as a poet. Further, he was incapable of completing his epic, [...] "Hyperion". As Walter Jackson Bate explains, to Keats [...] "Neither a finished 'grand Poem' nor even the semblance of a modest financial return seemed nearer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of {{the plane}} of the atoms, these orbitals can {{interact}} with each other freely, and become delocalized. This means that, instead of being tied to one atom of carbon, each electron is shared by all six in the ring. Thus, there are not enough electrons to form double bonds on all the carbon atoms, but the [...] "extra" [...] electrons strengthen all of the bonds on the ring equally. The resulting molecular orbital is considered to have π symmetry.|$|E
