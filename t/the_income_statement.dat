25|$|Despite the {{reported}} profit of €69.9 {{million in the}} year to December 2008, the Group's shareholders equity fell by over €220 million in the year, partly due to a €200 million distribution and other recognized losses that were not applied to <b>the</b> <b>Income</b> <b>Statement</b> but appeared directly in shareholders equity. Over the 3-year period to December 2008, the Group revalued upward its assets and investments by a net cumulative €306 million, which positively impacted shareholders equity. Over the same period it took a charge to equity of a net cumulative €312 million due to adverse exchange rate movements.|$|E
25|$|The bank, {{which had}} {{established}} a number of foreign subsidiary companies {{in the years after}} 1988, published its first consolidated financial statements for the 1995 business year. Over the two decades of this boom phase, its total assets increased from 530 million (end-1979) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (end-2000), reported total net income rose from CHF 2.9 million to 197 million, and the workforce more than sextupled from 86 to 563. The main book turnover (single-sided) of the parent bank alone surged from 6.7 to 77.3 billion Swiss francs between 1980 and 1989. Business for VP Bank Group flourished {{in the second half of}} the 1990s: total Group assets grew from 6.3 billion (1995) to 10.9 billion Swiss francs (2000) and gross income (revenues less operating expenses) from CHF 94 million to 254 million, whereas the commission and services business overtook the interest-differential business in 1997 as the major pillar of <b>the</b> <b>income</b> <b>statement.</b> In the years between 1996 and 2000, there was also a doubling of client assets under management from CHF 15 billion (end-1995) to 31 billion. Consolidated net income increased from 48 million (1995) to 197 million (2000) Swiss francs. As the significance of VP Bank Group’s foreign subsidiary companies grew, the proportion of investments attributable to them (assets held in non-CHF regions) increased as well, from 22 per cent (1996) to 40 per cent (2000) and ultimately to a high of 58.3 per cent at the end of 2005. As always, VP Bank placed those funds only with top-rated banks. The progressively internationalised bank redoubled its risk management efforts in the late 1990s and introduced an Asset and Liability Committee.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{vertical}} <b>income</b> <b>statement,</b> {{which is}} one of <b>the</b> main <b>income</b> <b>statements</b> of accounting, is accepted all across the world. Nevertheless, this vertical form is not compatible with the principles of the double-entry accounting system. The first usage of <b>the</b> vertical <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> came about {{in the second half of}} the 19 th century. The emergence of managerial accounting occurred at the same period. In the years of the First World War (1914 - 1918), banks were not only examining the balance sheets of risky customers before lending credits, they were also bringing to the fore, the relationship between profits and sales. As a result of this, vertical <b>income</b> <b>statements</b> started to be applied. In the beginning, <b>the</b> vertical <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> was based on an arrangement of sales to gross margin from the top to the bottom. This system developed during the 20 th century to give us its current form today. During this development period, <b>the</b> vertical <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> advanced alongside managerial accounting. This was because <b>the</b> vertical <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> system was compatible with financial analysis techniques. It was the 20 th century in which both managerial accounting and <b>the</b> vertical <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> finished their globalization of the world. Unfortunately, there has not been any discussion on the side-effects of this process to the principles of the double-entry accounting system...|$|R
2500|$|Further {{complicating the}} {{financial}} {{picture of the}} Group's financial statements {{is a collection of}} other related party transactions. In the year to December 2008, the Group reported an income of €150 million from the Quinn family and related entities, for services provided by the Group including: [...] "the identification of sites for acquisition and development, the negotiation of purchase price, the negotiation and arrangement of financing, the engagement of developers and related professional advisors and the ongoing monitoring of the projects through the construction phase." [...] For accounting purposes, these incomes, totaling €221 million in 2008, would have been included in <b>the</b> <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> that lead to the reported profit of €68.9 million in the year to December 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accounting}} treatment of CDS used for hedging may not parallel the economic effects and instead, increase volatility. [...] For example, GAAP generally require that CDS be {{reported on a}} mark to market basis. [...] In contrast, assets that are held for investment, such as a commercial loan or bonds, are reported at cost, unless a probable and significant loss is expected. Thus, hedging a commercial loan using a CDS can induce considerable volatility into <b>the</b> <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> and balance sheet as the CDS changes value over its life due to market conditions and due to the tendency for shorter dated CDS to sell at lower prices than longer dated CDS. One can try {{to account for the}} CDS as a hedge under FASB 133 but in practice that can prove very difficult unless the risky asset owned by the bank or corporation is exactly the same as the Reference Obligation used for the particular CDS that was bought.|$|E
2500|$|Off balance sheet: Derivative (finance) of {{many types}} {{have in the}} past been {{referred}} to as [...] "off-balance-sheet." [...] This term implies that the use of derivatives has no balance sheet impact. While there are differences among the various accounting standards internationally, there is a general trend towards the requirement to record derivatives at fair value on the balance sheet. There is also a generally accepted principle that, where derivatives are being used as a hedge against underlying assets or liabilities, accounting adjustments are required to ensure that the gain/loss on the hedged instrument is recognized in <b>the</b> <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> on a similar basis as the underlying assets and liabilities. Certain credit derivatives products, particularly Credit Default Swaps, now have more or less universally accepted market standard documentation. In the case of Credit Default Swaps, this documentation has been formulated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) who have for a long time provided documentation on how to treat such derivatives on balance sheets.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the availability of}} statistical data for international trade in banking services. Such data are required for WTO negotiations and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Following a discussion of areas of work for which data on international trade in banking services are required and of the outcome so far of international initiatives directed at the development of statistics for international trade in services, the availability of statistics relevant to the different GATS Modes of Supply of banking services of the GATS is reviewed. None of the currently available statistics under these headings provides a satisfactory measure of trade in banking services under Modes of Delivery 1 and 3 of the GATS. Thus the paper focuses on two other more promising categories of information, namely <b>the</b> <b>income</b> <b>statements</b> of banks, which depend on data already generated by private-sector entities, and data on trading in financial markets. In particular, the paper shows how information in <b>the</b> <b>income</b> <b>statements</b> can be approximately matched to the activities specified {{in the definition of}} financial services in the Annex on Financial Services of the GATS, exemplifying the argument with recent <b>income</b> <b>statements</b> of Jordanian banks. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{spectrum}} of approaches to managerial <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> assembling. In <b>the</b> preface, we explain <b>the</b> managerial <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> concept. We define it as a report processed for the needs of inter-business management, which intermediates various views on business results. In the next part, we devote to three basic approaches to managerial <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> structures recommended by the foreign literature. The first approach compares managerial <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> made up on the absorption calculation and on the variable calculation basis and different resulting effects on <b>the</b> trading <b>income.</b> <b>The</b> second approach presents <b>the</b> managerial <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> construction prepared for the budgeting needs and the needs to calculate the activity (sales volume) and consumption variances. In the third part, we describe managerial report structured according to the selected segments.
