After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included a sanctuary for cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E

5000|$|The Tale of Tom Kitten is a children's book, {{written and}} {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter. It was released by Frederick Warne & Co. in September 1907. The tale is about manners and how children react to them. Tabitha Twitchit, a cat, invites friends for tea. She washes and dresses her three <b>kittens</b> for <b>the</b> party, but within moments <b>the</b> <b>kittens</b> have soiled and lost their clothes while scampering about the garden. Tabitha is [...] "affronted". She sends <b>the</b> <b>kittens</b> to bed, and tells her friends <b>the</b> <b>kittens</b> have <b>the</b> measles.

40|$|The postmortem {{findings}} in 274 <b>kittens</b> were reviewed. <b>The</b> <b>kittens</b> were grouped by age at death: perinatal (&# 60; one day), neonatal (one to 14 days), preweaning (15 to 34 days) and postweaning (35 to 112 days); 203 (74 per cent) of <b>the</b> <b>kittens</b> were postweaning and 38 (14 per cent) were preweaning. Infectious disease was identified in 55 per cent of <b>the</b> <b>kittens,</b> and 71 per {{cent of the}} infectious disease was viral and detected significantly more frequently in rescue shelter kittens than in kittens from private homes. Twenty-five per cent of all kitten mortality was due to feline parvovirus (FPV). During the neonatal and preweaning periods, the main viral infections were feline herpesvirus and calicivirus. Feline infectious peritonitis caused the death of 17 <b>kittens</b> in <b>the</b> postweaning period. <b>The</b> rescue shelter <b>kittens</b> were significantly younger than <b>the</b> <b>kittens</b> from private homes (median survival 49 and 56 days) {{and were more likely}} to have FPV. <b>The</b> non-pedigree <b>kittens</b> were significantly younger than <b>the</b> pedigree <b>kittens</b> (42 v 56 days), and <b>the</b> pedigree <b>kittens</b> were significantly less likely to originate from rescue shelters. There was no significant difference between the age distribution of the male and female kittens. No diagnosis could be found in 33 per cent of <b>the</b> <b>kittens,</b> and this failure was correlated significantly with the submission of tissue samples as opposed to the whole carcase...|$|R
25|$|Amongst {{the changes}} that Vigo made to the {{original}} script was replacing Père Jules’ pet dog with over ten alley cats supplied by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Vigo’s father had been fond of such cats and Vigo’s childhood homes were often overrun with stray cats. During the scenes where Père Jules plays his phonograph, the cats would become immediately fascinated by the phonograph and surround it whenever it played music. Vigo quickly assembled his crew and shot footage of the cats listening to the music and sleeping inside the loud speaker. Simon later adopted <b>the</b> <b>kitten</b> that rested inside the phonograph horn. Vigo also visited local flea markets in Saint-Ouen and the scrap metal market on Boulevard Richard-Lenoir to find props for Père Jules’ collection of artifacts from around the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{subjects}} of later paintings impersonating Circe {{have a history}} of sexual experience behind them, starting with “Mary Spencer in the character of Circe” by William Caddick, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780. The subject here was the mistress of the painter George Stubbs. A portrait of “Mrs Nesbitt as Circe” by Joshua Reynolds followed in 1781. Though this lady’s past was ambiguous, she had connections with those in power and was used by the Government as a secret agent. In the painting she is seated sideways, wearing a white, loose-fitting dress, with a wand in her right hand and a gilded goblet near her left. A monkey is crouching above her in the branches of a tree and a panther fraternizes with <b>the</b> <b>kitten</b> on her knee. While the painting undoubtedly alludes to her reputation, it also places itself within the tradition of dressing up in character.|$|E
25|$|A crowd mills {{about before}} the Cathedral of the Intercession (the Temple of Vasiliy the Blessed) in Red Square. Many are beggars, and policemen {{occasionally}} appear. A {{group of men}} enters, discussing the anathema the deacon had declared on Grishka (Grigoriy) Otrepyev in the mass. They identify Grishka as the Tsarevich. With growing excitement they sing of the advance of his forces to Kromï, of his intent to retake his father's throne, and of the defeat he will deal to the Godunovs. A yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a nonsensical song ("The moon is flying, <b>the</b> <b>kitten</b> is crying"). The urchins greet him and rap on his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Boris and his retinue exit the Cathedral. The boyars distribute alms. In a powerful chorus ("Benefactor father... Give us bread!"), the hungry people beg for bread. As the chorus subsides, the yuródivïy's cries are heard. Boris asks why he cries. The yuródivïy reports the theft of his kopek and asks Boris to order the boys' slaughter, {{just as he did}} {{in the case of the}} Tsarevich. Shuysky wants the yuródivïy seized, but Boris instead asks for the holy man's prayers. As Boris exits, the yuródivïy declares that the Mother of God will not allow him to pray for Tsar Herod (see Massacre of the Innocents). The yuródivïy then sings his lament ("Flow, flow, bitter tears!") about the fate of Russia.|$|E

The crowd taunts him, then bows in mock homage ("Not a falcon flying in the heavens"). The yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a nonsensical song ("The moon is flying, <b>the</b> <b>kitten</b> is crying"). The urchins greet him and rap on his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Varlaam and Misail are heard in the distance singing of the crimes of Boris and his henchmen ("The sun and moon have gone dark"). They enter. The crowd gets worked up to a frenzy ("Our bold daring has broken free, gone on a rampage") denouncing Boris. Two Jesuits are heard in the distance chanting in Latin ("Domine, Domine, salvum fac"), praying that God will save Dmitriy. They enter. At the instigation of Varlaam and Misail, the vagabonds prepare to hang the Jesuits, who appeal to the Holy Virgin for aid. Processional music heralds the arrival of Dmitriy and his forces. Varlaam and Misail glorify him ("Glory to thee, Tsarevich!") along with the crowd. The Pretender calls those persecuted by Godunov to his side. He frees Khrushchov, and calls on all to march on Moscow. All exeunt except the yuródivïy, who sings a plaintive song ("Flow, flow, bitter tears!") of {{the arrival of the}} enemy and of woe to Russia.|$|E
500|$|Potter was at Hill Top in July 1906 {{during the}} {{development}} of Miss Moppet, and <b>the</b> <b>kitten</b> she borrowed as a model from a mason from Windermere was a difficult subject. [...] "n exasperating model," [...] Potter wrote, [...] "I have borrowed a Kitten and I am rather glad of the opportunity of working at the drawings.

[...] Biographer Linda Lear explains that [...] "pickle" [...] was a word Potter used to describe [...] "free-thinking exuberant people, like her cousin Caroline, or mischievous kittens and small children." [...] Potter used the same drawings of <b>the</b> <b>kitten</b> {{as a model for}} her next book, The Tale of Tom Kitten, which she dedicated in 1907 [...] "to all Pickles—especially those that get upon my garden wall".

25|$|Kittens {{are born}} blind and helpless, and {{are covered in}} a fuzzy coat. At birth, <b>the</b> <b>kittens</b> weigh 65-163grams, though kittens under 90grams usually do not survive. They are born with pink paw pads, which blacken {{at the age of}} three months, and blue eyes, which turn amber after five months. Their eyes open after 9–12 days, and their incisors erupt after 14–30 days. The kittens' milk teeth are {{replaced}} by their permanent dentition at the age of 160–240 days. <b>The</b> <b>kittens</b> start hunting with their mother at the age of 60 days, and will start moving independently after 140–150 days. Lactation lasts 3–4 months, though <b>the</b> <b>kittens</b> will eat meat as early as 1.5 months of age. Sexual maturity is attained at the age of 300 days. Similarly to the housecat, the physical development of African wildcat <b>kittens</b> over <b>the</b> first two weeks of their lives is much faster than that of European wildcats. <b>The</b> <b>kittens</b> are largely fully grown by 10 months, though skeletal growth continues for over 18–19 months. The family dissolves after roughly five months, and <b>the</b> <b>kittens</b> disperse to establish their own territories. The species' maximum life span is 21 years, though it usually only lives up to 13–14 years.|$|R

500|$|In {{her essay}} [...] "Thoroughly Post-Victorian, Pre-Modern Beatrix" [...] {{professor}} of English Katherine Chandler {{points out that}} Potter, unlike most Victorian writers of children's books, wrote original stories based on the realism of animal behaviour. Chandler notes that Potter avoids moralizing in her tales, making Miss Moppet {{nothing more than a}} story describing the natural behaviour of kittens. Potter's anthropomorphized animals are in fact slightly naughty, yet in their naughtiness the punishment is never the moral of the tale. At the end of Miss Moppet, <b>the</b> <b>kitten</b> is not punished and the mouse dances on the cupboard. This leads Chandler to quote literary scholar of modernism Humphrey Carpenter, [...] "there is nothing in [...] work that resembles the moral tale. In fact if might be argued that she is writing something pretty close to a series of immoral tales". In addition Chandler notes that Potter's economic use of prose presages modernism, comparing her writing to that of Ernest Hemingway.|$|E

Seeking his support, Mrs. Gage arrives at his house and is shown in by her granddaughter, Marie. The son welcomes his mother, but his wife strongly objects to having her mother-in-law take up residence in the house. Shown to her room by Marie, Mrs. Gage makes herself comfortable and gives Marie a kitten. [...] "Granny" [...] quickly becomes friends with little Marie. The wife struggles with Granny's presence, but her patience is tested when Granny knocks over a vase, and in recoiling, knocks over a sewing box. The mother delivers an ultimatum to her husband, [...] "Either your mother or I must leave this house!" [...] Though not shown, the husband decides that his mother is to go. In the next scene, the wife appears and informs her that she must leave. Marie assists her grandmother before her departure to the old folks' home with her son. She is upset that her grandmother was made to leave because she was [...] "only in the way" [...] and that as a cripple, she is no different. Marie writes a letter explaining that she has gone to live with grandma and departs to the old folks' home.
