5|$|After {{consecutive}} retirements in {{the previous}} three races which included first lap collisions in Austria and Germany, Michael Schumacher said that his objective in Hungary was to avoid any incidents on the first lap and to finish in a points-scoring position. He was also confident that Ferrari would perform well at the circuit. Barrichello revealed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>received</b> backing from Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo to challenge for more victories and the championship despite the latter's comments to the press about Barrichello assisting Michael Schumacher's title aspirations.|$|E
5|$|After denying rumors for decades, in 2004 McElhenny {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>received</b> improper {{financial benefits}} from the University of Washington during his time there, which included a $300 monthly check. Per NCAA rules, the most a college can offer an athlete is a summer job and a scholarship covering boarding and tuition. A popular (albeit usually jocular) spin on the rumor was that McElhenny essentially took a pay cut {{when he left the}} university to play for the 49ers. This was not entirely untrue; all payments accounted for, including legitimate ones, McElhenny claimed he and his wife received a combined $10,000 a year while at Washington—with the 49ers, his rookie salary was worth $7,000.|$|E

Clark served as the first chairman of the Clarksville, Indiana, board of trustees. Clark was unable to retain title to his landholdings. At the end of his life, he was poor, in ill health, and frequently intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|Eardwulf {{was evidently}} married {{before he became}} king, as Alcuin reproached him for abandoning his wife for a {{concubine}} soon after his coronation. This strained relations with the new Archbishop Eanbald II—Eanbald I {{had died in the}} year of Eardwulf's coronation. Alcuin, while condemning secular oppression of the church, affected surprise that while the Archbishop Eanbald was travelling he was accompanied by a large retinue, including soldiers, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>received</b> and protected the king's enemies. Eanbald was presumably in conflict with Eardwulf over property, but it is likely that he also supported rivals for Eardwulf's throne.|$|E

It was not until 20 years later <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>received</b> his first political appointment, the ambassadorship to the Kingdom of Spain.

5|$|Roderigo (or Rodrigo) Lopez {{was born}} into a family of Jewish origin in Portugal around 1517. His father, António Lopes, was {{physician}} to King John III of Portugal, and had been baptised into the Roman Catholic Church under coercion in 1497. Lopez was baptised and raised in the Catholic faith as a converso or New Christian, and educated at the University of Coimbra. He received a BA degree under the name Ruy Lopes on 7 February 1540, then an MA on 4 December 1541; he enrolled for a medical course on 23 December that year. Records do not survive regarding his doctorate, but according to his biographer Edgar Samuel it is probable <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>received</b> it in 1544.|$|E

5|$|Stephen {{was hoping}} to gain support from the West, and more {{specifically}} from the Pope. However, the help <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>received</b> was modest in numbers. The Hungarian Kingdom sent 1,800 Hungarians, while Poland sent 2,000 horsemen. Stephen recruited 5,000 Székely soldiers. The Moldavian army consisted of twenty cannon; light cavalry (Călăraşi); elite, heavy cavalry – named Viteji, Curteni, and Boyars – and professional foot soldiers. The army reached a strength of up to 40,000, of whom 10,000 to 15,000 comprised the standing army. The remainder consisted of 30,000 peasants armed with maces, bows, and other home-made weapons. They were recruited into Oastea Mare (the Great Army), into which all able-bodied free men {{over the age of}} 14 were conscripted.|$|E
5|$|The defense case {{commenced}} on March 25. The third {{count of}} the indictment was quashed as duplicative with the first. Burton testified that he had accepted Rialto's employment due to personal financial reversals. Burton testified that his duties would include acting as a criminal defense attorney for Dennis, but would not include any activity in Washington. Burton testified <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>received</b> notice of his appointment from Harlan on November 20, 1902, {{and that he had}} only contacted the Post Office to notify them of his intent to defend Dennis in a criminal case. He explained that he only asked to be notified of complaints against Rialto so that he could terminate his association with them should any arise.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{that of his}} contemporary, the Finn Jean Sibelius, Nielsen's {{reputation}} abroad did {{not start}} to evolve until after World War II. For some time, international interest was largely directed towards his symphonies while his other works, many of them highly popular in Denmark, have only recently started {{to become part of}} the world repertoire. Even in Denmark, many of his compositions failed to impress. It was only in 1897 after the first performance of Hymnus amoris <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>received</b> support from the critics, to be substantially reinforced in 1906 by their enthusiastic reception of Masquerade.|$|E

Van der Sloot reportedly receives fan mail from around the world, though mostly from women residing in the United States and the Netherlands.

5|$|According to {{government}} surveyor Thomas Corby, Newton's parakeet {{may still have}} been fairly common in 1843. Slater reported that he saw a single specimen in southwestern Rodrigues during his three-month stay to observe the 1874 Transit of Venus, and assistant colonial secretary William J. Caldwell saw several specimens in 1875 during his own three-month visit. The male <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>received</b> in 1875 and gave to Newton is the last recorded member of the species. A series of cyclones struck the following year and may have devastated the remaining population. Further severe storms hit in 1878 and 1886, and since few forested areas were left by this time, there was little cover to protect any remaining birds. The male could, therefore, {{have been the last}} of the species alive.|$|E
