5|$|Baleen whales {{use their}} baleen plates <b>to</b> <b>sieve</b> plankton, among others, {{out of the}} water; {{there are two types}} of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself by inflating their mouth. This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.|$|E

2500|$|The {{extremely}} long necks of [...] "plesiosauromorphs" [...] {{have caused}} speculation {{as to their}} function from the very moment their special build became apparent. Conybeare had offered three possible explanations. The neck could have served to intercept fast-moving fish in a pursuit. Alternatively, plesiosaurs could have rested on the sea bottom, while the head was sent out to search for prey, {{which seemed to be}} confirmed by the fact the eyes were directed relatively upwards. Finally, Conybeare suggested the possibility that plesiosaurs swam on the surface, letting their necks plunge downwards to seek food at lower levels. All these interpretations assumed that the neck was very flexible. The modern insight that the neck was, in fact, rather rigid, with limited vertical movement, has necessitated new explanations. One hypothesis is that the length of the neck made it possible to surprise schools of fish, the head arriving before the sight or pressure wave of the trunk could alert them. [...] "Plesiosauromorphs" [...] hunted visually, as shown by their large eyes, and perhaps employed a directional sense of olfaction. Hard and soft-bodied cephalopods probably formed part of their diet. Their jaws were probably strong enough to bite through the hard shells of this prey type. Fossil specimens have been found with cephalopod shells still in their stomach. The bony fish (Osteichthyes), which further diversified during the Jurassic, were likely prey as well. A very different hypothesis claims that [...] "plesiosauromorphs" [...] were bottom feeders. The stiff necks would have been used to plough the sea bottom, eating the benthos. This would have been proven by long furrows present in ancients seabeds. Such a lifestyle has in 2017 been suggested for Morturneria. [...] "Plesiosauromorphs" [...] were not well adapted to catching large fast-moving prey, as their long necks, though seemingly streamlined, caused enormous skin friction. Sankar Chatterjee suggested in 1989 that some Cryptocleididae were suspension feeders, filtering plankton. Aristonectes e.g. had hundreds of teeth, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>sieve</b> small Crustacea from the water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The area of lattice-based {{cryptography}} {{is growing}} ever-more prominent as a paradigm for quantum-resistant cryptography. One {{of the most}} important hard problem underpinning the security of lattice-based cryptosystems is the shortest vector problem (SVP). At present, two approaches dominate methods for solving instances of this problem in practice: enumeration and sieving. In 2010, Micciancio and Voulgaris presented a heuristic member of the sieving family, known as GaussSieve, demonstrating it to be comparable to enumeration methods in practice. With contemporary lattice-based cryptographic proposals relying largely on the hardness of solving the shortest and closest vector problems in ideal lattices, examining possible improvements <b>to</b> <b>sieving</b> algorithms becomes highly pertinent since, at present, only sieving algorithms have been successfully adapted to solve such instances more efficiently than in the random lattice case. In this paper, we propose a number of heuristic improvements to GaussSieve, which can also be applied <b>to</b> other <b>sieving</b> algorithms for SVP. ...|$|R
