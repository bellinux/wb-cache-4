5|$|A Scottish crest badge is a heraldic badge worn to show {{allegiance}} {{to an individual}} or membership in a specific Scottish clan. Crest badges are commonly called clan crests, {{but this is a}} misnomer; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> thing as a collective clan crest, just as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> thing as a clan coat of arms.|$|E

5|$|In {{the table}} above, genitive pronouns all end with -gin, which is {{separated}} orthographically by a hyphen that normally divides morphemes. The -gin form {{here is not}} a separate morpheme and cannot be lexically segmented; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> word as nganing that would be formed by removing -gin from nganing-gin 'my/mine'. The fact that the genitive forms have regular endings across the entire pronoun paradigm {{may have been a}} historical accident.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces {{can be attributed to the}} presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies, and thus that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen {{species of}} fleas in the genera Ceratophyllus and Dasypsyllus {{have been found}} on this bunting, and {{internal}} parasites include Ascaridia galli. The yellowhammer may carry haematozoan blood parasites such as Haemoproteus coatneyi. Males with high parasite levels produced fewer offspring (<b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> effect for females), and {{tend to be less}} brightly coloured. The striking plumage of the male may therefore have arisen as a signal of fitness to breed. Yellowhammers infected with Haemoproteus may have lower winter survival rates due to a tendency to having shorter wings.|$|E

5|$|The {{aspect of}} the {{colouring}} which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. The painting of the Libyan Sibyl and the Prophet Daniel, which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, {{can be found at}} various places on the ceiling, including the hose of the young man in the Mathan lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.|$|E
5|$|Aggrieved {{persons who}} cannot avail {{themselves}} of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to argue {{that they are a}} member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; it does not require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike. Consequently, a law that differentiates between classes of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.|$|E
5|$|Manuscripts 1eap and 1rK Erasmus {{borrowed}} from Johannes Reuchlin. The {{rest of the}} manuscripts he {{borrowed from}} Dominicans. It is significant {{that he did not}} use the Codex Basilensis, which was held at the Basel University Library, and was available for him. Erasmus had three manuscripts of the Gospels and Acts, four manuscripts of the Pauline epistles, but only one manuscript with the Book of Revelation. In every book of the New Testament he compared three or four manuscripts, except the last book, Book of Revelation. Unfortunately, this manuscript was not complete, it lacked the final leaf, which contained the last six verses of the book. Instead of delaying the publication, on account of the search for another manuscript, he decided to translate the missing verses from the Latin Vulgate into Greek. He used an inferior manuscript of Vulgate with textual variant libro vitae (book of life) instead ligno vitae (tree of life) in Rev 22:19. Even {{in other parts of the}} Book of Revelation and other books of the New Testament Erasmus occasionally introduced self-created Greek text material taken from the Vulgate. F. H. A. Scrivener remarked, that in Rev 17:4 he created a new Greek word: ἀκαθαρτητος (instead τὰ ἀκάθαρτα). <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>such</b> word in Greek language as ακαθαρτητος. In Rev 17:8 he used καιπερ εστιν (and yet is) instead of και παρεσται (and shall come). In Acts 9:6 the question that Paul asks at the time of his conversion on the Damascus road, Τρέμων τε καὶ θαμβὣν εἲπεν κύριε τί μέ θέλεις ποιῆσαι ("And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do?") was incorporated from the Vulgate.|$|E
