40|$|Abstract. Let A and B be strings with lengths m and n, respectively, over {{a finite}} integer alphabet. Two classic string mathing {{problems}} are computing the edit distance between A and B, {{and searching for}} approximate occurrences of A inside B. We consider the classic Levenshtein distance, but the discussion is applicable also to indel distance. A relatively new variant [8] of string matching, motivated initially {{by the nature of}} string matching in music, is to allow <b>transposition</b> invariance <b>for</b> A. This means allowing A to be “shifted ” by adding some fixed integer t to the values of all its characters: the underlying string matching task must then consider all possible values of t. Mäkinen et al. [12, 13] have recently proposed O(mn log log m) and O(dn log log m) algorithms <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> invariant edit distance computation, where d is the transposition invariant distance between A and B, and an O(mn log log m) algorithm <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> invariant approximate string matching. In this paper we first propose a scheme to construct transposition invariant algorithms that depend on d or k. Then we proceed to give an O(n + d 3) algorithm <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> invariant edit distance, and an O(k 2 n) algorithm <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> invariant approximate string matching. ...|$|R

40|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of the venous redirection (Mustard or Senning) operation <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> {{of the great}} arteries is cardiac arrhythmia. Drug treatment of tachyarrhythmia often worsens bradyarrhythmia. Pacemakers can now treat both arrhythmias. The technique for implantation of pacemakers after redirection <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> has changed over time from thoracotomy to subxiphoid to transvenous. Atrial pacing is almost always the mode of choice since the electrophysiologic abnormality is sinus node dysfunction with intact atrioventricular conduction. Twenty-nine patients aged 3 to 19 years (mean 9. 6) had implantation of a pacemaker a mean of 5. 5 years (range 1 to 14) after undergoing the Mustard operation <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> of the great arteries. Symptoms referable to bradycardia were eliminated in each case. Four patients who received an antitachycardia pacemaker no longer have symptomatic tachycardia. Four patients have required reoperation, three because of lead problems and one because of traumatic erosion of the pacemaker.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{main cause}} of {{long-term}} morbidity and mortality after a successful arterial switch operation <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> of the great arteries is complications at the ostial segments, proximal segments, {{or both of the}} retransferred coronary arteries. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the clinical usefulness of multislice computed tomographic angiography in detecting ostial and proximal coronary lesions in children having undergone the arterial switch operation <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> of the great arteries. METHODS: Forty-nine children (aged 8. 5 +/- 3. 9 years) operated on <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> of the great arteries with the arterial switch operation (follow-up, 8. 3 +/- 3. 6 years) underwent systematic selective conventional and multislice computed tomographic angiography. The ability of multislice computed tomography in detecting stenosis and other modifications of the coronary arteries' course was analyzed by 2 independent investigators. RESULTS: Multislice computed tomography, as compared with selective conventional coronary angiography, permitted assessment of ostial and proximal coronary segments in every patient. It correctly detected the 4 (8. 1 %) patients with significant coronary lesions (1 with ostial and 3 with proximal coronary stenosis) that had been identified by means of conventional angiography. Multislice computed tomography clearly showed an abnormal course of the coronary artery between the great arteries with compression of the ostial (1 patient) and proximal (3 patients) segments of the retransferred coronary arteries. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that multislice computed tomographic angiography is fully accurate in detecting ostial coronary artery stenoses, proximal coronary artery stenoses, or both in pediatric patients having undergone the arterial switch operation <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> of the great arteries. Our results suggest that multislice computed tomography could be used as a screening technique for detecting coronary complications in the follow-up of the arterial switch operation before having recourse to conventional angiography...|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} that the V(D) J recombinase {{functions as a}} transposase in vitro suggests that transposition by this system might be a potent source of genomic instability. To gain insight into the mechanisms that regulate transposition, we investigated a phenomenon termed target commitment that reflects a functional association between the RAG transposase and the target DNA. We found that the V(D) J recombinase is quite promiscuous, forming productive complexes with target DNA {{both before and after}} donor cleavage, and our data indicate that the rate-limiting step <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> occurs after target capture. Formation of stable target capture complexes depends upon the presence of active-site metal binding residues (the DDE motif), suggesting that active-site amino acids in RAG- 1 are critical for target capture. The ability of the RAG transposase to commit to target prior to cleavage may result in a preference <b>for</b> <b>transposition</b> into nearby targets, such as immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor loci.
