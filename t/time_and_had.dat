5|$|Dunn's {{training}} facility, Bud Dunn Stables, (later Bud Dunn and Son Stables) was in Florence, Alabama, on a ten-acre property. Dunn {{moved to}} north Alabama from Georgia in the 1950s, and bought out another trainer who was quitting the horse business. By the mid-1980s, Dunn had over 50 horses in training at a <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> several full-time employees. He also judged Tennessee Walking Horse shows, including the Spring Celebration, an annual Tennessee Walking Horse show in Shelbyville, Tennessee that is traditionally popular with trainers {{who hope to}} enter horses in the National Celebration later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Harrison County was {{originally}} part of Knox County and Clark County but was separated in 1808. It {{was the first}} Indiana county formed by the Indiana territorial legislature and not the Governor. The county originally contained land that is now parts of Crawford, Floyd, Washington, Jackson, Clark, Lawrence, Perry, Scott and Orange Counties. The county was named for William Henry Harrison, the first governor of Indiana Territory, and later a General in War of 1812, hero of Tippecanoe, and the 9th U.S. President. Harrison was the largest land holder in the county at the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> a small estate at Harrison Spring.|$|E

Chen's fellow activist Hu Jia stated that Chen had been {{planning}} escape for a long <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> previously attempted to dig a tunnel for escape. In {{the weeks leading up}} to his escape, Chen gave his guards the impression that he was ill in bed, and stopped appearing outside the house, which allowed him several days before any absence would be discovered. Under cover of darkness and with the help of his wife, Chen climbed over the wall around his house, breaking his foot in the process.|$|E

5|$|The Habsburg Charles II of Spain {{was dying}} at this <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> no children. At Charles' request, Innocent advised that the throne pass to Philip of Anjou, {{grandson}} of Louis XIV of France, {{due to the}} close kinship between Louis and Charles.

5|$|Abu Bakar {{employed}} {{the service of}} a Chinese contractor and long-time acquaintance, Wong Ah Fook, to oversee the development of Johor Bahru. The Johor Archives showed that Wong was the largest building contractor at that <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> been involved in at least twenty public works projects between 1887 and 1895. In addition, Wong was contracted to oversee the construction of the state mosque and several palaces under the direction of Abu Bakar. As a gratitude to Wong's contributions to the state, Abu Bakar granted him a plot of land in the heart of Johor Bahru in 1892. Wong then oversaw the construction of a village, Kampong Ah Fook, as well as a road, Jalan Wong Ah Fook on the land that he was granted.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some historians}} have {{identified}} Garrard {{as a member}} of the Danville Political Club, a secret debating society that was active in Danville, Kentucky, from 1786 to 1790, his name is not found in the Club's official membership records. Garrard's biographer, H. E. Everman, concludes that these historians may have mistaken Garrard's membership in the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge for membership in the Danville Political Club. The groups had similar aims, were active at about the same <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> several members in common. Other notable members of the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge included Isaac Shelby, Christopher Greenup, and Thomas Todd, all future Kentucky governors or gubernatorial candidates.|$|E

5|$|Archibald Campbell MacLaren (1 December 1871– 17 November 1944) was an English cricketer who captained the England cricket team {{at various}} times between 1898 and 1909. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he played 35 Test matches for England, as captain in 22 of those games, and led the team to defeat in four Ashes series against Australia. An amateur, MacLaren played first-class cricket for Lancashire, captaining that county {{for most of his}} career. As a batsman, MacLaren was one of the leading cricketers of his <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> a reputation as a fast-scoring stylist. In 1895, he scored 424 runs in an innings against Somerset which was the highest individual score in first-class cricket until 1923 and remained a record in English cricket until 1994. Opinions were divided over his captaincy. He was a deep thinker on the game and critics believed him to be tactically advanced, but his pessimism, clashes with the selectors and inability to get the best out of his players led most commentators to rate him a poor leader.|$|E
5|$|By the 1330s, Southampton's {{prosperity}} {{was in a}} slow decline. In 1338 {{there was}} a successful French attack on the town, during which various buildings were burned and castle was damaged. The house {{may have been one}} of those damaged in the raid, as the south-western corner of the building collapsed around that <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> to be quickly rebuilt; other alterations, including the addition of a fireplace, may have been carried out at the same time. Southampton's economy collapsed {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks and never fully recovered. The character of FrenchStreet began to change, as many houses were sub-divided or redeveloped to fit in more buildings. The Medieval Merchant's House ceased to be used by major merchants and by 1392 appears to have been rented out to tenants by Thomas Fryke and John Barflet, the latter a descendent of John Fortin, for whom the house was originally built.|$|E
5|$|East Orange, New Jersey-born field athlete Dorian Scott {{competed for}} Jamaica in the men's shot put. He was 26 {{years old at}} the <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> not competed at any Olympic games prior to his {{performance}} in Beijing. During the August 14 qualifying round, Scott was placed in the second heat, which included 23 athletes. He was given three chances to put the shot. During his first attempt, the shot flew 19.54meters, placing him 10th; in the second, 19.94meters, placing him sixth; and in the third, 19.71meters. However, since his second score was the best mark he received, the third score went unranked and the second score was used as his final score in the qualifying round. Overall, Scott placed 15th out of the 40 placing athletes, falling behind the Ukraine's Andriy Semenov (20.01meters) but displacing Australia's Justin Anlezark (19.91meters). He did not progress to the final round on August 15.|$|E

5|$|Groundbreaking on the MAR-I site {{started in}} March 1963 and {{construction}} proceeded rapidly. The radar was powered {{up for the}} first time in June 1964 and achieved its first successful tracking on 11 September 1964, repeatedly tracking and breaking lock on a balloon target over a 50-minute period. However, the system demonstrated very low reliability in the transmitter's travelling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers, which led to an extremely expensive re-design and re-installation. Once upgraded, MAR-I demonstrated the system would work as expected; it could generate multiple virtual radar beams, could simultaneously generate different types of beams for detection, tracking, and discrimination at the same <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> the accuracy and speed needed to generate many tracks.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} to play for Auckland until 1913. This period included two more matches against international opposition: a victory over the 1908 Anglo-Welsh side 11–0, and a defeat of Australia in 1913. Auckland had held the Ranfurly Shield throughout this <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> endured a number of close shield challenges during their reign. They had 23 successful shield defenses before they faced Taranaki on 16 August 1913. In the match Taranaki scored a converted try (worth five points at the time) four minutes from full-time to end Auckland's shield reign. Cunningham had played in 16 of Auckland's 24 shield matches during their tenure. He retired from provincial rugby {{at the end of}} that season.|$|E
5|$|He left in May {{and arrived}} in November {{of what was}} still the unorganized Oregon Country. At this time the region was under the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States after the settling of the Oregon boundary dispute with Great Britain the previous year. In Oregon, Chapman settled first in what was then Marysville, and is now Corvallis, in the Willamette Valley. In 1848, he relocated to Salem, where he learned of the California Gold Rush while at court at Knox Butte. Chapman went to California for a brief <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>had</b> some success in the gold fields before returning in 1849 to Oregon, which had become the Oregon Territory in 1848.|$|E
