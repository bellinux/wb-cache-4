2500|$|To see David Campese in seven-a-side {{play was}} another delight. The {{abbreviated}} version {{seemed to be}} made for him. Of course it was invented near my home area of the Scottish border country at Melrose and there was massive interest in the appearance of David Campese in a Randwick squad who were special guests in 1990 at the ‘Blue Riband’ of the spring sevens series, the Melrose tournament. Came the day and the rain simply teemed down on a pitch that was treacherous to say the least. The local players rubbed their hands in gleeful anticipation. Here was the weather and ground conditions to which they were accustomed and in which they could revel. Such hazardous conditions would cut the famous Wallaby down to size. The Borderers would show the great man how it should be done. Some hope! He was the star of the show, the tournament’s top try-scorer and points-scorer with 44 of Randwick’s 92 points. Not only that but he was like a duck in water, completely at home, fizzing about in the ‘glaur’, the Border name for cloying mud, as to the manner born. He had been preparing himself for water sports having previously asked that his Melrose billet should have a swimming pool! He saved Randwick from semi-final defeat with a typical touch of Campese magic. Randwick were 15-12 in arrears to Melrose with time almost up when he received the ball at halfway and took off like an inebriated skater. Some metres short of the goal line he produced a dive that would have dome credit to an Olympic swimmer and slithered his way to a momentous try that took Randwick to the final in which they beat the renowned sevens artistes from Kelso who included the famous ‘White Shark’, John Jeffrey. David admitted afterwards that he was grateful for the rain and mud: ‘I wouldn’t have scored that try on a dry day because I {{would not have been able}} <b>to</b> <b>aquaplane</b> into the corner.’ ...|$|E
50|$|Seconds later, the Team Ferrari Club of Japan's Ferrari F355 Challenge {{driven by}} Ota, slowed down, causing it <b>to</b> <b>aquaplane</b> and swerve left {{directly}} onto the Porsche. Both exploded into a fireball on impact. The Ferrari, after hitting the wall, slid across {{to the other side}} of the track and rested at the pit stop exit. Another Porsche swerved to avoid Ota.|$|E
50|$|However {{this can}} be {{prevented}} by grooves on runways. In 1965, a US delegation visited the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough to view their grooved runway for reduced aquaplaning and initiated {{a study by the}} FAA and NASA. Grooving has since been adopted by most major airports around the world. Thin grooves are cut in the concrete which allows for water to be dissipated and further reduces the potential <b>to</b> <b>aquaplane.</b>|$|E
50|$|In China, Sutil {{was running}} in 6th place with 6 laps {{remaining}} {{when he lost}} control of his Force India - due <b>to</b> <b>aquaplaning</b> - resulting in him crashing and forcing him to retire.|$|R
50|$|The best {{strategy}} is to avoid contributors <b>to</b> <b>aquaplaning.</b> Proper tire pressure, narrow and unworn tires, and reduced speeds from those judged suitably moderate in the dry will mitigate the risk of aquaplaning, as will avoidance of standing water.|$|R
50|$|Although the bar grip {{performs}} well as {{a pattern}} for severe mud, and is acceptable for most off-road surfaces, its lack of a small tread pattern makes it poor at clearing water. They are thus highly prone <b>to</b> <b>aquaplaning</b> on wet tarmac or smooth surfaces. They perform well on snow and carry chains well, but their large area of smooth unbroken rubber makes them poor performers on ice.|$|R
50|$|The {{results were}} overshadowed by a heavy hail storm from Lap 53, which caused {{three out of}} the top four cars (Jody Scheckter, James Hunt, and Mark Donohue), <b>to</b> <b>aquaplane</b> and crash in the same corner, {{bringing}} an early finish to the race, and a significant absence on the podium. A number of other cars crashed at the same corner as well, including Wilson Fittipaldi, Jochen Mass, and John Watson. The race results were finalised the lap after the lap most cars crashed, giving Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi, who had been the race leader prior to the storm, a one lap win in his McLaren M23. Carlos Pace, {{who was one of the}} crashers in his Brabham BT44B was classified in second position with another of the crashers, Tyrrell 007 driver Jody Scheckter classified third.|$|E
50|$|An elastic {{ball that}} bounces on water, the Waboba water balls flatten like a pancake when they hits the water surface, {{increasing}} its lift and propelling it upward. When {{it hits the}} water at a shallow angle, it too creates a bowl-shaped depression. But because it is soft, the ball flattens into a disc-shape when it hits the surface and this allows it <b>to</b> <b>aquaplane</b> efficiently across the surface. And {{the angle of the}} bowl-shaped depression causes it to launch into the air where the ball regains its shape, making it look as if it has bounced. The process is remarkably similar to the way stones skip across water, even though they are denser than the liquid. A shallow impact with the water surface creates a bowl-shaped depression that launches the stone into the air as it leaves.|$|E
50|$|On May 3, 1998, during round 2 of the JGTC at Fuji Speedway, Ota {{was badly}} injured. There were 47,000 spectators in {{attendance}} for the JGTC round scheduled for 300km (67 laps). At {{the time of}} race there was torrential rain and visibility was limited. Following the parade lap, the safety car drove through the starting line at 150 km/h (93 mph) then suddenly slowed down. This caused 910 Racing's Porsche 911 RSR driven by Tomohiko Sunako <b>to</b> <b>aquaplane</b> and strike the rear of Kaoru Hoshino's 911 GT2. Of the GT300 cars, the third {{car in front of}} the Porsches (and 22nd on the grid), the BMW M3 of Yasushi Hitotsuyama, behind, managed to avoid the Porsche by driving onto the grass and then back to the circuit, while the Porsche struck a barrier and rested on the grass. A caution flag was waved out.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between surface damage (the presence of ruts and undulations) and traffic safety is discussed. The {{characteristics of the}} road and the road surface may not show unsuspected changes for a controlled and safe traffic. The presence of ruts in the combination with waterlays can easily led <b>to</b> <b>aquaplaning.</b> Presence of waves can lend to a not well perceived contact tyre /road. A mathematical model is developed to determinate if the thickness of the waterlay by which almost no aqua...|$|R
40|$|The tread of a tyre {{consists}} of a profile (pattern of grooves, sipes, and blocks) mainly designed to improve wet performance and inhibit aquaplaning by providing a conduit for water to be expelled underneath the tyre as it makes contact with the road surface. Testing different tread profile designs is time consuming, as it requires fabrication and physical measurement of tyres. We propose a supervised machine learning method <b>to</b> predict tyres’ <b>aquaplaning</b> performance based on the tread profile described in geometry and rubber stiffness. Our method provides a regressor from the space of profile geometry, reduced <b>to</b> images, <b>to</b> <b>aquaplaning</b> performance. Experimental results demonstrate that image analysis and machine learning combined with other methods can yield improved prediction of aquaplaning performance, even using non-normalised data. Therefore this method has can potentially save substantial cost and time in tyre development. This investigation is based on data provided by Continental Reifen Deutschland GmbH...|$|R
50|$|Motorcycles {{benefit from}} narrow tires with round, canoe-shaped contact patches. Narrow tires are less {{vulnerable}} <b>to</b> <b>aquaplaning</b> because vehicle weight is distributed over a smaller area, and rounded tires more easily push water aside. These advantages diminish on lighter motorcycles with naturally wide tires, {{like those in}} the supersport class. Further, wet conditions reduce the lateral force that any tire can accommodate before sliding. While a slide in a four-wheeled vehicle may be corrected, the same slide on a motorcycle will generally cause the rider to fall. Thus, despite the relative lack of aquaplaning danger in wet conditions, motorcycle riders must be even more cautious because overall traction is reduced by wet roadways.|$|R
50|$|The 4½-month-long European tour {{started with}} the news that Ferrari driver René Arnoux had been sacked the team, and was {{replaced}} by Swede Stefan Johannson (no official explanation has ever been given by either Ferrari or Arnoux). The next race took place in another Portuguese-speaking country, the language's country of origin - Portugal. This race was held at the Estoril Circuit near the capital of Lisbon. Although the practice sessions were held in pleasant weather, it rained heavily for the race. Conditions were extremely difficult, and it saw Ayrton Senna display his mastery of wet-weather conditions. The Brazilian led the race from start to finish, {{and by the time he}} had finished, he had lapped everyone except 2nd-placed Alboreto. It was Senna's first victory - which was already very impressive considering the appalling conditions that caused drivers including Prost <b>to</b> <b>aquaplane</b> off the circuit.|$|E
50|$|In 1960 the British Aircraft Corporation {{took over}} the {{aircraft}} interests of the Bristol Aeroplane Company. In 1960, an RAF Vulcan bomber, approaching from the west, landed at Filton in heavy rain. The pilot braked, but started <b>to</b> <b>aquaplane.</b> He decided to abort the landing. Although he managed to take-off and eventually land successfully elsewhere, the jet blast from the aircraft's four Bristol Siddeley Olympus 201 engines severely damaged a filling station at {{the eastern end of}} the runway, sent cars spinning on the A38 trunk road and wrecked the boundary fence steel railings. Eyewitnesses claimed that the aircraft barely cleared the engine test beds next to the Bristol to South Wales railway embankment. Subsequently, the filling station was moved further north, to a safer location. In the early 1960s, a new Filton bypass was constructed, roughly parallel to the old one, and this later became part of the M5 motorway. The 1960s and 1970s saw the development and production of Concorde at Filton and a further extension of the Filton runway. The first flight of the Concorde 002 prototype took place on 9 April 1969 at Filton Aerodrome. All other British-built Concordes also used the main Filton runway for their first flights. Because of jet blast, gates and traffic lights were installed to close off the A38 road when Concorde took off. A few Lightning fighters were produced during this period.|$|E
5000|$|Pavement {{cross slope}} and grade: Cross slope {{is the extent}} to which the {{cross-section}} of a road resembles an upturned U. Higher cross slopes allow water to drain more easily. Grade is the steepness of the road at a particular point, which affects both drainage and force exerted by the vehicle on the road. Vehicles are less likely <b>to</b> <b>aquaplane</b> while traveling uphill, and far more likely to do so at the trough of two connected hills where water tends to pool. The resultant of cross slope and grade is called drainage gradient or [...] "resulting grade". Most road design manuals require that the drainage gradient in all road sections must exceed 0.5%, in order to avoid a thick water film during and after rainfall. Areas where the drainage gradient may fall below the minimum limit 0.5% are found at the entrance and exit of banked outer curves. These hot spots are typically less than 1% of the road length, but a large share of all skid crashes occur there. One method for the road designer to reduce the crash risk is to move the cross slope transition from the outer curve and to a straight road section, where lateral forces are lower. If possible, the cross slope transition should be placed in a slight up- or downgrade, thereby avoiding that the drainage gradient drops to zero. The UK road design manual actually calls for placement of a cross slope transition in an artificially created slope, if needed. In some cases, permeable asphalt or concrete can be used to improve drainage in the cross slope transitions.|$|E
50|$|Cross slope, {{cross fall}} or camber is a {{geometric}} feature of pavement surfaces: the transverse slope {{with respect to}} the horizon. It is a very important safety factor. Cross slope is provided to provide a drainage gradient so that water will run off the surface to a drainage system such as a street gutter or ditch. Inadequate cross slope will contribute <b>to</b> <b>aquaplaning.</b> On straight sections of normal two-lane roads, the pavement cross section is usually highest in the center and drains to both sides. In horizontal curves, the cross slope is banked into superelevation to reduce steering effort and lateral force required to go around the curve. All water drains {{to the inside of the}} curve. If the cross slope magnitude oscillates within 1 - 25 m, the body and payload of high (heavy) vehicles will experience high roll vibration.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{field hockey}} balls are hard spherical balls, {{made of plastic}} (sometimes over a cork core), and are usually white, {{although}} they can be any colour {{as long as they}} contrast with the playing surface. The balls have a circumference of 224 - 235 mm and a mass of 156 - 163 g. The ball is often covered with indentations <b>to</b> reduce <b>aquaplaning</b> that can cause an inconsistent ball speed on wet surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|Vehicle type: Combination {{vehicles}} like semi-trailers {{are more}} likely <b>to</b> experience uneven <b>aquaplaning</b> caused by uneven weight distribution. An unloaded trailer will aquaplane sooner than the cab pulling it. Pickup trucks or SUVs towing trailers also present similar problems.|$|R
500|$|The race {{began at}} 15:00 Japan Standard Time (...) [...] The track {{had a large}} amount of {{standing}} water on its surface, since Typhoon Phanfone had brought heavy rain to the area. The air temperature was , and the track temperature was [...] About 142,000 people attended the race. The standing water caused heavy spray and impaired visibility, and all cars used full wet tyres. The race began behind the safety car, with no formation lap; despite the slow speed, drivers struggled for grip on the wet surface. Ericsson lost control of his car after accelerating out of the final turn, and spun into the gravel trap at the corner. Marshals pushed his car out of the gravel, enabling him to keep driving. Following complaints from Hamilton about poor visibility, the race was suspended after two laps. The cars drove back into the pit lane, lined up in grid formation and their engines were shut off. Several cars had their ride heights raised to make them less prone <b>to</b> <b>aquaplaning</b> on their underbody planks. The race was restarted 20 minutes later behind the safety car, after the rain let up. Alonso stopped his car with an electrical issue (possibly a short circuit from the wet conditions), and was the race's first retirement on lap three. His departure promoted Ricciardo into fifth place, Magnussen sixth and Button seventh.|$|R
50|$|The amount a tire {{meets the}} road is an {{equation}} between {{the weight of the}} car and the type (and size) of its tire. A 1000 kg car can depress a 185/65/15 tire more than a 215/45/15 tire longitudinally thus having better linear grip and better braking distance not <b>to</b> mention better <b>aquaplaning</b> performance, while the wider tires have better (dry) cornering resistance.|$|R
50|$|Runway {{conditions}} affect {{take off}} and landing performance of an aircraft. The runway may be made up of concrete, asphalt, gravel or grass. An important safety concern at airports is the contamination of the runways due to ice, snow, water, rubber deposits etc. The landing distance required by an aircraft is much more in case of low friction runways which do not facilitate effective braking <b>to</b> occur. <b>Aquaplaning</b> is a phenomenon in which directional control is lost {{because of the presence of}} film of water between the rubber tires and the runway surface. The construction of grooved surface runways and regular maintenance, especially rubber removal, both help reduce runway slipperiness and facilitate good ground handling and effective braking.|$|R
500|$|Magnussen ran wide {{onto the}} first-turn run-off area on lap 38 but rejoined without spinning, and Vergne {{went off the}} track at the second corner. Vettel ran wide off the circuit and into the gravel trap at the S-turns during that lap, {{allowing}} Button to close in on him. Ricciardo closed the gap to Button that lap and attempted to pass him around the inside at the hairpin; Button defended his position, and Ricciardo ran wide. Hamilton recorded the fastest overall lap time of the race during the 39th lap, completing a circuit of one minute and 51.600 seconds. DRS was disabled on lap 41 because weather conditions continued to deteriorate. Visibility was reduced due to fading light and low cloud cover; drivers were dazzled by lights on their steering wheels. Ricciardo attempted to pass Button again that lap by taking the inside lane into the hairpin, but Button took a wide line. He passed Button at the hairpin to move into fourth position on the 42nd lap, and Button made a pit stop for full wet tyres. Sutil lost control of his car due <b>to</b> <b>aquaplaning,</b> spun and collided with the outside tyre barrier {{at the top of}} the hill at Dunlop Curve on the lap. Double yellow flags were waved at the corner to warn drivers about the incident, and Whiting did not use the safety car. Sutil's car was extracted from the track by a tractor crane that lap and turned backwards toward a gap in the barrier. Bianchi lost control of his Marussia at [...] on lap 43, veering right towards the run-off area outside the Dunlop Curve. Although he applied his throttle and brake pedals simultaneously, his fail-safe system did not work because the settings of his brake-by-wire system were incompatible.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Future {{active safety}} systems will require more {{accurate}} information {{about the state of}} a vehicle and the operating conditions of an individual tyre. Aquaplaning is a dangerous situation in which the contact between the tyre and the road is partially or completely lost. In this paper, the movements of the inner liner of the tyre during aquaplaning are measured optically and exploited <b>to</b> estimate <b>aquaplaning.</b> The results from proving-ground tests are shown and compared with those of the conventional approach of estimating aquaplaning from wheel speeds. The proposed method performs reliably in real time and can detect several different levels of aquaplaning. The results support the future development of production-capable tyre sensors. An optical tyre sensor also provides a research tool for attaining an in-depth understanding of the aquaplaning phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|For safety reason, {{porous asphalt}} has been {{developed}} in many countries <b>to</b> avoid <b>aquaplaning,</b> so that the road surface could provide sufficient skid resistance for the vehicles to avoid accidents. This paper evaluates the use of aggregate gradations applied in several countries such as; United Kingdom, Switzerland, Japan and Indonesia for porous asphalt production using local materials available around Surakarta. The experimental method was applied for this research including Marshall stability and flow to determine the optimum bitumen content, followed by the cantabrian and unconfined compressive strength at the optimum bitumen content. The results show that Japanese gradation is the best gradation could be applied for local materials around Surakarta, meanwhile Indonesian gradation is the worst in Marshall stability and resistance to segregation.

50|$|In Malaysia, McLaren {{seemed to}} improve their overall pace by three-tenths of a second due to {{performance}} updates to the car, with Hamilton recording the fastest lap time in both free practice sessions on Friday. Button also {{finished in the top}} ten in all three practice sessions. The first qualifying session was wet and the team relied on the weather radar rather than using common sense to misjudge the weather conditions, failing to send their cars out at the optimum track conditions. Hamilton failed to make it out of the first part of qualifying, setting the 20th best time. Button just made it out of that session, but due <b>to</b> him <b>aquaplaning</b> into the gravel trap, he started seventeenth on the grid taking no further part in the qualifying session. Both drivers finished in the points, with Hamilton finishing sixth and Button eighth.|$|R
2500|$|Randwick then {{defeated}} Melrose in the semi-final 16-15. Campese {{opened the}} scoring of the semi-final with a try that he converted to give Randwick a 6-0 lead. The scores were level at halftime 6-6. Campese scored first for Randwick {{in the second}} half with a try that he again converted to make the score 12-6. However, Melrose leveled the scores again, and with two minutes remaining Melrose captain Craig Chalmers kicked a penalty goal for a 15-12 lead. The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that, “Randwick looked briefly flustered but Campese, skipping through on a 30m run, rescued the game with 60 seconds remaining, to send the Australians through 16-15.” Graham Law in The Scotsman reported on the final moments of the semi-final and wrote that, [...] "Randwick secured ball from the kick-off and when Melrose infringed at a ruck full-time had been reached but, correctly, referee Jim Fleming allowed play to continue and Walker released Campese from nearly halfway. Chalmers, with the first engagement, and Purves both made tackles but Campese, now domiciled in Italy, seemed <b>to</b> expand and <b>aquaplaned</b> <b>to</b> the goal-line. It was no-side and Keith Robertson’s men were out. The Sunday Herald of Scotland wrote that, [...] "No-one else in the tournament would have had the pace and verve to squeeze in at the right corner to deny the hosts..." [...] Following the tournament Campese admitted that, ““If it had not been wet, I would not have made that try against Melrose.” ...|$|R
40|$|Porous asphalt {{pavement}} was initially {{developed for the}} purpose of improving road safety, best candidate material for quiet pavement and <b>to</b> avoid <b>aquaplaning</b> and skidding in wet weather. However, from previous studies, porous asphalt is able to mitigate surface runoff. Porous asphalt parking lots with underlying reservoir course perform as additional temporary water storage matrix that enables reduction of flash flood. This paper elaborates {{the development of a new}} porous asphalt aggregate grading design for storm water mitigation using the Nominal Maximum Aggregate Size (NMAS) 20 mm. The properties of the mixes were quantified and evaluated in terms of air voids, permeability, abrasion loss and indirect tensile strength. It was found that the proposed gradation has the best permeability and Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) values when compacted at 50 blows per face with a standard Marshal compactor. The porous asphalt slab was prepared using a slab compactor to simulate porous parking lot paving at site. The porous asphalt slab was finally placed inside a locally fabricated water flow simulator to simulate a porous {{asphalt pavement}} system for parking lots...|$|R

His departure promoted Ricciardo into fifth place, Magnussen sixth and Button seventh.Although Hamilton became concerned about his Mercedes' brakes, he was told that it was a relatively minor sensor problem. He and Vergne reported that conditions had improved, but Vettel and Massa said that visibility remained poor. The safety car drove into the pit lane {{at the end of the}} ninth lap, and the cars were allowed to overtake. Button immediately made a pit stop to fit intermediate tyres. Hamilton attempted to pass Rosberg heading into the first corner, but could not overtake the German driver. Rosberg began to pull away from him; Vettel tried to pass Magnussen going into the hairpin, but was unable to complete the manoeuvre. He ran wide at the Spoon Curve, remaining on the track by running onto the kerb. Pérez overtook Kvyat to claim ninth position on the lap. At the end of the first racing lap, Rosberg led Hamilton by 1.3 seconds; Hamilton was followed by Bottas, Massa, Ricciardo, Magnussen, Vettel, Räikkönen, Pérez and Kvyat.|$|R
40|$|Vehicle tire {{aquaplaning}} is {{a dangerous}} phenomenon, characterized in its hydrodynamic form by the tire to ground separation and the cancellation of steering or braking control possibilities. Its occurence is generally suspected only for high speeds in presence of water but the phenomenon can appear for rather low speeds. This work aim is <b>to</b> characterize <b>aquaplaning</b> occurence. Tests was carried out on a LCPC track comprising a water retention zone. An instrumented vehicle equipped with worn tires rolled through this zone for different stabilized speeds. As relevant indicators of the aquaplaning occurence we retained the rotation rates and forces of the traction wheels. At low speed, the wheel transmission moments increase while through the puddles because of the water hydrodynamic reaction. Conversely, starting from {{the realization of the}} process of aquaplaning these moments decrease whereas the rotation rates of the driving wheels increase simultaneously. With under-inflated tires the critical speed of <b>aquaplaning</b> was lowered <b>to</b> approximately 19 m/s while it is increased to more than 30 m/s in the event of over-inflation. Finally, phenomenon parameter have been verified by developing a visco-hydrodynamic model. The overall study confirms the risk of aquaplaning at low speed...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work presented in this report has been to develop a numerical method for the investigation of water-lubricated soft elastohydrodynamic (EHD) conjunctions {{as it relates to}} the problem of car tyre aquaplaning. Whereas the problem of aquaplaning on very thick water films is very well-studied, the aspects of a tyre sliding on thin water layer is much less investigated. Considering fluid flow in very thin layers, one can find that the relative importance of viscosity of the fluid increases over the mass inertia effects. Therefore it is suggested in the present investigation to distinct between two different regimes of aquaplaning and refer them as dynamic aquaplaning and viscous aquaplaning. The subject of the present investigation is viscous aquaplaning on thin fluid layer. Considering flow in a thin fluid layer allows a number assumptions to be made, which brings this problem close to the problem of fluid lubrication of machine elements. This makes it possible to apply advanced numerical methods originally developed for the lubrication theory <b>to</b> the <b>aquaplaning</b> of a pneumatic car tyre on a thin layer of water. Numerical results were produced for 20, 40, 60, 120, and 200 km/h. No fluid films were detected separating the surfaces in this range of velocities...|$|R
40|$|Carnivorous {{pitcher plants}} {{of the genus}} Nepenthes capture prey with a pitfall trap that relies on a micro-structured, {{slippery}} surface. The upper pitcher rim (peristome) is fully wettable and causes insects <b>to</b> slip by <b>aquaplaning</b> on a thin water film. The high wettability of the peristome is probably achieved {{by a combination of}} hydrophilic surface chemistry, surface roughness and the presence of hygroscopic nectar. Insect foot attachment could be prevented by the delayed drainage of the thin water film between the adhesive pad and the surface. Drainage should be faster for insects with a hairy adhesive system; however, they slip equally on the wet peristome. Therefore the stability of the water film against dewetting appears to be the key factor for aquaplaning. New experimental techniques may help to clarify the detailed function of the pitcher plant peristome and to explore its potential for biomimetic applications...|$|R
