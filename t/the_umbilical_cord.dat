5|$|Jaco Van Dormael {{was born}} in Ixelles. Belgium, on 9 February 1957 to a Belgian couple. Van Dormael was raised in Germany until age seven, when his family {{returned}} to Belgium. At his birth, he had nearly been strangled by <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> and received an insufficient supply of oxygen. It was feared that he may end up mentally impaired. This trauma accounts for the recurring themes in his films, which explore the worlds of people with mental and physical disabilities.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> was intact and still attached to the placenta inside the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha coccinea {{was used}} as a {{medicinal}} fungus by the Oneida Indians, and possibly by other tribes of the Iroquois Six Nations. The fungus, after being dried and ground up into a powder, was applied as a styptic, particularly to the navels of newborn children that were not healing properly after <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> had been severed. Pulverized fruit bodies were also kept under bandages made of soft-tanned deerskin. In Scarborough, England, the fruit bodies used to be arranged with moss and leaves and sold as a table decoration.|$|E

50|$|Severe chorioamnionitis may be {{accompanied}} by vasculitis of <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> blood vessels (due to the fetus' inflammatory cells) and, if very severe, funisitis (inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord's</b> connective tissue).|$|R
40|$|Foetal {{exposure}} to lead (Pb) during pregnancy is a major problem. However, no previous study has examined whether Pb concentrations in blood (Pb-B) and in serum (Pb-S) from pregnant women correlate with Pb-B and Pb-S in the foetuses. This hypothesis was tested in the present study. We measured Pb-B and Pb-S in 120 healthy pregnant women (more than 38 weeks of gestation) and their respective <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> samples. <b>The</b> analyses were carried out with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. We found higher Pb-B levels in the women compared with their respective <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> samples (1. 736 +/- 0. 090 mu g/dL and 1. 194 +/- 0. 062 mu g/dL, respectively; p 0. 05). Interestingly, we found positive correlations between Pb-B in <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> and Pb-B in the respective pregnant women (rs = 0. 5714; p < 0. 0001), and between Pb-S in <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> and Pb-S in the respective pregnant women (rs = 0. 3902; p < 0. 0001) {{as well as between}} %Pb-B/Pb-S in <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> and %Pb-B/Pb-S in the respective pregnant women (rs = 0. 3767; p < 0. 0001). These results indicate that the assessment of Pb-B and Pb-S in pregnant women provides relevant indexes of foetal {{exposure to}} Pb. Moreover, the similar %Pb-S/Pb-B in pregnant women and in <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> shows that <b>the</b> foetuses are directly exposed to the rapidly exchangeable Pb fraction found in their mothers.

5|$|In 2007, a 23-year-old {{woman in}} India, over eight months pregnant, hanged herself after contractions had begun. A viable infant was spontaneously {{delivered}} unassisted from the woman's body, which was suspended by the neck. The healthy infant {{was found on}} the floor, still tethered to the body of the mother by <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord.</b> The primary cause of the delivery was the otherwise normal contractions, which had begun prior to death, and was therefore not related to processes of decomposition. While this is not postmortem fetal extrusion, it may be referred to as a case of postmortem delivery, a term which is applied to a broad range of techniques and phenomena with a resultant delivery of a live infant.|$|E
5|$|The gestational period {{lasts for}} about {{eight and a}} half months, after which a single calf is born. Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and {{repeatedly}} lie down and get up again. Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position. She stands up immediately afterwards which causes <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> to break, vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth. In spite of regional variations, around 80% of the females give birth to their calves within a period of two to three weeks after the onset of the rainy season - from mid-November to the end of December. Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos. Twin births have not been reported.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> of {{a newborn}} is bluish-white in color. After birth, <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cord</b> is {{normally}} cut, leaving a 1–2inch stub. The umbilical stub will dry out, shrivel, darken, and spontaneously fall off within about 3 weeks. This will later become a belly-button after it heals. Occasionally, hospitals may apply triple dye to the umbilical stub to prevent infection, which may temporarily color the stub and surrounding skin purple.|$|E

40|$|On the {{histogenesis}} or {{nature of}} so-called fibrinoid degeneration, two theories {{have been accepted}} hitherto. The first is that fibrinoid substances consist mainly of fibrin exuded from blood streams {{and the second is}} that fibrinoid degeneration is characterized by an increase of acidic mucopolysaccharides in the connective tissues concerned. The present report deals with the histogenesis of fibrinoid degeneration developed in allergic tissue changes, from a histochemical point of view. The present preliminary experiments were undertaken to examine the histochemical significances of cutaneous tissues of rabbits and guinea pigs, fibrin coagula, placental tissues, <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> and cartilage. <b>The</b> following results were obtained. 1. Collagen fibers in the skin of rabbits and guinea pigs were stained in the following order : reddish purple, reddish and bluish using PAS, Reinhart's Hale-Van Gieson ard Lillie's allochrome method, respectively. On the other hand, ground substances contained in the samples showed positive Hale's reaction. Moreover, the contra! area of thick fiber-bundles appeared as violet by allochrome staining. Metachromasia reaction with toluidine blue was negative in the fibers while positive in the ground substances. 2. Mucinous substances of <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> and ground substances of cartilages showed positive Hale's reaction, while appearing as picromethylblue by allochrome staining. The ground substances of cartilage showed strongly positive metachromasia reaction with toluidine blue at pH of 2. 5, 4. 1 and 7. 0, while mucinous substances of <b>the</b> <b>umbilical</b> <b>cords</b> showed positeve reation only at pH 4. 1 and 7. 0.
