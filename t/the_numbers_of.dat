5|$|Although other breeds {{were being}} {{increasingly}} imported and bred, <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> the Finnhorse population also {{slowly began to}} recover; in 1997, 19,000 Finnhorses existed.

5|$|To date, little {{scientific}} data {{is available to}} assess the impact of cat predation on prey populations. Even well-fed domestic cats may hunt and kill, mainly catching small mammals, but also birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish, and invertebrates. Hunting by domestic cats may be contributing to the decline in <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> birds in urban areas, although the importance of this effect remains controversial. In the wild, the introduction of feral cats during human settlement can threaten native species with extinction. In many cases, controlling or eliminating the populations of non-native cats can produce a rapid recovery in native animals. However, the ecological role of introduced cats can be more complicated. For example, cats can control <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> rats, which also prey on birds' eggs and young, so a cat population can protect an endangered bird species by suppressing mesopredators.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly the {{extraordinary}} depression which {{has existed for}} the past four years in all branches of business, compelled the great railway lines to make reductions in their expenditures, and thus <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> unemployed have been constantly added to.|$|E
5|$|A {{large-scale}} {{slave trade}} with English privateers was begun. The {{life expectancy of}} slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> slaves. Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice. But {{by the turn of}} the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.|$|E

5|$|A mugging {{at gunpoint}} in 1854 reputedly {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of a park police force. Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted police have been replaced by a patrol team in a four-wheel drive vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> police in the park to half the level that they were ten years previously, despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.|$|E
5|$|After {{the change}} in organisation, Chetham's {{could no longer afford}} to provide {{education}} based on scholarships and other allowances, and began charging fees. In 1952, the school buildings were considered insufficient so a new block was built, opening in 1955. By 1960 <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> boys admitted had increased significantly, particularly among day pupils; 230 non-boarding students attended that year, alongside 64 boarders.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> dogs killed {{each year}} are {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs {{that can be seen}} as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E

30|$|For the {{prediction}} of depression, between May and June in 2013, we collected data from 1000 participants (male: 426, female: 574).

5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices {{and faces}} that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> sides of the faces of the graph equals twice the number of edges.|$|E
5|$|Between 1970 and 1972, {{a pair of}} Montagu's harriers, Britain's rarest {{breeding}} birds of prey, nested in the reed bed. The RSPB bought the reserve in 1973 for £53,000 (£,000 in 20). The Montagu's harriers did not return, but marsh harriers did, and the RSPB commenced improving the habitat and facilities, including embanking the lagoons and building a car park and visitor centre. Avocets, then still very rare in the UK, first bred here in 1984. The visitor centre facilities were improved between 1987 and 1989 to cope with <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> visitors.|$|E
