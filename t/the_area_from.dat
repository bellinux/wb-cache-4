5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{measurement}} the river is divided into five water body areas by the Environment Agency. Both <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>from</b> the source to Broad River around Crewkerne and <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>from</b> Broad River to Lopen Brook are rated good for chemical quality and moderate for ecological quality. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> <b>from</b> Lopen Brook to the River Isle, around Martock and South Petherton, is rated good for chemical quality, poor for ecological quality and poor overall. From the River Isle to River Yeo around Muchelney, chemical quality is rated good, and ecology is rated moderate. The section around Langport to the West Sedgemoor Drain continues to rate good for chemical quality and moderate for ecological quality, as does the final area leading to Bridgwater Bay.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Sir Archibald Murray, the Imperial Commander in Chief of Egypt, {{partially}} {{addressed the}} threat of von Kressenstein's forces to the Suez Canal by organising the defences into three sectors. No. 1 (Southern) sector, with its headquarters at Suez, covered <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>from</b> Suez to Kabrit, No. 2 (Central) sector, with its headquarters at Ismailia, covered <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>from</b> Kabrit to Ferdan, and No. 3 (Northern) sector, with its headquarters at Port Said, covered <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>from</b> Ferdan to Port Said. The No. 3 sector also had an advanced headquarters at Kantara. To support these forward defences, the British Empire improved their lines of communication by doubling the single railway line that ran from Cairo to the Suez Canal, and also pumped water from the River Nile along the Sweet Water Canal to supply the troops and the towns on the Suez Canal.|$|E
