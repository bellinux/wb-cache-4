5|$|There is also direct {{epidemiological}} {{evidence that}} TCDD is not carcinogenic at low doses, {{and in some}} studies cancer risk has even decreased. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> J-shape dose-response, low doses decrease the risk, and only higher doses increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and {{uranium-235}} (0.7204%). Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 {{for nuclear weapons}} and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction. The concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> 'critical mass'.|$|E

5|$|The term typhoon is the {{regional}} {{name in the}} northwest Pacific for a severe (or mature) tropical cyclone, whereas hurricane is {{the regional}} term in the northeast Pacific and northern Atlantic.

5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the scores from the first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to record two outs {{in the course of}} the same play. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> double play. Even three outs in one play, a triple play, {{is possible}}, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners.|$|E

25|$|In Advaita Vedanta, the {{interest}} {{is not in}} liberation in after life, but in one's current life. This school holds that liberation can be achieved while living, and a person who achieves <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> Jivanmukta.|$|E

25|$|Substituted {{derivatives}} of hydroxylamine are known. If the hydroxyl hydrogen <b>is</b> substituted, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>an</b> O-hydroxylamine, {{if one of}} the amine hydrogens <b>is</b> substituted, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>an</b> N-hydroxylamine. Similarly {{to ordinary}} amines, one can distinguish primary, secondary and tertiary hydroxylamines, the latter two referring to compounds where two or three hydrogens are substituted, respectively. Examples of compounds containing a hydroxylamine functional group are N-tert-butyl-hydroxylamine or the glycosidic bond in calicheamicin. N,O-Dimethylhydroxylamine is a coupling agent, used to synthesize Weinreb amides.|$|R

25|$|In some materials, {{neighboring}} electrons {{prefer to}} point in opposite directions, {{but there is}} no geometrical arrangement in which each pair of neighbors is anti-aligned. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> spin glass and is an example of geometrical frustration.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{invariant}} complex antilinear map j: S → S with j2 = idS. It {{follows that}} the triple i, j and k:=ij make S into a quaternionic vector space SH. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> quaternionic structure.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{invariant}} complex antilinear map r: S → S with r2 = idS. The {{fixed point}} set of r is then a real vector subspace SR of S with SR ⊗ C = S. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> real structure.|$|E

In such cases {{variables}} are represented through vectors instead of simple scalar values. For some distributed parameter systems the vectors may be infinite-dimensional (typically functions).|$|E
25|$|As {{may be seen}} in {{the next}} Figure, this design can be {{extended}} to multiple measurements, with consequent increase in the kinds of information that one can learn. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> cross-lagged model (multiple traits measured over more than one time).|$|E
25|$|Yield {{strength}} testing involves {{taking a}} small sample with a fixed cross-section area, and then pulling it with a controlled, gradually increasing force until the sample changes shape or breaks. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> Tensile Test. Longitudinal and/or transverse strain is recorded using mechanical or optical extensometers.|$|E

50|$|The formula given above for the {{standard}} error assumes that the sample size is {{much smaller than the}} population size, so that the population can be considered to be effectively infinite in size. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> usually the case even with finite populations, because most of the time, people are primarily interested in managing the processes that created the existing finite population; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>an</b> analytic study, following W. Edwards Deming. If people are interested in managing an existing finite population that will not change over time, then it is necessary to adjust for the population size; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>an</b> enumerative study.|$|R

25|$|Emotions {{are complex}} and involve a variety of {{physical}} and cognitive responses, {{many of which are}} not well understood. The general purpose of emotions is to produce a specific response to a stimulus. Feelings are the conscious perception of emotions, and when an emotion occurs frequently or continuously <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> mood.|$|E
25|$|The crucial {{aspect of}} any good pass is it being {{difficult}} to intercept. Good passers can pass {{the ball with}} great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball. A special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> no-look pass.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{a system}} that changes {{the shape of the}} wave (beyond simple scaling or shifting) creates {{additional}} harmonics (harmonic distortion). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>a</b> non-linear system. If it affects the wave symmetrically, the harmonics produced are all odd. If it affects the harmonics asymmetrically, at least one even harmonic is produced (and probably also odd harmonics).|$|E
5000|$|A simplicial {{collapse}} of K is {{the removal of}} all simplices [...] such that , where [...] is a free face. If additionally we have dim τ = dim σ-1, then <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>an</b> elementary collapse.|$|R
