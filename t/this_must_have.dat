5|$|Sir John Neville {{was from}} the branch of the Neville family based at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire, rather than that of Westmorland. It has been claimed that he, as a 'landless younger son' was {{partially}} to blame for his family's long-running feud with the Lancastrian Percy family of Northumberland. The first outburst of violence that took place {{was a result of}} the 1 May 1453 royal licence for John Neville's brother, Thomas Neville to marry Maud Stanhope being issued. News of <b>this</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> reached the north within the fortnight, for by the twelfth, one of the Earl of Northumberland's younger sons, Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont, began recruiting men. In August 1453, John Neville raided the Percy castle of Topcliffe, possibly with the intention of seizing Egremont. Failing to find him, Neville resorted to threatening the Percy tenantry who were in residence. He and Egremont were subsequently summoned to appear before the Royal Council, a summons which was ignored by both. Feuding continued through summer 1453, and even though they had been instructed to keep the peace, by the 27 July, the council was issuing letters to Northumberland and Salisbury regarding their sons. This was followed by more letters to the sons. In Knaresborough, the locals generally aligned themselves with John Neville due to the unpopularity of Sir William Plumpton (the king's man), from whom they began stealing with impunity, which resulted in severe injuries when the Neville brothers demonstrated a 'show of force' in January 1454.|$|E

Throughout the next year the campaign grew, preparing the public for an end of Stalinism.|$|E
25|$|Historical sound {{change in}} Japanese {{has led to}} the modern pronunciations of the {{individual}} characters as nichi and hon.

25|$|According to Hemming, after Cyneweard's death his manors of Laughern and Elmley Castle {{were seized}} by Urse d'Abetot's brother Robert Despenser. <b>This</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> {{occurred}} before 1086, {{when it was}} recorded in Domesday Book {{that they were in}} Robert's possession. Cyneweard's brother Godric had lost his land at Alton to William fitz Osbern sometime in or before 1071, the year of William's death, though despite this Godric was still alive in 1086.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} bells {{at the church}} is from 1585, when one had recently been cast. <b>This</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been later recast, as in the late 19th century the dates of the bells were recorded as 1602 or 1621, 1628, 1629, 1698 and 1723, forming a ring of five. James Keene of Woodstock cast the 1628 and 1629 bells. The tower had also an historic turret clock {{that may have been}} made early in the 17th century.|$|E
25|$|As far {{as can be}} determined, {{the medical}} corps in battle worked as follows. Trajan's Column depicts medics on the {{battlefield}} bandaging soldiers. They were located just behind the standards; i.e., near the field headquarters. <b>This</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been a field aid station, not necessarily the first, as the soldiers or corpsmen among the soldiers would have administered first aid before carrying their wounded comrades to the station. Some soldiers were designated to ride along the line on a horse picking up the wounded. They were paid {{by the number of}} men they rescued. Bandaging was performed by capsarii, who carried bandages (fascia) in their capsae, or bags.|$|E

25|$|Others, though, have {{questioned}} the evidence for precisely how John might {{have been influenced by}} Boscan and Garcilaso. Dámaso Alonso argued that John must have read the newly published 1575 edition of the poets in Ávila, shortly before his imprisonment in Toledo, and that <b>this</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been the key influence which rekindled in John memories of his own reading of Garcilaso as a young student of the Jesuits in Medina del Campo. However, Peter Thompson disputes this, arguing it is not definite John would have been familiar with Garcilaso from an early age, and even so the influence has been overemphasised by other commentators.|$|E
25|$|A longstanding {{theory is}} that the name {{originated}} in the Gallo-Roman period and comes from the Latin antverpia. Antverpia would come from Ante (before) Verpia (deposition, sedimentation), indicating land that forms by deposition in the inside curve of a river (which is in fact the same origin as Germanic waerpen). Note that the river Scheldt, before a transition period between 600 and 750, followed a different track. <b>This</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> coincided roughly with the current ringway south of the city, situating the city within a former curve of the river. However, many historians think it unlikely that there was a large settlement which would be named 'Antverpia', but more something like an outpost with a river crossing.|$|E
25|$|The royal {{inscriptions}} of the Assyrian king Adad-nirari I (c. 13071275 BC) relate how the vassal king Shattuara of Mitanni rebelled {{and committed}} hostile acts against Assyria. How this Shattuara {{was related to}} the dynasty of Partatama is unclear. Some scholars think that he was the second son of Artatama II, and the brother of Shattiwazza's one-time rival Shuttarna. Adad-nirari claims to have captured King Shattuara and brought him to Ashur, where he took an oath as a vassal. Afterwards, he was allowed to return to Mitanni, where he paid Adad-nirari regular tribute. <b>This</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> happened during the reign of the Hittite King Mursili II, but there is no exact date.|$|E

25|$|Head of the Library of Alexandria. The second Life, the Suda, and P.Oxy. 1241 attest that Apollonius {{held this}} post. Moreover, P.Oxy. 1241 {{indicates}} that Apollonius was succeeded {{in the position}} by Eratosthenes; <b>this</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been after 247/246 BCE, {{the date of the}} accession of Ptolemy III Euergetes, who was probably tutored by Apollonius and who appointed Eratosthenes. Unfortunately, the chronology of P.Oxy. 1241 bears some signs of confusion since it lists Apollonius under Ptolemy I Soter (died 283 BCE), or Ptolemy V Epiphanes (born 210 BCE). The Suda says that Apollonius succeeded Eratosthenes, but this doesn't fit the evidence either. There was another Alexandrian librarian named Apollonius ("The Eidographer", succeeding Aristophanes of Byzantium as library head) and this may have caused some of the confusion.|$|E
25|$|On 30 October 1917, {{the palace}} was {{declared}} {{to be part}} of the Hermitage public museums. This first exhibition to be held in the Winter Palace concerned the history of the revolution, and the public were able to view the private rooms of the Imperial Family. <b>This</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been an interesting experience for the viewing public, for while Soviet authorities denied looting and damage to the palace during the Storming, the Russian art connoisseur Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsov, who visited these rooms immediately before and after the event, described the private apartments as the most badly damaged area of the palace. The contents of the state rooms had been sent to Moscow for safety when the hospital was established, and the Hermitage Museum itself had not been damaged during the revolution.|$|E
25|$|Two {{loads of}} flour were requisitioned {{annually}} for pastry. It is unclear {{to what extent}} the large quantities of meat actually formed part of the monastic diet, as there was also an infirmary on the premises and <b>this</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> absorbed some of the food supplies. The kitchener was ordered to render account to the abbot four times a year. A cellarer was responsible for the supply of both beer and bread, including that required at the abbey's granges. the abbot ate from the same kitchens as the canons and could feed guests free of charge when on the premises, but he, the steward and the chaplain were to feed themselves when away from the abbey. Abbot Longnor established a substantial garden at the abbey and in later centuries a dovecote was installed there, providing another convenient source of meat.|$|E

25|$|The grey shrike {{superspecies}} {{consists of}} L. excubitor and its parapatric southern relatives. As mentioned above, {{the other members}} of this group are the southern grey shrike (L. meridionalis), the Chinese grey shrike (L. sphenocerus) and the loggerhead shrike (L. ludovicianus). The centre of this group's radiation is probably in the eastern Mediterranean region, and the southern grey shrike represents the basalmost form. The other three only diverged during the expansion into temperate regions. <b>This</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> happened fairly recently, because lineage sorting is not complete in the grey shrikes, and most of the present-day habitat of L. excubitor was uninhabitable during much of the Quaternary glaciation. Because of the phylogenetic uncertainties surrounding this close-knit group {{in the absence of a}} good fossil record, some refrain from splitting them up into distinct species; most modern authors do so however.|$|E
25|$|In Ong Kian Cheong, District Judge Neighbour {{stated that}} while {{people may have}} a desire to profess and spread their faith, the right to {{propagate}} such opinions cannot be unfettered. He found that both the accused persons, by distributing the seditious and objectionable tracts to Muslims and the general public, clearly reflected their intolerance, insensitivity and ignorance of delicate issues concerning race and religion in Singapore's multiracial and multi-religious society. Furthermore, in distributing the seditious and offensive tracts to spread their faith, the accused persons used the postal service to achieve their purpose and so were shielded by anonymity until {{the time they were}} apprehended. There is no doubt that <b>this</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> made it difficult for the police to trace them. In view of these circumstances, his Honour found that custodial sentences were warranted for both accused persons.|$|E
25|$|Cnut's {{death in}} 1035 was {{followed}} by a period of political uncertainty, as the succession was disputed between his sons. In 1036 Alfred, son of King Æthelred, returned from Normandy, where he had been taken for safety as a child at the time of Cnut's conquest of England. It is uncertain what his intentions were, but after landing with a small retinue in Sussex he was met by Godwin, Earl of Wessex, who escorted him in apparently friendly fashion to Guildford. Having taken lodgings there, Alfred's men were attacked as they slept and killed, mutilated or enslaved by Godwin's followers, while the prince himself was blinded and imprisoned, dying shortly afterwards. <b>This</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> contributed to the antipathy between Godwin and Alfred's brother Edward the Confessor, who came to the throne in 1042, a hostility which helped bring about the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.|$|E
