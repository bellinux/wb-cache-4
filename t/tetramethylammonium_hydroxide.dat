40|$|Studies of the {{dissolution}} of amorphous silica gel in aqueous hydroxides by 29 Si-MAS-NMR, give information on the oligomerisation of dissolved monomeric silicic acid and on the interaction between cations and the silica gel surface. The dissolution rate increases in the order (LIOH ˜ CsOH) 2 ̆ 6 lt;(RbOH ˜ NaOH) 2 ̆ 6 lt;KOH, indicating different promoting effects of the corresponding cations in {{the dissolution}} reaction. We attribute these differences to hydration properties of adsorbed alkali metal cations. Formation of silicate oligomers at high pH-values proceeds via cyclic trimeric silicate anions which, at high pH-values are more stabilised than the linear silicate anions. Further, the structure of highly polymerised silicate species depends on the alkali metal cation. Here we show {{for the first time}} that <b>tetramethylammonium</b> (TMA) <b>hydroxide</b> initially inhibits {{the dissolution of}} amorphous silica gel, which is caused by strong adsorption of rather hydrophobic TMA-cations on the silica gel surface. The effect of sodium/TMA-ratios on the dissolution rate was studied, showing that in the case where sodium is present, the rate of silica gel dissolution substantially increases. Studies on the reaction mechanism for the formation of cubic octameric silicate anions stabilised by TMA-cations are also reported...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{crystalline}} <b>tetramethylammonium</b> silicate <b>hydroxide</b> polyhydrate {{has been}} obtained by fractional crystallization {{at room temperature}} from a highly alkaline aqueous NMe 4 OH-SiO 2 solution. X-Ray single-crystal studies at 200 K revealed the trigonal crystal system, the unit-cell constants (hexagonal setting) a = 18. 126 (2) and c = 57. 529 (9) A°, the space group R 3 and Z = 3 formula units of [NMe 4] 16 [Si 8 O 20][OH] 8 · 116 H 2 O per unit cell. The crystal structure has been determined from 1416 unique Mo-Ka¯ data and refined to R = 0. 104. The host-guest compound is of polyhedral clathrate type with a mixed three-dimensional, (mainly) four-connected tetrahedral network composed of oligomeric silicate anions [Si 8 O 20] 8 -, OH- ions and H 2 O molecules linked via hydrogen bonds O-H?O. The silicate anions are each built up of eight SiO 4 tetrahedra sharing corners to form a cube (double four-ring structure). Cationic guest species NMe 4 + are enclosed in large polyhedral cavities [4668], [425865], [51264] and [425867] of the host structure; small [46] cages (i. e. the double-ring anions) and [4356] cages are unoccupied. Each silicate anion is the centre of a specific and probably very stable finite cluster [(NMe 4) 6 (Si 8 O 20) · 24 H 2 O] 2 -.

50|$|The {{synthetic}} {{applications of}} TMA are numerous and diverse, but are most appropriately considered under the entries for individual TMA salts (e.g. tetramethylammonium chloride and <b>tetramethylammonium</b> <b>hydroxide).</b> In general, although TMA salts do possess {{some of the}} phase-transfer catalytic properties that are characteristic of quaternary ammonium compounds, they tend to behave atypically because of the relatively high hydrophilicity of the TMA cation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tetramethylammonium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (TMAH or TMAOH) is a {{quaternary}} ammonium salt with the molecular formula N(CH3)4+&thinsp;OH−. It is commonly encountered as concentrated solutions in water or methanol. The solid and solutions are colorless, or yellowish if impure.

Because of their resilience, many unusual anions have been isolated as the quaternary ammonium salts.

5000|$|Pharmacological {{experiments}} with TMA {{have been performed}} using one of its salts, typically the chloride, bromide or iodide, since these anions were not expected {{to interfere with the}} actions of the TMA cation. In the early pharmacological literature, however, there are references to the use of [...] "tetramethylammonium hydroxide" [...] or [...] "tetramethylammonium hydrate", which were meant to facilitate comparison between weight-based dosages of different TMA salts, but did not involve the actual use of <b>tetramethylammonium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> whose strong basicity would have been incompatible with physiological conditions.|$|E
50|$|One {{very common}} {{positive}} photoresist {{used with the}} I, G and H-lines from a mercury-vapor lamp {{is based on a}} mixture of diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) and novolac resin (a phenol formaldehyde resin). DNQ inhibits the dissolution of the novolac resin, but upon exposure to light, the dissolution rate increases even beyond that of pure novolac. The mechanism by which unexposed DNQ inhibits novolac dissolution is not well understood, but is believed to be related to hydrogen bonding (or more exactly diazocoupling in the unexposed region). DNQ-novolac resists are developed by dissolution in a basic solution (usually 0.26N <b>tetramethylammonium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (TMAH) in water).|$|E
50|$|Usually, silicon wafers {{are used}} as {{substrates}} for bulk micromachining, {{as they can be}} anisotropically wet etched, forming highly regular structures. Wet etching typically uses alkaline liquid solvents, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) or <b>tetramethylammonium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (TMAH) to dissolve silicon which has been left exposed by the photolithography masking step. These alkali solvents dissolve the silicon in a highly anisotropic way, with some crystallographic orientations dissolving up to 1000 times faster than others. Such an approach is often used with very specific crystallographic orientations in the raw silicon to produce V-shaped grooves. The surface of these grooves can be atomically smooth if the etch is carried out correctly, and the dimensions and angles can be precisely defined.|$|E
50|$|Tetramethylammonium (TMA) or (Me4N+) is the {{simplest}} quaternary ammonium cation consisting of four methyl groups {{attached to a}} central nitrogen atom, and is isoelectronic with neopentane. It is positively charged and must exist in association with a counter-ion, and is most commonly found in simple salts such as tetramethylammonium chloride, tetramethylammonium bromide, tetramethylammonium iodide and <b>tetramethylammonium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> and can also form the unusual auride. Tetramethylammonium salts are used in chemical synthesis and are widely employed in pharmacological research. They also occur as toxic natural products, although the counterions {{may be difficult to}} identify. The identity of the anion associated with the tetramethylammonium cation frequently has little or no bearing on a particular chemical or biological type of action, but this is not invariably so.|$|E
5000|$|For {{potential}} {{applications to}} light emitting diodes, cubic silsesquioxanes. have been functionalized.

The general method of hydrolyzing organotrichlorosilanes is still effective here. When brominated or aminated, these structures can be coupled with epoxies, aldehydes, and bromoaromatics, which enable attachment of these silsesquioxanes to π-conjugated polymers. These methods can use copolymerization techniques, Grignard reagents, and different coupling strategies. There has also been research {{on the ability of}} conjugated dendrimer silsesquioxanes to behave as light emitting materials. Though, highly branched substituents tend to have π-π interactions, which hinder high luminescent quantum yield.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{anisotropic}} wet etchants {{are available}} for silicon, all of them hot aqueous caustics. For instance, potassium hydroxide (KOH) displays an etch rate selectivity 400 times higher in <100> [...] crystal directions than in <111> directions. EDP (an aqueous solution of ethylene diamine and pyrocatechol), displays a <100>/<111> selectivity of 17X, does not etch silicon dioxide as KOH does, and also displays high selectivity between lightly doped and heavily boron-doped (p-type) silicon. Use of these etchants on wafers that already contain CMOS integrated circuits requires protecting the circuitry. KOH may introduce mobile potassium ions into silicon dioxide, and EDP is highly corrosive and carcinogenic, so care is required in their use.

The waste liquor discharged from the liquid crystal display production contains 0. 53 wt% <b>tetramethylammonium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> 60 mg/d㎥ phenol and a ppb order of metal ions. In the cation exchange reaction, tetramethylammonium ion is captured on the cation exchange resin.
