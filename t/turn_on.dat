5|$|As {{well as the}} {{disputes}} over the refereeing, the goal judges on several occasions did not <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> the red light indicating a goal after a Canadian score. After Henderson's goal in game seven, Sinden sent the entire team off the bench to ensure the goal was counted. A similar incident during game eight led to the melee that Eagleson was involved in.|$|E

5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} Descent and Descent II, Descent 3 is a {{six degrees of}} freedom shooter where the player controls a flying ship from a first-person perspective in zero-gravity. It is differentiated from standard first-person shooters in that it allows the player to move and rotate in any 3D direction. Specifically, the player is free to move forward/backward, up/down, left/right, and rotate in three perpendicular axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Aboard the ship, the player can shoot enemies, <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> the ship's afterburners to temporarily increase its acceleration and speed, and fire flares or <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> the ship's headlight to explore darkened areas.|$|E

5|$|They {{are kind}} birds but the male Sebright may get {{protective}} around hens and may <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> its own owners like all roosters may do.

Sebrights are not prolific egglayers and hens are only expected to produce 60-80 creamy-white eggs each season.|$|E

5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> the inside and on the outside.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} laps, Massa {{appeared}} to have a faster car than Hamilton, and repeatedly tried to pass the McLaren {{on the inside of}} turn four.

He passed Hamilton briefly into the <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> lap five, but overshot the corner and ran wide onto the grass. He dropped to fifth, behind teammate Räikkönen and BMW's Nick Heidfeld. Hamilton apologised after the race for 'tricking' Massa into the move. Albers, in the sole remaining Spyker, retired on lap nine with a gearbox fire.|$|E

5000|$|Right <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> red are {{permitted}} {{in many regions}} of North America.

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 required in §362(c)(5) that in order for a state to receive federal assistance in developing mandated conservation programs, they must permit right <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> red lights. [...] All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have allowed right <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> red since 1980, except where prohibited by a sign or where right turns are controlled by dedicated traffic lights.

5|$|Failure usually meant {{six more}} months of sea service before the {{examination}} could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the midshipman a 'passed midshipman'. From the 18th century {{until the second}} half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission. Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others would wait their <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> a roster. During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing {{the outcome of}} the battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Olivia was {{considered}} the worst hurricane to hit Mazatlán, Sinaloa since 1943, {{in addition to being}} the strongest landfalling and costliest hurricane of the 1975 Pacific hurricane season. Olivia formed on October22 to the south of Mexico, quickly intensifying into a tropical storm. The storm moved northwestward initially, followed by a northeast <b>turn.</b> <b>On</b> October23, Olivia attained hurricane status, and the next day reached Category3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale just before moving ashore Mazatlán in northwest Mexico. Olivia destroyed 7,000houses in the region, leaving 30,000people homeless, and damage totaled $20million (1975USD, $ USD). The hurricane killed 30people, 20 of them from drowning in shrimp boats.|$|E
