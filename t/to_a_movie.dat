5|$|Because HBO {{does not}} break {{individual}} episodes with commercials, Carnivàle music is paced similar <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> with character-specific leitmotifs from {{as early as}} the first episode. Characters are musically identified by solo instruments chosen for the character's ethnic background or nature. Some characters whose connections are only disclosed later in the series have intentionally similar themes.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album {{to sound like a}} soundtrack <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie.</b> Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, in an effort to replicate the mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The Last Picture Show, and Vivre sa vie.|$|E
5|$|Ted (Josh Radnor) is at {{the clinic}} to remove his lower-back {{butterfly}} tattoo, where he is attracted to his doctor, Stella (Sarah Chalke). They agree to go <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie,</b> Plan 9 from Outer Space, but Ted does not realize Stella had brought her friends along with her, {{and it was not}} a date. At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her answer is still no. Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would {{be a good way to}} let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E

25|$|While the Oscar {{is owned}} by the recipient, it is {{essentially}} not on the open market. Michael Todd's grandson tried to sell Todd's Oscar statuette <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> prop collector in 1989, but the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction. Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful, some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the filmmakers}} worked around the stars' schedules, {{the filming of}} the whole movie took several years. While so many A-list actors were on board, most were not {{completely}} aware of what other sketches would {{be included in the}} film, which features thirteen vignettes tied together by a story of a mad screenwriter (Quaid) pitching ideas <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> producer (Kinnear). Penotti said many of the actors did not ask many questions about what else {{was going on in the}} film.|$|E
25|$|Transitioning from a {{television}} screen <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> meant that sets and designs {{needed to be}} more detailed, with {{a higher level of}} polish to stand up on the big screen. Zimmerman felt obliged to improve on the sets fans had watched for seven seasons, especially the bridge. Zimmerman repainted the set, added computer consoles, raised the captain's chair for a more commanding presence, and reworked the bridge's ceiling struts; Zimmerman had always been unhappy with how the ceiling looked but had never had the time or money to rework it previously.|$|E

Admission <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> for instance, may depend on age according to a motion picture rating system. A bus fare might be discounted for the young or old.

Murillo was lured into Bonin's van where he was bound, repeatedly raped, extensively bludgeoned about the skull with a tire iron, then strangled with a ligature before his nude body was thrown over an embankment into a bed of ivy alongside Highway 101. Eight days after the murder of David Murillo, on September 17, an 18-year-old Newport Beach youth named Robert Christopher Wirostek was abducted as he cycled to his job at a grocery store; his body was found on September 27 alongside Interstate 10.|$|E
25|$|B. F. Skinner, theorist of operant conditioning, {{shows how}} a pigeon has {{been taught to}} {{distinguish}} between two words and behaves appropriately depending on which one is being presented. It learned each response with a reward of food therefore its behaviour is being shaped by controlling its environment. An example of this conditioning in a consumer behaviour context is a cinema using a consumer incentive scheme. As a consumer, if one is given a card which entitles you to a free movie if you bring a friend and free popcorn on Tuesdays with {{the purchase of a}} ticket per se, one is more likely to go <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> when perhaps you wouldn’t have otherwise.|$|E
25|$|In 1870, the Patuxent Bank of Laurel {{was founded}} {{on the corner of}} Main Street and Washington Avenue. In 1874 a {{delegation}} was sent to Annapolis to introduce legislation to make Laurel its own county of 10,000 residents with land from Prince George’s, Howard, and Anne Arundel counties. In 1879 Laurel Academy of Music was built along Route 1. The building was converted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> theatre in 1915, with a parking garage on the lower floor of the wood structure; it burned in 1917, and Academy Ford built on the same site in the late 1900s. In 1888 inventor David J. Weems tested an unmanned electric train on a two-mile banked circular track near Laurel Station. The three-ton vehicle reached speeds of up to 120mph for twenty minutes.|$|E

25|$|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) signed Healy and his Stooges <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> {{contract}} in 1933. They appeared in feature films and short subjects, either together, individually, or with various combinations of actors. The trio {{was featured in}} a series of musical comedy shorts, beginning with Nertsery Rhymes. The short was one of a few shorts to be made with an early two-strip Technicolor process, including one featuring Curly without Healy or the other Stooges, Roast Beef and Movies (1934). The shorts themselves were built around recycled film footage of production numbers cut from MGM musicals, such as Children of Pleasure, Lord Byron of Broadway and the unfinished March of Time (all 1930), which had been filmed in early Technicolor. Soon, additional shorts followed (sans the experimental Technicolor), including Beer and Pretzels (1933), Plane Nuts (1933), Jail Birds of Paradise (1934) and The Big Idea (1934).|$|E
25|$|With four Rainbow Oscars, Joe and Silvia {{are sent}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> {{that takes place}} in the frozen mountains, where Frost Tiger (brother of Fire Leo, a boss from the {{previous}} game) protects the fifth Oscar and demands that Joe prove his inner strength in order to be worthy of it. Though successful, Joe's victory is short-lived when he is fooled by an impostor Silvia into giving Gedow the Oscars. Faced with his disastrous mistake, Joe and Silvia return to the original Captain Blue movie where they encounter Dr. Cranken again. The mad scientist reveals the impostor Silvia as Miss Bloody Rachel, a shapeshifting android programmed to destroy the heroes. As Rachel transforms into the previous bosses to fight back, Joe and Silvia attempt to reason with her by introducing the concept of a heart to her programming. Slowly, Rachel begins to understand and eventually chooses to side with the heroes. After Joe and Silvia finish off Dr. Cranken for good, Rachel gives them the sixth Rainbow Oscar.|$|E
25|$|Two {{months after}} the murder of Thomas Lundgren, on August 4, 1979, Bonin and Butts {{abducted}} a 17-year-old named Mark Shelton shortly after the youth left his Westminster home to walk <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>movie</b> theater near Beach Boulevard. Screams were heard from {{the vicinity of the}} Shelton household by neighbors, leaving a strong possibility Shelton was abducted by force. The youth was violated with foreign objects including a pool cue, causing his body to enter a state of shock which proved fatal. His body was then discarded in San Bernardino County. The following day, Bonin and Butts encountered a 17-year-old West German student named Markus Grabs attempting to hitchhike from Pacific Coast Highway. Grabs was bound with lengths of cord and ignition wire and driven to Bonin's home where he was sodomized, beaten, and stabbed a total of 77 times before his nude body was discarded in Malibu Creek, close to Las Virgenes Canyon Road. His body was found the following morning, with one investigator likening the network of injuries inflicted upon the victim to that of a rabid dog unable to determine when to cease biting.|$|E

Rice was at a party from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. at Rae Ann Schmitz's house. She testified as a first year law student and eventually became a member of his legal defense team. Cousins of Duane Peak, Frank and Will Peak, testified that Duane Peak's story of what he did the week before the bombing was a lie. Will Peak provided Poindexter with an alibi {{for the night}} that he was accused of building the bomb in David Rice's kitchen. The jury ignored it all. Norma Aufrecht, who allegedly drove Duane Peak from NCCF headquarters to David Rice's house, did not testify. She was charged with conspiracy to commit first degree murder and accessory after the fact. She would have testified that she did not drive Duane Peak on Sunday, August 16, but she was never deposed by the defense. She fled Omaha in fear and did not return to live there for 10 years after the trial.|$|E
