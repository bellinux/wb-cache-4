Meanwhile Nájí, who had told marvellous tales {{concerning}} a well in the neighbouring hills, which showed the foundations of houses in its bowels, was directed to guide Lieutenant Amir. He objected that the enormous distance would be trying to the stoutest mule, and yet he did not blush when it was reached after a mile's ride to the southwest (240° mag.).

The implanted yttrium substantially improved the scale resistance <b>to</b> <b>spalling,</b> only slightly affected the scale growth rate, and altered the scale morphology. On unimplanted material de-veloped ridged scales, while yttrium promoted the formation ofbuckled oxide layers, the higher the dose the more buckled the scale.

Introduction. The so-called reactive elements (Y, Sc, Ce) in most cases offer an improvement of the oxidation behaviour of the FeCrAl-type alumina forming alloys due to enhancing the scale resistance <b>to</b> <b>spalling</b> [l- 101.

40|$|Fire poses one of {{the most}} severe {{environmental}} conditions that can act on concrete structures as an external load and can induce severe damages (cracks, spalling) or even lead <b>to</b> collapse. Fire <b>spalling</b> of concrete is a complex phenomenon, which might occur due to pressure build-up in the pores, thermal and load-induced stresses. In this context, ordinary concrete specimens (B 40 -II and B 40 -III: fc 28 days ≈ 40 MPa) were exposed to standard fire curve (ISO 834 - 1), while a constant uniaxial or biaxial compressive load was applied. Six different levels of uniaxial compressive stress on cubes and four different levels of biaxial compressive stress on slabs have been investigated. The test results showed that loaded specimens are more susceptible <b>to</b> <b>spalling</b> than unloaded specimens, with increasing amount of spalling for higher values of applied load. It has been found that biaxially loaded specimens are more prone <b>to</b> <b>spalling</b> than uniaxially loaded specimens.

50|$|Where {{the main}} {{impediment}} is solid rock, entry may involve {{the use of}} explosive material, {{similar to those used}} to remove stumps on farms, or it may involve the practice of rock shaving, where small holes are drilled in the rock and a gunpowder charge is detonated <b>to</b> <b>spall</b> the rock off in thin layers. A similar technique, called plug and feather, involves driving wedges into lines of small diameter holes that have been drilled in the rock. As the wedges are driven into the holes, a crack forms along the line of holes and the rock is eventually broken.|$|E
5000|$|Rate of {{drilling}} {{is affected by}} the pressure of the column of mud in the borehole and its relative counterbalance to the internal pore pressures of the encountered rock. A rock pressure greater than the mud fluid will tend to cause rock fragments <b>to</b> <b>spall</b> as it is cut and can increase the drilling rate. [...] "D-exponents" [...] are mathematical trend lines which estimate this internal pressure. Thus both visual evidence of spalling and mathematical plotting assist in formulating recommendations for optimum drilling mud densities for both safety (blowout prevention) and economics. (Faster drilling is generally preferred.) ...|$|E

50|$|Hardness of a {{material}} to deformation {{is dependent on}} its microdurability or small-scale shear modulus in any direction, not to any rigidity or stiffness properties such as its bulk modulus or Young's modulus.

50|$|Chrome {{surfaces}} can {{be damaged}} by cleaning with abrasives and sharp/hardened metal utensils common in commercial cooking environments, so special spatulas, brushes and cleansers are recommended {{for the operation}} and maintenance of these products. If damage does occur to the chrome surface, food acids tend to penetrate and dissolve the metal substrate beneath the chrome coating, causing it <b>to</b> <b>spall</b> off. Chrome griddles can be cleaned with soapy water and a palmetto bristle brush. Metal scrapers and abrasives should be explicitly avoided, as they tend to damage the surface and permanently cloud the mirror finish. Special cleaning agents and powders specifically for use on chrome surfaces are also available.|$|E
50|$|Neodymium magnets, {{invented in}} the 1980s, are {{the strongest and}} most {{affordable}} type of rare-earth magnet. They are made of an alloy of neodymium, iron, and boron (Nd2Fe14B), sometimes abbreviated as NIB. Neodymium magnets are used in numerous applications requiring strong, compact permanent magnets, such as electric motors for cordless tools, hard disk drives, magnetic holddowns, and jewelry clasps. They have the highest magnetic field strength and have a higher coercivity (which makes them magnetically stable), {{but they have a}} lower Curie temperature, m and are more vulnerable to oxidation than samarium-cobalt magnets. Corrosion can cause unprotected magnets <b>to</b> <b>spall</b> off a surface layer, or to crumble into a powder. Use of protective surface treatments such as gold, nickel, zinc, and tin plating and epoxy resin coating can provide corrosion protection.|$|E
50|$|Laser induced {{spallation}} is {{a recent}} experimental technique developed to understand the adhesion of thin films with substrates. A high energy pulsed laser (typically Nd:YAG) is {{used to create a}} compressive stress pulse in the substrate wherein it propagates and reflects as a tensile wave at the free boundary. This tensile pulse spalls/peels the thin film while propagating towards the substrate. Using theory of wave propagation in solids it is possible to extract the interface strength. The stress pulse created in this fashion is usually around 3-8 nanoseconds in duration while its magnitude varies as a function of laser fluence. Due to the non-contact application of load, this technique is very well suited <b>to</b> <b>spall</b> ultra-thin films (1 micrometre in thickness or less). It is also possible to mode convert a longitudinal stress wave into a shear stress using a pulse shaping prism and achieve shear spallation.|$|E

50|$|Shock {{hardening}} is {{a process}} used to strengthen metals and alloys, wherein a shock wave produces atomic-scale defects in the material's crystalline structure. As in cold work, these defects interfere with the normal processes by which metallic materials yield (plasticity), making materials stiffer, but more brittle. When compared to traditional cold work, such an extremely rapid process results in a different class of defect, producing a much harder material for a given change in shape. If the shock wave applies too great a force for too long, however, the rarefaction front that follows it can form voids in the material due to hydrostatic tension, weakening the material and often causing it <b>to</b> <b>spall.</b> Since voids nucleate at large defects, such as oxide inclusions and grain boundaries, high-purity samples with a large grain size (especially single crystals) are able to withstand greater shock without spalling, and can therefore be made much harder.|$|E
50|$|Neutrons are {{uncharged}} {{constituents of}} atoms and penetrate materials well, deflecting {{only from the}} nuclei of atoms. The statistical accumulation of deflected neutrons at different positions beyond the sample {{can be used to}} find the structure of a material, and the loss or gain of energy by neutrons can reveal the dynamic behaviour of parts of a sample, for example diffusive processes in solids. At ISIS the neutrons are created by accelerating 'bunches' of protons in a synchrotron, then colliding these with a heavy tungsten metal target, under a constant cooling load to dissipate the heat from the 160 kW proton beam. The impacts cause neutrons <b>to</b> <b>spall</b> off the tungsten atoms, and the neutrons are channelled through guides, or beamlines, to around 20 instruments, each individually optimised for the study of different types of interactions between the neutron beam and matter. The target station and most of the instruments are set in a large hall. Neutrons are a dangerous form of radiation, so the target and beamlines are heavily shielded with concrete.|$|E
5000|$|Concrete cannot {{by itself}} {{withstand}} severe hydrocarbon fires. In the Channel tunnel {{that connects the}} United Kingdom and France, an intense fire broke out and reduced the concrete lining in the undersea tunnel down to about 50 mm. In ordinary building fires, concrete typically achieves excellent fire-resistance ratings, unless it is too wet, which can cause it to crack and explode. For unprotected concrete, the sudden endothermic reaction of the hydrates and unbound humidity inside the concrete generates pressure high enough <b>to</b> <b>spall</b> off the concrete, which falls in small pieces {{on the floor of}} the tunnel. Humidity probes are inserted into all concrete slabs that undergo fire testing to test for this, even for the less severe building elements curve (DIN4102, ASTM E119, BS476, or ULC-S101). The need for fireproofing was demonstrated, among other fire protection measures, in the European [...] "Eureka" [...] Fire Tunnel Research Project, which gave rise to in building codes for the trade to avoid the effects of such fires upon traffic tunnels. Cementitious spray fireproofing must be certification listed and applied in the field as per that listing, using a hydrocarbon fire test curve such as the one used in UL1709.|$|E

Ten years later, after weather-related expansion and contraction of the bridge, and the shedding {{of pieces of}} concrete due <b>to</b> <b>spalling,</b> SEPTA closed the bridge on October 25, 1986, truncating service at Cynwyd and suspended service to three of the line's six stations (Ivy Ridge, Manayunk, and Walnut Hill). Between 1996 and 1999, the bridge was stabilized and refurbished. The effort determined that the internal steel reinforcement was not compromised, as SEPTA had feared.

Later models were built with all-welded armor to eliminate this problem. These lessons had already been applied to the design and production of the M4.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was found}} in the part of the villa's former site that had belonged to conte Giuseppe Fede, and was quickly acquired by Thomas Jenkins, an English connoisseur and dealer in antiquities with deep connections to English aristocrats on the Grand tour. In 1792, the statue was purchased by the first Marquess of Lansdowne. The statue had been fragmentary when rediscovered. It was restored at that time, as fragmentary sculptures did not appeal to neoclassical taste; the sculptor responsible, who was probably Carlo Albacini, completed the statue's missing parts according to the taste of the day: the nose was completed, the right forearm, several fingers, the rear of the lion's hide, part of the right thigh and the whole of the left calf were sculpted and assembled as discreetly as possible. The restorations were removed in the 1970s, after it was detected that iron and lead pins connecting the restorations to the original were swelling from corrosion and threatening <b>to</b> <b>spall</b> off additional pieces of marble. The 18th-century restorations were in part replaced with casts in epoxy resin, [...] "to show the original as much as possible free of alien additions" [...] according to the conservator Jerry Podany.
