5|$|Liverpool had the {{majority}} of the possession up to this point, with Dortmund content to counter-attack. The tactic worked as Dortmund took lead in the 61st minute. Sigfried Held passed to Lothar Emmerich on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> side of the pitch, Emmerich played a lofted pass to Held, who volleyed the ball into the goal to give Dortmund a 1–0 lead. Seven minutes later Liverpool were level. Peter Thompson ran down <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> side of the pitch and passed to Roger Hunt who scored to level the match at 1–1. The linesman on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> side of the pitch signalled to the referee that the ball had gone out of play, yet the referee ignored him and allowed the goal to stand. There were few chances for either side {{until the end of the}} half when Liverpool had a chance to win the match, but Hunt's shot missed. With the scores still level at 1–1, the match went into extra-time.|$|E

5|$|The novella won the Hugo Award in 1972, and was {{nominated}} for several other awards. It received generally positive reviews from reviewers and scholars, and was variously described as moving and hard-hitting. Several critics, however, stated that it compared unfavorably with Le Guin's other works such as <b>The</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Hand</b> of Darkness, due to its sometimes polemic tone and lack of complex characters.|$|E

Ten minutes after the Indonesians were first seen, Private Sneddon, on the extreme left, engaged a group of six Indonesians with a long burst of machine-gun fire, killing two instantly and a third as he ran towards him. Haines subsequently killed a fourth, while a fifth Indonesian continued past him, followed by five others, who then engaged the Australians. The Indonesian patrol continued to advance, taking them towards {{the rear of the}} Australian positions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an analysis for electromagnetic energy in dispersive composite media based on classical electrodynamics. An {{investigation of the}} relation between reactance rate and electromagnetic energy derived from the Foster’s theorem is conducted. The material energy of this kind is discussed in the frequency band of <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> property. It is illustrated that the time average electromagnetic energy density is still positive even after an effect of dissipation is cancelled in <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> band, which is reasonable in physics...|$|R

5|$|Both of the attendants– Dakini to {{her left}} and Varnini to her right– are {{depicted}} nude, with matted or dishevelled hair, three-eyed, full-breasted, wearing the serpentine sacred thread and the mundamala, and carrying the skull-bowl in <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and the knife in the right. Sometimes, the attendants also hold severed heads (not their own). While Dakini is fair, Varnini is red-complexioned. In other depictions, both are depicted blue-grey. Sometimes, her attendants are depicted as skeletons and drinking the dripping blood from Chhinnamasta's severed head, rather than her neck. The attendants are absent in some depictions.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the other worlds of the Hainish universe, the relationship between Athshe and the League of Worlds is portrayed as ambiguous. Whereas with planets such as Gethen in <b>The</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Hand</b> of Darkness the integration with the Hainish planets {{is seen as a}} good thing, Athshe is seen as changed for the worse both by the loggers and by being taught to kill their own species. The League eventually decides to isolate Athshe and limit all contact with it, a decision shown to have ambiguous overtones.|$|E
5|$|Le Guin's father Alfred Louis Kroeber was an anthropologist, and the {{experience}} that this gave Le Guin influenced all of her works. The protagonists of many of Le Guin's novels, such as <b>The</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Hand</b> of Darkness and Rocannon's World, are also anthropologists or social investigators of some kind. Le Guin uses the term Ekumen for her fictional alliance of worlds, a term coined by her father, who derived it from the Greek Oikoumene to refer to Eurasian cultures that shared a common origin.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{to future}} history works by other authors such as Isaac Asimov, Le Guin's fictional works {{set in the}} Hainish {{universe}} explore the idea of human society expanding across the galaxy. Books like The Dispossessed, <b>The</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Hand</b> of Darkness, and The Word for World is Forest also explore the effects of various social and political systems. Le Guin's later Hainish novels also challenge contemporary ideas about gender, ethnic differences, the value of ownership, and human beings' relationship to the natural world.|$|E
5|$|The Triple Gate (Tam Quan) is {{accessible}} by both pedestrians and vehicles. Two-wheeled vehicles and pedestrians use {{the left and}} right wings respectively, and cars, buses, and trucks can use the central wing. The three gates represent emptiness, impermanence and middle-view. It is decorated with sculptures and engravings of lotuses, lanterns and swastikas, all prominent symbols in Buddhism. On <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> side of the grounds, there is a Bodhi tree, a symbol of the enlightenment of the Buddha. The tree is located in a concrete lotus, and around it are eight samsara-wheel-shaped signs that represent the Noble Eightfold Path. Signs with text explain each of the eight paths.|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} trefoil {{is famous}} for having a three-colouring which distinguishes it from the unknot. The three-colouring is also notorious for not distinguishing the right <b>handed</b> from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> trefoil. However {{with a bit of}} tweaking the three colours can also be used for this task. What lies behind the method is a new operation on biracks called doubling which converts the 3 -colour quandle into a biquandle. Colouring with this biquandle distinguishes the right <b>handed</b> from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>handed</b> trefoil. Equivalently it defines an element of the homology of the quandle or biquandle classifying space...|$|R
