40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the measurement models that appropriate to measure psychological attributes toward psychological scale. Measurement models <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> <b>is</b> parallel, tau-equivalent and congeneric models. Each model has different assumptions according to each item’s precision and scale measuring on psychological scale. As a sample of psychological scale, this study uses Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Data was taken from the 3. 183 adolescents from junior and senior high school in DIY, with ages ranging from 15 to 19. Both scale were tested using the Hotelling T 2 test for testing the equality of mean and variance as well as confi rmatory factory analysis through structural equation modeling to rest the accuracy of the model. This study found that psychological scales tend to fi t better with the congeneric model than others. The congeneric model is one which assumes that every item in a scale has a different precision and scale of measure. Therefore, it is concluded that items tend to be measured in psychological attributes, with relative variation...|$|E
40|$|An {{insertion}} in the lactococcal plasmid pGBK 17, which inactivated the gene(s) encoding {{resistance to}} the prolate-headed phage c 2, was cloned, sequenced, and identified as a new lactococcal insertion sequence (IS). IS 981 was 1, 222 bp in size and contained two open reading frames, one large enough to encode a transposase. IS 981 ended in imperfect inverted repeats of 26 of 40 bp and generated a 5 -bp direct repeat of target DNA {{at the site of}} insertion. IS 981 was present on the chromosome of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LM 0230 from where it transposed to pGBK 17 during transformation. Twenty-three strains of lactococci examined for the presence of IS 981 by Southern hybridization showed 4 to 26 copies per genome, with L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains containing the highest number of copies. Comparison of the DNA sequence and the amino acid sequence of the long open reading frame to other known sequences showed that IS 981 is related to a family of IS elements <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> <b>IS</b> 2, IS 3, IS 51, IS 150, IS 600, IS 629, IS 861, IS 904, and ISL 1...|$|E
