5|$|The {{alignment}} of today’s Route 124 was first {{designated as a}} part of pre-1927 Route 5 in 1916, a route that was to run from Delaware, Warren County to Newark. In 1927, <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> of the route became a part of Route 24, a route that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. A freeway, which is the current {{alignment of}} Route 24, was proposed for <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> of the route in the 1950s that was approved in 1960. Route 24 was moved to the new freeway between the John F. Kennedy Parkway on the Millburn/Summit border and Interstate 78 (I-78) in 1972, with Route 124 being designated along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point. In 1992, the Route 24 freeway was completed between I-287 in Hanover Township and the John F. Kennedy Parkway. As a result, Route 124 was extended west along the former Route 24 to U.S. Route 202 in Morristown.|$|E

5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Schuyler Avenue (which runs as Hudson County Route 507 {{to the south}} of Route 7 and Bergen County Route 130 to the north of Route 7), the road turns NNW, narrowing again to two lanes undivided. In <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> of the route, it had a concurrency with County Route 507 (both Bergen and Hudson counties). It keeps this configuration for about a half mile, as it still runs along the Kearny/North Arlington border. At that point, it meets the southern terminus of State Route 17 (Ridge Road) and the northern terminus of Hudson County Route 697 (Kearny Avenue).|$|E

The woods cease as NY441 approaches an interchange with Panorama Trail (NY153), the lone limited-access junction along the divided highway. East of NY153, NY441 crosses over Irondequoit Creek and downgrades to a four-lane undivided highway at a junction with Penfield Road. Here, Route441 becomes Penfield Road and enters the densely populated hamlet of Penfield.|$|E

5|$|Construction on I-270 {{began in}} 1965. The first portion cost about $2.7million. It opened in 1968, {{connecting}} I-70 to Vasquez Boulevard. Two years later, another two-mile (3.2km) segment connected the portion already {{in service to}} I-80S. I-80S became I-76 in 1976. Construction began on the section between I-76 and I-25 in April 1993 and was finished in September 1999, costing $11.4million. The mileposts were already established when construction took place, so the route was not assigned new mileposts. Completion of <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> largely decreased traffic problems in the area.|$|E

Other listed attractions along the byway near this section include Canyonlands National Park and various areas with Morrison Formation, a layer of rock where dinosaur remains are common. I-70, US-6, and US-50 all enter Colorado concurrently. Where I-70 follows the Book Cliffs, it was built parallel to or on top of US-6/50.|$|E

5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 3 was legislated to {{run along the}} Paterson Plank Road portion of today’s Route 120 {{as part of its}} route between Secaucus and Greenwood Lake. By 1947, Route 3 had been {{designated}} along the entire alignment of current Route 120. When New Jersey renumbered its state highways in 1953, Route 3 was moved to a new freeway alignment that was Route S3. As a result of this realignment, the portion of the route between modern Route 3 and Paterson Plank Road became a portion of Route 20 while the section along Paterson Plank Road was removed from the state highway system. Paterson Plank Road between County Route 503 and Route 17 joined the state highway system again as an extension of <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> of Route 20 in 1972 when the Meadowlands Sports Complex was slated to be built. At this point, Route 20 had consisted of three disconnected segments. Since none of these segments were connected, <b>this</b> <b>portion</b> of road was redesignated Route 120 by the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, several state {{highways}} concurrent with US 322 were removed, including Route S44, Route 51, Route 42, Route 48, and Route 55. The section of US 322 between former US 130 and Route 42 became state highway jurisdiction in 1955 after a state takeover. <b>This</b> <b>portion</b> was also designated {{as part of}} County Route 536 {{with the creation of}} the 500-series county routes in 1952. When the Commodore Barry Bridge opened in 1974 and replaced the ferry across the Delaware River, US 322 was moved to the new bridge approach and the former piece of the route to the ferry dock became Route 324.|$|E

Construction on these improvements was completed in 1986.
