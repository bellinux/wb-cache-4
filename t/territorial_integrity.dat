Despite {{more than two decades}} of unsuccessful efforts, including several documents controversial on one or both sides, there are still some disputable points waiting for the final settlement. It is expected to be reached by the Arbitration Tribunal established by the Arbitration Agreement between Croatia and Slovenia, signed in 2009.

The pro-British faction {{in the cabinet}} was isolated due to the British ambassador taking leave until 18 August. As the crisis deepened in Europe, Ottoman policy was to obtain a guarantee of <b>territorial</b> <b>integrity</b> and potential advantages, unaware that the British might enter a European war. On 30 July 1914, {{two days after the}} outbreak of the war in Europe, the Ottoman leaders agreed to form a secret Ottoman-German Alliance against Russia, although it did not require them to undertake military action.|$|E

American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American prisoners of war. The agreement guaranteed the <b>territorial</b> <b>integrity</b> of Vietnam and, like the Geneva Conference of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian Muslims' {{dissatisfaction with}} the Ustaše rule of the NDH and their need for {{protection}} were combined with nostalgia {{for the period of}} Habsburg rule in Bosnia and a generally friendly attitude towards Germany among prominent Bosnian Muslims. These factors led to a push towards autonomy for the Bosnian Muslim community which was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the <b>territorial</b> <b>integrity</b> of the NDH. By November 1942, the autonomists were desperate to protect the Muslim people and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich.|$|E

5|$|The fort's defenders, the Royal Fencible American Regiment led by Joseph Goreham, {{a veteran}} of the French and Indian War, {{successfully}} repelled several attempts by Eddy's militia to storm the fort, and the siege was ultimately relieved when the RFA plus Royal Marine reinforcements drove off the besiegers on November 29. In retaliation for the role of locals who supported the siege, numerous homes and farms were destroyed, and Patriot sympathizers were driven out of the area. The successful defense of Fort Cumberland preserved the <b>territorial</b> <b>integrity</b> of the British Maritime possessions, and Nova Scotia remained loyal throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|Calvert, {{a former}} high {{official}} {{in the government of}} King James I, asked the Privy Council for permission to build a colony, to be called Carolina, on land south of the Virginia settlements in area of the modern-day North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Claiborne arrived soon afterwards and expressed the concerns of Virginia that its <b>territorial</b> <b>integrity</b> was being threatened. He was joined in his protests by a group of London merchants who planned to build a sugar colony in the same area. Claiborne, still intent on his own project, received a royal trading commission through one of his London supporters in 1631, one which granted him the right to trade with the natives on all lands in the mid-Atlantic where there was not already a patent in effect.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July 1936, the Spanish Army {{launched}} a coup d'état, {{leading to a}} prolonged armed conflict between Spanish Republicans (the elected leftist national government) and the Nationalists (conservative, anti-communist rebels who included most officers of the Spanish Army). Julio Álvarez del Vayo, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, appealed to the League in September 1936 for arms to defend Spain's <b>territorial</b> <b>integrity</b> and political independence. The League members would not intervene in the Spanish Civil War nor prevent foreign intervention in the conflict. Adolf Hitler and Mussolini continued to aid General Francisco Franco's Nationalists, while the Soviet Union helped the Spanish Republic. In February 1937, the League did ban foreign volunteers, but this was in practice a symbolic move.|$|E

5000|$|United States Secretary of State John Hay {{had issued}} the [...] "Open Door Notes" [...] of September-November 1899, {{followed}} by a diplomatic circular in July 1900, asking {{that all of the}} major world powers with vested interests in China declare formally that they would maintain an 'open door' to allow all nations equal rights and equal access to the treaty ports within their spheres of influence in China. Fearing that the European powers and Japan were preparing to carve China up into colonies, Hay also added provisions that Chinese <b>territorial</b> and administrative <b>integrity</b> should be maintained.|$|R
5000|$|Millard {{has been}} {{described}} as an Open Door Realist, advocating passionately the view that the Open Door Policy in China, which upheld Chinese <b>territorial</b> and administrative <b>integrity</b> and advocated no interference with the free use of the treaty ports within their spheres of influence in China, should be backed by American military force as necessary. For Millard, the Open Door Policy involved the establishment of an American economic protectorate over China. Soon after the armistice of 1918 Millard strongly urged the United States to take an active and leading part in the reconstruction of China. Millard warned that [...] "our Eastern policy will not be respected until the world is convinced that failure to consider and meet our reasonable wishes carries a probability of war".|$|R
5|$|In 1921 the Protocol of Corfu was annulled {{during the}} Conference of Ambassadors and Northern Epirus was {{definitively}} ceded to the Albanian state. However attempts to re-establish an autonomous Northern Epirus continued. In 1921 the Albanian government, during the country's {{entrance to the}} League of Nations, committed itself {{to protect the rights}} of minorities within its territory, which were ratified by the local Parliament next year. However, these rights were granted within a much more limited area compared to the Protocol, which included only some villages in the regions of Himara, Gjirokastër and Sarande, and none of the main towns. Moreover, Greek education was viewed as a potential threat to the <b>territorial</b> <b>integrity</b> of the Albanian state and Greek schools were either closed or converted to Albanian ones. As a result of this policy, education in Greek was limited and for a time virtually eliminated (1934–1935). Only after the intervention of the Permanent Court of International Justice, in April 1935, did the Albanian side allow the reopening of Greek-language schools and waive its insistence on the use of Albanian in Greek schools.|$|E
5|$|Poland made a {{recovery}} under Mieszko's son, Duke Casimir I (r. 1039–1058), known to {{history as the}} Restorer. After returning from exile in 1039, Casimir rebuilt the Polish monarchy and the country's <b>territorial</b> <b>integrity</b> through several military campaigns: in 1047, Masovia was taken back from Miecław, a Polish noble who tried to detach the region from {{the rule of the}} Polish monarch, and in 1054 Silesia was recovered from the Czechs. Casimir was aided by recent adversaries of Poland, the Holy Roman Empire and Kievan Rus', both of whom disliked the chaos in Poland left after the dismemberment of the country beginning in the reign of Mieszko II. Casimir introduced a more mature form of feudalism and relieved the burden of financing large army units from the duke's treasury by settling his warriors on feudal estates. Faced with the widespread destruction of Greater Poland after the Czech incursion, Casimir moved his court to Kraków and replaced the old Piast capitals of Poznań and Gniezno; Kraków would function as the nation's capital for several centuries.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian Muslims sought {{protection}} and {{independence from the}} NDH, and saw German support {{as a means to}} achieve those aims. Prominent Bosnian Muslims were friendly towards Germany, and Bosnians were generally nostalgic over the former period of Habsburg (Austro-Hungarian) rule. This push was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the <b>territorial</b> <b>integrity</b> of the NDH. By November 1942, these Muslim autonomists were desperate to protect their people and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich. While this idea did not receive Hitler's approval, possibly because {{he did not want to}} create problems for Pavelić, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler saw this as an opportunity to create a Waffen-SS recruiting zone in the NDH to attract Bosnian Muslims. In early 1943, Hitler authorised the raising of the first SS division to be recruited from a non-Germanic people, the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian). The division was to be raised primarily from the Muslim population of the NDH.|$|E
5000|$|This {{coupling}} {{of religious}} and ethnic identity - principally Roman Catholic and Gaelic - {{as well as a}} consciousness of dispossession and defeat at the hands of British and Protestant forces, became enduring features of Irish nationalism. However, the Irish Catholic movements of the 16th century were invariably led by a small landed and clerical elite. Professor Kevin Whelan has traced the emergence of the modern Catholic-nationalist identity that formed in 1760-1830. Irish historian Marc Caball, on the other hand, claims that [...] "early modern Irish nationalism" [...] began to be established after the Flight of the Earls (1607), based on the concepts of [...] "the indivisibility of Gaelic cultural <b>integrity,</b> <b>territorial</b> sovereignty, and the interlinking of Gaelic identity with profession of the Roman Catholic faith".|$|R
50|$|In the 1890s {{the major}} world powers (France, the Britain, Germany, Japan, and Russia) began carving out spheres of {{influence}} for themselves in China, which was then under the Qing dynasty. The United States demanded this practice to end so that all nations could trade on an equal footing. In 1899, U.S. Secretary of State John Hay sent diplomatic letters to these nations, asking them to guarantee the <b>territorial</b> and administrative <b>integrity</b> of China and to {{not interfere with the}} free use of treaty ports within their respective {{spheres of influence}}. The major powers evaded commitment, saying they could not agree to anything until the other powers had consented first. Hay took this as acceptance of his proposal, which {{came to be known as}} the Open Door Policy.|$|R
25|$|The {{new king}} was popular, but his {{security}} was not certain.

Carlos IV protested his abdication and appealed to Napoleon for assistance. With the two rivals openly craving his mediation, the emperor {{was placed in}} an ideal position to control events. He summoned Carlos, María Luisa and Fernando to meet him for a conference at Bayonne (Godoy was rescued from captivity and transported to France). With all the contestants united in his presence, Napoleon demanded that the rival kings renounce the throne and hand it to the emperor. Carlos assented, and on 5 May, Fernando's defiance was overcome and the throne was formally signed over to Napoleon in exchange for generous pensions for the royal family and guarantees of <b>territorial</b> and religious <b>integrity</b> for Spain.|$|R
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the <b>territorial</b> <b>integrity</b> of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
5|$|Joseph married Max Joseph's sister, Maria Josepha, in 1765, {{hoping he}} could claim the Bavarian {{electorate}} for his offspring. After {{two years of}} unhappy marriage, Maria Josepha died without issue. When Max Joseph died ten years later, Joseph could only present a weak legal claim to Lower Bavaria through a dubious and ancient grant made by the Emperor Sigismund to the House of Habsburg in 1425. Knowing its poor legal grounds, Joseph negotiated a secret agreement with Charles Theodore shortly after Max Joseph's death. In this agreement (3 January 1778), Charles Theodore ceded Lower Bavaria to Austria in exchange for uncontested succession to {{the remainder of the}} duchy. Charles Theodore also hoped to acquire from Joseph some unencumbered parts of the Austrian Netherlands and parts of Anterior Austria that he could bequeath to his bastards, but this was not written into the agreement and Joseph was not a particularly generous man. Furthermore, the agreement entirely ignored the interests of Charles Theodore's own heir presumptive, Charles II August, of the House of Palatinate-Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld. Charles August was the presumptive heir of Charles Theodore's domains and titles. He had a clear and direct interest in the disposition of the Bavarian duchy, especially in its <b>territorial</b> <b>integrity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ukrainian {{independence}} {{was confirmed by}} a referendum held on 1 December 1991. In this referendum, 54% of Crimean voters supported independence from the Soviet Union. This {{was followed by a}} 1992 vote by the Crimean parliament to hold a referendum on independence from Ukraine, which spawned a two-year crisis over the status of Crimea. At the same time, the Supreme Soviet of Russia voted to void the cession of Crimea to Ukraine. In June of the same year, the Ukrainian government in Kiev voted to give Crimea a large amount autonomy as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea within Ukraine. Despite this, fighting between the Crimean government, Russian government, and Ukrainian government continued. In 1994, Russian nationalist Yuri Meshkov won the 1994 Crimean presidential election, and implemented the earlier approved referendum on the status of Crimea. 1.3 million people voted in this referendum, 78.4% of whom supported greater autonomy from Ukraine, whilst 82.8% supported allowing dual Russian-Ukrainian citizenship. Later in that same year, the status of Crimea as part of Ukraine was recognised by Russia, which pledged to uphold the <b>territorial</b> <b>integrity</b> of Ukraine in the Budapest Memorandum. This treaty was also signed by the United States, United Kingdom, and France. Ukraine revoked the Constitution of Crimea and abolished the office of President of Crimea in 1995. Crimea was granted a new constitution in 1998, which granted lesser autonomy than the previous one. Crimean officials would later seek to restore the powers of the previous constitution. Throughout the 1990s, many Crimean Tatar deportees and their descendants returned to Crimea.|$|E
