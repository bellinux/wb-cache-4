2500|$|The {{leadership}} of the new organization included such prominent activists as Lucretia Mott, Lucy Stone and Frederick Douglass. Its drive for universal suffrage, however, was resisted by some abolitionist leaders and their allies in the Republican Party, who wanted women to postpone their campaign for suffrage until after it had been achieved for male African Americans. [...] Horace Greeley, a prominent newspaper editor, told Anthony and Stanton, [...] "This is a critical period for the Republican Party {{and the life of}} our Nation... I conjure you <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is 'the negro's hour,' and your first duty now is to go through the State and plead his claims." [...] Anthony and Stanton refused to postpone their demands and continued to push for universal suffrage.|$|E
2500|$|There's {{no doubt}} Iraq hasn't fully {{complied}} with its disarmament obligations {{as set forth}} by the Security Council in its resolution. But on the other hand, since 1998 Iraq has been fundamentally disarmed: 90-95% of Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} capacity has been verifiably eliminated... We have <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> missing 5-10% doesn't necessarily constitute a threat... It constitutes bits and pieces of a weapons program which in its totality doesn't amount to much, but which is still prohibited... We can't give Iraq a clean bill of health, therefore we can't close the book on their weapons of mass destruction. But simultaneously, we can't reasonably talk about Iraqi non-compliance as representing a de-facto retention of a prohibited capacity worthy of war. (page 28) ...|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Maus of BikePortland.org {{described}} the sculpture as a [...] "functional work of public art {{that will serve}} {{not just as a}} place to store Zoobomb bikes and equipment, but as a visual testimony to what makes Portland, Portland", and called the day of its installation one that [...] "will live forever in Portland's bike-cultural history". Furthermore, he said the work recognizes Zoobomb as a tradition, a [...] "civic and cultural institution with deep connections" [...] to the city. In his coverage of the dedication ceremony, Maus wrote: [...] "It's important <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is not just for Zoobomb. It's for all of us. It's from a City that encourages and recognizes the power of creative expression and activism embodied not just in a physical monument, but in the spirit of every Portlander." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of ethical consideration, most {{research}} into diseases and conditions affecting fetal development has been restricted {{to the use of}} other animals aside from human beings. [...] Most accounts on the implications caused by diseases or conditions like rubella, hypothyroidism and intrauterine hypoxia involving humans have come from studies done on patients later in life, or more appropriately, after birth. [...] Although there is much evidence that points towards these prenatal diseases or conditions being precursors for improper brain development, and thus potential consequences for memory, it is hard to assume that these alone are the only cause. [...] If one could test for, and track the onset of the disease during gestation while screening potential extraneous variables, one may be able to better understand this topic. [...] It is important <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a newer, less explored, aspect of memory research. [...] If anything can be taken from this, it should be that most of these diseases or conditions resulting in poor fetal brain development can be prevented or mitigated if one exercises healthy living behaviour. [...] A large part of this involves proper nutrition and dieting.|$|E

5000|$|Rice's {{policy as}} Secretary of State viewed {{counter-terrorism}} {{as a matter}} of being preventative, and not merely punitive.

If they succeed in committing their crime, then hundreds or indeed thousands of people die. That's why you have to prevent, and intelligence is the long pole in the tent in preventing attacks." ...|$|R

60|$|You are <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> homage {{is one of}} the few {{surviving}} {{impressions of}} one who came into personal contact with Cesare, and of one, moreover, representing a Government more or less inimical to him, who would therefore have no reason to draw a favourable portrait of him for that Government's benefit. One single page of such testimony is worth a dozen volumes of speculation and inference drawn afterwards by men who never knew him--in many cases by men who never began to know his epoch.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is indeed," [...] {{agreed the}} Wizard. [...] "But the {{remarkable}} thing, to me, is {{how such a}} young boy ever learned {{the secret of the}} Magic Word of Transformation.

60|$|It is, however, <b>to</b> be <b>remembered</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{quietness}} {{in character}} of subject {{was much more}} possible to an early painter, owing to the connection in which his works were to be seen. A modern picture, isolated and portable, must rest all its claims to attention on its own actual subject: but {{the pictures of the}} early masters were nearly always parts of a consecutive and stable series, in which many were subdued, like the connecting passages of a prolonged poem, in order to enhance the value or meaning of others. The arrangement of the subjects in the Arena Chapel is in this respect peculiarly skilful; and to that arrangement we must now direct our attention.|$|R
30|$|This {{period of}} {{structural}} change inevitably altered {{the distribution of}} occupational rents against rural labour, which increased rural-urban inequality and exacerbated the deflationary tendencies of the transformation. To fully grasp the distributional implications, it is useful <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> during <b>this</b> period initial levels of inequality were already high. Piketty (2014) notes that from 1800 – 1910, private capital {{as a percentage of}} national income was on average 700 % for Germany, France and Britain, while in the USA, it ranged from 300 to 500 %. In agrarian economies, the ownership of capital was highly concentrated leading to significant inequalities of wealth and income. Though some landowners had lost private wealth during the agrarian transformation, the loss of agricultural employment countered any tendency to reduce wealth inequality.|$|R
60|$|Hydrogen {{gives rise}} to no {{substance}} that can become solid, either during combustion or afterwards {{as a product of}} its combustion. But when it burns, it produces water only; and if we take a cold glass and put it over the flame, it becomes damp, and you have water, produced immediately in appreciable quantity; and nothing is produced by its combustion but the same water which you have seen the flame of the candle produce. It is important <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> hydrogen is the only thing in nature which furnishes water as the sole product of combustion.|$|E
6000|$|But he {{was forced}} <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> could not be so. His mother's trial was not yet over, {{and even in the}} midst of his own {{personal}} trouble he remembered that the verdict to her was still a matter of terrible import. He would not let it be known that he had abandoned the property, at any rate till that verdict had been given. And then as he moved back to the house he tried to think in what way it would become him to behave to his mother. [...] "She can never be my mother again," [...] he said to himself. They were terrible words;--but then was not his position very terrible? ...|$|E
60|$|My {{mother had}} {{arranged}} everything, ruling naturally {{as if she}} were the mistress of the house. Thus she installed me in the great room where I had seen the old Marquis, though I would rather she had retained it, and given me that which I had occupied when I was there with my husband. However, I made no objection, for I felt so much vexed that I was extremely afraid of saying something to show that I thought she ought <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was my house, and that she was my guest. I would not for the world have uttered anything so ungenerous and unfilial; and all I could do that night was to pray that she might not drive me to lose my self-command, and that I might both do right and keep my child.|$|E
60|$|But it is {{necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> next <b>that</b> <b>this</b> empire was not always at its evening. Byzantium was not always Byzantine.

We must remember Rome as well as Byzantium; as indeed nobody would remember Byzantium {{if it were not for}} Rome. The more I saw of a hundred little things the more my mind revolved round that original idea which may be called the Mediterranean; and the fact that it became two empires, but remained one civilisation, just as it has become two churches, but remained one religion.|$|R

50|$|While ethicists {{are able}} to come up with Feminist {{approaches}} to Judaism, this often becomes complicated when examining specific rituals and practices of Judaism. When examining the practice and actions of Judaism, as opposed to the thoughts and beliefs, many issues arise.
