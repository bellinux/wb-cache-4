40|$|Early {{endoderm}} {{formation in}} zebrafish requires {{at least three}} loci that function downstream of Nodal signaling but upstream of the early endodermal marker sox 17 : bonnie and clyde (bon), faust (fau), and casanova (cas). cas mutants show the most severe phenotype as they do not form any gut tissue and lack all sox 17 expression. Activation of the Nodal signaling pathway or overexpression of Bon or Fau/Gata 5 fails to restore any sox 17 expression in <b>cas</b> mutants, demonstrating <b>that</b> <b>cas</b> plays {{a central role in}} endoderm formation. Here we show <b>that</b> <b>cas</b> encodes a novel member of the Sox family of transcription factors. Initial cas expression appears in the dorsal yolk syncytial layer (YSL) in the early blastula, and is independent of Nodal signaling. In contrast, endodermal expression of cas, which begins in the late blastula, is regulated by Nodal signaling. Cas is a potent inducer of sox 17 expression in wild-type embryos as well as in bon and fau/gata 5 mutants. Cas is also a potent inducer of sox 17 expression in MZoep mutants, which cannot respond to Nodal signaling. In addition, ectopic expression of cas in presumptive mesodermal cells leads to their transfating into endoderm. Altogether, these data indicate <b>that</b> <b>Cas</b> is the principal transcriptional effector of Nodal signaling during zebrafish endoderm formation...|$|R

40|$|SummaryIn zebrafish, {{endoderm}} induction {{occurs in}} marginal blastomeres and requires Casanova (Cas), the first endoderm-specific factor {{expressed in the}} embryo. Whereas the transcription factors Gata 5 and Bon are necessary and sufficient for cas expression in marginal blastomeres, Bon and Gata 5 are unable to induce cas in animal pole cells, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>cas</b> expression requires an additional, unidentified factor(s). Here, we show <b>that</b> <b>cas</b> expression depends upon the T box transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes), a maternal determinant that is localized to marginal blastomeres. Eomes synergizes potently with Bon and Gata 5 to induce cas, even in animal pole blastomeres. We show that Eomes is required for endogenous endoderm induction, acting via an essential binding site in the cas promoter. Direct physical interactions between Eomes, Bon, and Gata 5 suggest that Eomes promotes endoderm induction in marginal blastomeres by facilitating the assembly of a transcriptional activating complex on the cas promoter...|$|R

40|$|Crk-associated {{substrate}} (Cas) is a tyrosine-phosphorylated docking {{protein that}} is indispensable for {{the regulation of}} the actin cytoskeletal organization and cell migration in fibroblasts. The function of Cas in neurons, however, is poorly understood. Here we report <b>that</b> <b>Cas</b> is dominantly enriched in the brain, especially the cerebellum, of postnatal mice. During cerebellar development, Cas is highly tyrosine phosphorylated and is concentrated in the neurites and growth cones of granule cells. Cas coimmunoprecipitates with Src family protein tyrosine kinases, Crk, and cell adhesion molecules and colocalizes with these proteins in granule cells. The axon extension of granule cells is inhibited by either RNA interference knockdown of Cas or overexpression of the Cas mutant lacking the YDxP motifs, which are tyrosine phosphorylated and thereby interact with Crk. These findings demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>Cas</b> acts as a key scaffold that links the proteins associated with tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathways to the granule cell axon elongation...|$|R
40|$|Embryonic {{development}} requires generating cell types at {{the right}} place (spatial patterning) and the right time (temporal patterning). Drosophila neuroblasts undergo stem cell-like divisions to generate an ordered sequence of neuronal progeny, making them an attractive system to study temporal patterning. Embryonic neuroblasts sequentially express Hunchback, Krüppel, Pdm 1 /Pdm 2 (Pdm), and Castor (Cas) transcription factors. Hunchback and Krüppel specify early-born temporal identity, but the role of Pdm and Cas in specifying temporal identity has never been addressed. Here we show <b>that</b> Pdm and <b>Cas</b> regulate late-born motor neuron identity within the NB 7 - 1 lineage: Pdm specifies fourth-born U 4 motor neuron identity, while Pdm/Cas together specify fifth-born U 5 motor neuron identity. We conclude <b>that</b> Pdm and <b>Cas</b> specify late-born neuronal identity; <b>that</b> Pdm and <b>Cas</b> act combinatorially to specify a temporal identity distinct from either protein alone, and <b>that</b> <b>Cas</b> repression of pdm expression regulates the generation of neuronal diversity...|$|R

40|$|For the {{emerging}} amphibian genetic model Xenopus tropicalis targeted gene disruption {{is dependent on}} zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) or transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), which require either complex design and selection or laborious construction.

Here, we report <b>that</b> RNA-guided <b>Cas</b> 9 nuclease resulted in precise targeted gene disruption in all ten X. tropicalis genes that we analyzed, with efficiencies above 45 % and readily up to 100 %. Systematic point mutation analyses in two loci revealed that perfect matches between the spacer and the protospacer sequences proximal to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) were essential for Cas 9 to cleave the target sites in the X. tropicalis genome. Further study showed <b>that</b> the <b>Cas</b> 9 system could serve as an efficient tool for multiplexed genome engineering in Xenopus embryos. Analysis of the disruption of two genes, ptf 1 a/p 48 and tyrosinase, indicated <b>that</b> <b>Cas</b> 9 -mediated gene targeting can facilitate direct phenotypic assessment in X. tropicalis embryos. Finally, five founder frogs from targeting of either elastase-T 1, elastase-T 2 or tyrosinase showed highly efficient transmission of targeted mutations into F 1 embryos.
