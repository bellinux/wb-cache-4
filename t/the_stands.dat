Somehow Garin held on to his lead of two metres, two little metres for a legendary victory. <b>The</b> <b>stands</b> {{exploded}} and the ovation united the two men. Garin exulted under the cheers of the crowd. Cordang cried bitter tears of disappointment.|$|E

5|$|Ann Arbor {{was founded}} in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders and <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> of Bur Oak trees.

5|$|Easter Road is an all-seated stadium, {{split into}} four {{geographic}} sections, {{known as the}} Famous Five (formerly North), East, South and West Stands. The Famous Five and South Stands are the oldest part of the present stadium, built in 1995. Each stand has two tiers, a cantilevered roof and a capacity of nearly 4,000. To keep {{within the boundaries of}} the site, the upper deck of each stand angles toward the centre. When <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> were built, the Famous Five Stand was above pitch level and the South Stand was below, but this was corrected when the natural slope was removed. Each stand also stretched beyond the east touchline, which was corrected by widening the pitch when the East Stand was rebuilt. Between the two tiers of the Famous Five Stand there are function suites and lounges. Before <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> were rebuilt in the 1990s, the north and south ends of Easter Road were known as the Cowshed and Dunbar End respectively. The southern end was called the Dunbar End because there was a lemonade factory named Dunbar's located behind it.|$|E

On a July 7 game against the Oakland Athletics, while in <b>the</b> <b>stands,</b> he caught Nelson Cruz's 300th home run.|$|E
50|$|In 1990s Findus ceased {{production}} in the town, so <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> went through several other sponsored names. Firstly <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> was renamed <b>the</b> Stones Bitter <b>stand</b> before later becoming <b>the</b> John Smiths <b>stand</b> in 1997 and then <b>the</b> Carlsberg <b>stand</b> in 2004. Findus returned to the Town in 2009 and <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> then reverted to its original name.|$|R

5|$|In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting {{his players}} {{to be more}} {{distinctly}} dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for {{the origin of the}} white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> West <b>stand</b> {{runs along}} <b>the</b> {{length of the}} pitch and is <b>the</b> stadium's largest <b>stand.</b> <b>The</b> <b>stand</b> {{contains}} a number of executive boxes along its length as well as restaurants etc. <b>The</b> <b>stand</b> houses <b>the</b> changing rooms, and the players tunnel emerges {{from the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>stand.</b> White seating in the top tier spells out the club's nickname [...] "BORO".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> North <b>Stand</b> was {{completed}} first (before <b>the</b> South <b>Stand),</b> which enabled Halifax Town {{to return to}} the Football League when it won the Conference in 1998. <b>The</b> South <b>Stand</b> {{was completed}} within the next year. <b>The</b> <b>stand</b> is usually where away fans are housed. In recent times <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> hasn't been used as Halifax Town's opponents don't tend to bring a large following of supporters. For rugby league <b>the</b> <b>stand</b> is usually open. It is an all-stander stand.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> East <b>Stand</b> is a two-tier development, {{completed}} in 1993.

5|$|In early 1942, {{with the}} United States now embroiled World War II, Arthur Compton {{concentrated}} the Manhattan Project's various teams working on plutonium at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. Zinn used athletes to build Fermi's increasingly large experimental configurations under <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> of the disused Stagg Field. In July 1942, Fermi measured a k = 1.007 from a uranium oxide lattice. This raised hopes that pure uranium would yield a suitable value of k.|$|E

5|$|Ninety {{seconds after}} Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams' {{players and coaches}} were huddled at midcourt, {{attempting}} to calm down Wallace (Tayshaun Prince was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions). While Artest {{was lying on the}} table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches. A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him in the chest. Artest jumped off the table, ran into <b>the</b> <b>stands,</b> and grabbed a man, Michael Ryan, who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Boyle stood up to try and hold back Artest and was trampled in the effort, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a gouge on his head. Jackson followed Artest into <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> and punched a fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Artest's face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Pacers players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who was not dressed for the game due to injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio analyst and former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> to retrieve Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's brother, David, to Jones. More fans then began throwing drinks and other objects, while a number of fans spilled out onto the court.|$|E

5|$|Such was the {{disappointment}} at losing the Ashes, Collins was stripped {{not only of}} the New South Wales captaincy but also that of his local club, Waverley. Former players, including his former Waverley captain, the influential Monty Noble, publicly criticised Collins' captaincy.
