5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E

In this design there was an aisle on the lower level only, and set against one side instead of centerline. The lower level also contained six single bedrooms and a toilet. The upper level would have eight two-person [...] "Vista Bedrooms" [...] which spanned {{the width of the}} car. Access to these rooms would be from four sets of stairs from the lower level aside. Each Vista Bedroom would contain an individual toilet and two beds: one stacked above <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> single bedroom beneath, and one lengthwise over the aisle.|$|E

40|$|In {{northwest}} Leicestershire and South Derbyshire {{there are}} eight inliers of Carboniferous Limestone. The five Eastern Inliers consist mainly of thick to massive bedded dolomite of C.;S.;to age and has been namedthe Cloud Hill Dolomite Formation. The Formation has been divided into three ffiemberss (l) <b>the</b> I'lassive <b>Bedded</b> Dolomite Member; (2) the Red Bed Member.;(5) the Biohem Member. The three Western Inliers and <b>the</b> topmost <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southernmost of the Eastern Inliers consist of thin to thick bedded limestone and dolomitic limestone with interbedded shale and are D 2 agej <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> have been named the Ticknall Limestone Formation and divided into two members: (l) the Limestone and Shale Member; (2) <b>the</b> Thick <b>Bedded</b> Limestone and Dolomite Member. <b>The</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Inliers have been strongly dolomitized and are mostly medium to coarsely crystalline dolomite with fossil remains completely destroyed <b>in</b> most cases. <b>The</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Inliers 5 apart from patchy dolomitization of <b>the</b> topmost <b>beds,</b> are largely biomicrite and biomicrudite with interbedded quartz-rich shale. Fossil remains are abundant and well preserved. Dolomitization of <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in.</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Inliers {{is thought to have}} resulted from the invasion of magnesian brines originating from buried sub- Vise'an evaporites; <b>the</b> patchy dolomitization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Inliers probably resulted from Mg∼rich groundwater penetrating <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> from <b>the</b> overlying Trias sic I-Iarl. <b>The</b> Massive <b>Bedded</b> Dolomite Member and the Red Bed Member appear to have been deposited mainly in intertidal conditions, while the Bioherm Member and Ticknall Formation are likely to have been deposited in subtidal conditions. A review of Kent's criteria for distinguishing between gulf and block facies suggests the need for a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southwest Widmerpool Gulf boundary. <b>The</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eight inliers are highly disturbed structurally, with near vertical strata <b>in</b> <b>the</b> four northernmost Eastern Inliers intersected by normal, reverse, and strike-slip faults, the strike of <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> between <b>the</b> Eastern Inliers offset by sinistral faults, a small anticline through the Western Inliers, and both sets of inliers bounded by post-Carboniferous faulting. <b>The</b> uplift of <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Inliers is thought {{to be the result of}} late Carboniferous to early post-Carboniferous diapirism involving concealed pre-Visean evaporites...|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Knock You Down", {{directed}} by Chris Robinson, premiered on March 23, 2009. The video begins with Hilson slowly falling backwards onto a bed, and then West appears and raps the introduction. Both start reflecting on their previous relationship, before the clip flashes {{back to the}} previous events. West is shown to be an artist, who is painting a portrait of Hilson. Hilson and West begin to caress each other, as she as shown in several seductive poses in a bed and sings {{in front of a}} white backdrop. The video returns to the present, showing Hilson and West breaking up, as both of them fall backwards onto the floor, similar to the way Hilson falls onto <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening sequence. Visual effects come into play greater in this scene, as when West falls, he shatters into pieces. Ne-Yo then appears, and sings his lines in front of a grey backdrop. Ne-Yo and Hilson proceed to go on a date at a party in West and Hilson's apartment, and are seen being affectionate by West. He then confronts Hilson, and Ne-Yo also approaches the duo before Hilson walks off, torn between the two men. The clip ends with Hilson falling backwards onto a bed, in similar fashion as the opening scene.|$|E
500|$|As {{stated by}} Jason Lipshutz of Billboard, in this video, Rihanna {{returned}} to nature as in her video for her previous single, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)", which features {{nearly the same}} colors as the [...] "California King Bed" [...] video. Lipshutz also commented that Rihanna's just rolled-out-bed appearance is completed by the modest, cream-colored attire in the airy, light-filled clip. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the video, writing: [...] "Instead of being in complete control, here she is—vulnerable, open, and unsure. The video captures the feel of 'King Bed,' not that it's a difficult one to grasp." [...] Jessica Sinclair of Long Island Press was also positive about the video, praising the sensual side of Rihanna. A writer of The Huffington Post concluded: [...] "In the video for her new video, 'California King Bed,' the Barbadian pop star slows it down and shows her sensitive side, holding notes and bearing her soul over a troubled relationship. Set entirely in a gorgeously pink-palleted open air room overlooking the beach, the winds swirl and blow the curtains dramatically around the heart broken singer." [...] The writer finished the review saying that [...] "Not much happens in the video – but then, that's the point." [...] Amber Katz of MTV Buzzworthy compared the video with Fergie's [...] "Big Girls Don't Cry" [...] saying, that they [...] "Both are midtempo, ballady and filmed in a soft-focus domestic setting." [...] Katz also complimented <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video saying that it [...] "evoke a very Caribbean vibe, a shout-out to Rihanna's native Barbados, no doubt." [...] A writer of Daily Mail complimented Rihanna's looks in the video, saying that it showed her [...] "most sultry" [...] side. Both Nicole Eggenberger of OK! and Eleanor Young of Marie Claire commented that the video uses a lot of sex appeal which was a departure from Rihanna's older videos.|$|E
