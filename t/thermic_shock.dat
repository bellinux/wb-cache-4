Observou-se também que o fotoblastismo das sementes não foi alterado por tratamento com temperaturas de 35 a 80 ºC durante 30 minutos. Os resultados obtidos mostram que sementes de P. speciosus possuem elevada capacidade de sobrevivência à temperatura atingida durante as queimadas que ocorrem anualmente nos campos cerrados. Seeds of Paepalanthus speciosus Koern. - Eriocaulaceae, when {{enclosed}} into naked {{fruits and}} in the diaspores, showed tolerance at <b>thermic</b> <b>shock</b> until 70 ºC during 30 min. and this capacity was not modified when the <b>thermic</b> <b>shock</b> happened 24 h after the imbebition. Seed photoblastism was not affected by treatment with temperatures from 35 to 80 ºC during 30 min. These results showed that seeds of P. speciosus have high capacity of survival at temperature developed during the burn of annual occurrence on "campo rupestre"...|$|E
40|$|Thermic shocks in rolling {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} {{produced in the}} beginning of the rolling process, when some compulsory conditions are subdued, especially when the rolling cylinders are not correctly warmed up and the initial temperature in the production plants during the cold season are low – such conditions are meant for a correct use of the stands. This paper work refers to some research that has been done about the <b>thermic</b> <b>shock</b> produced inside the warm rolling cylinders due to the instantaneous variation of temperature, caused by repeated warming and cooling off of the rolling cylinders. On one hand, these get warm in case of almost 1100 o C, due to their contact with the incandescent half-manufactured product, and on the other hand, they cool off into water...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAcross bacterial, archaeal and {{eukaryotic}} kingdoms, {{heat shock}} proteins (HSPs) {{are defined as}} a class of highly conserved chaperone proteins that are rapidly induced in response to temperature increase through dedicated heat shock transcription factors. While this transcriptional response governs cellular adaptation of fungal, plant and animal cells to <b>thermic</b> <b>shock</b> {{and other forms of}} stress, early-branching eukaryotes of the kinetoplastid order, including trypanosomatid parasites, lack classical mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and show largely constitutive expression of HSPs, thus raising important questions on the function of HSPs in the absence of stress and the regulation of their chaperone activity in response to environmental adversity. Understanding parasite-specific mechanisms of stress-response regulation is especially relevant for protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania that are adapted for survival inside highly toxic phagolysosomes of host macrophages causing the various immuno-pathologies of leishmaniasis. Here we review recent advances on the function and regulation of chaperone activities in these kinetoplastid pathogens and propose a new model for stress-response regulation through a reciprocal regulatory relationship between stress kinases and chaperones that may be relevant for parasite-adaptive differentiation and infectivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} research was to produce triploid offspring of O. niloticus, applying warm <b>thermic</b> <b>shocks</b> (41 A- 42 oC) to eggs during 3, 5 - 4 min., 3, 5 mino after fertilization, or cold shocks (10, 8 - 11, 3 oC) to oocytes during one hour, 5 min after their fertilization. The best tissue to confirm triploids was kidney and brain of larvae and alevines. Then, the survival of fertilized eggs and growth rate were determined. The results show that the warm and cold shocks are efficient to produce 100 % triploids, with different rates of survival. Also, that 25, 5 % oftspring was deformed when cold shocks were applyed, and 32, 5 % deformities with warm shocks. There were not significant difterences in growth between triploid and diploid populationsafter three months of age. La triploidía se obtuvo aplicando choques térmicos calientes (41. 4 - 42 OC) a oocitos durante 3. 5 - 4 minutos, 3. 5 min. después de la fertilización, y choques térmicos fríos (10. 8 - 11. 3 oC) a oocitos durante una hora, 5 minutos de su fertilización. La triploidía se comprobó por análisis cromosomal en larvas y alevinos. Luego se monitoreó la tasa de crecimiento y sobrevivencia de los huevos fertilizados. Los resultados indican que los choques calientes y fríos fueron eficientes para producir ciento por ciento de triploidía, con tasas variables de sobrevivencia. Se observaron deformidades de peces trioloides (25. 5 % con choques frfos, y 32. 5 % con choques calientes). No se encontraron diferencias significativas en el crecimiento entre poblaciones triploides y diploides luego de tres meses de cultivo...|$|R
40|$|The {{repair of}} {{concrete}} may {{be carried out}} with repair mortars. On this repairs we could profit of the ameliorated properties of repair mortars that we could find in the furnishers {{of that kind of}} products. We have studied the adhesion of that repair mortars to the concrete. The repair mortar study is composed of acrylic resins, hydraulic liaints and polypropilene fibres. First we have studied the need of adhesion coat. In spite of the technical report deliver with the product, says that adhesion coat is not necessary, our tests show that this coat is well necessary. We have made pull-off tests. We have made also aging tests of specimens concrete/epoxy glue/repair mortar. The specimens haved passed the cycles of ice-thaw, <b>thermic</b> <b>shock</b> and cycles variations of temperature. After this tests we have made the pull-off tests. This tests show that adhesion and repair mortar is not affect by the aging simulate. The ruptures occur always on the concrete with less resistance than standards specimens. For conclusion we can say that this kind of repair mortars needs an adhesion coat in epoxy in preference. The aging of that mortars is less important than that of concrete...|$|E
40|$|Striking {{nucleolar}} lesions {{occur in}} cultured cells after exposure to supranormal temperatures. These lesions appear at 42 °C and {{consist of a}} loss of the granular ribonucleoprotein (RNP) component and intranucleolar chromatin, and a disappearance of the nucleolar reticulum. The material remaining in the morphologically homogeneous nucleolus is {{a large amount of}} closely packed fibrillar RNP. The lesions remain identical as temperature increases to 45 °C. These alterations are reversible when the cells are returned to 37 °C and are associated with the reappearance of an exaggerated amount of intranucleolar chromatin and granular RNP. High-resolution radioautography indicates that after <b>thermic</b> <b>shock</b> nucleolar RNA synthesis is inhibited whereas extranucleolar sites are preserved: it also suggests that the granular RNP is reconverted to fibrillar RNP probably by simple unraveling. The results prove the existence of heat-sensitive cellular functions in the nucleolus which deal with the DNA-dependent RNA synthesis. The precise site of action is assumed to involve hydrogen bonds, resulting in configurational changes in nucleolar RNP and affecting the stability of the DNA molecule. The subsequent events in nucleolar RNA synthesis are discussed in light of the morphologic and biochemical effects of actinomycin D on the nucleolus...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{therapy for}} Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} and other muscle diseases {{is limited by}} a massive early cell death following injections. In this study, we explored the potential benefit of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) expression in the survival of porcine myogenic precursor cells (MPCs) transplanted in pig skeletal muscle. Increased HO- 1 expression was assessed either by transient hyperthermia or by HO- 1 lentiviral infection. One day after the <b>thermic</b> <b>shock,</b> we observed a fourfold and a threefold increase in HSP 70 / 72 and HO- 1 levels, respectively. This treatment protected 30 % of cells from staurosporine-induced apoptosis in vitro. When porcine MPC were heat-shocked prior to grafting, we improved cell survival by threefold at 5 days after autologous transplantation (26. 3 +/- 5. 5 % surviving cells). After HO- 1 lentiviral transduction, almost 60 % of cells expressed the transgene and kept their myogenic properties to proliferate and fuse in vitro. Apoptosis of HO- 1 transduced cells was reduced by 50 % in vitro after staurosporine induction. Finally, a fivefold enhancement in cell survival was observed after transplantation of HO- 1 -group (47. 5 +/- 9. 1 % surviving cells) {{as compared to the}} nls-LacZ-group or control group. These results identify HO- 1 as a protective gene against early MPC death post-transplantation...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify methods for breaking dormancy and promoting germination of Stryphnodendron adstringens and S. polyphyllum seeds. Seeds of both species were submitted to the following treatments for breaking dormancy: control; mechanical scarification (sandpaper number 220); hot water (initial temperature of 87 degrees C) for 5 and 15 minutes; chemical scarification with H(2) SO(4) (95 %) for 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 minutes; thermal shock 1 (0 degrees C and 50 % RH for 1 h and thereafter 10 minutes into water Ti= 85 degrees C, Tf= 57 degrees C); <b>thermic</b> <b>shock</b> 2 (40 degrees C and 40 % RH for 6 h and thereafter 10 minutes into water, Ti= 0 degrees C, Tf= 3 degrees C); thermal shock 3 (40 degrees C and 40 % RH for 6 h and thereafter 10 minutes into water, Ti= 25 degrees C, Tf= 25 degrees C). We concluded that seeds belonging to same genus but from different species answered differently to some treatments for breaking dormancy. Chemical scarification with H(2) SO(4) (45 minutes) and mechanical scarification with sandpaper are methods that can be employed with efficiency to break dormancy and promote germination for both species...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} {{aimed to develop}} a method of {{quantification}} of heat shock protein transcript levels in the estuarine copepod Eurytemora affinis. For that, the full-length cDNA of the 78 -kDa glucose-regulated protein (Ea-grp 78) and the cytosolic 90 -kDa heat shock protein (Ea-hsp 90 A) from this species have been cloned. These cDNA revealed, respectively, 2, 370 and 2, 299 bp with 1, 971 and 2, 124 bp open reading frames encoding 656 and 707 amino acids. Main features, sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis with other species were described. Then, the expression profiles were analysed using reverse transcription/real-time quantitative PCR method from copepods subjected to different thermic and osmotic stresses in laboratory, and from copepods directly sampled into the natural population of the Seine Estuary (France) along a salinity gradient. <b>Thermic</b> <b>shock</b> (7. 5 °C, 22. 5 °C and 30 °C during 90 min) significantly induced increases of transcript quantities ranged between 1. 7 - and 19. 7 -fold the levels observed in control conditions (15 °C). Hypo- and hyper-osmotic shocks (salinities of 1 and 30 during 90 min) caused a 2 -fold induction of Ea-hsp 90 A transcript level in comparison to controls (salinity of 15) whereas no significant change was measured for Ea-grp 78. On the other hand, similar expression profiles were observed for the two transcripts after 72 h of exposition to salinities of 1 and 25 with a significant 2 -fold induction observed for the lower salinity. To finish, strong expression inductions of both Ea-grp 78 and Ea-hsp 90 A genes were observed in field copepods sampled at low salinity during the campaigns of June 2009 and May 2010. These results tend {{to show that the}} low salinity and the increase of temperature seem to have a synergic effect on stress condition of copepods...|$|E
