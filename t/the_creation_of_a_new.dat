5|$|Traditionally, the West of China {{has been}} weaker economically, as it {{promises}} a less lucrative {{return to the}} investors than its eastern competitors.

5|$|Although {{there were}} several short spells when a third {{division}} was created, the two-division structure remained largely in place until 1975, when a major re-organisation of the league led to a new three-tier set-up and <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Premier Division at the highest level. In 1998, the teams then in the Premier Division broke away to form the SPL, which supplanted the Premier Division as {{the highest level of}} football in Scotland.

5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that {{the facts of the case}} did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Because male-female {{relationships}} are inherently unequal in her society, Wollstonecraft endeavours {{to formulate a}} new kind of friendship in The Wrongs of Woman: motherhood and sisterhood. It is Maria's pathetic story regarding the kidnapping of her child that first interests Jemima in her plight. The novel fragments also suggest that the tale might not end with a marriage, but rather with <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> kind of family, one constituted by two mothers for Maria's child. With Jemima's rescue of Maria, Wollstonecraft appears to reject the traditional romantic plot and invent a new one, necessitated by the failure of society to grant women their natural rights.|$|E

5|$|Kouandété {{launched}} another coup against Soglo on December 17, but he {{was forced}} to hand power to Alley two days later. His administration oversaw <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> constitution and a presidential election, Dahomey's first since 1964. The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three-quarters of the country from voting. Alley lost popularity with the suggestion that the military should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, Alley was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|E
