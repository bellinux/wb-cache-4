5|$|Polyps feed on {{a variety}} of small organisms, from {{microscopic}} zooplankton to small fish. The polyp's tentacles immobilize or kill prey using their nematocysts. These cells carry venom which they rapidly release in response to contact with another organism. A dormant nematocyst discharges in response to nearby prey touching the trigger (cnidocil). A flap (operculum) opens and its stinging apparatus fires the barb into the prey. The venom is injected through the hollow filament <b>to</b> <b>immobilise</b> the prey; the tentacles then manoeuvre the prey to the mouth.|$|E

5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed <b>to</b> <b>immobilise</b> the waist whilst healing, and are made with two bendable metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E

5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies {{show that they are}} willing to consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it <b>to</b> <b>immobilise</b> it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEchistatin, a 5000 -Da disintegrin, is {{a strong}} {{competitive}} inhibitor of platelet αIIbβ 3 binding to fibrinogen. In addition to its antiplatelet activity, echistatin also exhibits activating properties by inducing a switch of αIIbβ 3 conformation towards an active state. However, soluble echistatin, which is a monomeric ligand, provides only receptor affinity modulation, but it is unable to activate integrin-dependent intracellular signals. Since proteins may exhibit a multivalent functionality {{as a result of}} their absorption to a substrate, in this study we evaluated whether immobilised echistatin is able to stimulate platelet adhesion and signalling. The immobilisation process led to an increase of echistatin affinity for integrin(s) expressed on resting platelets. Unlike the soluble form, immobilised echistatin bound at comparable extent either unstimulated or ADP-activated platelets. Furthermore, echistatin presented in this manner was effective in stimulating integrin-dependent protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Platelets adhering <b>to</b> <b>immobilised</b> echistatin showed a pattern of total tyrosine phosphorylated proteins resembling that of fibrinogen-attached platelets. In particular, solid-phase echistatin induced a strong phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases pp 72 syk and pp 125 FAK. Inhibitors of platelet signalling, such as apyrase, prostaglandin E 1, cytochalasin D and bisindolylmaleimide, while not affecting platelet adhesion <b>to</b> <b>immobilised</b> echistatin, abolished pp 125 FAK phosphorylation. This suggests that signals activating protein kinase C function, dense granule secretion and cytoskeleton assembly might be involved in echistatin-induced pp 125 FAK phosphorylation...|$|R

Inhibition was cGMP-independent and associated with both reduced platelet spreading and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. To investigate the cGMP-independent effects of NO we evaluated integrin beta(3) phosphorylation. Adhesion to fibrinogen induced rapid phosphorylation of beta(3) on tyrosines 773 and 785, which was reduced by GSNO in a cGMP independent manner. Similar results were observed in suspended platelets indicating that NO-induced effects were independent of spreading-induced signalling.

40|$|The binding of Streptococcus gordonii HG 222 {{to other}} streptococci was tested by coaggregation and by binding <b>to</b> <b>immobilised</b> {{bacteria}} in an ELISA assay. Out of 17 streptococcal strains, HG 222 coaggregated only with Streptococcus sanguis HG 1470 and Streptococcus oralis Ny 586. Binding of HG 222 <b>to</b> <b>immobilised</b> bacteria also occurred only with HG 1470 and NY 586. Binding of HG 222 to S. oralis Ny 586 was further investigated. Preincubation of Ny 586 coated microtitreplates with whole saliva, parotid, submandibular and sublingual saliva enhanced binding of HG 222 to Ny 586. Several salivary substances bound to both HG 222 and Ny 586, namely {{low molecular weight}} mucins, salivary agglutinin, and IgA. There were indications that binding of HG 222 to Ny 586 was especially enhanced by IgA. Binding of IgA to both bacteria could be demonstrated with all the types of glandular saliva. In addition, purified colostral IgA enhanced binding of HG 222 to Ny 586. Saliva preincubation of Ny 586 coated microtitreplates {{in the presence of}} antiserum against the IgA a-chain inhibited saliva mediated binding of HG 222 to Ny 586. In this case, binding of salivary agglutinin to Ny 586 was also inhibited, suggesting complexation between IgA and agglutinin. In conclusion, these results indicate that colonisation of dental surfaces by S. gordonii may be accomplished by binding to strains of S. oralis or S. sanguis. This process may be enhanced by IgA in saliva. KEY WORDS: oral streptococci; saliva; coaggregation; interbacterial binding...|$|R

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae {{serotype}} 3 strains {{are highly}} resistant to opsonophagocytosis due to recruitment of the complement inhibitor Factor H via Hic, {{a member of}} the pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) family. In this study, we demonstrated that Hic also interacts with vitronectin, a fluid-phase regulator involved in haemostasis, angiogenesis, and the terminal complement cascade as well as a component of the extracellular matrix. Blocking of Hic by specific antiserum or genetic deletion significantly reduced pneumococcal binding <b>to</b> soluble and <b>immobilised</b> vitronectin and <b>to</b> Factor H, respectively. In parallel, ectopic expression of Hic on the surface of Lactococcus lactis conferred binding <b>to</b> soluble and <b>immobilised</b> vitronectin as well as Factor H. Molecular analyses with truncated Hic fragments narrowed down the vitronectin-binding site to the central core of Hic (aa 151 - 201). This vitronectin-binding region is separate from that of Factor H, which binds to the N-terminus of Hic (aa 38 - 92). Binding of pneumococcal Hic was localised to the C-terminal heparin-binding domain (HBD 3) of vitronectin. However, an N-terminal region to HBD 3 was further involved in Hic-binding <b>to</b> <b>immobilised</b> vitronectin. Finally, vitronectin bound to Hic was functionally active and inhibited formation of the terminal complement complex. In conclusion, Hic interacts with vitronectin and simultaneously with Factor H, and both human proteins may contribute to colonisation and invasive disease caused by serotype 3 pneumococci...|$|R
