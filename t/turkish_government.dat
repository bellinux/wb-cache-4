5|$|In the {{preparation}} for possible entry into World War II, the <b>Turkish</b> <b>government</b> introduced a tax, the Varlık Vergisi, which disproportionately targeted Turkey's non-Muslim residents. Many Armenians, and other non-Muslim populations, {{were forced to}} sell their property at significantly reduced prices through public auctions {{in order to pay}} for the sudden tax hike or have the properties confiscated by the state. In addition, the law allowed authorities to confiscate the property of any relative of a taxed person in order to pay the tax. From this tax, the <b>Turkish</b> <b>government</b> collected 314,900,000 liras or about US$270 million (80% of the state budget) from the confiscation of non-Muslim assets.|$|E

5|$|Kevork Juskalian {{was among}} the {{earliest}} graduates of the Euphrates College in Kharpert, completing his studies around 1881. He served as a minor official of the local <b>Turkish</b> <b>government</b> in Mezire, a village near Kharpert. He was then invited {{to work in the}} Persian consulate in Mezire until he was recalled by the <b>Turkish</b> <b>government</b> to serve as supervisor of eleven villages in the region of Kharpert. Kevork Juskalian felt that there was no secure future for him in Ottoman Turkey and subsequently fled to the United States with his family, arriving at Ellis Island on November 15, 1887. Consequently, the Juskalian family became some of the first Armenians to come to the United States. Kevork found a job at the Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works in Worcester, Massachusetts.

5|$|The Kurdish {{geographical}} name changes were exempt under the Ottoman Empire {{due to the}} Islamic religious orientation of Kurds. During the Republican era and especially after the Dersim massacre, Kurdish {{geographical name}} changes became more common. During the Turkish Republican era, the words Kurdistan and Kurds were banned.

5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} Cicero, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence conveyed by Cicero to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the <b>Turkish</b> <b>government.</b> Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be {{too old to be}} of much value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which he wrote a book to address rumors and explain his role during the war.

5|$|In Turkey {{the plan}} called for {{diplomatic}} pressure on 8 June 1944, following the Normandy Landings, to allow the Allied forces access to Turkey {{for the purposes of}} staging an invasion of Greece (in support of the story of Zeppelin). At the same time the Soviets would make a similar request of Bulgaria. However, it was agreed that this risked a pre-emptive invasion of Turkey by German forces. Instead, the Allies took advantage of German warships being permitted, in June, access to Turkish territorial waters to transit to the Aegean Sea. A complaint to the <b>Turkish</b> <b>government</b> emphasised the Allies' interest in the Balkans and that they did not wish to see the Germans reinforcing the region.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman Empire entered World War I on {{the side}} of the Central Powers and was {{ultimately}} defeated. During the war, the empire's Armenians were deported to Syria as part of the Armenian Genocide. As a result, an estimated 800,000 to 1,500,000 Armenians were killed. The <b>Turkish</b> <b>government</b> has refused to acknowledge the events as genocide and claims that Armenians were only relocated from the eastern war zone. Genocidal campaigns were also committed against the empire's other minority groups such as the Assyrians and Greeks. Following the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918, the victorious Allied Powers sought to partition the Ottoman state through the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres.|$|E

The Hrant Dink foundation states that 661 properties in Istanbul alone were confiscated by the <b>Turkish</b> <b>government,</b> leaving only 580 of the 1,328 properties owned by the 53 Armenian foundations (schools, churches, hospitals, etc.).

5|$|The codex {{was brought}} to Constantinople in 1621 by Cyril Lucar (first a patriarch of Alexandria, then later a patriarch of Constantinople). Lucar was {{involved}} in a complex struggle with the <b>Turkish</b> <b>government,</b> the Catholic Church, and his own subordinates. He was supported by English government and presented the codex to James I in 1624, as a gratitude for his help.

King James died before the manuscript started for England, and the offer was transferred to Charles I in 1627. It became a part of the Royal Library, British Museum and since 1973 of the British Library. It was saved from the fire at Ashburnam House (the Cotton library) on 23 October 1731, by the librarian, Richard Bentley.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{whether there}} is a {{political}} business cycle (PBC) on the agricultural supports in the Turkish economy.

To this end, first the series for the producer support estimates are filtered by the Hodrick-Prescott filter, and then an econometric model is employed to estimate the effects of a set of explanatory variables including the economic crisis, the opportunistic and the partisan characteristics of the incumbent parties. Our results provide limited support for the opportunistic type PBC. Moreover, it seems that some <b>Turkish</b> <b>governments</b> have created the partisanship type PBC...|$|R
