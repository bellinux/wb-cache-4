40|$|After {{blending}} the triblock copolymer, poly(ethylene oxide-b-propylene oxide-b-ethylene oxide) (PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO) with novolac-type <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin,</b> Fourier transform {{infrared spectroscopy}} {{revealed that the}} ether groups of the PEO block were stronger hydrogen bond acceptors for the OH groups of <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> than were the ether groups of the PPO block. Thermal curing with hexamethylenetetramine as the curing agent resulted in the triblock copolymer being incorporated into the <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin,</b> forming a nanostructure through a mechanism involving reaction-induced microphase separation. Mild pyrolysis conditions led to {{the removal of the}} PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO triblock copolymer and formation of mesoporous <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin.</b> This approach provided a variety of composition-dependent nanostructures, including disordered wormlike, body-centered-cubic spherical and disorder micelles. The regular mesoporous novolac-type <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> was formed only at a phenolic content of 40 – 60 wt %, the result of an intriguing balance of hydrogen bonding interactions among the <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> and the PEO and PPO segments of the triblock copolymer...|$|R

Low-fat soy and peanut flours and blood meal were hydrolyzed in an alkaline state, and PF-cross-linked protein resins were formulated by reacting the protein hydrolyzates with phenol-formaldehyde (PF) in solid-tosolid ratios ranging from 70 % to 50 % hydrolyzates and 30 % to 50 % PF. Physical properties of medium density fiberboard (MDF) bonded with protein-based <b>phenolic</b> <b>resins</b> were compared to those of boards bonded with ureaformaldehyde (UF) and PF resins, and flakeboard bonded with soy protein-based <b>phenolic</b> <b>resin</b> was compared to PF-bonded board.
