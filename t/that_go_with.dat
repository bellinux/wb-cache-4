5|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2008, Obama {{typically}} led McCain in national polls by single-digit margins, and also led in several key swing states. McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due {{at least in part}} to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year. McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.|$|E

25|$|Music {{is central}} to a Kathakali performance. It sets the mood and {{triggers}} emotions resonant {{with the nature of}} the scene. It also sets the rhythm to which the actor-dancers perform the choreography and scenes. Some major musical patterns, according to Clifford and Betty, <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> the moods and content of the scene are: Cempata (most common and default that applies to a range of moods, in battles and fights between good and evil, also to conclude a scene); Campa music (depict tension, dispute, disagreement between lovers or competing ideas); Pancari (for odious, preparatory such as sharpening a sword); Triputa (thought provoking, scenes involving sages and teachers); Atanta (scenes involving kings or divine beings); Muri Atanta musical style (for comic, light hearted, or fast moving scenes involving heroic or anger-driven activity).|$|E
25|$|The Metropolitan Theater façade {{resembles a}} stage being {{framed by a}} proscenium-like central window of stained glass which carries the name “Metropolitan” with flora and fauna motif {{surrounding}} the label. This helps bring in light to the lobby. It was highlighted on both ends by the curving walls with colorful decorated tiles in resemblance with the batik patterns from Southeast Asia. There are also moldings of zigzag and wavy lines <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> the sponged and painted multi-colored massive walls. The wall that framed the stained glass is a segmented arch with rows of small finials on the upper edge of the wall. Angkor Wat-inspired minarets crown {{the top of the}} concave roof which suggested its status as a theater back in its prime days. Located in the entrance are elaborate wrought iron gates which are patterned into leaf designs and various lines. Accenting the ground level are Capiz lamps and banana-leaf formed pillars which go alternately with the theater’s entrances.|$|E

An early interest in fashion and textiles – designing confections of [...] "bright fluorescent fishnet fabrics" [...] — was a hallmark of her time at Central Saint Martins College. M.I.A. was a roommate of fashion designer Luella Bartley and is a long-time friend of designer Carri Mundane. Clothes from her limited-edition [...] "Okley Run" [...] line — Mexican and Afrika line jackets and leggings, Islamic-inspired and water melon-print hoodies, and tour-inspired designs – were sold in 2008 during New York fashion week. She commented, [...] "I wanted to tie all my work together. When I make an album, I make a number of artworks <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> it, and now I make some clothes <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> it too. So this Okley run was an extension of my Kala album and artwork."

500|$|Rhetoric is {{discussed}} in chapter 4.17 of Manasollasa. The text dedicates over 450 verses in chapter 4.18 to dance and describes types of dance forms, musical instruments <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> dance performances, and the occasions when dances were celebrated. The text discusses six types of performers, their characteristics and their roles — Nata (actor), Nartaka (dancer), Nartaki (danseuse), Vaitalika (bard), Charana (wandering performer) and Kollatika (acrobat). Their body movements (6 Anga, [...] 8 Upanga and 6 Pratyanga) are explained with their significance. This discussion {{is similar to that}} found in Natya Shastra, a Sanskrit text composed around 1st-century BCE. The text thereafter presents the 21 Sthanas and 26 Charis of the dance tradition.|$|E
500|$|The Reproductive Freedom Project of ACLU, {{according}} to their mission statement, actively works provide access to any and all reproductive health care for any human, regardless of race, gender, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, or political standing. In some cases, Reproductive Freedom Programs fund ultrasounds and abortions and any lodging, meals, or transportation <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> that. Because women have reported finding it necessary to cross state lines or wait weeks for an abortion, The Reproductive Freedom Project states {{that they want to}} fight for individuals [...] "state by state and law by law" [...] until every individual can pursue the kind of lifestyle they want. As stated on their website, [...] "states have enacted more restrictions to abortion than they did in the previous 10 years combined". The ACLU claims to be committed to fighting injustices with access to education on what accessibilities one has to abortions, birth control, religious rights, as well as trying to diminish abstinence-only sexual education, for ACLU claims that abstinence only education promotes a lack of willingness to use contraceptives.|$|E
500|$|Black {{intensely}} {{believed in}} judicial restraint and reserved {{the power of}} making laws to the legislatures, often scolding his more liberal colleagues for {{what he saw as}} judicially created legislation. Conservative justice John M. Harlan II would say of Black: [...] "No Justice has worn his judicial robes with a keener sense of the limitations <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> them." [...] Conservative Judge Robert Bork wrote, [...] "Justice Black came to have significantly more respect for the limits of the Constitution than Justice Douglas and the other leading members of the Warren majorities ever showed." [...] One scholar wrote, [...] "No Justice of the Court conscientiously and persistently endeavored, as much as Justice Black did, to establish consistent standards of objectivity for adjudicating constitutional questions." [...] Black advocated a narrow role of interpretation for justices, opposing a view of justices as social engineers or rewriters of the Constitution. Black opposed enlarging constitutional liberties beyond their literal or historic [...] "plain" [...] meaning, as he saw his more liberal colleagues do. However, he also condemned the actions of those to his right, such as the conservative Four Horsemen of the 1920s and 1930s, who struck down much of the New Deal's legislation.|$|E

500|$|The second Milton Berle Show {{appearance}} came on June 5 at NBC's Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. Berle {{persuaded the}} singer {{to leave his}} guitar backstage, advising, [...] "Let 'em see you, son." [...] During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of [...] "Hound Dog" [...] {{with a wave of}} his arm and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with energetic, exaggerated body movements. Presley's gyrations created a storm of controversy. Newspaper critics were outraged: Jack Gould of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability.... His phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> a beginner's aria in a bathtub.... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway." [...] Ben Gross of the New York Daily News opined that popular music [...] "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley.... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos". Ed Sullivan, whose own variety show was the nation's most popular, declared him [...] "unfit for family viewing". To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as [...] "Elvis the Pelvis", which he called [...] "one of the most childish expressions I ever heard, comin' from an adult." ...|$|E

The most common instruments <b>that</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> Kathak are tabla (a pair of hand drums) that syncs with the dancer's feet rhythms, sarangi or harmonium with manjira (hand cymbals) that meters the tal (cycle), and other instruments to add effect, depth and structure to the expressive stage of a Kathak performance.|$|E

He emphasized how Anthony [...] "maintains her lies until they absolutely cannot be maintained any more" [...] and then replaces [...] with another lie, using [...] "Zanny the Nanny" [...] as an example. Anthony repeatedly told police that Caylee was with the nanny that she specifically identified as Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez. Police, however, {{were never able to}} find the nanny.
