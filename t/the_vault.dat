5|$|As the Dalek discovers Rose, {{the video}} feeds to <b>the</b> <b>Vault</b> are lost, and the Doctor {{immediately}} sets off {{to try to}} get back into <b>the</b> <b>Vault.</b> The Dalek tries to kill Rose but it cannot, having found compassion from Rose's DNA. The Dalek is urged to kill van Statton, but Rose instead convinces to spare his life. She follows the Dalek as it makes its way to the highest part of <b>the</b> <b>Vault</b> and destroys the roof, exposing the area to natural sunlight that the Dalek basks in. The Doctor arrives and prepares to kill the Dalek, but Rose stops him, convincing him the Dalek has developed emotions. However, the Dalek is unable to cope with them, and it asks Rose to orders its own self-destruction to end its pain. Rose reluctantly agrees, and the Dalek shortly implodes thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the large}} pendentives that support <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> are windows, six {{on each side}} of the chapel. There were two more windows in each end of the chapel, now closed, and those above the High Altar covered by the Last Judgement. Above each window is an arched shape, {{referred}} to as a lunette and above eight of the lunettes at the sides of the chapel are triangular spandrels filling the spaces between the side pendentives and <b>the</b> <b>vault,</b> the other eight lunettes each being below one of the corner pendentives.|$|E
50|$|The timber {{building}} comprises two intersecting barrel vaults, producing four identical round arched entrances at {{the ends}} of <b>the</b> <b>vaults.</b> Surmounting <b>the</b> point of intersection of <b>the</b> <b>vaults</b> is a tall fleche, {{in the form of a}} tower and dome, which doubles the full height of <b>the</b> building. <b>The</b> <b>vaulted</b> sections of <b>the</b> building are constructed with timber framed walls clad externally with horizontal chamfered timber boards and internally with diagonally laid tongue-and-groove boarding. The curved roofs of <b>the</b> <b>vaults</b> are formed with corrugated iron. The entrances, through <b>the</b> <b>vaulted</b> ends of these sections, have a wide carved timber fascia boards which rest visually on timber piers flanking the entrances. Internally the ceiling space is lined with regularly spaced timber trusses in <b>the</b> <b>vaulted</b> sections, and lined with timber boarding over the intersection.|$|R

5|$|Hobbs and {{his team}} {{eventually}} find and arrest Dom, Mia, Brian, and Vince. While transporting them to the airport for extradition to the United States, the convoy is attacked by Reyes' men, who kill Hobbs' team. Hobbs and Elena are saved by Dom, Brian, Mia, and Vince as they fight back and escape, but Vince is shot {{in the process and}} dies. Wanting to avenge his murdered team, Hobbs and Elena agree to help with the heist. The gang breaks into the police station and tear <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> holding Reyes' money from the building using their cars, dragging it through the city. After an extensive police chase, Dom makes Brian continue without him while he attacks the police and the pursuing Reyes, using <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> attached to his car to smash their vehicles. Brian returns and kills Zizi while Reyes is badly injured by Dom's assault. Hobbs arrives on the scene and executes Reyes to avenge his team. Though Hobbs refuses to let Dom and Brian go free, he gives them a 24-hour head start to escape on the condition they leave <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> as it is. However, <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> is empty as it had been switched during the chase. After splitting the cash (Vince's share is given to his family), they go their separate ways.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Fallout by Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment, the protagonist player character, <b>the</b> <b>Vault</b> Dweller, first encounters the feral Dogmeat in Junktown. Dogmeat's former owner (an unnamed man closely resembling Max Rockatansky) {{died at the}} hands of thugs hired by a local gangster named Gizmo. If the player character feeds Dogmeat or is wearing a leather jacket, Dogmeat will follow them and fight in their defense. According to the series' canon, Dogmeat was adopted by <b>the</b> <b>Vault</b> Dweller on 30 December 2161, and killed by a force field barrier during <b>the</b> <b>Vault</b> Dweller's assault on the Master's Military Base on 20 April 2162. Dogmeat was supposed to appear in the canceled film adaptation of the game as well.|$|E
50|$|It is {{not known}} when <b>the</b> <b>vaults</b> complex was closed down, with some {{suggesting}} as early as c.1835 and others as late as c.1875. Written records regarding <b>the</b> <b>vaults</b> during their slum use are virtually non-existent. All that is known is {{that at some point}} tons of rubble were dumped into <b>the</b> <b>vaults</b> making them inaccessible.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>vaulted</b> {{ceilings}} of <b>the</b> palace were skillflly constructed, with {{sides of}} equal length unlike in other {{sites in the}} Petén region where <b>the</b> sides of <b>vaulted</b> ceilings were often of different lengths. <b>The</b> <b>vaulting</b> is of exceptional height, reaching up to [...]|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Tuscan <b>Vault</b> {{once held}} {{many more than}} the present 14 tombs, but most were moved to <b>the</b> New <b>Vault</b> or {{enclosed}} within the piers of <b>the</b> Ferdinand <b>Vault</b> during <b>the</b> major rearrangement of 1960. <b>The</b> 5-meter wide <b>vault</b> is very large, being 21 meters long, and extends along the entire western lengths of both <b>the</b> Ferdinand <b>Vault</b> and <b>the</b> Franz <b>Vault,</b> ending only when it meets the outside wall of the west transept of <b>the</b> Maria Theresia <b>Vault.</b>|$|R

5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that would have seen <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> hanging {{over the edge of the}} Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.|$|E
5|$|The chapel walls {{have three}} {{horizontal}} tiers with six {{windows in the}} upper tier down each side. There were also two windows at each end, but these have been closed up above the altar when Michelangelo's Last Judgement was painted, obliterating two lunettes. Between the windows are large pendentives which support <b>the</b> <b>vault.</b> Between the pendentives are triangularly shaped arches or spandrels cut into <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> above each window. Above {{the height of the}} pendentives, the ceiling slopes gently without much deviation from the horizontal. This is the real architecture. Michelangelo has elaborated it with illusionary or fictive architecture.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, with <b>the</b> various <b>vaults</b> overcrowded, a major {{rearrangement}} {{project began}} {{which resulted in}} the construction of the Children's Columbarium and <b>the</b> New <b>Vault.</b> At <b>the</b> same time many bodies were moved to those new areas, others were moved from <b>the</b> Tuscan <b>Vault</b> and <b>the</b> Ferdinand <b>Vault</b> and walled up into the corner piers of <b>the</b> Ferdinand <b>Vault.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>vaults</b> were {{neglected}} and disused {{for many years}} and subsequently developed a sinister reputation in the 1970s and 80s. <b>The</b> <b>vaults</b> were used by homeless persons as shelter from Melbourne’s cold nights, and numerous attacks and murders occurred here.|$|R
50|$|The {{layout of}} the cathedral follows that of the Latin cross. <b>The</b> <b>vaulting</b> of <b>the</b> choir and the south aisle is ogival (gothic), <b>the</b> <b>vaulting</b> for <b>the</b> north aisle is groin <b>vaulting</b> and <b>the</b> ceiling of the south chapel is decked with modern paneling.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} 1892 Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, {{purchased and}} donated by Lord Stanley, was physically {{awarded to the}} Champions until 1970, and is now displayed in <b>the</b> <b>Vault</b> Room at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>vault</b> of {{the nave}} rises steeply {{in a simple}} quadripartite form, {{in harmony with the}} nave arcade. The eastern end of the choir was {{extended}} and the whole upper part elaborated {{in the second quarter of}} the 14th century by William Joy. <b>The</b> <b>vault</b> has a multiplicity of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at St Cuthbert's Church, Wells. The vaults of the aisles of the choir also have a unique pattern.|$|E
5|$|As they regroup with van Statten's staff, {{they learn}} his {{assistant}} has taken over, {{and will have}} van Statten's memories wiped of <b>the</b> <b>Vault,</b> while planning on filling the entire bunker with cement to prevent other problems. Rose offers Adam a ride in the TARDIS since he will have no job after this.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of the stones contain masonic symbols, {{as well as a}} number of carved tree-stumps. Several family vaults are also found here, {{including}} <b>the</b> Sanford <b>Vault,</b> <b>the</b> Tuckett <b>vault,</b> <b>the</b> Thomas C Watkins <b>vault,</b> <b>the</b> Col. Land Family <b>Vault</b> and <b>the</b> Stinson Family Mausoleum.|$|R

His coat of arms figures in <b>the</b> <b>vaults</b> of <b>the</b> church of Saint Dominique at Toulouse; and did in <b>the</b> <b>vaults</b> of Bayonne Cathedral until the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The beatings usually aim at {{the muscular}} tissue within <b>the</b> <b>vaults</b> of <b>the</b> foot (longitudinal arch of the foot), omitting the bone {{structure}} of the ball and <b>the</b> heel. <b>The</b> <b>vaults</b> are highly touch-sensitive and therefore susceptible to pain due to the tight clustering of nerve endings.|$|R
5|$|At the 2007 National Championships, Sacramone competed {{on three}} events, {{choosing}} {{to skip the}} uneven bars. She defended her title on <b>the</b> <b>vault,</b> placed second on the floor exercise and third on the balance beam. Following Nationals, she {{was named to the}} American team for the World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.|$|E
5|$|At the World Championships in October, Sacramone won a {{gold medal}} on <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> and a silver medal in the team competition. That gave her nine world medals, and tied her with Liukin and Shannon Miller for the most world medals by an American female gymnast at that time.|$|E
5|$|Four Egyptian gymnasts, three {{artistic and}} one rhythmic, {{qualified}} for the Olympics. Mohamed El-Saharty, the lone male, was invited to London as the highest-ranked African in the individual all-around at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. He was individual all-around Arab Champion in 2011 and 2012, African Champion in 2010 and 2012, and Pan Arab Champion in 2011. At the latter tournament, he had also taken gold in the horizontal bar, the pommel horse, <b>the</b> <b>vault,</b> and the team event. In London his best event was <b>the</b> <b>vault,</b> where he finished 12th. He was 52nd in the horizontal bar, 56th in the floor, 57th in the pommel horse, 61st in the rings, and 65th in the parallel bars. His final rank in the individual all-around was 37th.|$|E

5|$|In 1719 the Duke and Duchess {{were able}} {{to move into the}} east wing of the {{unfinished}} palace, but Marlborough had only three years to enjoy it. While living at Windsor Lodge he suffered another stroke in June 1722, not long after his 72nd birthday. Finally, at 4 a.m on 16 June (O.S.), in the presence of his wife and two surviving daughters Henrietta Godolphin and Mary Montagu, the 1st Duke of Marlborough died. He was initially buried in <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> at the east end of HenryVII's chapel in Westminster Abbey, but following instructions left by Sarah, who died in 1744, Marlborough was moved to be by her side lying in <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> beneath the chapel at Blenheim.|$|E
5|$|In Fallout Shelter, players {{build and}} {{manage their own}} Vault as an Overseer – the leader and {{coordinator}} of their Vault. Players guide and direct the citizens of <b>the</b> <b>Vault,</b> and need to keep them happy through meeting their needs such as power, food, and water. They rescue dwellers from the wasteland and assign them to different resource-generating buildings in <b>the</b> <b>Vault,</b> using the SPECIAL statistics system from the other Fallout games. Each character's SPECIAL profile affects their ability to generate different resources, and their statistics can be increased by training them in rooms devoted to each stat. The dwellers can level up over time, increasing their health, and can be given new items and weapons to help with various tasks. The number of dwellers can be increased by waiting for new dwellers from the wasteland to arrive or by pairing a male and a female dweller in living quarters to produce babies.|$|E
