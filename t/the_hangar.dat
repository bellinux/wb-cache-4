5|$|At the Singapore Airshow in February 2016, Airbus Group {{presented}} Air-Cobot {{and its use}} in {{its vision}} of <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> of the future. The same month, the Singapore government enlisted Airbus Group to help local maintenance, repair, and operations providers to stay competitive against neighbour countries like Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines which are cheaper. To improve productivity, Airbus Group launches, in October 2016, a testbed hangar where new technologies can be tested. Upon entering <b>the</b> <b>hangar,</b> cameras study the aircraft to detect damages. Mobile robots, {{such as the one}} of the Air-Cobot project, and drones, such as the one of the Aircam project, carry out more detailed inspections.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft could undergo maintenance, {{and most}} {{functional}} and equipment tests carried out aboard - either in <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> {{or on the}} deck. Some components and could be repaired on board, but other work was {{to be carried out}} by the workshops on the engine repair and component repair ships that would accompany the maintenance carrier.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{structures}} was the Arch Hangar. At the time, {{it was the largest}} monolithic arch roof structure in the US, and one of the largest hangars in the world. The construction of <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> was also groundbreaking, including a foundation set on bedrock, extensive footing structures, intricate formwork, and a 340-foot arch span.|$|E
50|$|Just {{outside the}} town lie <b>the</b> Cardington airship <b>hangars.</b> <b>The</b> <b>hangars</b> {{have been used to}} shoot scenes for movies such as Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and Inception. <b>The</b> <b>hangars</b> {{can be seen from the}} Bedford Bypass.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hangars</b> {{and service}} area {{were located in}} what is now Alma Avenue, Woy Woy. <b>The</b> <b>hangars</b> are still in {{existence}} and are utilised as warehouses or industrial buildings.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>hangars</b> housed two S-70B Seahawk helicopters.|$|R
5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier USS Ticonderoga delivered the Apollo 16 Command Module to the North Island Naval Air Station, near San Diego, California, on Friday, May 5, 1972. On Monday, May 8, 1972, ground service equipment {{being used to}} empty the residual toxic reaction control system fuel in the Command Module tanks exploded in a Naval Air Station hangar. Forty-six people {{were sent to the}} hospital for 24 to 48 hours observation, most suffering from inhalation of toxic fumes. Most seriously injured was a technician who suffered a fractured kneecap when the GSE cart overturned on him. A hole was blown in <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> roof 250 feet above; about 40 windows in <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> were shattered. The Command Module suffered a three-inch gash in one panel.|$|E
5|$|By 1989, {{the airline}} had 156 {{employees}} and 150,000 annual passengers. On 9 February 1989, Norsk Air's board {{decided to start}} the termination process if a sale was not made. The employees agreed to cut their wages 10 percent and not take sick days during the sales process. One of the main difficulties in the sales process was that Widerøe {{could not afford to}} purchase Norsk Air's hangar at the airport. Widerøe intended to continue operations at both Torp and Geiteryggen for a year to see where to establish its base. In fear that the airline would move to Skien, the municipalities of Sandefjord and Stokke, who owned the majority of the airport, agreed to purchase <b>the</b> <b>hangar,</b> which had been built for NOK20 million in 1987, for NOK11.5 million. Half <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> would be rented to Widerøe for NOK500,000 per year. This was insufficient to cover the NOK1.2 million in annual interest costs.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years the ship was either in reserve or used as a troop transport, until she began {{reconversion}} into a cruiser at Chatham Dockyard on 1 March 1923. The flight decks were removed and she was mostly restored to her designed configuration, although her 3-inch AA guns were replaced by three QF 4 inch Mk V AA guns. Two of these were mounted on a platform between the aft funnel and the mainmast and the third gun was positioned on the quarterdeck between the two 7.5-inch guns. The major exception was that No. 2 7.5-inch gun was not installed and she retained her hangar in the forward superstructure. The two derricks that serviced <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> were replaced by a single crane on the starboard side of <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> roof. No. 2's position was occupied by a prototype compressed-air Carey aircraft catapult, the first British cruiser to mount a catapult. Vindictive used {{it for the first time}} on 3 October when she launched a Fairey IIID floatplane. She also conducted catapult trials on float-equipped Fairey Flycatcher fighters.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{preservation}} of <b>the</b> <b>hangars</b> {{is one of the}} greatest concerns raised in surveys taken by OC Parks, the fate of <b>the</b> south <b>hangar</b> is uncertain.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the area}} that was once the Harvard Army Airfield has reverted to {{agriculture}} and <b>the</b> <b>hangars</b> are used for grain storage. In 1983, three of <b>the</b> <b>hangars</b> were destroyed by fire, which was started by careless use of a cutting torch {{by a pair of}} teenagers who were dismantling <b>the</b> first <b>hangar</b> for salvage. A handful of wartime buildings still exist on the former military airfield.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s {{this group of}} four formed {{themselves}} into an alliance called The Griffin Trust, and Vauxhall Motors granted them a peppercorn lease on two of <b>the</b> <b>hangars.</b> <b>The</b> third <b>hangar</b> continued {{to be used to}} service Vauxhall motor cars.|$|R
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the project in 2013, the Air-Cobot robot is dedicated to inspect the lower parts of an aircraft. In the continuation of the project, there is the prospect of coupling with a drone to inspect an aircraft's upper parts. In October 2016, Airbus Group launches its research project on <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> of the future in Singapour. The robots from the Air-Cobot and Aircam projects are included in it.|$|E
5|$|Sydney {{normally}} transported 450 soldiers—the main {{force of}} a Royal Australian Regiment (RAR) battalion—plus equipment and vehicles on each voyage. The soldiers were accommodated in the sailors mess decks, with the sailors displaced to <b>the</b> <b>hangar.</b> Vehicles were secured to the flight deck, while other cargo was packed onto pallets and stored either in <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> or on the flight deck. Although it was originally intended that Sydney would sail to and from Saigon, the ship's commanding officer {{at the time of}} the first voyage, John Crabb, informed the Naval Board that he would refuse orders to do so, as the Saigon River could easily be mined after Sydney had sailed up. Instead, the port of Vũng Tàu was selected as the destination, with soldiers and equipment transferred to shore by helicopters, landing craft, and barges. During the early voyages, unloading and reloading was a multiple-day process, with the transport moving to deeper waters each night, but improved cargo handling practices, upgrades to Sydney (including the installation of three new cargo cranes and six embarked landing craft during mid-1968 refit), and increased access to US cargo- and troop-carrying helicopters, reduced this to a single day by 1968.|$|E
5|$|The Ark of the Covenant {{is seen in}} {{a broken}} crate during <b>the</b> <b>Hangar</b> 51 opening sequence. Lucasfilm used the same prop from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Guards were hired to protect the highly sought after piece of film memorabilia during the day of its use. A replica of the staff carried by Charlton Heston in The Ten Commandments was also used to {{populate}} the set to illustrate the Hangar's history.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> {{construction}} of <b>hangars</b> 3,4,8 and 9, to an Australianised RAF Type A 1917 design, were begun by contractor TH Dennis, but in April construction work ceased and <b>the</b> <b>hangars</b> were relocated to Charleville. This situation changed quickly, and <b>the</b> <b>hangars</b> were relocated back to Eagle Farm from circa November 1942, to eventually double <b>the</b> length of <b>hangars</b> 1 and 2, and create hangars 3 and 3A (work {{was still being}} carried out in January 1944).|$|R
5000|$|On September 15, 1945, a {{hurricane}} caused {{a fire in}} one of <b>the</b> <b>hangars.</b> <b>The</b> fire quickly spread to <b>the</b> two other <b>hangars</b> and destroyed <b>the</b> <b>hangars,</b> blimps, 366 planes and 150 cars. (See 1945 film report: [...] "Hurricane Sweeps US East Coast", United Newsreel Corporation.) The same type of wooden hangar can still be seen today at only four locations: (2) Moffett Field in California, (2) Tustin, California, (2) Lakehurst, NJ, and (1) Tillamook, Oregon.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, the Wellington bombers {{for which}} <b>the</b> <b>hangars</b> were built never arrived, {{as they were}} donated to Britain {{at the start of}} the Second World War, forming The New Zealand Squadron. However, <b>the</b> <b>hangars</b> have been in {{continuous}} use since their construction, and (re-roofed in steel) remain in use today.|$|R
5|$|The carrier's crew {{suffered}} 811 fatalities, mainly {{among the}} aircraft mechanics and armorers stationed on <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> decks and the ship's engineers, {{many of whom}} were trapped below in the boiler and engine rooms by uncontrolled fires raging on the decks above them. Twenty-one of the ship's aviators were killed. The loss of Kaga and the three other IJN carriers at Midway (Hiryū was also sunk during the battle), with their aircraft and veteran pilots, was a crucial strategic defeat for Japan and contributed significantly to Japan's ultimate defeat in the war.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Taihō and Shōkaku left Zuikaku {{to recover}} the Division's few {{remaining}} aircraft after their heavy losses (only 102 aircraft remained aboard the seven surviving carriers by the evening) and the 1st Mobile Fleet continued its withdrawal towards Okinawa. The Americans did not spot the Japanese carriers until {{the afternoon of the}} following day and launched a large airstrike that only succeeded in hitting Zuikaku with a single bomb that started a fire in <b>the</b> <b>hangar.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Syndicate surgeon {{attempting}} to procure the alien fetus is killed {{by one of}} the alien rebels, who assumes his form. Krycek finds the dead surgeon and the fetus missing, and tells Spender that the rebels are now going to succeed in their goals to halt colonization. The Syndicate and its families gather at El Rico Air Force Base. Shortly after Fowley arrives, a white light appears around one end of <b>the</b> <b>hangar.</b> It is revealed to be the rebels, who surround and immolate the entire Syndicate—except for The Smoking Man and Fowley—who escape by car.|$|E
50|$|The Tillamook airbase for blimps was {{commissioned}} on December 1, 1942, as U.S. Naval Air Station Tillamook. <b>The</b> two wooden <b>hangars</b> used to house these airships were decommissioned after World War II and deeded to Tillamook County. One of <b>the</b> <b>hangars</b> (Hangar B) {{is a national}} historic landmark {{and the location of}} the Tillamook Air Museum. <b>The</b> other <b>hangar,</b> (Hangar A) burned down in 1992.|$|R
50|$|The Graf Zeppelin class's {{upper and}} lower hangars were long and narrow with unarmored sides and ends. Workshops, stores and crew {{quarters}} were located outboard of <b>the</b> <b>hangars,</b> a design feature {{similar to that of}} British carriers. <b>The</b> upper <b>hangar</b> measured 185 m x 16 m; <b>the</b> lower <b>hangar</b> 172 m x 16 m. <b>The</b> upper <b>hangar</b> had 6 m vertical clearance while <b>the</b> lower <b>hangar</b> had 0.3 m less headroom due to the ceiling braces. Total usable hangar space was 5450 m2 with stowage for 41 aircraft: 18 Fieseler Fi 167 torpedo bombers in the lower hangar; 13 Junkers Ju 87C dive bombers and 10 Messerschmitt Bf 109T fighters in <b>the</b> upper <b>hangar.</b>|$|R

5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1973. The airport {{needed to be}} built on permafrost. The runway is {{insulated}} against the ground, so it will not melt during the summer. <b>The</b> <b>hangar</b> is frozen into the ground, with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck. The runway was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method, forcing the airport to regularly re-asphalt the runway. In 1989, parts of the runway were re-insulated, giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution. In 2006, this measure {{was conducted on the}} remaining parts of the runway. An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Engadine was {{purchased}} in February 1915 by the Admiralty {{and she was}} modified by Cunard at Liverpool from 10 February to 23 March 1915 with a permanent, four-aircraft, hangar in the rear superstructure {{and a pair of}} cranes were mounted at the rear of <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> to hoist the seaplanes {{in and out of the}} water. Four quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns, each with 130 rounds, and two Vickers QF 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns, each with 65 rounds, were fitted for self-defence. She also carried a pigeon loft that housed carrier pigeons to be used by her aircraft if their wireless was broken.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the steep}} decline in routes, {{the company was}} reorganized into a virtual airline in 1999. All {{operations}} were {{taken over by the}} Swedish airline Golden Air, who would operate the Saab 340 aircraft. At the same time, Golden Air bought half of Teddy Air. In October, Coast Air announced that they had too few aircraft to continue flying from Stord, and would terminate operations. Teddy Air became the only airline to serve Stord. 1999 returned a loss of NOK6.9 million. In 2004, Teddy Air terminated all services. The contract with Golden Air was discontinued, and <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> at Geiteryggen was sold. The company remained on paper until 2005, when the equity was gone and the entity was dissolved.|$|E
50|$|On August 3, 1995, a welder's torch {{started a}} fire in <b>the</b> wooden <b>hangar.</b> Response from {{numerous}} area fire departments was swift but all attempts to control the blaze were unsuccessful due to <b>the</b> <b>hangar's</b> southern yellow pine construction and massive size. <b>The</b> wooden <b>hangar</b> was engulfed, and burned to the ground.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, <b>the</b> blimp <b>hangars</b> were {{designated}} National Civil Engineering Landmarks by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). There have been talks regarding making one of <b>the</b> <b>hangars</b> a military museum.|$|R

5|$|Hangar 5, the westernmost {{original}} hangar, houses Duxford's aircraft conservation workshops. Open to the public, <b>the</b> <b>hangar</b> allows {{visitors to}} see museum staff and volunteers {{at work on}} a variety of conservation tasks. Notable projects include a Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter acquired from an American owner in 'jungle recovery' condition, and a Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 now on display in AirSpace. Duxford is a partner with the British Aviation Preservation Council in the National Aviation Heritage Skills Initiative, which has been funded since 2005 by the Heritage Lottery Fund and aims to provide training to volunteers supporting aviation heritage projects.|$|E
5|$|Josephine Ledesma, from Austin, Texas, was 24 {{when the}} war broke out and worked as an {{airplane}} mechanic from 1942 to 1944. When her husband, Alfred, was drafted she decided to volunteer to work as an airplane mechanic. Even though the army waived her husband's duty, she was sent to train at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, where {{she was the only}} Mexican-American woman on the base. After her training, she was sent to Bergstrom Air Field. There were two other women, both non-Hispanic, at Bergstrom Air Field, and several more in Big Spring, all working in the sheet metal department. At Big Spring, she was the only woman working in <b>the</b> <b>hangar.</b> She worked as a mechanic between from 1942 to 1944.|$|E
5|$|Lexington was {{designed}} to carry 78 aircraft, including 36 bombers, but these numbers increased once the Navy adopted the practice of tying up spare aircraft in the unused spaces {{at the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>hangar.</b> In 1936, her air group consisted of 18 Grumman F2F-1 and 18 Boeing F4B-4 fighters, plus an additional nine F2Fs in reserve. Offensive punch was provided by 20 Vought SBU Corsair dive bombers with 10 spare aircraft and 18 Great Lakes BG torpedo bombers with nine spares. Miscellaneous aircraft included two Grumman JF Duck amphibians, plus one in reserve, and three active and one spare Vought O2U Corsair observation aircraft. This amounted to 79 aircraft, plus 30 spares.|$|E
