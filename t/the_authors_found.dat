5|$|While all {{molecular}} phylogeny studies {{and half the}} combined studies until 2008 conclude that brachiopods are lophotrochozoans, they could not identify which lophotrochozoan phylum were the closest relatives of brachiopods—except phoronids, which are a sub-group of brachiopods. However, in 2008 two analyses found that brachiopods' closest lophotrochozoan relatives were nemertines. <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> <b>found</b> this surprising, since nemertines have spiral cleavage {{in the early stages}} of cell division and form a trochophore larva, while brachiopods have radial cleavage and a larva that shows no sign of having evolved from a trochophore. Another study in 2008 also concluded that brachiopods are closely related to nemertines, casting doubt on the idea that brachiopods are part of a clade Lophophorata of lophophore-feeding animals within the lophotrochozoans.|$|E

5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the penis. <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> <b>found</b> that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E

The cysticercoids were approximately elliptical in shape with the larval scolex invaginated into the bladder and entirely surrounded by a heavy cyst wall. Neither caudal appendage nor embryonal hooks were observed on any of the specimens examined. The larvae were filled with calcaresus corpuscles which masked the internal structure. In general the cysticercoids (Fig. 1) infected in Pheidole fervida F. SMITH arelarger than those (Fig. 2) of Tetramorium caespiturn subsp. jacoti WHEELER. Both cysticercoids which infected in the two species of ants were only mature cysticercoids and the developing stage of them were not <b>found.</b> <b>The</b> <b>author</b> <b>found</b> that <b>the</b> tapeworms had infected up to 100 %, when <b>the</b> <b>author</b> killed young white Leghorn cocks and cut out their small intestine, 20 days after being fed them on cystcercoids taken out of the abdominal cavity of these ants.
