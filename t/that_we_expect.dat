2500|$|The British {{government}} {{demanded the}} return of the personnel. Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said, [...] "we sought a full explanation of what happened and left the Iranian authorities in no doubt <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> immediate and safe return of our service personnel and boats". Prime Minister Tony Blair denied the British boats were in Iranian waters and called the detainment [...] "unjustified and wrong".|$|E
2500|$|We must subject {{government}} officials to the same rules of conduct <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> of the citizen. The very existence of the government is imperiled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. As Brandeis puts it, [...] "if the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that {{in the administration of}} the criminal law the end justifies the means—to declare that the government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal—would bring terrible retribution. Against that pernicious doctrine this court should resolutely set its face." ...|$|E

It is only silly little {{children}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> will dispute and quarrel. I should not have supposed it possible {{in the case of}} such young ladies as you. It is a great deal better to be yielding and kind. If one of you says something that the other thinks is not true, let it pass without contradiction; it is foolish to dispute about it. And so if one has any thing that the other wants, it is generally much better to wait for it than to quarrel. It is hateful to quarrel. Besides, it spoils your beauty. When children are quarrelling they look like little furies." ...|$|E

60|$|In this distress, {{the wind}} still blowing very hard, {{one of our}} men {{early in the morning}} cried out, Land! and we had no sooner run out of the cabin to look out in hopes of seeing {{whereabouts}} in the world we were, but the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment, her motion being so stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> <b>we</b> should all have perished immediately; and we were immediately driven into our close quarters to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the sea.|$|R

While, however, we {{entertain}} these {{wishes and}} opinion, we must {{guard against the}} supposition that it is chiefly by holding out means and opportunities of official distinction <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> our Government to benefit the millions subjected to their authority. We have repeatedly expressed to you a very different sentiment. Facilities of official advancement can little affect {{the bulk of the}} people under any Government, and perhaps least under a good Government. It is not by holding out incentives to official ambition, but by repressing crime, by securing and guarding property, by creating confidence, by ensuring to industry the fruit of its labour, by protecting men in the undisturbed enjoyment of their rights, and in the unfettered exercise of their faculties, that Governments best minister to the public wealth and happiness. In effect, the free access to office is chiefly valuable when it is a part of general freedom.|$|E

Tell him, sir, that his threats leave this {{garrison}} as unmoved as do his promises. If so be that he intends in truth to bombard us, let him begin forthwith. We are ready for him, as you perceive. Maybe he did not suppose us equipped with cannon; but there they stand. Those guns are trained upon his camp, and the first shot he fires upon us shall be a signal for such a reply as he little dreams of. Tell him, too, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> no quarter, and will yield none. We are unwilling for bloodshed, but if he drives us to it and executes his purpose of employing cannon, then the consequences be upon his own head. Bear him that answer, and tell him to send you no more with empty threats." ...|$|E
60|$|My dearest Mrs. Martin,--I {{wrote to}} you not many days ago, but I {{must tell you}} that our voyagers are safe in Sandgate break in 'an ugly hulk' (as poor Stormie says despondingly), {{suffering}} three or four days of quarantine agony, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> to see them on Monday or Tuesday in the full bloom of their ill humour. I am happy to think, according to the present symptoms, that the mania for sea voyages is considerably abated. 'Nothing could be more miserable,' exclaims Storm; 'the only comfort of the whole four months is the safety of the beans, tell papa'--and the safety of the beans is rather a Pythagoraean[133] equivalent for four months' vexation, though not a bean of them all should have lost in freshness and value! He could scarcely write, he said, for the chilblains on his hands, and was in utter destitution of shirts and sheets. Oh!
