40|$|Secret Sharing {{from the}} {{perspective}} of <b>threshold</b> <b>schemes</b> has been well-studied over the past decade. <b>Threshold</b> <b>schemes,</b> however, can only handle {{a small fraction of the}} secret sharing functions which we may wish to form.

This paper will present general methods for constructing secret sharing schemes for any given secret sharing function.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{distributed}} estimation using one-bit quantization {{in the presence of}} non-ideal trans-mission links is revisited. Previous results have shown that the estimation performance highly depends on the selection of local quantization thresholds. Both the identical <b>threshold</b> <b>scheme</b> and the non-identical <b>threshold</b> <b>scheme</b> are investigated under the minimax criterion. Specifically, local sensor thresholds are uniformly distributed in the known range of the parameter under estimation for the non-identical <b>threshold</b> <b>scheme.</b> By compar-ing the Cramer-Rao Bounds (CRBs), the uniform thresholding scheme outperforms the identical <b>threshold</b> <b>scheme</b> when the parameter range is large relative to the standard deviation of the observation noise. Using the uniform thresholding scheme, maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) as well as a more practical estimator is developed. The comparison of these two thresholding schemes is conducted by adopting the proposed simple estimator and our previously proposed mean estimator. The results further confirm the superiority of the non-identical <b>threshold</b> <b>scheme</b> for a large parameter range...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the concept of}} quantum secret sharing. In a ((k,n)) <b>threshold</b> <b>scheme,</b> a secret quantum state is divided into n shares such that any k of those shares {{can be used to}} reconstruct the secret, but any set of k- 1 or fewer shares contains absolutely no information about the secret. We show that the only constraint on the existence of threshold schemes comes from the quantum "no-cloning theorem", which requires that n < 2 k, and, in all such cases, we give an efficient construction of a ((k,n)) <b>threshold</b> <b>scheme.</b> We also explore similarities and differences between quantum secret sharing schemes and quantum error-correcting codes. One remarkable difference is that, while most existing quantum codes encode pure states as pure states, quantum secret sharing schemes must use mixed states in some cases. For example, if k <= n < 2 k- 1 then any ((k,n)) <b>threshold</b> <b>scheme</b> must distribute information that is globally in a mixed state. Comment: 5 pages, REVTeX, submitted to PR...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To reduce energy {{consumption}} (EC), a mobile handset {{system can be}} designed {{in such a way}} that while the data-receiving unit in a mobile handset is receiving and monitoring data packets, the rest part of the handset (i. e., a processing unit and a user interface) is switched off into a sleep mode. In this paper, we study the timing when the rest part of the handset should wake up. Several schemes (i. e., Always-ON, Always-OFF, Wake-up upon Arrival, Wake-up upon Full, and the fractional <b>threshold</b> <b>scheme)</b> are studied and compared in terms of energy saving and the packet dropping probability (PDP). We formulate the total EC for all theses schemes analytically. Furthermore, we show how to choose optimal thresholds for the fractional <b>threshold</b> <b>scheme</b> for the following two-optimization problems: 1) minimizing the switch-on rate with a bound on the PDP and 2) minimizing the total EC with a bound on the PDP. Our study shows that the fractional <b>threshold</b> <b>scheme</b> is the best scheme. Simulations are carried out to validate analytic models.

In contrast to the traditional public key cryptography based on public key infrastructure (PKI) and identity-based public key cryptography (IDPKC), certificateless public key cryptography (CL-PKC) offers useful properties as it does not require any certificates to ensure the authenticity of public keys and the key escrow problem is eliminated. In this paper, we investigate the notion of <b>threshold</b> signature <b>schemes</b> in CL-PKC.
