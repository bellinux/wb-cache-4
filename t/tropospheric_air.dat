5000|$|Sudden stratospheric warming {{events are}} {{associated}} with weaker polar vortices. This warming of stratospheric air can reverse the circulation in the Arctic Polar Vortex from counter-clockwise to clockwise. These changes aloft force changes in the troposphere below. An example of {{an effect on the}} troposphere is the change in speed of the Atlantic Ocean circulation pattern. A soft spot just south of Greenland is where the initial step of downwelling occurs, nicknamed the [...] "Achilles Heel of the North Atlantic". Small amounts of heating or cooling traveling from the polar vortex can trigger or delay downwelling, altering the Gulf Stream Current of the Atlantic, and the speed of other ocean currents. Since all other oceans depend on the Atlantic Ocean's movement of heat energy, climates across the planet can be dramatically affected. The weakening or strengthening of the polar vortex can alter the sea circulation more than a mile beneath the waves. Strengthening storm systems within the troposphere that cool the poles, intensify the polar vortex. La Niña-related climate anomalies significantly strengthen the polar vortex. [...] Intensification of the polar vortex produces changes in relative humidity as downward intrusions of dry, stratospheric air enter the vortex core. With a strengthening of the vortex comes a longwave cooling due to a decrease in water vapor concentration near the vortex. The decreased water content is a result of a lower tropopause within the vortex, which places dry stratospheric air above moist <b>tropospheric</b> <b>air.</b> Instability is caused when the vortex tube, the line of concentrated vorticity, is displaced. When this occurs, the vortex rings become more unstable and prone to shifting by planetary waves.The planetary wave activity in both hemispheres varies year-to-year, producing a corresponding response in the strength and temperature of the polar vortex. The number of waves {{around the perimeter of the}} vortex are related to the core size; as the vortex core decreases, the number of waves increase.|$|E

To correct for the temporal increase of atmospheric N 2 O, the CARIBIC N 2 O data are expressed as deviations from the long-term trend at the northern hemispheric baseline station Mauna Loa, Hawaii (Delta N 2 O). Delta N 2 O undergoes a pronounced seasonal variation in the LMS with a minimum in spring. The amplitude increases going deeper in the LMS (up to potential temperature of 40 K above the thermal tropopause), {{as a result of}} the seasonally varying subsidence of air from the stratospheric overworld. Seasonal variation of CH 3 Cl above the tropopause is similar in phase to that of Delta N 2 O. Significant correlations are found between CH 3 Cl and Delta N 2 O in the LMS from winter to early summer, both being affected by mixing between stratospheric air and upper <b>tropospheric</b> <b>air.</b> This correlation, however, disappears in late summer to autumn. The slope of the CH 3 Cl-Delta N 2 O correlation observed in the LMS allows us to determine the stratospheric lifetime of CH 3 Cl to be 35 +/- 7 years.

From the correlation of CO and O 3 irreversible mixing of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>air</b> into the lowermost stratosphere is identified. The CO distribution indicates that transport and subsequent mixing of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>air</b> across the extratropical tropopause predominantly affects a layer, which closely follows the shape of the local tropopause. In addition, the seasonal cycle of CO 2 illustrates the strong coupling of that layer to the extratropical troposphere.

The mixing layer extends to about 25  K in potential temperature above the local tropopause exhibiting only a weak seasonality. However, at large distances from the tropopause a significant influence of <b>tropospheric</b> <b>air</b> is still evident.

In the stratosphere, there tended to be a positive correlation between NO(x) and water vapor and negative correlations between NO(x) and ozone and between NO(x) and total reactive odd-nitrogen, NO(y). The ratio of NO(x) to NO(y), in conjunction with NO(y), appears to be an excellent tracer of <b>tropospheric</b> or stratospheric <b>air</b> at northern latitudes during winter. Tropospheric NO(x) was typically 10 to 50 percent of gas-phase NO(y), while in the stratosphere, NO(x) was typically less than 10 percent, and frequently less than 5 percent of gas-phase NO(y) ...|$|R
