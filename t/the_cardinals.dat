5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cardinals</b> {{faced the}} Los Angeles Dodgers in the divisional {{round of the}} playoffs. Five home runs in Game 1 and no runs allowed by the bullpen in Game 2 helped <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> to win {{the first two games}}.

However, the Astros tied the series in the next two games in Houston, before a combined one-hitter by Astros pitchers Brandon Backe and Brad Lidge gave them the series lead.

2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the difficult stretch for <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal,</b> in 1988 <b>the</b> university announced it would shut down the paper’s presses, then located in Vilas Hall.

50|$|In the Catholic Church, {{it means}} {{in the heart of}} the Pope's bosom. In other words, this is a {{cardinal}} whose name isn't publicly revealed due to supposed dangers at home which would cause <b>the</b> <b>cardinal's</b> life to be in danger. If the pope reveals <b>the</b> <b>cardinal's</b> appointment before he dies, <b>the</b> <b>cardinal</b> is admitted to the next conclave provided he is under the age of 80. If the pope dies before <b>the</b> <b>cardinal</b> In pectore is revealed, <b>the</b> <b>cardinal's</b> appointment ends with the pope's death.|$|R
5|$|The series {{then moved}} to Shibe Park in Philadelphia for Game 3, where Martin had two hits, {{including}} a double and scored twice in a 5-2 Cardinals' victory over Grove. In Game 4, he produced the only two hits by <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> as they lost to Earnshaw, 3-0. Martin almost single-handedly provided the offense for <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> in Game 5, driving home four runs with two singles, a home run and a sacrifice fly, as <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> triumphed 5-1. Although he was held hitless {{in the final two}} games of the series, he made an impressive catch to extinguish an Athletics two-run rally in the ninth inning of Game 7 to end the game and clinch the world championship for <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Game2 {{ended on}} October 3, the Yankees and Cardinals boarded trains to St. Louis, Missouri. The mayor of St. Louis, Victor J. Miller, ordered that the workday end by three the next {{afternoon}} so that the city could welcome <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> at Union Station. <b>The</b> <b>Cardinals</b> players were treated like champions by fans and citizens alike. Just outside the station, Mayor Miller stood at a podium and presented club manager and player Rogers Hornsby with a brand new Lincoln sedan priced at US$4,000 and {{paid for by the}} city's top businessmen. Each member of the Cardinals' team received a new hat, a new pair of shoes, and an engraved white-gold watch valued at a manufacturer's price of $100. As <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> were receiving special treatment from the people of St. Louis, fans were lining up outside Sportsman's Park with the hope of being able to purchase tickets to Game3 for a price of $3.30.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's {{teammate}} Jack Clark hit a late-inning {{home run}} {{of his own}} in Game 6 to defeat the Dodgers, <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> moved on to face the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series. Once again sportswriters were quick {{to draw attention to}} Smith's outstanding defensive play instead of his 2 for 23 effort at the plate. After <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> took a three-games-to-two advantage, a controversial Game 6 call by umpire Don Denkinger overshadowed the remainder of the Series (which the Royals won in seven games).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cardinal</b> confesses {{his part}} {{in the killing of}} the Duchess to his mistress, Julia, then murders her with a {{poisoned}} Bible. Bosola overhears <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> plotting to kill him (though he accepts that he would earn this punishment for his actions), and so visits the darkened chapel to kill <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> at his prayers. Instead, he mistakenly kills Antonio, who has just returned to Malfi to attempt a reconciliation with <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal.</b> Bosola then stabs <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal,</b> who dies. In the brawl that follows, Ferdinand and Bosola stab each other to death.|$|R
