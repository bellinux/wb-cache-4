25|$|Upon {{retiring}} in 1963, Vollenhoven was succeeded by four persons: Hendrik van Riessen, J. van der Hoeven, A.W. Begemann, and C.A. van Peursen.

After giving his valedictory address on “Plato’s realism,” Vollenhoven continued to give private monthly lectures <b>to</b> <b>specialists</b> in his problem-historical work.

25|$|Old-style faces {{evolved over}} time, showing {{increasing}} abstraction from handwriting and blackletter models and often increased delicacy or contrast as printing technique improved. Old-style faces have often sub-divided into Venetian (or humanist) and Garalde (or Aldine), a division {{made on the}} Vox-ATypI classification system. Nonetheless, {{some have argued that}} the difference is excessively abstract, hard to spot except <b>to</b> <b>specialists</b> and implies a clearer separation between styles than originally appeared.

25|$|A set {{of skills}} and scope of {{practice}} may define a primary care physician, generally including basic {{diagnosis and treatment of}} common illnesses and medical conditions. Diagnostic techniques include interviewing the patient to collect information on the present symptoms, prior medical history and other health details, followed by a physical examination. Many PCPs are trained in basic medical testing, such as interpreting results of blood or other patient samples, electrocardiograms, or x-rays. More complex and time-intensive diagnostic procedures are usually obtained by referral <b>to</b> <b>specialists,</b> with special training with a technology or increased experience and patient volume that make a risky procedure safer for the patient. After collecting data, the PCP arrives at a differential diagnosis and, with the participation of the patient, formulates a plan including (if appropriate) components of further testing, specialist referral, medication, therapy, diet or life-style changes, patient education, and follow up results of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the three}} other {{countries}} which contributed combat forces to the war, Australia did not immediately contribute military forces to the post-war reconstruction of Iraq. Following victory, the Australian force in Iraq was limited <b>to</b> <b>specialists</b> attached to the Coalition headquarters in Baghdad {{and the search for}} Iraq's suspected weapons of mass destruction, a frigate in the Persian Gulf, a party of air traffic controllers at Baghdad International Airport, two C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, two AP-3C Orion aircraft and small Security Detachment (SECDET) consisting of infantry and Airfield Defence Guards protecting the Australian military units and diplomats based in Baghdad. This force was later expanded to include an Army training detachment and a small medical detachment attached to a US Air Force hospital. The Royal Australian Navy has also assumed command of coalition forces in the Persian Gulf on two occasions; Combined Task Force 58 in 2005 and Combined Task Force 158 in 2006.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the reasons why {{patients}} and families are referred <b>to</b> <b>specialist</b> palliative care. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with patients, and professionals from primary care and specialist palliative care services in the north of England. A content analysis of the transcripts was undertaken, key issues were identified and common themes grouped. Twelve professionals working in specialist palliative care, three GPs, six community nurses and thirteen patients were interviewed (n= 34). Five key themes are reported: reasons why patients are referred <b>to</b> <b>specialist</b> palliative care; reasons why patients are not referred <b>to</b> <b>specialist</b> palliative care; timeliness of referrals; continuity of care; and use of referral criteria. It was found that the professionals in primary care would like more training and education about how to refer patients <b>to</b> <b>specialist</b> palliative care and how to deal with issues of death and dying. The patients were generally satisfied with the service but wanted to be able to be supported at home in their final days. Further training and education may improve the knowledge of professionals who refer patients <b>to</b> <b>specialist</b> palliative care. There are currently no standardized criteria in the UK to determine when a referral should be triggered. The development of a set of standardized referral criteria may be useful in aiding a referral decision...|$|R
500|$|A wide low crystal vase with {{cover is}} {{engraved}} {{with the name}} of the Mughal Emperor Akbar, and was long thought to have been German, but sent out to India as a diplomatic gift, as the metalwork mounts are clearly European in style. It is now seen as an original, and exceptionally rare, Mughal crystal carving, to which the mounts were added in the 19th century, perhaps in Paris. [...] However the cartouche with Akbar's name does not seem <b>to</b> <b>specialists</b> correct for a contemporary court piece, and the vase in India was probably carved after his reign (1556–1605), and the name perhaps added even later.|$|E
500|$|It {{quickly became}} the {{standard}} reference work for a generation of British ornithologists, replacing Thomas Bewick's book {{of the same name}} through its increased scientific accuracy, but following Bewick in its mixture of scientific data, accurate illustrations, detailed descriptions and varied anecdotes, {{as well as in the}} use of small 'tail-piece' engravings at the ends of articles. This [...] made the book attractive to the public as well as <b>to</b> <b>specialists.</b> Yarrell, a newsagent without university education, corresponded widely with eminent naturalists including Carl Linnaeus, Coenraad Jacob Temminck and Thomas Pennant to collect accurate information on the hundreds of species illustrated in the work.|$|E
500|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the Republican {{neoconservative}} administration of President George W. Bush, elected to the presidency in 2001, differed from earlier administrations in one key respect: it was open about adhering to the Imperial Grand Strategy, outright declaring {{that it would be}} willing to use force to ensure U.S. global hegemony despite international condemnation. Chomsky sees this as being in contrast to previous administrations, who had never explicitly informed the public that they adhered to such a doctrine. Instead, earlier administrations had discussed their intentions within elite circles which were known only <b>to</b> <b>specialists</b> or readers of dissident literature. Thus, where once only the socio-economic elite and their left-wing critics knew of the Imperial Grand Strategy, now the entire American populace are potentially aware of it. He considers this a [...] "significant difference." ...|$|E

Alexandru eventually remixed the song and stretched it to three minutes and 41 seconds. An English language track, [...] "Yodel It!" [...] combines rock with pop and hip hop music. Ilinca yodels prominently during the chorus, while Florea provides rap vocals. The song runs at a moderate tempo of 87 beats per minute. Bogdan Honciuc from Wiwibloggs likened its lyrical message to that of Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off" [...] (2014), as [...] "Ilinca teaches us to break free from the daily doom and gloom, but she suggests yodeling our hearts out instead of shaking it off".

He continued to add to the series until at least his departure for England, and presumably added Inigo Jones whilst in London.|$|E
