40|$|This {{reference}} document on {{best available techniques}} in the tannery industry reflects an information exchange carried out according to Article 16 (2) of Council Directive 96 / 61 /EC. The document has {{to be seen in}} the light of the preface, which describes the objectives of the document and its use. Scope The scope of the BREF for the tanning industry is based on Section 6. 3 of Annex I of the IPPC Directive 96 / 61 /EC as ‘Plants for <b>tanning</b> <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> where the treatment capacity exceeds 12 tonnes of finished products per day’. The types of hides and skins are restricted to those of ovine and bovine origin, because the production capacities for any other type of raw material for the production of leather and furs are far below the threshold value in the Directive. Structure of the industry (Chapter 1) The tannery operation consists of converting the raw hide or skin, a highly putrescible material, into leather, a stable material, which can be used in the manufacture of a wide range of products. The whole process involves a sequence of complex chemical reactions and mechanical processes. Amongst these, tanning is the fundamental stage, which gives leather its stability an...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} fifty years the {{problems}} of the leather industry have been tackled from various aspects by scientific research workers all over the world, and "works control" today forms one of. the important foundation stones of efficiently run tanneries and footwear factories. The raw materials of the tanning industry, hides and skins, constitute the largest proportion of the cost of production, and it is ' only natural that the improvement of these valuable raw materials should be given primary attention by any leather scientist. Until only a few years ago, however, the South African hide and skin industry was at a serious ·disadvantage in that it had to base recommendations for improved production methods almost exclusively on overseas experience and practice. The importance of the differences existing between South Africa and European or American countries with regard to climate, slaughtering, hide and skin production in general, transport and sale, however, necessitates a different approach to our specific problems. The overseas hide and skin industry has had, since the beginning of this century, the support and particularly the guidance of scientific research; {{but it was not until}} 1935, when, through the support of the Hide and Skin advisory Board, Prof. W. F. Barker founded the original <b>Tanning,</b> <b>Hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>Skins</b> Research Department at Rhodes University College, Grahamstown, that science actively entered the field of hide and skin production in this country. Much of the work done had of course to be based on the results obtained by overseas research institutions, and the adaptation of such results to suit our own problems for some time formed a considerable part of the investigations undertaken. This thesis embodies the results of work undertaken by the writer since 1943 on specific problems of the South African hide and skin industry. Much of the work has already received publication through the Circulars and Journals of this Institute, but it is embodied here again in order to maintain the continuity. The attitude throughout has been to evolve methods of production suited to our own conditions, and the adoption of the recommendations contained in this thesis should lead to improvement in the quality of our hides and skins. Much still remains to be done, and it is the sincere hope of the writer that this work will stimulate and form the basis for subsequent investigations. For that reason more or less detailed descriptions are given of all experiments conducted, and the theory of curing in its relation to tanning is briefly discussed. The literature in each of the four Parts has been attached at the end of that Part to facilitate reference work. At the same time, however, the writer kept in mind the requirements of the trade itself, therefore much of the work is discussed in popular terms. It is hoped that the correct balance between the two extremes has been arrived at...|$|E

Depolymerisation of condensed tannins is presented as an alternative source of low molecular weight phenolics to be applied in the stabilisation of collagen. In this research, mimosa tannin from the Black Wattle tree (Acacia mearnsii) was used in the depolymerisation process. Preliminary experiments on depolymerisation were undertaken using the methods laccase-mediator system and L-cysteine in mild acidic medium, both showing unsatisfactory results. Acid-catalysed depolymerisation followed by nucleophile addition is a common analytical method for determining the degree of polymerisation of proanthocyanidins. The acid-catalysed depolymerisation method was scaled-up, with the addition of pyrogallol as a nucleophile trapping agent, and powdered depolymerised mimosa was obtained. Data show an increase in the monomeric content and decrease in percentage of condensed tannins for the acid-catalysed process, indicating the potential of the depolymerisation of mimosa tannin in obtaining environmentally friendly sources of low molecular weight phenolic compounds for use in large scale/industrial applications. The depolymerised product was applied in the stabilisation of <b>hide</b> powder <b>and</b> goat <b>skin.</b> Using <b>hide</b> powder, data show that the laccase-assisted polymerisation of the depolymerised mimosa reached higher values of ΔTs in comparison with the conventional process employing unmodified mimosa.

Samples collected were <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> treated with salt, washed and air dried. Samples taken 2 hours after slaughter and samples delivered without treatment. The bacterial damage was clear in raw <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> delivered without treatment. They showed signs of putrefaction, offensive odour and hair slipping. A number of bacteria were isolated. A number of bacteria were isolated also from traditional salted <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> this was probably due to delay in curing and absence of bacteriocides. A number of bacteria were isolated from samples taken from washed <b>and</b> air dried <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> samples 2 hours taken after slaughter, this probably due to poor hygiene, large number of labors and bad condition of collection room of raw <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins.</b> A total of 414 organisms were isolated and consist of 379 Grampositive bacteria and 35 were Gram- negative bacteria.

The objectives of the study were to identify the roles of the major actors and market channels, analyze strengths and weakness of the marketing system, and estimate the potential demand of the <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins.</b> A survey was conducted in which data and information were collected from 15 local collectors 5 butcheries <b>and</b> 6 <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> traders using structured questionnaire. Secondary data including prices, marketing, and purchase and sales of the raw material were collected from government bodies and private organizations. In addition, the production <b>and</b> quality of <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> were studied by selecting 121 sample rural household heads from 4 villages of the wereda using two stage random sampling. Formal and informal data collection tools of both primary and secondary data were also used. In analyzing the marketing conditions of the raw materials, descriptive statistics and SCP paradigm were used. Results indicate that 66 % of rural households sell <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> to local collector in rural areas, while 34 % supplied to the wereda wholesalers. Buying process was done without following the grading standards of <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins,</b> by simple sorting based on visible defects. The concentration analysis indicated that the market was highly oligopolistic with narrow range of market concentration. The marketing margin and marketing cost analysis showed transport charges, income and municipality tax, labour cost, preservation material cost and store rent were costs that influenced the marketing margin. High market concentration, barriers to entry in terms of capital and credit, and high marketing margin in the study area reveal that <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> marketing was inefficient. Therefore, to improve marketing system, correcting malpractices, implementation of standard grades and provision of market information, capacity building for all actors in the chain, strengthening the extension service on the product handling and management to farmers were recommended.

40|$|Most {{countries}} have implemented export-oriented development strategies with {{the objectives of}} improving their economic stability and improving resource allocation efficiency. Export tax, which has been {{an integral part of}} trade policies for centuries, has not been given adequate attention by the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the economic literature. Export taxes on primary commodities serve as indirect subsidies to manufacturing and processing industries by lowering the domestic price of inputs, and also {{have a positive effect on}} government revenue. Conversely, export taxes can have a negative impact on the producers of raw materials and externalities for trade partners. The government of Ethiopia applied a 150 % export tax on raw <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> (RHS) <b>and</b> semi-finished leather products in 2008, and another 150 % export tax on crust leather in 2012 in order to encourage the leather manufacturing industry. The aim of this study is to examine the export trends of Ethiopia s raw <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> finished leather products, and to analyse the effect of export tax on Ethiopia s leather industry s export competitiveness. A linear trend analysis model was used to analyse the export trends of raw <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> finished leather products. This study evaluated export volume data from 1997 to 2014 in order to estimate the trend coefficients. The results of the model showed that Ethiopia s RHS and semi-processed leather products export had declined by - 38. 06 % and significant at 1 % significant level; this is due to the heavy export tax imposed by the government to increase the production and export of finished leather products. Meanwhile, finished leather products and footwear have increased by 75. 34 % and 44. 37 % respectively, and significant at 1 % significant level. The comparative advantage analysis was used to examine the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) of Ethiopia by comparing selected countries. The results indicated that Ethiopia was a RCA of raw <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> semi-processed leather products more than one (RCA > 1) before 2008; after the export tax implementation in 2008, the RCA became decreased, conversely, the RCA of Ethiopia s finished product more than one for the period 2006 to 2014 and increased more after 2008. South Africa has comparative advantage only on the export of raw <b>hides</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> semi-processed leather product (RCA> 1). Nigeria was not stable RCA for both raw <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> finished leather products and in most year revealed comparative advantage greater than one (RCA > 1). The RCA indexes of footwear for all three countries were less than one except Ethiopia in (2007, 2008 and 2012). The RCA provides information on advantage to exports, such as product comparisons with other competitive countries. However, the RCA does not show the sources of advantage (growth), therefore the constant market share (CMS) model was used to indicate the source of advantage. The CMS model has been used to evaluate the competitiveness of Ethiopia s leather products. The export value data of 2007 were used as the base year, whereas data in 2013 were considered as the year after the export tax implementation and increase. The results indicate that the implementation of the export tax has reduced the competitiveness of raw <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> semi-processed leather products, but increased the competitiveness of the finished leather products in the world markets. The overall results showed positive export growth (2. 55), which is most likely achieved by an increase in the export competitiveness of the leather industry of 2. 25. The positive competitiveness value indicates that Ethiopian finished leather products are competitive with other exporters in selected markets (Italy, China and Hong Kong). Conversely, Ethiopia s leather products have negative commodity composition effects and market composition effects (- 0. 132 and - 0. 262, respectively). The negative commodity composition effect shows that, because of the export tax, the export of Ethiopian raw <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> semi-processed leather products have decreased, while the imports of these products have grown faster in selected markets.
