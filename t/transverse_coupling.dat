Introduction The <b>transverse</b> <b>coupling</b> impedance {{is a measure of}} the interaction between the beam and deflecting modes (TM 1 n 0) in accelerator cavities. Two-wire and bead-pull techniques are usually employed for the measurement of <b>transverse</b> <b>coupling</b> impedance. The principle of the wire technique is to insert wires into cavities and beam line components to transform them into transmission lines and measure the scattering parameters. Coupling impedances (longitudinal or transverse) are extracted from S parameters [1]. For longitudinal coupling impedance measurement, a single wire is inserted in the center of cavities and beam components to form a coaxial transmission line. For <b>transverse</b> <b>coupling</b> impedance, two off-center wires are inserted to form a balanced-two-wire transmission line and a 180 degree, 3 db pow [...] ...|$|E

These simulations confirm the results obtained analytically and extend them to cases which are not easily accessible by analytical methods. I. INTRODUCTION <b>Transverse</b> <b>coupled</b> bunch oscillations in a storage ring are driven by wake fields due to the interaction with cavity-like structures or with the resistive wall of the vacuum vessel.

40|$|Surface {{waves in}} {{metamaterials}} {{are responsible for}} a range of phenomena, and understanding their properties is essential for the development of metamaterial applications. This thesis first investigates the propagation of surface magneto-inductive waves along a defect in an array of split-ring resonators. A new approach is demonstrated in which the defect is formed by changing the resonant frequency of the defect elements. The dispersion relation was derived and its dependence on the sign and the strength of the inter-element coupling and the relationship between the resonant frequencies was studied. Waveguides, couplers and filters were simulated, and the theoretical results were verified experimentally. The thesis further investigates the effect of inter-element coupling on surface magneto-inductive polaritons. Using two models, one relying on the effective-medium approximation and the other on equivalent circuits, we studied theoretically surface polaritons propagating along an interface between air and a magnetic metamaterial. With a moderate longitudinal coupling, a single polariton is supported similar to the un-coupled case. However, the presence of a <b>transverse</b> <b>coupling</b> changed the polariton dispersion dramatically. The effective-medium model yielded two branches of polariton dispersion at low values of <b>transverse</b> <b>coupling.</b> As the coupling increased, both polaritons disappeared. The validity of the effective-medium model was further tested by employing the circuit model. In this model, surface polaritons could exist {{in the presence of a}} <b>transverse</b> <b>coupling</b> only if the boundary layer of the metamaterial included additional impedances, which could become non-Foster circuits. The results reveal that the inter-element coupling is a major mechanism affecting the properties of the polaritons. They also highlight the limitations of using bulk effective-medium parameters for interface problems in metamaterials. Open Acces...|$|E
