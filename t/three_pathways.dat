25|$|Glutamyl endopeptidase {{has been}} shown to cleave certain target {{proteins}} among human inflammatory regulators and immune components. It can process kininogen into kinin, and cleave immunoglobulins. The protease also cleaves and inactivates α1-antitrypsin, but is successfully inhibited by α2-macroglubulin. Glutamyl endopeptidase can inhibit the activation of targets within the complement system. It is indicated to cause inhibition to all <b>three</b> <b>pathways</b> of complement activation.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{contact with}} their ligand, TNF receptors also form trimers, their tips fitting into the grooves formed between TNF monomers. This binding causes a {{conformational}} change {{to occur in the}} receptor, leading to the dissociation of the inhibitory protein SODD from the intracellular death domain. This dissociation enables the adaptor protein TRADD to bind to the death domain, serving as a platform for subsequent protein binding. Following TRADD binding, <b>three</b> <b>pathways</b> can be initiated.|$|E
25|$|The Sec-dependent {{system is}} divided into <b>three</b> <b>{{pathways}}.</b> TAAs are one of those pathways and also go by the name type Vc secretion pathway. The mechanism is split into two. First, the protein must move across the inner membrane or, in other words, translocate, in a Sec-dependent manner via the periplasm. The signal peptide on the N-terminus acts as a temporary tether {{to hold it in}} place. Next, it must move to the outer membrane. The trimerisation aids translocation, and no translocation would occur without its beta-barrel membrane anchor. The type V secretion system is described as non-fimbrious, meaning that the bacterial cells do not use long physical appendages named pili to attach to one another.|$|E

25|$|A token {{remnant of}} Snape Wood {{was left behind}} {{in the middle of the}} new estate, amounting to little more than a small fenced-in copse with <b>three</b> <b>pathways</b> leading through it. Owned by the local authority, Nottingham City Council, the site was {{designated}} a Local Nature Reserve, but years of neglect have left the site rubbish-strewn and in need of a structured management plan. Despite constant fly-tipping and a lack of proactive conservation, this site surprisingly supports a wide variety of wildlife, from rare wildflowers to mammals such as grey squirrels, hedgehogs and urban foxes, as well as up to 20 different species of bird. In February 2009, plans to set up a community group to take ownership for the maintenance and conservation of the site on behalf of the local authority were moved forward.|$|E
25|$|The reticulospinal tracts, {{also known}} as the {{descending}} or anterior reticulospinal tracts, are extrapyramidal motor tracts that descend from the reticular formation in two tracts to act on the motor neurons supplying the trunk and proximal limb flexors and extensors. The reticulospinal tracts are involved mainly in locomotion and postural control, although they do have other functions as well. The descending reticulospinal tracts are one of four major cortical pathways to the spinal cord for musculoskeletal activity. The reticulospinal tracts works with the other <b>three</b> <b>pathways</b> to give a coordinated control of movement, including delicate manipulations. The four pathways can be grouped into two main system pathways – a medial system and a lateral system. The medial system includes the reticulospinal pathway and the vestibulospinal pathway, and this system provides control of posture. The corticospinal and the rubrospinal tract pathways belong to the lateral system which provides fine control of movement.|$|E

500|$|In {{budding yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Holliday {{junctions}} {{can be resolved}} by four different pathways that account for essentially all Holliday junction resolution in vivo. [...] The pathway that produces the majority of crossovers in S. cerevisiae budding yeast, and possibly in mammals, involves proteins EXO1, MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer (called MutL gamma) and SGS1 (ortholog of Bloom syndrome helicase). [...] The MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer binds preferentially to Holliday junctions. [...] It is an endonuclease that makes single-strand breaks in supercoiled double-stranded DNA. [...] The MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer promotes the formation of crossover recombinants. [...] While the other <b>three</b> <b>pathways,</b> involving proteins MUS81-MMS4, SLX1 and YEN1, respectively, can promote Holliday junction resolution in vivo, absence of all three nucleases has only a modest impact on formation of crossover products.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the {{proteins}} and glycoproteins {{that constitute the}} complement system are synthesized by hepatocytes. But significant amounts are also produced by tissue macrophages, blood monocytes, and epithelial cells of the genitourinal tract and gastrointestinal tract. The <b>three</b> <b>pathways</b> of activation all generate homologous variants of the protease C3-convertase. The classical complement pathway typically requires antigen—antibody complexes (immune complexes) for activation (specific immune response), whereas the alternative pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis, foreign material, pathogens, or damaged cells. The mannose-binding lectin pathway can be activated by C3 hydrolysis or antigens without the presence of antibodies (non-specific immune response). In all <b>three</b> <b>pathways,</b> C3-convertase cleaves and activates component C3, creating C3a and C3b, and causes a cascade of further cleavage and activation events.
