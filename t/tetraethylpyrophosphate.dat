40|$|IN 1935 {{neostigmine}} x {{was introduced}} {{as an agent}} {{for the treatment of}} myasthenia gravis. It is still the drug of choice but, because of the fre-quency of dosage and the development of refractoriness in some patients, there has been a concentrated search for another, more nearly ideal thera-peutic agent. In recent years potent anticholinesterase (antiChE) drugs, the alkyl phosphates, were introduced for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. These include di-isopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), 2 <b>tetraethylpyrophosphate</b> (TEPP), 3 and hexaethyltetraphosphate (HETP). 4 DFP was found to be a very effective antiChE agent, but toxic and not effective therapeutically. HETP and TEPP were found to be more effective in treatment, but were unstable and therefore created difficulties in manufacture. In 1951 Rider et al. 5 introduced the most recent of these alkyl phosphates, octamethyl pyrophosphoramide (OMPA). Gregory and Stone 6 have com-pared the clinical responses of the patient with myasthenia gravis to OMP...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{prevailing}} theory, the propagation of nerve impulse is dependent upon (1) the release of acetylcholine near a receptor protein, (2) the depolarization of the excitable membrane and (3) the rapid hydrolysis of acetylcholine by the closely situated enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, thereby restoring the membrane to a polarized state. This theory is based primarify upon results of in vitro studies conducted chiefly by Nachmansohn and collegues (1) [...] It follows that {{in the presence of}} a cholinesterase inhibitor, acetylcholine would be allowed to accumulate to such a high concentration as to cause blockade of nerve conduction. This has indeed been shown to be the case in in vitro preparations such as the single giant axon of the squid (2), the lobster walking-leg nerve bundle (3) and in the isolated frog sciatic nerve (4). In all of these preparations the concentrations of inhibitors required to in-hibit conduction were extremsly large. Murtha et. al. (5) reported that followingthe administration of <b>Tetraethylpyrophosphate</b> (1. ...|$|E
40|$|Bacillus cereus SM 3 was {{isolated}} on a mineral salts medium with Tween 80 {{as the primary}} carbon source. It was able to hydrolyze second- and third-generation pyrethroids, thereby generating noninsecticidal products. The enzyme responsible for this hydrolytic reaction was named permethrinase for this study. This is the first instance in which pyrethroid detoxification has been achieved with a cell-free microbial enzyme system. Permethrinase was purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. The molecular mass of native permethrinase was 61 +/- 3 kDa, as estimated by Sephadex G- 100 gel filtration. This novel microbial esterase {{seems to be a}} carboxylesterase. Permethrinase activity had an optimum pH of 7. 5 and a temperature optimum of 37 degrees C. No cofactors or coenzymes were required for permethrinase activity. The enzyme may be a serine esterase, as it seems {{to be sensitive to the}} organophosphorus compound <b>tetraethylpyrophosphate</b> at concentrations in the micromolar range. Addition of dithiothreitol afforded permethrinase protection against the inhibitory effects of the sulfydryl agents p-chloromercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide. The enzyme was stable over a range of temperatures. Cell extracts of strain SM 3 also contained another esterase, which was active towards beta-naphthylacetate, but this enzyme was distinct from permethrinase...|$|E
40|$|In 1966 the U. S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, since {{renamed the}} U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, was {{considering}} {{the use of}} commercial <b>tetraethylpyrophosphate</b> (TEPP) for spraying problem bird roosts. Although TEPP {{was known to be}} a fast degrading organophosphate, the Bureau decided that a determination of TEPP residues on birds sprayed under simulated field conditions would be useful in reaching a decision on possible use of this material. The determination was done with an enzymatic Warburg manometric method for measuring the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a major cause of neurotoxication. It was found that at simulated roost temperatures of 7 · 8 °C with relative humidity of 57 · 60 %, the AChE inhibition activity of TEPP in red·winged blackbirds diminished rapidly in the first 2 days. However, after 19 days, an indicated 2. 2 % (2. 8 % statistically possible) remained as cholinergic inhibition residues that could be hazardous to humans or nontarget species, considerably more than 99 % loss in 45. 2 hr at 26 °C that had been previously reported. This information, among others, was used by the Bureau in deciding not to pursue the use of TEPP in spraying problem bird roosts...|$|E
40|$|Frog skin cholinesterase {{is largely}} of the serum (pseudocholinesterase) type. For whole skin, the {{activity}} at 10 [...] 1 ~ AcChC 1 is 4. 9 /~l. /mg. N/hr. Tela subcutanea isolated by dissection exhibits an activity of 65 #l. /mg. N/hr. at 10 [...] j ~ AcChC 1. Since about one-tenth of the nitrogen {{of the skin}} {{is located in the}} tela subcutanea, it is estimated that more than 90 per cent of the enzyme is associated with this tissue layer. Kirschner (8) has reported that inhibitors of cholinesterase inhibit active sodium transport in frog skin. These inhibitors are more effective when applied {{to the inside of the}} skin than when applied to the outside. The action of each inhibitor on sodium flux has the same reversibility properties as its action on the enzyme. Thus, eserine, a reversible inhibitor of cholinesterase, reversibly inhibits active sodium transport, while <b>tetraethylpyrophosphate,</b> an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme, exhibits irreversible inhibition of transport. Van der Kloot (10) has presented evidence that the sodium pump in frog muscle requires cholinesterase activity. He measured the equilibrium intracellular sodium concentration and the residual cholinesterase activity of frog sartorii which had been bathed in graded concentrations of physostigmine eserine, a cholinesterase inhibitor capable of penetrating into the muscle fibre. It was found that the equilibrium intracellular sodium concentration paralleled the degree of cholinesterase inhibition, the 50 per cent values both falling at about 10 - ~ ~ physostigmine. Despite the occurrence of high cholinesterase activities in tissues in which active sodium transport is observed to occur, and the striking effects of cho...|$|E
40|$|The {{types of}} cardiac cholinesterases (1) and the {{responses}} of the myocardium to acetylcholine (2, 3) differ in various species and at various sites in the heart. It has not been possible to explain the differing physiological responses in terms of the types of cholinesterases present (1 - 3). A comparative study of the histochemical localization at the ultrastructural level of cholinesterase activity in cardiac muscle, correlated with biochemical and physiological findings, might shed some light on the B R I E F N O T E S ~ 5 functions of the cholinesterases of cardiac muscle. Barrnett and Palade (4) applied the thiolacetic acid histochemical method to rat ventricular muscle. Non-specific esterases (5) and specific (acetyl) cholinesterase (6) are known to hydrolyse thiolacetic acid, and the latter may be distinguished by the use of specific inhibitors. Hydrolysis of thiolacetic acid, CH~COSH, yields acetic acid and hydrogen sulfide: the latter is precipitated as lead sulfide, giving, at the sites of enzyme activity, an electron-opaque deposit. In rat ventricular muscle, Barrnett and Palade (4) found the most striking activity in the M band. This activity was reported to be inhibited partially by 10 - 6 M eserine and almost completely by 10 -s M <b>tetraethylpyrophosphate</b> and by 10 - 4 M diisopropylfluorophosphate. They suggested that this enzyme was possibly a cholinesterase. No other site of cholinesterase activity in ventricular muscle was observed. We {{have not been able to}} confirm these observations on the effects of inhibitors using a modification of the same technique. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that the M band enzyme is not a cholinesterase, but may be rather an organophosphate-resistant non-specific esterase...|$|E
