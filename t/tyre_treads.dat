40|$|The regular <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> {{pattern design}} process is often based upon {{experience}} and experimental evaluations and may take about 2 years. The use of engineering tooling could improve and speed up this process. The research objective is therefore to develop experimental and simulation tooling by which interior <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise can be predicted, analysed and optimized. The physics of tyre-road noise is {{explained in a}} comprehensive manner as {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics is needed to evaluate, measure, analyse or optimize tyres with respect to noise. The first engineering tool developed is an instrumented vehicle with dedicated measurement and processing technologies, enabling quantification of the terminology used in subjective evaluations of tyre-road noise. The three most important <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise characteristics are: level, tonalness and modulation/drumming. They can be quantified, respectively, by the Sound Pressure Level, the so-called order spectrum and the (bandpass filtered) sound pressure variation during one tyre revolution. While rolling on smooth roads, the <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern geometry in the tyre-road contact is considered to be the main origin of contact pressure variations, resulting in vibrations and noise. The second engineering tool is a simulation procedure of this source. In the new source modelling approach, the averaged tread pattern height in contact is calculated. The model predicts (R 2 = 0. 76) the correct trends of the three <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise characteristics, by using the trend of their geometrical cause. The model can be used to reduce exterior as well as interior <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise. From these <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise characteristics dedicated Sound Quality Metrics are defined: for level the Standard Deviation (STD), for tonalness the Order Prominence (OP) and for modulation the Multi-Order Modulation (MOM). They correspond very well (respectively R 2 = 0. 96, 0. 60 and 0. 80) with the human perception of the noise characteristics. An increase in each of the metrics results in a worse subjective perception of the <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise. The metrics are applicable for measured and simulated sounds. In the third engineering tool the three metrics are combined to model the human percpetion of <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> patternn noise. The human perception model is obtained through a linear regression of these tyre related Sound Quality Metrics on the subjective rating of simulated sounds. The output of the model is called the Sound Quality Preference Index (SQPI) predicting the human perception of <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern sounds correctly (R 2 = 0. 94).

The reason for this is the growing concern about the effect of rubber product waste on the environment and the rise in the costs of virgin rubbers. In this study, physicomechanical properties such as tensile properties, tear strength, hardness, resilience, abrasion resistance, ageing performance, and swelling behaviour as well as carbon black dispersion rating of 85 / 15 virgin NRinovel reclaimed ground rubber tyre (GRT) revulcanisates were evaluated and compared with those of control vulcanisates. Results revealed that the abrasion volume loss of blends of virgin NR and novel reclaimed rubber revulcanisates is lower than that of revulcanisate prepared with a blend of 85 / 15 virgin NRI reclaimed rubber (Control (Rec)), produced locally, and comparable with that of 100 % NR vulcanisate (Control (NR)). Although the tensile strength and elongation at break of the virgin NRinovel reclaimed rubber revulcanisates are lower than those of the Control (NR) vulcanisate, these values are at a level acceptable for <b>tyre</b> <b>treads.</b> Hence, the 85 / 15 virgin NRinovel reclaimed rubber revulcanisates prepared with the readily available, low-cost, environmentally friendly amino compound can be used {{as an alternative to the}} Control (NR) and Control (Rec) vulcanisates in <b>tyre</b> <b>treads...</b>|$|E

Therefore, local rubber industries, particularly re-treading tyre industry has started replacing RSS grade partly with a cheaper scrap grade of Natural Rubber (NR) in their re-treading tyre compounds, in arbitrary ratios without considering the quality of <b>tyre</b> <b>treads.</b> In the project work, the tyre re-treading compounds based on blends of (RSS) and scrap grade in different proportions are investigated to identify the most suitable blend for obtaining optimum technical properties. The first step of the study reveals that the blend having RSS and scrap rubber in the ratio 80 : 20 is the most suitable economical blend to obtain a balance of technical properties.

40|$|Ground {{rubber tyre}} (GRT) {{produced}} by recycling of tyre waste or rejects {{is used as}} a filler in the manufacture of tyre components, mainly to reduce the cost. Rubber matrix-GRT compositions generally exhibit poor mechanical properties due to poor matrix-filler adhesion and lack of reactive sites on GRT particle surfaces. Therefore, GRT is modified by employing various types of reclamation processes to enhance mechanical properties. The modified GRT known as reclaimed rubber is widely used as a component in rubber blends in many applications, especially in tyre manufacturing. This study is focused on developing a cost effective, environmental friendly mechano-chemical reclamation process for GRT to produce reclaim rubber using a readily available amino compound. Initially, influence of the amino compound on rubber compound properties was evaluated and results indicate that it acts as an activator for sulphur vulcanization. Properties of GRT modified with the amino compound indicate that the amino compound acts as a reclaiming agent as well. Comparison of properties of natural rubber (NR) / novel reclaimed rubber blend compounds and revulcanisates with those of the controls reveal that the former can be used as alternatives to the latter in the manufacture of <b>tyre</b> <b>treads.</b> Replacement of 30 % of virgin NR in the vulcanisates with the novel reclaimed rubber retains about 65 - 85 % of strength properties, elongation at break and resilience. Abrasion volume loss is at an acceptable level and ageing properties are comparable to those of the 100 % virgin NR vulcanisate. Further, most of the properties of the virgin NR / novel reclaimed rubber composites are comparable to those of the corresponding composites prepared by blending NR with commercially available reclaimed rubbers. Accordingly, the novel reclaimed rubber could be a suitable component to blend with virgin NR in the manufacture of <b>tyre</b> <b>treads</b> with required properties.

40|$|Thesis (DTech. {{degree in}} Mathematics and Statistics) Tshwane University of TechnologyFor decades, the {{development}} of rhythmic corrugations on untarred roads has fascinated road engineers and technicians and even travellers. Numerous researchers have proposed theories about the formation and movement of these corrugations. Automobile tyres are essentially designed for use on tarred or concrete road surfaces. However, these tyres are also used on dirt roads, which often develop corrugations {{as a result of}} the interaction between the vehicle and dry road surfaces. Designing a tyre suited to corrugated dirt road conditions would be advantageous for rural inhabitants as well as the economy of a country. The aim of this research is to investigate the tangential oscillation of the vehicle <b>tyre’s</b> <b>tread</b> surface when the tyre strikes an obstacle in the road and the effect of this tangential oscillation on the formation of corrugations. A theoretical analysis of the nature and frequency of the tangential oscillation of the tread surface of the rubber tyre was done. A mathematical model (torsional oscillator model) of the tangential oscillations of the rubber <b>tyre’s</b> <b>tread</b> surface was proposed, in the form of an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. To verify this model, static experiments were performed on a wheel with a rigid, stationary axle. Dynamic experiments were then carried out on the tyre of a vehicle. It was found that, when a vehicle is travelling a corrugated dirt road and an obstacle (such as a corrugation) is struck in the road, the tread surface of the rubber tyre will oscillate tangentially. A second theoretical model, the forced telegraph equation model, in the form of a partial differential equation, was also proposed. Correlation between the graphs of the two models was evident. The experiments and observations in this research are consistent with the hypothesis that corrugations are formed, at least partially by the tangential oscillation of the vehicle <b>tyre’s</b> <b>tread</b> surface. It is suggested that, to minimize the formation of dirt road corrugations, the design of tyres must take into account the tangential oscillation of the rubber <b>tyre’s</b> <b>tread</b> surface. If the tangential oscillation of the tyres’ tread surface can be effectively damped, their tendency to generate corrugations might be reduced...|$|R

First, a short bibliographical study determined the most relevant parameters that should be included in a global hydroplaning model such as the tyres ’ characteristics (pressure, contact area, and tread depth), the load, the water-depth, the road profile, and macrotexture. Among them, the water-depth is the most difficult to evaluate, because it deeply depends on the pavement irregularities (roughness and texture), the road geometry, and the weather (rain-fall intensity). Thus, a model calculating the water-film thickness by using road characteristics measurements is proposed. This initial water-depth is included in a linear model with 2 degrees of freedom, which describes the longitudinal dynamics phenomenon. The load transfer between the front and the rear axles is calculated in a straight line. Moreover, the water-depth in front of the rear tyre is calculated by considering the water displacement generated by the front tyres.

Since the introduction of “Green Tyres” in the early 90 ’s, the use of silica as a reinforcing filler, along with a silane coupling agent, has spread and grown worldwide. The greatest advantage of using silica over carbon black as a reinforcing filler in a tyre tread compound is that a lower rolling resistance is achieved, while maintaining good wet traction.

In this case, the micropearl is subjected to hydrodynamic stresses due to the shear of the elastomer matrix, the last method is based on the analysis of dispersion during the mixing operation of silica and the elastomer in an internal mixer coupling information from rheology, bound rubber and SEM to follow the dispersion.

40|$|Noise is {{a severe}} problem in modern society. Road traffic noise is a {{substantial}} contributor and the tyre/road interaction is the main noise source for normal driving conditions. Despite more than 30 years of research, {{there is a lack}} of quantitative tyre/road noise prediction models. The work presented in this thesis extends an existing model for tyre/road noise. Of special interest is the contact between the tyre and road that to a great extent determines the quality of the acoustic rolling model. A key point is the so called influence coefficients of the tyre tread, which describes how adjacent points in the contact interact. A tyre model based on the elastic field equations is proposed, which at the moment is the only tyre model for calculating influence functions at the tread. The tyre model predicts both radial and tangential impulse response functions including local deformation and hence, the influence coefficients. Furthermore, a contact model is presented, which uses the influence coefficients to calculate the contact forces. This model is in addition extended to take into account roughness variation over the tyre width. The proposed contact model results in a simpler model for the sound radiation, since no additional formulation of the local deformation is needed. Contact forces, tyre vibrations and sound radiation are compared to existing models. The results agree well with those of previous models for soft <b>tyre</b> <b>treads</b> and for rough roads.
