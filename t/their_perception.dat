5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{characterize}} college and university administrator perceptions of organizational culture, <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of themselves versus other campus subcultures, and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of themselves as members of their campus communities, through an analysis of their use of metaphors. Primary research objectives included the identification of administrator perceptions of the dominant campus culture, <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of related subcultures, <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of group self-consciousness, and the characterization of administrators as a legitimate collegiate subculture. This study employed a qualitative phenomenological design, utilizing metaphor analysis as the framework for individual interviews.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has identified many interventions for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Some of these interventions are evidence-based; others are not. However, previous {{research has}} also found that parents select interventions for their children with ASD {{on the basis of}} several factors other than the evidence base, including their emotional representations of ASD and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of the timeline, consequences, and causes of ASD. Other research has found that people’s cultural worldviews influence their decision-making on a variety of social and political issues. The current study examined the relationships between these factors and parents’ perceptions of the efficacy of evidence-based and non-evidence-based interventions. Contrary to previous research, for parents of children with ASD, perceptions of intervention efficacy were not affected by their emotional representations of ASD or <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of the timeline or consequences of ASD. There was a relationship between parents’ perceptions of the causes of ASD and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of the efficacy of some interventions. Parents’ cultural worldview was not related to <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of the efficacy of evidence-based interventions, but was related to <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of non-evidence-based interventions.

25|$|Infants {{begin the}} process of {{language}} acquisition by being able to detect very small differences between speech sounds. They can discriminate all possible speech contrasts (phonemes). Gradually, as they are exposed to their native language, <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> becomes language-specific, i.e. they learn how to ignore the differences within phonemic categories of the language (differences that may well be contrastive in other languages – for example, English distinguishes two voicing categories of plosives, whereas Thai has three categories; infants must learn which differences are distinctive in their native language uses, and which are not). As infants learn how to sort incoming speech sounds into categories, ignoring irrelevant differences and reinforcing the contrastive ones, <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> becomes categorical. Infants learn to contrast different vowel phonemes of their native language by approximately 6 months of age. The native consonantal contrasts are acquired by 11 or 12 months of age. Some researchers have proposed that infants may be able to learn the sound categories of their native language through passive listening, using a process called statistical learning. Others even claim that certain sound categories are innate, that is, they are genetically specified (see discussion about innate vs. acquired categorical distinctiveness).|$|E

25|$|In artistic contexts, in the {{performance}} of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to traditional guidelines is of greater importance than performer's preferences.

For example, when subjects judge the size of two figures in a perspective picture, their apparent sizes can be distorted by the 3D context, making a convincing optical illusion.

25|$|At least 25 {{vir genes}} on the Ti plasmid are {{necessary}} for tumor induction. In addition to <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> role, virA and chvE induce other vir genes. The virA protein has autokinase activity: it phosphorylates itself on a histidine residue. Then the virA protein phosphorylates the virG protein on its aspartate residue. The virG protein is a cytoplasmic protein produced from the virG Ti plasmid gene. It is a transcription factor, inducing the transcription of the vir operons. The chvE protein regulates the second mechanism of the vir genes' activation. It increases VirA protein sensitivity to phenolic compounds.|$|E
25|$|Superficial {{similarities}} between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes {{are thought to}} be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly curving W-shape. Although cuttlefish cannot see color, they can perceive the polarization of light, which enhances <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> of contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor cells on their retina (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and one to look more backward. The eye changes focus by shifting the position of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the lens as in mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, there is no blind spot, because the optic nerve is positioned behind the retina.|$|E
