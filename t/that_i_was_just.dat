[...] She begged Malibu neighbour Larry Hagman to check Moon into a clinic to dry out (as he had attempted to do before), but when doctors recorded Moon's chemical intake at breakfast – a bottle of champagne, Courvoisier and amphetamines – they concluded that there was no hope for his rehabilitation.|$|E
500|$|When you win a race {{like this}} {{the feeling is}} very, very good. There {{have been times when}} I have been {{flat-out}} to finish sixth, but you can't see that from the outside. In [...] I finished three or four times in seventh place. I pushed like mad, yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were thinking <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> trundling around. But that's motor racing. So in fact {{the only thing you can}} judge in this sport is the long term. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.|$|E
500|$|Eckhart {{has talked}} {{much about his}} beliefs, his way of life, and his future career ambitions. Talking to Entertainment Weekly {{regarding}} his Mormon faith, he revealed, [...] "I'm sure people think I'm a Mormon, but I don't know that I'm a Mormon anymore, you know? To be honest, to be perfectly clear, I'd be a hypocrite if I did say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>just</b> because I haven't lived that lifestyle for so many years." [...] In other interviews, {{he has said that}} hypnosis helped him to quit drinking, smoking, and partying, and that he undertakes amateur photography in his spare time. In an interview with Parade magazine, Eckhart revealed that before he discovered acting, he wanted to become a songwriter.|$|E

500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is set in common time and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. While it is played in the key of C major and has backing piano and guitar sounds, [...] "Alfie" [...] also uses a sample from Sandie Shaw's 1967 Eurovision Song Contest winning song [...] "Puppet on a String". In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I {{want him to do}} something with his life. I suppose his paranoia — induced by smoking so much weed — made him think, [...] "Why are you trying to be mean?" ...|$|E
500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. I realized that it was a real accident. I mean I thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|According to her suicide note, Alcorn {{had felt}} [...] "like a girl {{trapped in a}} boy's body" [...] since she was four, and came to {{identify}} as a transgender girl {{from the age of}} fourteen, when she became aware of the term. According to her note, she immediately informed her mother, who reacted [...] "extremely negatively" [...] by claiming that it was only a phase and that God had made her a male, so she could never be a woman. She stated that this made her hate herself, and that she developed a form of depression. Her mother sent her to Christian conversion therapists, but Alcorn later related that here she only encountered [...] "more Christians" [...] telling her that she was [...] "selfish and wrong" [...] and [...] "should look to God for help." [...] Aged sixteen, she requested that she be allowed to undergo transition treatment, but was denied permission: in her words, [...] "I felt hopeless, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> going to look like a man in drag {{for the rest of my}} life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep." ...|$|E

500|$|The album, {{released}} {{on the same}} day in both the UK and US, failed to chart in the UK, but peaked at number 10 in the US. It was released to quash any bootleg versions that Lennon was sure would leak onto the market. US editions of the album wrongly stated that the album was recorded in England. The album came with a 13-month calendar that had photos, poems and songs in it, from Lennon's In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, and Ono's Grapefruit books. In the US, Capitol was reluctant at first to issue the album, after the commercial failures of their Lennon's and Ono's experimental albums. Lennon recalled in an interview in December 1980 that he had to persuade Capitol to distribute the album: [...] "They said 'This is garbage, we're not going to put it out with her screaming on one side and you doing this sort of live stuff.' And they refused to put it out. But we finally persuaded them that... people might buy this." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lennon said that Capitol [...] "were on the [...] McCartney bandwagon, which they were on, and they thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> an idiot pissing about with a Japanese broad and the music we were making, like Toronto, they didn't want to put out, because they didn't like that." ...|$|E
500|$|By coincidence, Olympic team {{training}} {{took place}} in Tarwater's hometown of Knoxville. At the Olympics, Tarwater swam the third leg of the preliminary round of the men's 4×200-meter relay. His time of 1:46.33 was a personal best, and the second-fastest leg for Team USA, which turned in the fastest preliminary swim, and third-fastest among all 64 swimmers. He attributed his performance to concentrating exclusively on the freestyle during the two months between Trials and the Games. Of his Olympic experience, Tarwater said, [...] "Even at 28, {{with a lot of}} international experience, nothing matches the Olympics. [...] My heart was pumping so intensely <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> trying to calm myself down. [...] Standing on the blocks, waiting to take the exchange, I was just saying, 'Breathe. [...] Breathe. [...] Breathe.'... It's such a rush." [...] Typically, the relay team for the finals is composed of the top two qualifiers plus the two fastest swimmers in the preliminaries. In 2012, however, the U.S. team had its top three swimmers in reserve, as Phelps would swim the relay final despite dropping the individual 200-meter freestyle from his program. [...] After Tarwater's fast preliminary swim, the U.S. coaches strongly considered replacing number three Olympic Trials qualifier Ricky Berens with Tarwater in the finals, before electing to go with Berens due to Berens' greater experience. In the finals, the U.S. relay team beat the second-place French team by three seconds, winning Tarwater a gold medal.|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, Eastwood {{told the}} UK's Daily Mail that [...] "I loved {{the fact that}} Obama is multi-racial. I thought that was terrific, as my wife is the same racial make-up. But I felt he was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1926, {{while still}} in Charleston, Edson {{published}} his autobiography. He wanted to call it The Autobiography of an Ass and release it under his own name, but Brentano's, his publisher, overruled him on both counts. The book was published as The Great American Ass by Anonymous, {{with the idea that}} curiosity about the identity of the author would stimulate sales. In a 1928 letter to Robert Marks, a Charleston friend, Edson vented his frustration at how the book had been handled. [...] "It needs revision damn badly. For instance, Sam Ornitz edited the opening paragraph to say that “Wilber, Nebraska, is not to be found on any map, it is exotically discovered for you in the works of Willa Cather…” The facts are, Wilber is the county seat of Saline County, and I was actually born there, and Willa Cather actually lived there at the same time. Sam supposed, of course, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> romancing. And without investigating, he announced there was no such town as Wilber, Saline County, Nebraska. All the critics knew better...therefore they concluded I was a liar in denying the existence of the town, a fool in not knowing the town existed, and finally, a coward in writing anonymously—all of which was not my fault at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Returning to London in 1946, Lee {{was offered}} his old job back at Beecham's, with a {{significant}} raise, but he turned them down as [...] "I couldn't think myself back into the office frame of mind." [...] The Armed Forces were sending veterans with an education in the Classics to teach at universities, but Lee felt his Latin was too rusty and didn't care for the strict curfews. Having lunch with his cousin Nicolò Carandini, now the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Lee was detailing his war wounds when Carandini said, [...] "Why don't you become an actor, Christopher?" [...] Lee liked the idea and after assuaging his mother's protests by pointing to the successful Carandini performers in Australia, which included his great-grandmother Marie Carandini, {{who had been a}} successful opera singer, he met Nicolò's friend Filippo Del Giudice, a lawyer-turned-film producer. The head of Two Cities Films, part of the Rank Organisation, Giudice, [...] "looked me up and down... concluded <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> what the industry had been looking for".
