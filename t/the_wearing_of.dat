40|$|The {{hygrothermal effect}} on <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> {{behavior}} <b>of</b> composite material (fiberglass and polyester resin vf= 40 %) was investigated experimentally in this work. The study includes manufacturing of test device (pin on disc) according to ASTM G 99. In order {{to study the}} hygrothermal effect on <b>wear</b> behavior <b>of</b> composite materials the hygrothermal chamber was manufactured. The experimental results show that <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> glass fiber/polyester increased with increasing the load, sliding speed and sliding distance. The load and sliding distance were more effective on <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composite rather than sliding speed. Also, it has been revealed that, the hygrothermal is considerable effect that, <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> rate <b>of</b> glass fiber/polyester without hygrothermal effect is lower than wear with hygrothermal effect.

Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of this and it is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons were most likely to have been chiefs or chieftains.

40|$|Rubbers are {{interesting}} materials and are extensively {{used in many}} mining industries for material transportation. <b>Wear</b> <b>of</b> rubber {{is a very complex}} phenomenon to understand. The present study aims to explain the influence of rock properties on <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> M and SR grade rubber used in top cover of conveyor belts. Extensive laboratory experiments were conducted under four combinations of normal load and sliding speed. <b>The</b> <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> rubber types were analyzed based on the rock properties like shear strength, abrasivity index and fractal dimension. A fully instrumented testing set up was used to study <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> rubber samples under different operating conditions. In general, wear was higher for M grade rubber compared to SR grade rubber. Increase in shear strength of rocks depicts decreasing trend for <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> M and SR grade rubber at lower load conditions. Moreover, a higher load combination displays no definite trend in both the rubbers. The strong correlation between <b>the</b> <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> rubber and frictional power for all rubber-rock combinations has given rise to the parameter A, which reflects the relative compatibility between the rubber and rock. Increase of Cerchar’s Abrasivity Index of rocks shows gradual enhancement in wear for M grade rubber in all the load and speed combinations whereas, it fails in SR grade rubber due to its higher strength. <b>The</b> <b>wear</b> <b>of</b> rubber tends to decrease marginally with the surface roughness of rocks at highest normal load and sliding speed in M grade rubber.

5|$|In 1239 Henry {{introduced}} different policies, possibly {{trying to}} imitate those of Louis of France: Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned {{and forced to}} pay fines equivalent {{to a third of}} their goods, and any outstanding loans were to be released. Further huge demands for cash followed – £40,000 was demanded in 1244, for example, of which around two-thirds was collected within five years – destroying the ability of the Jewish community to lend money commercially. Henry had built the Domus Conversorum in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s. Anti-Jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice flourished in the 1250s and, in response, Henry passed the Statute of Jewry in 1253, which attempted to segregate Jews and enforce <b>the</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>of</b> Jewish badges; it remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry.|$|E

For this reason, <b>the</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>of</b> yellow by Henry and Anne {{may have been a}} symbol of mourning. With Mary's mother dead, Anne attempted to make peace with her.

5|$|The vicar from 1842 to 1892 was Thomas Chamberlain (later {{founder of}} St Edward's School), {{a firm believer}} in the Tractarian movement, who {{introduced}} daily services as well as such ritualist practices as altar candles and <b>the</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>of</b> Eucharistic vestments – the latter causing him to be rebuked by Bishop Wilberforce in 1855.

In 1847 Chamberlain founded the Community of St Thomas Martyr, which was devoted to the assistance of the poor of the parish, by now heavily slumland; this sisterhood remained active until 1958. The convent buildings for it were built in 1886, but have since been demolished.

5|$|The {{image of}} St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first {{appeared}} in the Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of William I. Following the death of King Alexander III in 1286 an image of Andrew was used on the seal of the Guardians of Scotland who assumed control of the kingdom during the subsequent interregnum. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late 14th century; the Parliament of Scotland decreeing in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on the front and back of their tunics. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century. Since 1606 the saltire has also formed part of the design of the Union Flag. There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the thistle, the nation's floral emblem (celebrated in the song, The Thistle o' Scotland), the Declaration of Arbroath, incorporating a statement of political independence made on 6 April 1320, the textile pattern tartan that often signifies a particular Scottish clan and the royal Lion Rampant flag.
