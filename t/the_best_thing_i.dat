Charles signed with Atlantic Records in 1954 where producers Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler encouraged him to broaden his repertoire. Wexler would later remember that Atlantic Records' success came not from the artists' experience, but the enthusiasm for the music: [...] "We didn't know shit about making records, but we were having fun". Ertegun and Wexler found that a hands-off approach was the best way of encouraging Charles. Wexler later said, [...] "I realized <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> could do with Ray was leave him alone".|$|E

Happy to have avoided heartbreak, Beyoncé continues to sing about her ex-lover, who did not recognize {{the possibility of a}} happy relationship with Beyoncé until the relationship broke down. Beyoncé no longer desires her lover after discovering his deceit; as shown in the pre-chorus and chorus lines, [...] "When I think of the time that I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you / Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged a bullet / I’m so over you, so baby good looking out / I wanted you bad / I’m so through with that / Because honestly / You turned out to be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> never had / And will always be the best thing you never had." ...|$|E

2500|$|His most {{controversial}} work, Portrait of Madame X (Madame Pierre Gautreau) (1884) {{is now considered}} {{one of his best}} works, and was the artist's personal favorite; he stated in 1915, [...] "I suppose it is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have done." [...] When unveiled in Paris at the 1884 Salon, it aroused such a negative reaction that it likely prompted Sargent's move to London. Sargent's self-confidence had led him to attempt a risque experiment in portraiture—but this time it unexpectedly back-fired. The painting was not commissioned by her and he pursued her for the opportunity, quite unlike most of his portrait work where clients sought him out. Sargent wrote to a mutual acquaintance: ...|$|E
