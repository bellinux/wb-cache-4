Within the dewar, each crystallization experiment is contained as a solution within a plastic capillary tube. The standard procedure for loading samples in these tubes has involved rapid freezing of the precipitant and biomolecular solution, e. g., protein, directly in liquid nitrogen; this method, however, often resulted in uncontrolled formation of air voids, These air pockets, or bubbles, can lead to irreproducible crystallization results. A novel protocol has been developed to prevent formation of bubbles, {{and this has been}} tested in the laboratory as well as aboard the International Space Station during a 42 -day long mission of July/August 2001. The gain or loss of mass from solutions within the plastic capillaries revealed that mass transport occurred among separated tubes, and that this mass transport was dependent upon the hygroscopic character of the solution contained in any given tube. The surface area of the plastic capillary tube also related to the observed mass transport. Furthermore, the decreased mass of solutions of-protein correlated to observed formation of protein crystals...|$|E

40|$|Background: A rule called " 30 -min rule" defines {{that red}} cell unit {{cannot be used}} if it {{has been out of}} blood bank {{refrigerator}} for over 30 min. This rule is useful to guide initiation of transfusion, but is inadequate for deciding whether to reuse or discard units received-back at blood transfusion services (BTS). A simple cost-effective temperature-sensitive indicator was evaluated to decide upon reuse (cold chain was uninterrupted) or discard (where cold chain was interrupted) in a simulation exercise. Materials and Methods: Temperature-sensitive indicators TH-F™ that irreversibly changed color from white to red demonstrated that heat excursion has occurred and the cumulative temperature has exceeded 10 °C for over 30 min, were used in outdated red cells for simulating units, which are not used and received-back. These units were also tagged with a standard <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>device,</b> which was a re-usable credit card sized device, which would log the actual time and temperature. In few units percent hemolysis was also calculated. Results: Statistically insignificant elevation in average temperature was noted in 102 simulated units at the time of return to BTS (Δ 0. 04 °C), despite the fact that these units were in the transport box for over 4 h. The average supernatant hemoglobin in these units was 0. 24 %, much below the prescribed threshold.

40|$|Polypropylene {{has proven}} to be the ideal {{material}} for the outer shell of the lead acid batteries. Due to its mold-ability and inert properties the material provides a capsule for the functioning components of the lead acid battery and can withstand a variety conditions encountered during its application, such as impact shock resistance, high and low temperatures and acid resistance. Polypropylene has however become of great concern with regards to environmental pollution since it is generally resistant to normal conditions of degradation and can only be properly disposed of by incineration. This factor has encouraged the industry to find ways to regenerate spent polypropylene. A good example of such a process is the recycling of lead acid batteries. This allows not only for the regeneration of lead, but also for the recycling of polypropylene in the manufacturing of battery cases. There are some cost advantages in using recycled polypropylene. However it does have its disadvantages in that the material does start to deteriorate after multiple processes. A common practice amongst battery manufacturers is to add virgin polypropylene to the recycled material in order to ensure performance consistency. The comparative study investigated the use of various ratios of virgin and recycled PP in the manufacturing of lead acid battery cases and their influence on the physical properties and performance of the final material. The degradation of PP was also investigated as the material was subjected to multiple manufacturing processes where the influence of stabilizers was further considered. A common technique of PP analysis such as MFI was shown to be an effective technique to maintain good quality control. The study further showed that {{it is important that the}} material grade of PP used in the manufacturing of the battery case and lid is compatible in order to allow for effective heating sealing of the two components. Polypropylene has a waxy surface finish and it is generally difficult to label or write on. Labels tend to fall off in application and make it difficult to maintain a track record of the manufactured batteries with time. This study showed successfully that a laser activated dye can be added to the PP without influencing its color or its performance. This allows for successful labeling of battery cases by various bar coding writers that can trace the battery through its manufacturing process. Lead acid batteries are often operated outside the specified temperature range that is determined by battery manufacturers resulting in premature failure. These failures can occur within the warranty period of the battery and result in illicit claims since the monitoring of the batteries in its application was not possible. A suitable <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>device</b> was designed that would be incorporated into the vent cap or lid of the battery case. The device contained temperature sensitive indicators that would undergo a permanent color change at specified temperatures thereby giving the battery manufacturer an indication as to the maximum temperature the battery was exposed to...|$|E
40|$|Frequency domain spectrometers use {{intensity}} modulated {{light to}} quantitatively interrogate turbid media. The modulation frequencies employed {{are in the}} radiofrequency range. Intensity modulated light launched into a turbid medium generates photon density fluctuations with wave like character that oscillates at the modulation frequency. These density fluctuations are named diffuse photon density waves, {{and it has been}} shown that the amplitude and phase of the photon density wave inside the medium depends on its optical properties. Hence by measuring the amplitude and phase of the photon density wave the optical properties of the medium can be estimated. This is the basic working principle of a frequency domain photon migration spectrometer. Frequency domain spectrometers fabricated with laser diodes are limited to discrete wavelengths thereby making compromises on the information about the media under test. In this research a wavelength tuneable frequency domain spectrometer was constructed by modulating the output intensity of a titanium: sapphire laser using an acousto-optic modulator. A low noise avalanche photodiode module in conjunction with a lock-in amplifier was used to measure the amplitude attenuation and phase lag inside a turbid sample. The frequency domain spectrometer was tested for accuracy and precision by estimating the optical properties of an important tissue simulation phantom, Intralipid, at a representative wavelength 790 nm. The results indicated that the spectrometer estimates absorption with an accuracy of 10 %. The instrument estimates the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients with a precision of 3 % and 6 %, respectively. Optical properties of Intralipid were measured from 710 - 850 nm in the therapeutic window. The results were compared with published data measured by other methods and similar frequency domain techniques. The absorption coefficient agrees within 10 % with results from a time domain measurement. The reduced scattering coefficient was within the error limits of other reported measurements. At 750 nm the reduced scattering agrees within 5 % with the results from a continuous wave, time domain and within 1 % from another frequency domain measurement, and at 811 and 849 nm this agreement is within 9 %. A Mie theory prediction of the reduced scattering coefficient based on a measurement of the particle size distribution by a Mastersizer 2000 is larger than the frequency domain results by 6 %. The spectrometer was used to determine the optical temperature coefficient of Intralipid, exploring its potential as a non invasive <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>device.</b> The measured minute change in the absorption coefficient suggests a minimum observable temperature change of 4 'C, which for most practical applications means that the precision needs to improve. The effect of glucose on the optical properties of Intralipid indicates that the absorption coefficient decreases steadily at 730 nm up to 1000 mg/dL. The reduced scattering coefficient decreases with increasing glucose concentration at most of the wavelengths. This work quantified the absorption and reduced scattering of Intralipid over a larger wavelength range (in the therapeutic window) than before. This is the first time the effects of temperature on the optical properties of a turbid medium monitored with a frequency domain spectrometer. Specific information about the precision and accuracy which can be achieved with the current technology is documented. Current precision is not sufficient for many applications that would benefit from separation of absorption and scattering...|$|E

We found that the impact of weather conditions is different depending on the location of the body where the temperature measurement is taken from, as measurements of the face of animals were much more impacted by air temperature compared to measures of the trunk.

Also, in addition to <b>monitoring</b> global <b>temperature,</b> these microwave radiometers {{have the potential to}} reveal interannual climate signals in tropics. We have analyzed the data of MSU Ch 2 and AMSU Ch 5 (53. 6 GHz) from the NOAA operational satellites for the period 1980 to 2000, utilizing the NOAA calibration procedure. The data are corrected for the satellite orbital drift based on the temporal changes of the on-board warm blackbody temperature. From our analysis, we find that the global temperature increased at a rate of 0. 13 +/- 0. 05 Kdecade(sup - 1) during 1980 to 2000. From an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of the MSU global data, we find that the mid-tropospheric temperature in middle and high latitudes responds to the ENSO forcing during the Northern Hemisphere Winter in a distinct manner. This mid-latitude response is opposite in phase to that in the tropics. This result is in accord with simulations performed with an ECMWF global spectral model.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{formerly}} depleted {{domestic oil}} fields have become producers once again through tertiary oil recovery. In tertiary oil recovery, water and Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) are alternatively injected into reservoirs through injection wells. This raises the field pressure and forces oil to producing wells {{where it is}} then pumped to a storage tank {{referred to as a}} battery. This paper is focused on an operating division in the Permian Basin (USA). The CO 2 is acquired from underground domes in Colorado and then transferred through pipelines to oil fields in West Texas and New Mexico. The compressors are used to move CO 2 and boost the gas to the required field pressure, usually around 2, 200 [*]psig. Reciprocating compressors are flexible and able to handle wide capacity and condition swings, offer an efficient method of compressing almost any gas composition {{in a wide range of}} pressures and have numerous applications and wide power ratings. This makes them a vital component in various industrial facilities. Condition monitoring of critical rotating machinery is widely accepted by operators of centrifugal compressors.

Yet, there is concern in the South African fruit industry that too much fruit and money is lost each year due to breaks along the fresh fruit export cold chain. Objective: The objective {{of this article was}} to identify the influence of logistics activities on breaks along the South African fruit export cold chain. The focus is specifically on temperature sensitive fruit, exported in refrigerated containers to Europe and the United Kingdom through the Port of Cape Town.

40|$|Abstract Despite {{the large}} amount of {{research}} work in condition based maintenance and condition monitoring methods, there is still a need for more reliable and accurate methods. The clear evidence of that need is the continued dependence on time based maintenance, especially for critical applications such as turbomachinery and airplane engines. The lack of accurate condition monitoring systems could lead to not only the unexpected failures as well as the resulting hazards and repair costs, but also a huge waste of material and time because of unnecessary replacement due to false alarms and unnecessary repair and maintenance. Temperature change is a phenomenon that accompanies every dynamic activity in the universe. However, it has not been adequately exploited for mechanical system condition monitoring. The reason is the slow response of current <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems compared to other condition monitoring methods such as vibration analysis. Many references inferred that the change in temperature is not sensible until approaching the end of the monitored component life and even the whole system life (Kurfess, et al., 2006; Randall, 2011; Patrick, et al., March 7 - 14, 2009). On the other hand, the most commonly used condition monitoring method, i. e., vibration analysis, is not free from pitfalls. Although vibration analysis has shown success in detecting some bearing faults, for other faults like lubrication problems and gradual wear it is much less effective. Also, it does not give a reliable indication of fault severity for many types of bearing faults. The advancement of thermography as a <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> tool encourages the reconsideration of <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> for mechanical system fault detection. In addition to the improved accuracy and responsiveness, it has the advantage of non-contact monitoring which eliminates the need for complex sensor mounting and wiring especially for rotating components. Therefore, in current studies the thermography-based monitoring method is often used either as a distinct method or as a complementary tool to vibration analysis in an integrated condition monitoring system. The main objectives of this study are hence to: 1. 	Define heat sources in the rolling element bearings and overview two of the most famous bearing temperature calculation methods. 2. 	Setup a bearing test rig that is equipped with both vibration and <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems. 3. 	Develop a temperature calculation analytical model for rolling element bearing that include both friction calculation and heat transfer models. The friction calculated by the model will be compared to that calculated using the pre-defined empirical methods. The heat transfer model is used for bearing temperature calculation that will be compared to the experimental measurement using different <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices.</b> 4. 	Propose a new in-band signal enhancement technique, based on the synchronous averaging technique, Autonomous Time Synchronous Averaging (ATSA) that does not need an angular position measuring device. The proposed method, in addition to the Spectral Kurtosis based band selection, will be used to enhance the bearing envelope analysis. 5. 	Propose a new method for classification of the bearing faults based on the fault severity and the strength of impulsiveness in vibration signals. It will be used for planning different types of tests using both temperature and vibration methods. 6.

The technique is supported by the results of finite element modeling and is used for bearing <b>temperature</b> condition <b>monitoring</b> when the bearing is already running at thermal equilibrium condition...|$|R

Regardless of the attractive features of the active sensors, they still suffer from some weaknesses. Especially, their utilization appears to be significantly limited in term of power consumption. In fact, energy is usually a non renewable resource and batteries limit the sensor lifetime, therefore the reduction of energy consumption has opened up new challenges for researchers. For these reasons, passive sensors have received a considerable attention and present a promising solution. Thereby, new trends are {{moving in the direction}} of self powered and wireless sensing system. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a passive wireless sensor for <b>temperature</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The sensor <b>device</b> is based on the electromagnetic transduction principle and its originality resides in the integration of a high temperature sensitive material into passive structure. Subsequently, the sensing device shows a linear response to increasing temperature. Electromagnetic simulation results demonstrated that the sensor performs quite well and the sensing device exhibits interesting behavior at millimeter-wave frequencies...|$|R
