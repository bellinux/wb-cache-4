500|$|Karthi {{was born}} on 25 May 1977 in Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu, India. He had his {{schooling}} at Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan and St. Bede's Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School, Chennai. He gained a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Crescent Engineering College, Chennai. After graduation, he worked as an Engineering consultant in Chennai and considered higher studies abroad. [...] "I was earning about [...] 5000, per month and found the work monotonous. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought, I should do something more", he recalled in an interview. Karthi got a scholarship for his higher studies in the United States, and enrolled at Binghamton University, New York, where he earned his Master of Science in Industrial Engineering. While pursuing his masters, he also attended lectures on filmmaking.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Bono stated [...] "When things aren't {{going right}} and I'm feeling like we're not communicating, I go through terrible things on stage." [...] He likened his {{emotions}} on those occasions to [...] "a big blackness", {{and found that}} performing the song helped him to purge them from his mind on some occasions. Several scenes in the 1988 film Rattle and Hum depict Bono with his arm in a sling, {{a result of his}} falling and dislocating his shoulder during a performance of [...] "Exit" [...] on 20 September 1987 in Washington. The concert was being filmed for the movie, and the Edge stated that [...] "the show was not going well". Bono fell while running across the stage [...] "in an attempt to try [...] get something going". Recalling the incident, Bono said [...] " [...] had taken me to some ugly place... but it was rage that caused it. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> realized rage is an expensive thing for your general well-being." [...] On another occasion he said [...] "I just want to take a bath after we do that. I just want to wash it off my skin." [...] Graham wrote that [...] "performances of 'Exit' would grow ever more fraught and purgative." ...|$|E
500|$|In a May 7, 1918 {{letter from}} Tobolsk {{to her sister}} Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia {{described}} a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: [...] "We played on the swing, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about {{it so many times}} yesterday that they got quite fed up, but I could go on telling it masses of times... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy." [...] In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as [...] "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was [...] "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." [...] Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess [...] "offensive and a terrorist" [...] and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.|$|E
2500|$|Shyamalan {{originally}} {{offered the}} roles of Aang to Noah Ringer; Sokka to Jackson Rathbone; [...] to Nicola Peltz; and Zuko to Jesse McCartney. In an interview with People, Shyamalan claimed {{that he did not}} want to make The Last Airbender without Nicola Peltz, [...] "I said that only once before in my career, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> met Haley in The Sixth Sense auditions." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Lori was {{six years}} old, her mother took her to an agent who {{specialized}} in child actors. She thought that acting might be a healthy outlet for Lori. When later asked what inspired her to be an actress, Martin said, [...] "The best {{time in my life}} was when I was about four. Doree and I had to go live with my aunt in Ponca City, Oklahoma. My mother got sick and Daddy had to go to work every day, so we couldn't stay here. I didn't want to come back. I cried and cried. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> decided, if I had to come back, I'd be an actress. I started getting parts immediately and my little brother was signed by the same agent, but he lacked my interest in acting. I just loved it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The work {{of record}} {{producer}} Phil Spector, who popularized the Wall of Sound, was a focal obsession for Wilson. In the 1960s, Wilson thought of Spector as [...] "the single most influential producer. He's timeless. He makes a milestone whenever {{he goes into}} the studio." [...] Brian later reflected: [...] "I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song." [...] He explains: [...] "Before Spector, people recorded all the instruments separately. They got great piano, great guitar, and great bass. But he thought of the song as one giant instrument. It was huge. Size was so important to him, how big everything sounded. And he had the best drums I ever heard." [...] In 1999, when asked if he was a religious man, Wilson responded: [...] "I believe in Phil Spector." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{return in}} 1947 was lower, but in 1948, with the Somerset batting seeming ever more {{dependent}} on him for runs, he responded {{with all of the}} four centuries scored by the team in the summer, {{and one of them was}} his own highest score and the highest innings made to that stage by a Somerset batsman: 310 against Sussex at Eastbourne. The previous Somerset record had been 292, set by the late Victorian era amateur Lionel Palairet. Gimblett told his biographer David Foot, on the tapes that form the backbone of the biography, that he had said on the pitch at Eastbourne to Sussex player James Langridge: [...] "Well, that's got rid of one amateur's name in our county's record books." [...] Gimblett went on to say that a collection had been proposed to mark the feat, but that Somerset's secretary had been dismissive of the idea. [...] "I think <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first decided that my career with Somerset was going to end. I was deeply hurt," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Celia {{seemed to}} understand, {{for the next}} thing she said, in a very cheerful tone, was, [...] "See what a pretty sight <b>that</b> <b>is.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little girl I used to think spiders spun cloth for the fairies, and spread it on the grass to bleach." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When we {{did talk}} about {{questions}} I had, he essentially challenged me and my arguments," [...] Khalid writes.

He provided me with material that argued against the legality of terrorism." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first knew <b>that</b> I {{cared for}} you. But {{it seems to}} me that I must have always cared for you, and that I only found it out <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw you going by the house that day."

[...] Wilson's work is sometimes characterized as avant-garde pop. Critic Michael Hann cites an [...] "extraordinary rush of avant-pop creativity between 1965 and 1967". In the belief of writer Richard Goldstein: [...] " [...] never realized his full potential as a composer. In the light of electronica and minimalism, you can see how advanced his ideas were, but they remain bursts of inspiration from a mind that couldn't mobilize itself into a whole. This was the major tragedy of rock in the sixties." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Navarro's {{departure}} {{in early}} 1998, Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were on the}} verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I could imagine carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him as the two still had unresolved personal problems from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In April 1998, when Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] Flea decided to contact Anthony and have him meet with John to try and resolve any personal problems that the two might have had. Flea was relieved to find out that both had no bad blood towards each other and were once again excited to make music together. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "For me, that was the defining moment of what would become the next six years of our lives together. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> knew that this was the real deal, that the magic was about to happen again. Suddenly we could all hear, we could all listen, and instead of being caught up in our finite little balls of bullshit, we could all become players in that great universal orchestra again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; but I like it best <b>when</b> it <b>is</b> awake, <b>when</b> {{it blows}} a hurricane-- it is magnificent. The whole cliff shakes with {{the shock of}} the waves, and {{sometimes}} the spray drives over in sheets. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> like to sit here; it exhilarates me, and makes me feel as though I belonged to the storm, and was strong with its strength. Come, let us go in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes I {{have kept}} them awake all day myself," [...] replied the Queen; [...] "but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> lonely and need amusement.

But I must {{have a talk with}} my new Prince and Princess this evening, so I could devote but little time to my people, and only awakened them to satisfy your curiosity." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sun Ce told Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, when Liu Yao criticised me {{for helping}} Yuan Shu conquer Lujiang, he didn't have good {{intentions}} and his reasons were not convincing. Why? Yuan Shu had {{control over the}} thousands of troops {{which used to be}} under my father's command. I wanted to make great achievements, so I {{had no choice but to}} submit to Yuan Shu and ask him to give me control of my father's troops. Even then, he only gave me back about 1,000 men. When he ordered me to attack Lujiang, the circumstances I was in were so desperate that I had no choice but to obey him. Later on, he turned evil and wanted to commit treacherous acts. I tried to dissuade him but he wouldn't listen. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> decided to sever ties with him. My relationship with Yuan Shu is only up to this extent. Now that Liu Yao is dead, there is no chance for me to explain to him anymore. However, his son still lives in Yuzhang. I don't know how Hua Ziyu treats him, and whether Liu Yao's former followers have decided to serve Hua Ziyu. You are from the same commandery as Liu Yao, and you served under him before. I hope you can visit his son and convey my wishes to his followers. If they wish to join me, I will welcome them; if they don't, do treat them kindly. At the same time, you can assess how strong Hua Ziyu's defences are, and see if the peoples of Luling and Poyang are willing to join me. You can bring along as many men as you wish." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "I have committed unpardonable acts. Yet, you treat me as generously as how Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin treated former enemies who surrendered to them. The ancients lived by a code of loyalty until death. I don't need too many men to accompany me. Just a dozen or so will be sufficient." ...|$|E

50|$|Shortly afterwards, {{my mother}} {{suggested}} I visit Italy. I stayed for three years, {{learned to speak}} better Italian and studied fresco painting at the Academia di Belle Arte in Florence. I learned the old master techniques using dried pigments with rabbit skin glue. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{fell in love with}} the early fresco artists: Giotto, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca and Michelangelo. Those <b>are</b> the people <b>that</b> still nourish me through their art.|$|R

2500|$|... "In {{spite of}} everything, {{it was a}} very fertile period for me. During the first weeks, I had a dream almost every night, some of which {{anticipated}} my future work.
