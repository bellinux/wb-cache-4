5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to}} as countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the side-slip, away from <b>the</b> <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E
