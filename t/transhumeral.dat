He also headed the amputee clinic at the Liberty Mutual Insurance (now Liberty Mutual Group), Hopkinton, Massachusetts, and found that individuals with transradial amputations were using prostheses to recoup much more of their lost functioning than were individuals with <b>transhumeral</b> amputations. His frustration with existing devices for <b>transhumeral</b> amputees led him to put together a group of institutions to develop a myoelectric elbow.

50|$|Transradial (below {{the elbow}} amputation) and transtibial {{prostheses}} (below the knee amputation) typically cost between US $6,000 and $8,000, while transfemoral (above the knee amputation) and <b>transhumeral</b> prosthetics (above the elbow amputation) cost approximately {{twice as much}} {{with a range of}} $10,000 to $15,000 and can sometimes reach costs of $35,000. The cost of an artificial limb often recurs, while a limb typically needs to be replaced every 3-4 years due to wear and tear of everyday use. In addition, if the socket has fit issues, the socket must be replaced within several months from the onset of pain. If height is an issue, components such as pylons can be changed.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, {{there have}} been advancements in {{artificial}} limbs. New plastics and other materials, such as carbon fiber, have allowed artificial limbs to be stronger and lighter, limiting the amount of extra energy necessary to operate the limb. This {{is especially important for}} trans-femoral amputees. Additional materials have allowed artificial limbs to look much more realistic, which is important to trans-radial and <b>transhumeral</b> amputees because {{they are more likely to}} have the artificial limb exposed.In addition to new materials, the use of electronics has become very common in artificial limbs. Myoelectric limbs, which control the limbs by converting muscle movements to electrical signals, have become much more common than cable operated limbs. Myoelectric signals are picked up by electrodes, the signal gets integrated and once it exceeds a certain threshold, the prosthetic limb control signal is triggered which is why inherently, all myoelectric controls lag. Conversely, cable control is immediate and physical, and through that offers a certain degree of direct force feedback that myoelectric control does not. Computers are also used extensively in the manufacturing of limbs. Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing are often used to assist in the design and manufacture of artificial limbs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—C 5 /C 6 tetraplegic {{patients}} and <b>transhumeral</b> amputees {{may be able}} to use voluntary shoulder motion as command signals for a functional electrical stimulation system or <b>transhumeral</b> prosthesis. Stereotyped relationships, termed “postural synergies, ” among the shoulder, forearm, and wrist joints emerge during goal-oriented reaching and transport movements as performed by able-bodied subjects. Thus, the posture of the shoulder can potentially be used to infer the desired posture of the elbow and forearm joints during reaching and transporting movements. We investigated how well able-bodied subjects could learn to use a noninvasive command scheme based on inferences from these postural synergies to control a simulated <b>transhumeral</b> prosthesis in a virtual reality task. We compared the performance of subjects using the inferential command scheme (ICS) with subjects operating the simulated prosthesis in virtual reality according to complete motion tracking of their actual arm and hand movements. Initially, subjects performed poorly with the ICS but improved rapidly with modest amounts of practice, eventually achieving performance only slightly less than subjects using complete motion tracking. Thus, inferring the desired movement of distal joints from voluntary shoulder movements appears to be an intuitive and noninvasive approach for obtaining command signals for prostheses to restore reaching and grasping functions.

40|$|International audienceDecoding {{finger and}} hand {{movements}} from sEMG electrodes {{placed on the}} forearm of transradial amputees has been commonly studied by many research groups. A few {{recent studies have shown}} an interesting phenomenon: simple correlations between distal phantom finger, hand and wrist voluntary movements and muscle activity in the residual upper arm in <b>transhumeral</b> amputees, i. e., of muscle groups that, prior to amputation, had no physical effect on the concerned hand and wrist joints. In this study, we are going further into the exploration of this phenomenon by setting up an evaluation study of phantom finger, hand, wrist and elbow (if present) movement classification based on the analysis of surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals measured by multiple electrodes placed on the residual upper arm of five <b>transhumeral</b> amputees with a controllable phantom limb who did not undergo any reinnervation surgery. We showed that with a state-of-the-art classification architecture, it is possible to correctly classify phantom limb activity (up to 14 movements) with a rather important average success (over 80 % if considering basic sets of six hand, wrist and elbow movements) and to use this pattern recognition output to give online control of a device (here a graphical interface) to these <b>transhumeral</b> amputees. Beyond changing the way the phantom limb condition is apprehended by both patients and clinicians, such results could pave the road towards a new control approach for <b>transhumeral</b> amputated patients with a voluntary controllable phantom limb.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in successful upper limb prostheses is the socket design. Sockets must be individually fabricated to arrive at a geometry that suits the user's morphology and appropriately distributes the pressures associated with prosthetic use across the residual limb. In higher levels of amputation, such as <b>transhumeral,</b> this challenge is amplified as prosthetic weight and the physical demands placed on the residual limb are heightened. Yet, in the upper limb, socket fabrication is largely driven by heuristic practices. An analytical understanding of the interactions between the socket and residual limb is absent in literature. This work describes techniques, adapted from lower limb prosthetic research, to empirically characterize the pressure distribution occurring between the residual limb and well-fit <b>transhumeral</b> prosthetic sockets. A case series analyzing the result of four participants with <b>transhumeral</b> amputation is presented. A Tekscan VersaTek pressure measurement system and FaroArm Edge coordinate measurement machine were employed to capture socket-residual limb interface pressures and geometrically register these values to the anatomy of participants. Participants performed two static poses with their prosthesis under two separate loading conditions. Surface pressure maps were constructed from the data, highlighting pressure distribution patterns, anatomical locations bearing maximum pressure, and the relative pressure magnitudes. Pressure distribution patterns demonstrated unique characteristics across the four participants that could be traced to individual socket design considerations. This work presents a technique that implements commercially available tools to quantitatively characterize upper limb socket-residual limb interactions.

Inverse dynamic analysis was applied to calculate the axial force, bending and torsional moments at three virtual amputation levels representing 25, 50, and 75 % residual humeral length. The influences of amputation level, elbow flexion constraint, gender and anthropometric scaling were assessed. Results indicate that the proximal (25 %) amputation level experienced significantly higher axial forces and bending moments across all subjects when compared to distal amputation levels (p≤ 0. 030). Constraining elbow flexion had a limited influence on peak <b>transhumeral</b> loads. Male subjects experienced higher axial forces during all evaluated activities (p≤ 0. 023). Peak axial force for all activities occurred during jumping jacks (174. 5 N). Peak bending (57. 6 Nm) and torsional (57. 2 Nm) moments occurred during jumping jacks and rapid internal humeral rotation, respectively.

40|$|Background: The osseointegration {{programme}} for {{upper extremity}} amputation started in Sweden in 1990, when a titanium fixture was first implanted into a thumb. This method {{has since been}} used for <b>transhumeral</b> and below-elbow amputation. The treatment involves two surgical procedures. During the first a titanium fixture is surgically attached to the skeleton, and a second procedure six months later involves a skin penetrating abutment to which the prosthesis is attached. Objectives: To describe the osseointegration procedure for surgery, prosthetics and rehabilitation. Methods: Patients with short stumps and previous problems with prosthetic fitting were selected. From 1990 to April 2010, 37 upper limb cases were treated and fitted with prosthesis: 10 thumbs, 1 partial hand, 10 transradial and 16 <b>transhumeral</b> amputations. Of these, 7 patients are currently not prosthetic users. Results: Patients indicated that function {{and quality of life}} had improved since osseointegration. Conclusion: Osseointegration is an important platform for present and future prosthetic technology. The prosthetic situation is improved due to the stable fixation, freedom of motion and functionality. Clinical relevance The two-stage osseointegration procedure has the potential to change the rehabilitation strategy for selected upper limb amputees. The method eliminates the need for a socket and the prosthesis will always fit. The stable prosthetic fixation and increased freedom of motion generates improved function.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{interface}} between the prosthetic socket and residual limb (S-RL) interface {{is an important factor in}} determining acceptance and outcomes of upper limb prostheses. [1] Among the most common complaint from amputees is that the prosthesis is uncomfortable due to developing skin irritation which is usually attributed to poor fit (Nielson 1990). In order to understand why skin irritations can and do occur it is imperative to examine the biomechanical properties of the S-RL interface. A primary reason behind the development of skin irritation is instability of the socket upon the residuum. Alley (2009) asserts that excess slip, axial rotation, and translation are the facets of instability that cause skin irritations due to friction and shear. Measuring the motion at the S-RL interface is not commonly done and therefore there is still no valid and reliable method to quantify the motion clinically.

Furthermore, it is difficult for small residual stumps to provide sufficient impact absorption for safe manipulation in daily living, as intact arms do. Therefore, substitution of upper limb function in <b>transhumeral</b> amputees requires a sufficient range of motion and sufficient viscoelasticity for shoulder prostheses under critical weight and dimension constraints. We propose the use of two different types of actuators, ie, pneumatic elastic actuators (PEAs) and servo motors. PEAs offer high power-to-weight performance and have intrinsic viscoelasticity in comparison with motors or standard industrial pneumatic cylinder actuators. However, the usefulness of PEAs in large working spaces is limited because of their short strokes. Servo motors, in contrast, can be used to achieve large ranges of motion. In this study, the relationship between the force and stroke of PEAs was investigated. The impact absorption of both types of actuators was measured using a single degree-of-freedom prototype to evaluate actuator compliance for safety purposes. Based on the fundamental properties of the actuators identified, a four degree-of-freedom robotic arm is proposed for prosthetic use. The configuration of the actuators and functional parts was designed to achieve a specified range of motion and torque calculated from the results of a simulation of typical movements performed in usual activities of daily living. Our experimental results showed that the requirements for the shoulder prostheses could be satisfied.

The management we propose includes the following steps: preventive catheterization of the descending aorta via <b>transhumeral</b> access; Stark cesarean delivery; uterotonics drugs; Affronti endouterine square hemostatic sutures; intrauterine application of Bakri balloon and partial filling with 100 [*]mL of normal saline; B Lynch suture, hysterorrhaphy, and filling a Bakri balloon with up to 500 [*]mL of normal saline; reversible radiological embolization; and/or surgical ligation of the uterine arteries. The bleeding stopped following placement of Affronti sutures combined with external (B-Lynch suture) and internal (Bakri balloon) uterine compression. Our experience indicates that this conservative method can be considered an option in the management of selected cases of pregnancy at high risk for intrapartum hemorrhage...|$|E
