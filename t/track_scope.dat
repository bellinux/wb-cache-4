40|$|The {{primary goal}} of <b>tracking</b> <b>scope,</b> cost, and time {{throughout}} the construction process is to facilitate the early detection of problem activities that are running over budget or falling behind scheduled progress. Current practice tracks this information using separate processes, which leads to inconsistencies between the information and inaccuracies when determining the cost and schedule status. Project managers need an integrated suite of project management tools so that the project's scope, cost, and time are in sync and the work in place is accurately reflected in the project control system. In this paper, we will provide a case study that demonstrates the practical needs of project managers to support integration throughout {{the life of a}} project. We will also demonstrate how those needs are not being addressed by existing software tools, by standards developed for the project management domain, and by information models that have been developed in research. This paper will show that the following issues must be addressed to enable the integration throughout the construction process: the information must be integrated at the start of construction; the mapping scheme between the different hierarchical representations of scope, cost, and time must be defined; and the shared information must be defined...|$|R

40|$|Online social post streams such as Twitter {{timelines}} and forum discussions {{have emerged}} as important channels for information dissemination. They are noisy, informal, and surge quickly. Real life events, which may happen and evolve every minute, are perceived and circulated in post streams by social users. Intuitively, an event {{can be viewed as}} a dense cluster of posts with a life cycle sharing the same descriptive words. There are many previous works on event detection from social streams. However, there has been surprisingly little work on tracking the evolution patterns of events, e. g., birth/death, growth/decay, merge/split, which we address in this paper. To define a <b>tracking</b> <b>scope,</b> we use a sliding time window, where old posts disappear and new posts appear at each moment. Following that, we model a social post stream as an evolving network, where each social post is a node, and edges between posts are constructed when the post similarity is above a threshold. We propose a framework which summarizes the information in the stream within the current time window as a ``sketch graph'' composed of ``core'' posts. We develop incremental update algorithms to handle highly dynamic social streams and track event evolution patterns in real time. Moreover, we visualize events as word clouds to aid human perception. Our evaluation on a real data set consisting of 5. 2 million posts demonstrates that our method can effectively track event dynamics in the whole life cycle from very large volumes of social streams on the fly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Oblique-viewing {{endoscopes}} (oblique scopes) {{are widely}} used in minimally invasive surgery. The viewing direction of an oblique endoscope can be changed by rotating the scope cylinder, which enables a larger field of view, but makes the scope calibration process more difficult. The calibration is a critical step for incorporating oblique scope into computer assisted surgical procedures (robotics, navigation, augmented reality), though few calibration methods of oblique endoscopes has been developed. Yamaguchi et al. [1] first modelled and calibrated the oblique <b>scope.</b> They directly <b>tracked</b> the camera head and formulated the scope cylinder’s rotation to the camera model as an extrinsic parameter. Their method requires five additional parameters to be estimated. In this work, we <b>track</b> the <b>scope</b> cylinder instead. Since {{the rotation of the}} camera head with respect to the cylinder only causes the rotation of the image plane, less parameter needs to be estimated.

Humans live in organized societies that {{are characterized by}} {{a high level of}} interdependence of group members in various aspects of life, ranging from the economic phenomenon of labour division to providing emotional support to others. Under these circumstances, the capacity to track social connections within and between groups has great adaptive value in managing everyday life. We may understand the importance and adaptive value of <b>tracking</b> the <b>scope</b> of culturally shared knowledge if we consider the importance of cultural norms in guiding behaviour. To become a competent member of their cultural group one must be able to conform to the group's specific behavioural norms and to accumulate culturally shared knowledge. Acquiring this knowledge is essential for successful social interactions. In contrast to current dominant explanatory theories emphasizing that social category formation is simply rooted in humans’ need to belong and affiliate with a group, the aim of this e-book is to provide evidence that, in addition to its affiliative role, children form social categories for epistemic purposes. We show that children use specific cues, like kinship, patterns of resource allocation and consensus to understand group cohesion (Section 1). Once children figured out who is in-group and who is out-group, they show a significant in-group bias in attention, acting and learning (Section 2). Yet, this in-group bias can be attenuated by induced synchronous behavior (Section 3) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Construction Management Program (CMP) {{curriculum}} {{content is}} typically derived from institutional and program mission, historical evolution, accreditation criteria, and student, faculty, and industrial advisory inputs. Accreditation bodies assure that {{critical thinking and}} communication skills are delivered and/or content is delivered in broad topical areas. Accreditation emphasis is upon Program Educational Objectives (PEO) and their measurement. This paper challenges that practice. What are the PEOs based upon? How does a CMP ensure that critical and basic industrial competencies are delivered to students? How does a program track and control the teaching and delivery of these competencies amidst ever changing institutional requirements and individual course changes? This paper proposes that {{the answer lies in}} developing sets of competencies from industrial workflow processes which can then map a course or program’s objectives and outcomes. With critical and analytical thinking underlying the entirety of the educational objectives, this system can be modularized for allocating competencies across the curriculum (courses). The premise of the paper’s proposed model is as follows: Define and validate the work-flow processes of the industry segment, group these defined processes into modules for organizational and classification purposes, define the competencies required to accomplish the modules (industrial processes), develop course and program objectives based upon the competencies, then measure outcomes.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that track support stiffness {{is a major}} factor controlling rates of track geometry deterioration, particularly where the track support stiffness changes abruptly. There is, therefore, considerable potential benefit in being able to quantify and detect changes in the track support stiffness. In recent years, trackside techniques using various types of transducer have been developed to determine track deflections as trains pass. However, deducing the track support stiffness from these measurements requires assumptions to be made concerning train loading and <b>track</b> behaviour, and <b>scope</b> for different interpretations remains. For example, loads from moving trains vary dynamically and it is not usually feasible to measure their exact values at any given point along the track. This paper presents new methods of analysis, which can be applied to frequency spectra of track displacement, velocity or acceleration generated as trains pass to calculate the track support stiffness for trains of known axle intervals, without needing to know the actual loads applied. The approach is demonstrated with reference to theory and measured data from a range of field sites. </span...|$|R

We present the necessary tools to <b>track</b> an oblique <b>scope</b> and a camera model which includes changes to the intrinsic camera parameters thereby extending previously proposed methods.

Using 5 sets of 40 calibration images, we compare both camera models (i. e. model and approximation) and 2 interpolation schemes.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{navigation}} tracks of the Research Vessel Polarstern and it provides a software application for statistical analysis of these <b>tracks.</b> The <b>scope</b> of this program follows two requirements. Firstly the program provides an assessment functionality for post processing of old tracks of R/V Polarstern to include all these tracks in long term storage and archiving system of AWI, the PANGAEA network. Secondly, it provides an online assessment tool to analyze the navigation information onboard the vessel in real time. The software application has been developed using Borland C++ Builder 6 environment under Windows 7 operating system. The numeric functions of this application are following ANSI standard of C++ programming language, and thus it could be implemented in any developing environments using this standard. A full description of the navigation systems onboard the R/V Polarstern has been reviewed to investigate how the possible connections and relations between different sensors act, {{to understand how the}} cruise track is produced and to find appropriate analysis methods. In particular, a statistical method is introduced for analyzing the navigational data of the vessel from different sources onboard. This method consists of several tests for detecting and identifying the outliers in the data. It follows a decision based filter that keeps the original data if it successfully passes the outlier tests. In addition, the filter replaces the outliers with appropriate solutions that are calculated using different routines such as transformation from different devices as well as interpolation and extrapolation procedures. This method provokes smoothing of the original data as well. As results of the online and the offline mode, the final product is a file, called “Master track”, which consists of seven columns. These columns are: the date and time of the records with one second interval, the evaluated position of the vessel given in geographical coordinates, the heading of the ship, the roll and pitch and finally a quality number that indicates the precision of the position. In addition a generalized version of the Master track is provided applying Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm. At the end of this work some results are presented to show the improvements that have been achieved using the application. A sample Master track and the corresponding generalized track were finally published in PANGAEA. ...|$|R

The Translational Research and Patient Safety in Europe (TRANSFoRm) project seeks to facilitate research using linked data from more than one source. We performed a requirements analysis which identified a wide range of data and business process requirements that need to be met before linking primary care and either genetic or disease registry data. Objectives To develop a survey to assess the readiness of data repositories to participate in linked research – the Transform International Research Readiness (TIRRE) survey. Method We develop the questionnaire based on our requirement analysis; with questions at micro-, meso- and macro levels of granularity, study-specific questions about diabetes and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), and research <b>track</b> record. The <b>scope</b> of the data required was extensive. We piloted this instrument, conducting ten preliminary telephone interviews to evaluate the response to the questionnaire.

40|$|This {{document}} {{is available to}} the public through the National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA 22161 This {{document is}} disseminated under the sponsorship of the Department of Transportation in the interest of information exchange. The United Storm Movement Prediction (SMP) is a proposed (future) product for Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR), aiding controllers by tracking storm systems approaching and passing through the terminal environment. Because the scan strategy (data acquisition) of TDWR has been critically designed {{to meet the needs of}} its primary function, which is the detection of hazardous low-altitude wind shear, there is the question of whether reliable storm tracking can be obtained from the TDWR data set. The objectives of storm <b>tracking</b> involve a <b>scope</b> (spatial range) much larger than that required for the wind-shear algorithms where detailed volume coverage is confined (in off-airport sited radars) to a sector covering the important approach and departure corridors and the only 360 degree scans are near-surface scans for gust-front detection. This report examines the application of a correlation based method for detecting storm motion, testing the notion that reliable storm motion can be inferred from existing TDWR data. In particular, storm motion derived from an analysis of the TDWR Precipitation product (PCP) is studied. A summary description of the algorithm is presented along with an analysis of its performance using data from MIT Lincoln Laboratory's TDWR testbed operations in Denver (1988) and Kansas City (1989). The primary focus of the present analysis is on the reliability of tracking, since the algorithm is expected to operate in an autonomous environment. Some attention is given to the idea of prediction, in the form of storm extrapolation, considering 15, 30, and 60 minute predictions. Specific areas for improvement are identified, and application of the algorithm track vectors for long-term prediction (30 - 60 minutes) is discussed with reference to example PCP images...|$|R
