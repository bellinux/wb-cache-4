5|$|According to polls {{conducted}} by mainstream media, most Japanese people had perceived {{the flag of}} Japan as the national flag even before {{the passage of the}} Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem in 1999. Despite this, controversies surrounding the use of the flag in school events or media still remain. For example, liberal newspapers such as Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun often feature articles critical of the flag of Japan, reflecting their readerships' political spectrum. To other Japanese, the flag represents the <b>time</b> <b>where</b> democracy was suppressed when Japan was an empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{rectangular}} west {{tower was}} a relatively short defensive structure, {{designed to protect the}} more vulnerable western slope of the ridge. A similar tower in the south overlooks the entrance to the castle. At {{the north end of the}} castle is the hall, stretching across the courtyard; in the east corner is an additional building, probably built by the English at the end of the 13th century. Although the hall is relatively large, 50 by 27feet (15 by 8m), these buildings follow a simpler design to those current in England at the <b>time,</b> <b>where</b> a combination of a hall, chamber and a service block in castles was becoming more common.|$|E
5|$|Although {{her mother}} was a {{grandchild}} of King George III, May was only a minor member of the British Royal Family. Her father, the Duke of Teck, had no inheritance or wealth and carried the lower royal style of Serene Highness because his parents' marriage was morganatic. However, the Duchess of Teck was granted a parliamentary annuity of £5,000 and received about £4,000 a year from her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge. Despite this, the family was deeply in debt and lived abroad from 1883, in order to economise. The Tecks travelled throughout Europe, visiting their various relations. They stayed in Florence, Italy, for a <b>time,</b> <b>where</b> May enjoyed visiting the art galleries, churches, and museums.|$|E
5|$|Ashford {{has been}} {{associated}} with the German town Bad Münstereifel since the 20th century. British forces occupied the town in 1919 under the command of Major J Goode, following the end of the war. Goode subsequently formed close friendships with some Bad Münstereifel residents. John Wiles, Major Goode's brother in law, later became mayor of New Romney in 1946, and subsequently arranged a visit to the Rhineland with Winston Churchill. Wiles arranged several other exchange visits between British and German families, at a <b>time</b> <b>where</b> travel between the two countries was rare. He was declared an honorary citizen of Bad Münstereifel in 1961, which led to the two towns being formally twinned in 1964. Bad Münstereifel was twinned with the French town of Fougères, Brittany two years later, which led to a twinning with Ashford in 1984.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a <b>time</b> <b>where</b> it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, and the person who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.|$|E
