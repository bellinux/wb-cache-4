Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that <b>these</b> <b>conclusions</b> overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.|$|E

Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage: for example, how to use them to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. <b>These</b> <b>conclusions</b> often are crucial steps in a proof.|$|E

5|$|The {{antiquarian}} William Lambarde, for example, published what {{he believed}} were the Anglo-Saxon and Norman law codes, tracing {{the origins of the}} 16th-century English Parliament back to this period, albeit misinterpreting the dates of many documents concerned. Francis Bacon argued that clause 39 of Magna Carta was the basis of the 16th-century jury system and judicial processes. Antiquarians Robert Beale, James Morice, and Richard Cosin argued that Magna Carta was a statement of liberty and a fundamental, supreme law empowering English government.

5|$|The reforms {{implemented}} by Djedkare are generally assessed negatively in modern Egyptology as his policy of decentralization created a virtual feudal system that transferred much {{power to the}} high and provincial administrations. Some Egyptologists such as Naguib Kanawati argue that this contributed heavily {{to the collapse of}} the Egyptian state during the First Intermediate Period, c. 200 years later. <b>These</b> <b>conclusions</b> are rejected by Nigel Strudwick, who says that in spite of Djedkare's reforms, Ancient Egyptian officials never amassed enough power to rival that of the king.|$|E
5|$|This {{narrative}} {{has been}} disputed by the historian Steven Newton, who dedicated {{a section of}} his 2002 publication about Operation Citadel to refuting it. Using first-hand accounts of German officers that executed Operation Citadel and scrutinizing Glantz and House's sources, Newton contended that the plan for the 4th Panzer Army to swing from the Oboyan direction to Prokhorovka was decided as early as May 1943, well before Operation Citadel even commenced, as German planners of Army Group South had always expected an encounter between the 4th Panzer Army and Soviet reserves that would arrive at the Psel River and Prokhorovka. Other historians have corroborated <b>these</b> <b>conclusions.</b> Newton also asserts that {{this has always been}} the accepted narrative in post-war literature.|$|E

5|$|Schizophrenia is a {{major cause}} of disability, with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. <b>These</b> <b>conclusions,</b> however, have been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia's {{other main}} {{economic}} arm, farming, performed less strongly during the war, {{partly because the}} Chartered Company prioritised the strategically important mines {{at the behest of}} British officials. Southern Rhodesian farmers were optimistic at the outbreak of war, surmising that the Empire would become desperate for food and that they would be essentially immune to inflation because they grew their own crops. While <b>these</b> <b>conclusions</b> were on the whole accurate, logistical complications made it difficult for Rhodesian food to be exported, and as in mining there was often a shortage of labour. There were a number of drives to increase agricultural yield with the hope of feeding more people in Britain, but because Southern Rhodesia was so far away it was difficult for the colony to make much of an impact. One of the main culinary contributions the territory made to the British wartime marketplace was Rhodesian butter, which first reached England in February 1917.|$|E

5|$|Submarine escape {{training}} led US Navy {{personnel to}} believe that Haldane's allowable supersaturation ratios for fast tissues were unnecessarily conservative, as calculated values indicated that supersaturation in trainees exceeded Haldane's limits, {{but they did not}} develop DCS. A large number (2143) of experimental dives were conducted over 3 years to derive allowable supersaturation ratios for a Haldanian 5 compartment model with compartment half-times of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Values for critical supersaturation derived from this experimental work were different for each tissue compartment. Values for slow tissues (75 and 40-minute) were close to Haldane's findings, but considerably higher values were found for the fast tissues. These values were so high that the researchers concluded that the 5- and 10-minute tissues were not relevant to the development of DCS. Based on <b>these</b> <b>conclusions,</b> a set of tables was computed which omitted the 5- and 10-minute tissues.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force's 1997 {{rejection}} of re-engining was subsequently disputed in a Defense Science Board (DSB) report in 2003.

Criticizing the Air Force cost analysis, the DSB found that among other things, the Air Force failed to account for the cost of aerial refueling; the DSB estimated that refueling in the air cost $17.50 per gallon, whereas the Air Force had failed to account for the cost of fuel delivery and so had only priced fuel at $1.20 per gallon.|$|E
5|$|The Compsognathus {{specimen}} {{discovered in}} Germany in the 19th century featured only two digits on each forelimb, leading scientists {{to conclude that}} this was how the creature appeared in life. However, the fossil discovered later in France revealed the manus (hands) to have had three digits, similar to other members of compsognathid genera. The fossilization of the German Compsognathus had simply failed to preserve the specimen's hands completely. Bidar supposed that the French specimen had webbed hands, which would look like flippers in life. In the 1975 book The Evolution and Ecology of the Dinosaurs, L. B. Halstead depicts the animal as an amphibious dinosaur capable of feeding on aquatic prey and swimming {{out of reach of}} larger predators. Ostrom debunked this hypothesis by showing conclusively that the French specimen was nearly identical to the German specimen in every aspect but its size. Peyer confirmed <b>these</b> <b>conclusions.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} of the {{vertical}} muon energy spectrum simulations has been suggested. These calculations {{have been carried}} out in terms of various models of hadronic interactions. The most energetic π±-mesons and K±-mesons produced in hadron interactions contribute mainly to this energy spectrum of muons due to the very steep energy spectrum of the primary particles. So, some constraints on the hadronic interaction models may be set from a comparison of calculated results with cosmic data on the vertical muon energy spectrum. This comparison showed that the most energetic secondary particles production is too high {{in the case of the}} QGSJET II- 04 model and rather low in the case of the QGSJET II- 03 model. <b>These</b> <b>conclusion</b> have been supported by the LHC data...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} exchange rates and import prices on the domestic producer price index and consumer price index in selected industrialized economies. The empirical model is a vector autoregression incorporating a distribution chain of pricing. When the model is estimated over the post-Bretton Woods era, impulse responses indicate that exchange rates have a modest effect on domestic price inflation while import prices have a stronger effect. Pass-through is larger in countries with a larger import share and more persistent exchange rates and import prices. Over 1996 - 98, these external factors have had a sizable disinflationary effect {{in many of the}} countries, but not in the United States.
