Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock braking system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E
5|$|Andres {{originated}} from a disturbance that slowly organized and formed into Tropical Depression One-E on June 1. The next day, it reached tropical storm {{status as a}} second circulation formed north-northwest of the initial circulation. However, the former circulation became dominant, and Andres intensified slightly. After {{a brief period of}} a normal track to the northwest, Andres was picked up by westerly winds and became the first named storm to threaten Central America. Initially forecast to cross the isthmus and enter the Caribbean Sea, Andres instead turned to the southeast and paralleled the coast. This was the first time since record-keeping began that any East Pacific storm had taken such a path. Andres <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> to the northeast. It weakened to a depression and made landfall near San Salvador on June 7 and dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Mediterranean, the decoy {{operation}} MG 3 had begun when convoy MW12 with three freighters had sailed from Port Said after dusk on 10 August. The merchant ships were escorted by two cruisers, ten destroyers and two smaller escorts and another merchant ship escorted by two cruisers and three destroyers left Haifa at 03:00 the next day. The two forces rendezvoused early on 11 August and sailed {{west to the}} longitude of Alexandria, <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back.</b> U-83 had reported that four cruisers and ten destroyers were close to Crete and a message from a Sunderland was intercepted. Reconnaissance reports from Malta noted a smokescreen over Valletta, apparently to conceal two cruisers but this was later taken to mean that the British were hiding the departure of ships heading west towards the convoy. The large size of the convoy was interpreted by Supermarina to imply an operation in the eastern Mediterranean and prepared to reinforce the 8th Cruiser Division at Navarino.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} action began, Persano {{decided to leave}} Re d'Italia and {{transfer}} to Affondatore, though none of his subordinates on the other ships {{were aware of the}} change. They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping Re d'Italia, he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships {{and the rest of the}} fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, though he failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass. The Austrians <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. The Austrian ships concentrated their fire on Re d'Italia, paying particular attention to her stern. In their attempts to ram her, one of the Austrian ships destroyed Re d'Italias rudder, leaving her unmaneuverable.|$|E
25|$|The {{most memorable}} Parisian civic event {{during the period}} was the funeral of Victor Hugo in 1885.

Maurice found his progress towards Tienen opposed by Francisco López de Mendoza, who was strongly entrenched - he refused to be tempted out while Maurice refused to engage or pass while leaving a large force in his rear.

Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain saw the {{division}} flag {{moving to the}} left and followed Griffin with his brigade and a regiment of Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory's brigade. By the time Warren returned to White Oak Road, Ayres's division had captured the return. Since no attack was now needed at the return (refused end) of the Confederate line, Warren sent Major Cope to tell Griffin to push westward toward the Ford's Road. Griffin turned his men to the right and headed west parallel to White Oak Road. Warren <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> toward the return to look again for Crawford's division.|$|E
25|$|After {{pulling out}} of an {{uncontrolled}} spin and with the fire amazingly going out on its own, Johnson headed for the English Channel, but was intercepted by a single Fw 190. Unable to fight back, he maneuvered while under a series of attacks, and although sustaining further heavy damage from hundreds of 7.92mm rounds, managed to survive until the German ran out of ammunition. The German rocked his wings to salute Johnson, <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back.</b> His opponent was likely the commander of III/JG 2, Oberst Egon Mayer. After landing, Johnson tried to count the bullet holes in his airplane, but gave up after the tally passed 200 - without even moving around the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|At this point, {{hundreds}} of people fled the mall after hearing the gunshots, but many remained inside and dashed to cover. Roberts headed further toward the food court, firing at 16-year-old employee Alina Pavlenko, who was over 100 feet away, but missed. He also dropped three other magazines in his possession. He <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> and headed toward a JCPenney store. He attempted to reload the AR-15 at that point, {{but was unable to}} do so, the weapon having apparently jammed. During that time, Nick Meli, a concealed carry permit holder, drew his Glock 22, claimed to have taken aim at Roberts, but did not fire since there was a bystander behind Roberts. Meli claims that Roberts saw him and that this may have contributed to Roberts' decision to commit suicide.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle is}} seen by modern historians as a decisive victory in the war, {{although}} contemporary accounts were less clear on this issue, and some tried to {{stress the importance of}} the Siege of Smolensk, commanded by the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa, and downplay Żółkiewski's victory. Regardless, following the battle, Żółkiewski <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> towards the Russians at Tsaryovo-Zaymishche, commanded by Valuyev, who after learning about the defeat of their relief force at Kluszyno decided to surrender. Soon after the battle, Tsar Vasili IV was ousted by the boyars and Żółkiewski entered Moscow with little opposition. Boyars then proclaimed the Polish prince of the Commonwealth Władysław IV Waza as the new Tsar of Russia. He claimed the Tsar's title from 1610 to 1634 but never assumed the throne, as his father and Commonwealth king, Zygmunt III Waza, failed to negotiate a lasting agreement with the boyars; the Polish garrison in Moscow was soon besieged and would surrender a year later.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} these developments, Shiloni decided that he could only {{advanced}} the cannons to the vicinity of Be'erot Yitzhak. He and Ya'uri took a jeep to reconnoiter for a suitable firing location. They were forced to continue on foot after being attacked by Egyptian aircraft. Shiloni found a location need kibbutz Sa'ad and also estimated that the Egyptians would be concentrated about 150m west of Be'erot Yitzhak. At about 17:30, the Israeli cannons began shelling Egypt's armor concentration. One of the first shells scored a direct hit on the armor {{in the north of}} the village, and another missed its target, but accidentally hit the path of incoming Egyptian reinforcements, which <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back.</b> The shelling, which continued almost uninterrupted (it stopped only when Egypt's aircraft fired at the artillery), triggered a general retreat. The last Egyptian forces to retreat were the infantry, who were hit by Israeli fire from Be'erot Yitzhak.|$|E

25|$|In 1629, the Ottomans, having secured {{peace with}} the Habsburgs, mustered their forces for another {{offensive}} under the new and capable Grand Vizier Gazi Hüsrev Pasha. A severe winter and heavy floods made operations in central Iraq impossible, and Hüsrev turned his army east instead, invading Persia proper. On 4 May 1630 he routed the Persians under Zainal Khan Begdeli Shamlu in battle at Mahidasht near Kermanshah and proceeded to sack the city of Hamadan. Hüsrev Pasha <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> towards Baghdad and besieged it in November. However the siege had to be lifted soon, as the onset of another heavy winter threatened his lines of communication. In {{the wake of his}} withdrawal, the Persians re-established their control of Iraq, and subdued the rebellious Kurdish populations. The next few years saw constant raiding and skirmishes, without either side claiming any decisive advantage. Shah Safi (r. 1629–42) sent a peace delegation to the Ottoman court, but the new Grand Vizier, Tabanıyassi Mehmed Pasha, rejected its demands. The Caucasian front of the Persians flared up again in 1633, when the restless Georgian kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti, under the rule of King Teimuraz, defied Safavid sovereignty. In 1634, Rustam Khan, a Georgian convert to Islam, was sent by the Shah to subdue them. Teimuraz was defeated, but managed to escape to safety in Imereti. He would nevertheless manage to restore himself on the throne of Kakheti in 1638, and even win Persian recognition of this fact.|$|E
