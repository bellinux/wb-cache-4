50|$|Standard prostanoids {{have the}} {{following}} relative efficacies as receptor ligands in binding to and activating IP: PGI2>>PGD2=PGE2=PGF2α>TXA2. In typical binding studies, PGI2 has one-half of its maximal binding capacity and cell-stimulating actions at ~1 nanomolar {{whereas the other}} prostaglandins are >50-fold to 100-fold weaker than this. However, PGI2 is very unstable, spontaneously converting to a far less active derivative 6-keto-PGF1 alpha within 1 minute of its formation. This instability makes defining the exact affinity of PGI2 for IP difficult. It also makes it important to have stable synthetic analogs of PGI2 for clinical usage. The most potent of these receptor agonists for binding to and activating IP are iloprost, <b>taprostene,</b> and esuberaprost which have Kd values (i.e. concentrations which bind to half of available IP receptors) in the low nanamole/liter range (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=345/).|$|E
40|$|This study investigates whether {{incomplete}} {{relaxation of}} vascular smooth muscle preparations {{induced by the}} prostacyclin analogue <b>taprostene</b> is due to partial agonism at prostanoid IP receptors. In {{the presence of the}} prostanoid EP 4 receptor antagonist AH 23848, 3 microM <b>taprostene</b> induced 45 % relaxation of phenylephrine-contracted guinea-pig saphenous vein rings and displaced log concentration-response curves for the prostacyclin analogues AFP- 07, TEI- 9063, and cicaprost to the right, parallel to their predicted addition curves. In contrast, <b>taprostene</b> interacted additively with prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), ONO-AE 1 - 259 (selective EP 2 agonist), and acetylcholine. Similarly, on rat tail artery contracted with phenylephrine, 3 microM <b>taprostene</b> (20 % relaxation) opposed AFP- 07 - but not PGE 2 -induced relaxation. However, under U- 46619 -induced tone (AH 23848 absent), <b>taprostene</b> antagonized AFP- 07 and cicaprost more than TEI- 9063, suggesting that the latter has more than one relaxation mechanism. The presence of a sensitive EP 3 contractile system in mouse aorta interfered with IP receptor-mediated relaxation. By generating tone with phenylephrine and the potent EP 3 agonist sulprostone, it was possible to show that 3 microM <b>taprostene</b> (15 % relaxation) selectively opposed relaxations induced by AFP- 07, TEI- 9063, and cicaprost. Our experiments indicate that <b>taprostene</b> is a partial agonist at prostanoid IP receptors, and may be a lead to an IP receptor antagonist...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} low dose human {{superoxide}} dismutase and low dose <b>taprostene,</b> a stable analogue of prostacyclin, were investigated separately and {{together in a}} model of myocardial ischemia (1. 5 h) with reperfusion (4. 5 h) in open chest, anesthetized cats. <b>Taprostene</b> (60 ng/kg per min), human superoxide dismutase (0. 25 mg/kg per h), both agents together, or their vehicle, were infused intravenously in cats starting 0. 5 h after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Neither low dose <b>taprostene</b> nor low dose human superoxide dismutase exerted any endothelial or myocardial protection in this model. However, the two agents together showed a significant endothelial and myocardial protection in cats with myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Compared with cats that were untreated or received only <b>taprostene</b> or human superoxide dismutase, cats receiving both agents exhibited a lower plasma creatine kinase activity at every time point observed after reperfusion, a reduced area of cardiac necrosis (7 ± 2 % vs. 21 ± 5 % area at risk, p < 0. 001), lower mycloperoxidase activity in the ischemic region (p < 0. 01) and a significant preservation of vasorelaxant responses of left anterior descending coronary rings to endothelium-dependent vasodilators, acetylcholine (p < 0. 001) and A- 23187 (p < 0. 001). <b>Taprostene</b> appears to act additively with human superoxide dismutase to inhibit neutrophil adherence and activation and to inactivate superoxide radicals, and thus reduce cellular injury 4. 5 h after reperfusion of the ischemic heart. Use of this agent may allow low doses of superoxide dismutase to be used more effectively in early myocardial ischemia...|$|E
40|$|Herein {{we provide}} {{evidence}} for the coexpression of two distinct prostacyclin (PGI 2) receptors (IP) on BEAS- 2 B human airway epithelial cells. IP receptor heterogeneity initially was sug-gested by {{the finding that the}} rank orders of potency of PGI 2 and three structurally similar analogs [taprostene, iloprost, 15 -deoxy- 16 -(m-tolyl) - 17, 18, 19, 20 -tetranorisocarbacyclin (15 -de-oxy-TIC) ] for the inhibition of chemokine (CXCL 9 and CXCL 10) release and for transcriptional activation/augmentation of cAMP response element and glucocorticoid response element luciferase reporters were distinct. Indeed, PGI 2, <b>taprostene,</b> and iloprost activated both reporters whereas 15 -deoxy-TIC was inert. Conversely, 15 -deoxy-TIC, PGI 2, and <b>taprostene</b> (but not iloprost) suppressed chemokine release. Further experi-ments established that iloprost did not antagonize the inhibitor...|$|E
40|$|Our {{study shows}} that the {{prostacyclin}} analogues AFP- 07 and cicaprost are moderately potent agonists for prostanoid EP 4 receptors, {{in addition to being}} highly potent IP 1 receptor agonists. Both activities were demonstrated on piglet and rabbit saphenous veins, which are established EP 4 preparations. On piglet saphenous vein, PGE 2 was 6. 1, 24, 96, 138, 168 and 285 times respectively more potent than AFP- 07, cicaprost, PGI 2, iloprost, carbacyclin and TEI- 9063 in causing relaxation. Another prostacyclin analogue <b>taprostene</b> did not induce maximum relaxation (21 – 74 %), and did not oppose the action of PGE 2. The EP 4 receptor antagonist AH 23848 (30 μm) blocked relaxant responses to PGE 2 (dose ratio= 8. 6 ± 1. 3, s. e. mean) {{to a greater extent than}} cicaprost (4. 9 ± 0. 7) and AFP- 07 (3. 8 ± 0. 8), had variable effects on TEI- 9063 -induced relaxation (3. 7 ± 1. 5), and had no effect on <b>taprostene</b> responses (< 2. 0). On rabbit saphenous vein, AH 23848 blocked the relaxant actions of PGE 2, AFP- 07, cicaprost, iloprost and carbacyclin to similar extents. AFP- 07, cicaprost and TEI- 9063 showed high IP 1 relaxant potency on piglet carotid artery, rabbit mesenteric artery and guinea-pig aorta, with AFP- 07 confirmed as the most potent IP 1 agonist reported to date. AH 23848 did not block cicaprost-induced relaxation of piglet carotid artery. EP 3 contractile systems in these preparations can confound IP 1 agonist potency estimations. Caution is urged when using AFP- 07 and cicaprost to characterize IP 1 receptors in the presence of EP 4 receptors. <b>Taprostene</b> may be a lead to a highly selective IP 1 receptor agonist...|$|E
40|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{activity of the}} rat isolated colon is suppressed by prostacyclin analogues such as cicaprost (IC 50 = 4. 0 [*]nM). Activation of prostanoid IP 1 -receptors located on NANC inhibitory neurones is involved. However, several non-prostanoids, which show medium to high IP 1 agonist potency on platelet and vascular preparations, exhibit very weak inhibitory activity on the colon. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate this discrepancy. Firstly, we have demonstrated the very high depolarizing potency of cicaprost on the rat isolated vagus nerve (EC 50 = 0. 23 [*]nM). Iloprost, <b>taprostene</b> and carbacyclin were 7. 9, 66, and 81 fold less potent than cicaprost, indicating the presence of IP 1 as opposed to IP 2 -receptors. Three non-prostanoid prostacyclin mimetics, BMY 45778, BMY 42393 and ONO- 1301, although much less potent than cicaprost (195, 990 and 1660 fold respectively), behaved as full agonists on the vagus nerve. On re-investigating the rat colon, we found that BMY 45778 (0. 1 – 3 [*]μM), BMY 42393 (3 [*]μM) and ONO- 1301 (3 [*]μM) behaved as specific IP 1 partial agonists, but their actions required 30 – 60 [*]min to reach steady-state and only slowly reversed on washing. This profile contrasted sharply with the rapid and readily reversible contractions elicited by a related non-prostanoid ONO-AP- 324, which is an EP 3 -receptor agonist. The full versus partial agonism of the non-prostanoid prostacyclin mimetics may be explained by the markedly different IP 1 agonist sensitivities of the two rat neuronal preparations. However, the slow kinetics of the non-prostanoids on the NANC system of the colon remain unexplained, and must be taken into account when characterizing neuronal IP-receptors...|$|E
40|$|In the {{guinea-pig}} isolated {{vas deferens}} preparation bathed in Tyrode's solution, the prostacyclin analogues, cicaprost, TEI- 9063, iloprost, <b>taprostene</b> and benzodioxane-prostacyclin, enhanced twitch responses to submaximal electrical field stimulation (20 %-EFS). The high potency of cicaprost (EC 150 = 1. 3 [*]nM) {{and the relative}} potencies of the analogues (equi-effective molar ratios= 1. 0, 0. 85, 1. 6, 17 and 82, respectively) suggest the involvement of a prostacyclin (IP-) receptor. Maximum enhancement induced by cicaprost in 2. 5 [*]mM K+ Krebs-Henseleit solution {{was similar to that}} in Tyrode solution (2. 7 [*]mM K+), but was progressively reduced as the K+ concentration was increased to 3. 9, 5. 9 and 11. 9 [*]mM. There was also a greater tendency for the other prostacyclin analogues to inhibit EFS responses in 5. 9 [*]mM standard K+ Krebs-Henseleit solution; this may be attributed to their agonist actions on presynaptic EP 3 -receptors resulting in inhibition of transmitter release. The EFS enhancing action of cicaprost was not affected by the α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (100 and 1000 [*]nM). Cicaprost (20 and 200 [*]nM) did not affect contractile responses of the vas deferens to either ATP (5 [*]μM) or α,β-methylene ATP (1 [*]μM) in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 100 [*]nM). In addition, enhancement by cicaprost of responses to higher concentrations of ATP (30 and 300 [*]μM) in the absence of TTX, as shown previously by others, was not seen. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2, 10 [*]nM) and another prostacyclin analogue TEI- 3356 (20 [*]nM) enhanced purinoceptor agonist responses. Unexpectedly, TTX (0. 1 and 1 [*]μM) partially inhibited contractions elicited by 10 – 1000 [*]μM ATP; contractions elicited by 1 – 3 [*]μM ATP were unaffected. Further studies are required to establish whether a pre- or post-synaptic mechanism is involved. In a separate series of experiments, cicaprost (5 – 250 [*]nM), TEI- 9063 (3 – 300 [*]nM), 4 -aminopyridine (10 – 100 [*]μM) and tetraethylammonium (100 – 1000 [*]μM) enhanced both 20 %-EFS responses and the accompanying overflow of noradrenaline to a similar extent. In further experiments with the EP 1 -receptor antagonist AH 6809, TEI- 3356 (1. 0 – 100 [*]nM) and the EP 3 -receptor agonist, sulprostone (0. 1 – 1. 0 [*]nM) inhibited both maximal EFS responses and noradrenaline overflow, thus confirming previous reports of the high activity of TEI- 3356 at the EP 3 -receptor. Cicaprost had no significant effect on noradrenaline overflow at 10 and 100 [*]nM, but produced a modest inhibition at 640 [*]nM. In conclusion, our studies show that prostacyclin analogues (particularly TEI- 3356) can inhibit EFS responses of the guinea-pig vas deferens by acting as agonists at presynaptic EP 3 -receptors. Prostacyclin analogues (particularly cicaprost and TEI- 9063) can also enhance EFS responses through activation of IP-receptors. The mechanism of the enhancement has not been rigorously established but from our results we favour a presynaptic action to increase transmitter release...|$|E
