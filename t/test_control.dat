5000|$|TTCN is a {{programming}} language used for testing of communication protocols and web services. A TTCN test suite consists of many test cases written in the TTCN {{programming language}}.Until version 2 the language was written in tables and called Tree and Tabular Combined Notation.

The second step is to derive a positivity threshold from the difference in between-plate distribution functions of the transformed <b>test</b> and <b>control</b> SFU counts.

50|$|Orchestra Control Engine is {{flexible}} {{because it can}} be customized. This is done visually. The solutions created are open (based on an open source framework) and are extendible. Modular components of the software allow a user to develop, debug and <b>test</b> <b>control</b> applications. For example, previously developed algorithms can be divided into functional units and reused indefinitely. All the units work together. The software can be distributed among various remote hardware devices which may be hundreds of meters apart. It also scalable in that it selects hardware which provides the best cost and performance for a particular operation. The system's parameters can be quickly reconfigured both on line and also at the time of a run.|$|E
5000|$|Testing and <b>Test</b> <b>Control</b> Notation (TTCN), both TTCN-2 and TTCN-3, follows actor model rather closely. In TTCN, Actor {{is a test}} component: either {{parallel}} test component (PTC) or {{main test}} component (MTC). Test components can send and receive messages to and from remote partners (peer test components or test system interface), the latter being identified by its address. Each test component has a behaviour tree bound to it; test components run in parallel and can be dynamically created by parent test components. Built-in language constructs allow the definition of {{actions to be taken}} when an expected message is received from the internal message queue, like sending a message to another peer entity or creating new test components.|$|E

Flight trials revealed a marked sensitivity to turbulence resulting in flutter, and during trials at stalling speed, the SZD-20X entered a spin, which the rudders were unable to recover the aircraft from, only when the pilot shifted his weight as far forward as he could, did the SZD-20X recover from the spin. Flying in the SZD-20X continued until 6 October 1959, when turbulence-induced flutter tore the aircraft apart, the pilot escaping with parachute.|$|E

A second flight was made the next day, with the intention of making a flight to London, but shortly after slipping the mast a strip of fabric became detached from the lower fin, and the flight was limited to a cruise around Bedfordshire to <b>test</b> <b>control</b> response, lasting 6hr 29 min.

50|$|The 6555th's Titan-Gemini Division lasted {{considerably}} {{longer than}} its SLV-II Division. The division exercised technical <b>test</b> <b>control</b> over the Titan II GLV launch vehicle, but the Martin Company launched the booster. Martin launched the first unmanned Gemini-Titan GLV mission from Complex 19 on 8 April 1964, {{and the flight}} succeeded in placing an unmanned 7,000-pound Gemini 1 capsule into low earth orbit on that date. The first manned Gemini mission (Gemini 3) was launched from Complex 19 on 23 March 1965, and it met all of its test objectives. (Astronauts Virgil I. Grissom and John W. Young were recovered with their capsule in the primary recovery area after three orbits on March 23d.) Nine more pairs of astronauts were boosted into orbit aboard Gemini-Titan GLV launch vehicles in 1965 and 1966, and seven Atlas-Agena target vehicles were launched from Complex 14 in support of six Project Gemini missions. Following the last highly successful Gemini-Titan GLV flight in November 1966, the Gemini Launch Vehicle Division completed its mission and began transferring personnel to other Air Force bases or to other agencies under the 6555th Aerospace Test Wing. As overall manager for Project Gemini, NASA was understandably proud of {{its role in the}} highly successful effort, but the Air Force and its contractors planned, built and launched all the Titan II GLV space boosters associated with Project Gemini.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a new distributed multihop wireless <b>test</b> <b>control</b> network based on the recent development in “radio-on-chip ” technology. The proposed architecture consists of three basic components, the test scheduler, the resource configurators, and the RF nodes which support the communication between the test scheduler and clusters of cores. Under the multilevel tree structure, the resources (including not only the circuit blocks to perform testing, but also the on-chip radio-frequency nodes for intra-chip communication) are properly distributed and system optimization is performed {{in terms of both}} test application time and <b>test</b> <b>control</b> cost.

40|$|Seven {{serological}} tests, two immunochromatographic tests, ICT Tuberculosis and RAPID TEST TB, {{and five}} enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, TUBERCULOSIS IgA EIA, PATHOZYME-TB complex, PATHOZYME-MYCO IgG, PATHOZYME-MYCO IgA, and PATHOZYME-MYCO IgM, were evaluated simultaneously with 298 serum samples from {{three groups of}} individuals: 44 patients with active tuberculosis, 204 controls who had undergone the Mantoux test (89 Mantoux test-positive and 115 Mantoux test-negative controls), and 50 anonymous controls. The sensitivities of the tests with sera from patients with active tuberculosis were poor to modest, ranging from 16 to 57 %. All the tests performed equally with sera from subgroups of those with active tuberculosis, those with pulmonary (33 patients) versus extrapulmonary (11 patients) disease, {{and those who were}} smear positive (24 patients) versus smear negative (12 patients) (P > 0. 05). The specificities of the tests ranged from 80 to 97 % with sera from the Mantoux <b>test</b> <b>controls</b> and 62 to 100 % with sera from the anonymous controls. The TUBERCULOSIS IgA EIA had the highest sensitivity (57 %) with sera from patients with active tuberculosis, with a high specificity of 93 % with sera from the Mantoux <b>test</b> <b>controls,</b> but a very poor specificity of 62 % with sera from the anonymous controls. Overall, ICT Tuberculosis followed by PATHOZYME-MYCO IgG had the best performance characteristics, with sensitivities of 41 and 55 %, respectively, with sera from patients with active tuberculosis and specificities of 96 and 89 %, respectively, with sera from the Mantoux <b>test</b> <b>controls</b> and 88 and 90 %, respectively, with sera from the anonymous controls. By combining all the test results, a maximum sensitivity of 84 % was obtained, with reciprocal drops in specificities to 55 and 42 % for the Mantoux <b>test</b> <b>controls</b> and anonymous controls, respectively. The best combination was that of ICT Tuberculosis and PATHOZYME-MYCO IgG, with a sensitivity of 66 % and a specificity of 86 % for the Mantoux <b>test</b> <b>controls</b> and a sensitivity and specificity of 78 % for the anonymous controls. While a negative result by any one of these tests would be useful in helping to exclude disease in a population with a low prevalence of tuberculosis, a positive result may aid in clinical decision making when applied to symptomatic patients being evaluated for active tuberculosis...|$|R
