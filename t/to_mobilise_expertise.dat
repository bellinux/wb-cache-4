40|$|Climate Change {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} the single greatest threats to global social, environmental and economic wellbeing. Climate change poses significant threats to existing urban infrastructure, current water use practices and agricultural industries to name a few. In the State of Victoria in Australia, there is an e-Science initiative <b>to</b> <b>mobilise</b> cross-organisational <b>expertise</b> in order to underpin policy-making as it relates to climate change adaptation. An underpinning Spatial Decision Support System Framework has been designed to support integrated systems modelling across a number of modelling domains including climate, hydrological, crop and land suitability modelling. A number of core datasets serve as inputs in the spatial decision support system framework including land utilization, soil, geology, climate prediction (historical and forecasts) and many others. These datasets feed into a number of system models, which are used to better understand the present and future land suitability, hydrological processes, agricultural productivity and sea level changes. The climate change models align with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and have been downscaled to a regional level. In this research we present an e-Science based virtual collaborative workspace which has been developed to support the exchange of data, models, within a secure cross- organisational data grid. Also, we examine the use of a geographical visualisation as a front end to complex multi-disciplinary scenario modelling to enable end users to better understand the policy and on the ground implications of climate change to the Victorian landscape. 1...|$|R
40|$|Infrastructure {{procurement}} programmes of {{many public}} clients and large private developers, increasingly involve complex networks of stakeholders. Well balanced and 'fully informed' decisions are critical in optimising resources to achieve agreed objectives. A research project in Hong Kong {{is aimed at}} developing an ICT (Information and Communications Technology) [...] enhanced MSS (Management Support System). This will empower the formulation of more effective and effi cient construction project procurement and delivery/ operational systems [...] for innovative and improved 'total' management of construction projects [...] from a large client's viewpoint. Web-based Decision Support Systems (wDSSs) are being developed to help achieve such objectives, by capturing, codifying and mobilising both expert and experiential construction industry knowledge. Furthermore, web interfaces are being designed <b>to</b> <b>mobilise</b> the collective <b>expertise</b> of the entire project supply chain in real-time collaborative formats. These decision aids will enable the often fragmented multi-disciplinary project teams to build on 'state of the science' knowledge, past 'lessons learnt' and present best practices, in making more informed managerial decisions that will help to optimise inputs and reduce wasted resources. Potential benefi ts of wDSSs are demonstrated in this paper, through examples from the integrated framework and prototype modules/ models that are under development and 'construction' in Hong Kong. These cover a crosssection of infrastructure programme management decision scenarios, i. e. in: (1) multi-purpose contractor registration-prequalifi cation, (2) dynamic performance appraisal of contractors and (3) evaluating 'extension of time' entitlements. Interim outcomes included herein are the basic MSS framework, pilot models of items (1) and (2) above and prototype modules of item (3) above...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been using {{quantified}} consensus within climate science as an argument to foster climate policy. Recent efforts to communicate such scientific consensus attained a high public profile but it is doubtful {{if they can be}} regarded successful. We argue that repeated efforts to shore up the scientific consensus on minimalist claims such as ‘humans cause global warming’ are distractions from more urgent matters of knowledge, values, policy framing and public engagement.  Such efforts to force policy progress through communicating scientific consensus misunderstand the relationship between scientific knowledge, publics and policymakers. More important is to focus on genuinely controversial issues within climate policy debates where expertise might play a facilitating role. <b>Mobilising</b> <b>expertise</b> in policy debates calls for judgment, context and attention to diversity, rather than deferring to formal quantifications of narrowly scientific claims...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a {{preliminary}} analysis of Australian third sector, or non-profit, organisations' attempts <b>to</b> <b>mobilise</b> citizen engagement using online technologies. Recent debates {{about the nature and}} importance of citizen engagement, and the impacts of online technologies on citizen engagement, are reviewed in order to identify the significance of these technologies to third sector organisations. Drawing on a content analysis of 50 Australian third sector organisations' websites, I then consider the ways in which these organisations are, or are not, utilising online technological capacity <b>to</b> <b>mobilise</b> citizen engagement with their organisational activities. The research concludes that, while the organisations reviewed are utilising the capacity of online technologies to present information about their offline activities, they are less consistent in using these technologies <b>to</b> <b>mobilise</b> civic engagement in new ways. The implications of the research findings are discussed in relation {{to the future of the}} Australian third sector and public policy...|$|R
