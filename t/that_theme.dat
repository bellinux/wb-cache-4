5|$|The score {{established}} Herrmann as {{an important}} new composer of film soundtracks and eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as '"radio scoring", musical cues typically 5–15 seconds in length that bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response. The breakfast montage sequence begins with a graceful waltz theme and gets darker with each variation on <b>that</b> <b>theme</b> as {{the passage of time}} leads to the hardening of Kane's personality and the breakdown of his first marriage.|$|E
5|$|Peter Molyneux {{stated that}} {{he came up with}} the idea of {{creating}} Theme Park because he felt the business genre was worth pursuing. He said <b>that</b> <b>Theme</b> Park is a game he had always wanted to create, and wanted to avoid the mistakes of his earlier business simulation game, The Entrepreneur: he wanted to create a business simulation game and make it fun so people would want to play it. In an interview, he explained that the primary reason he created Theme Park was because he wanted players to create their dream Theme Park. Another reason is he wanted players to understand the kind of work running one entails. The three difficulty settings enable players to choose the desired depth: simply having fun creating a theme park, or making all the business decisions too. Molyneux stated that the most difficult part to program was the visitors' behaviour.|$|E

50|$|Children's Literature {{comments}} {{that the book}} deals with familiar themes to the Warriors series such as youth versus age, new versus tradition, and the discovery that others are not very different from oneself.

One {{of the more interesting}} passages is the account of the symposium held at the home of Harun al-Rashid's famous vizier Yahya the Barmakid on the topic of love. A dozen leading thinkers provide their definition of love and then a thirteenth, a Magian judge, speaks at greater length on <b>that</b> <b>theme.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{entering}} a picture gallery, {{he meets with}} an old poet, Eumolpus. The two exchange complaints about their misfortunes (83–84), and Eumolpus tells how, when he pursued {{an affair with a}} boy in Pergamon while employed as his tutor, the youth got the better of him (85–87). After talking about the decay of art and the inferiority of the painters and writers of the age to the old masters (88), Eumolpus illustrates a picture of the capture of Troy by some verses on <b>that</b> <b>theme</b> (89).|$|E
25|$|As the BBS {{phenomenon}} grew, so did {{the popularity}} of special interest boards. Bulletin Board Systems could be found for almost every hobby and interest. Popular interests included politics, religion, music, dating, and alternative lifestyles. Many SysOps also adopted a theme in which they customized their entire BBS (welcome screens, prompts, menus, and so on) to reflect <b>that</b> <b>theme.</b> Common themes were based on fantasy, or were intended to give the user the illusion of being somewhere else, such as in a sanatorium, wizard's castle, or on a pirate ship.|$|E

For the King of the Hill visual gag, the Simpsons staff {{acquired}} the rights to use the actual theme song from that show. The {{music that is}} played as Krusty performs his new show in front of adults at the theater {{is a mixture of}} the old Krusty theme and the theme from Playboy After Dark, a television show hosted by Hugh Hefner that started airing in the 1960s and featured parties from a Playboy club. This musical combination was composed by Alf Clausen after The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma came with the suggestion. On his blog, Ledesma wrote <b>that</b> <b>theme</b> for Playboy After Dark [...] "was cool and jazzy and just right for its time. Alf’s homage to <b>that</b> <b>theme,</b> wrapped around Krusty’s theme was very clever indeed." ...|$|E

5000|$|David Grylls of the Sunday Times said, [...] "As {{the book}} travels from the fatuous to the alarming, a fabular {{structure}} begins to emerge, hinting <b>that</b> <b>themes</b> of empire and exploitation, slavery and segregation, are being explored.

500|$|In a {{break from}} tradition, one of the ending themes of the game was not an {{in-house}} production, but Starsailor's [...] "Way To Fall". Hideo Kojima later revealed in his blog that he originally wanted to use [...] "Space Oddity" [...] and [...] "Ashes to Ashes" [...] (by David Bowie) for the ending themes because of the space development theme of the game, but during the game's development <b>that</b> <b>theme</b> lost its significance. One of his colleagues then advised him to listen to Stellastarr, but Kojima heard Starsailor. He liked the song [...] "Way To Fall", and chose it as an ending theme.|$|E

[...] Instead, the producers chose [...] "the Doctor's love of humanity" [...] as a theme, and selected pieces which they felt connected with <b>that</b> <b>theme.</b>|$|E
500|$|Once underway, Biden's {{campaign}} messaging became confused due {{to staff}} rivalries and bickering. Four different themes were presented, sometimes simultaneously: [...] "Pepsi Generation", [...] "Voice of optimism", [...] "Save the children", and [...] "Scold the voters". [...] Pollster Pat Caddell {{in particular was}} a disruptive force within the campaign, {{but he had been}} Biden's friend for 15 years. [...] Another of the themes was generational change; Biden hoped to inspire a new generation, as John F. Kennedy had inspired his. [...] But <b>that</b> <b>theme</b> was not catching on especially well. [...] Biden was also hurt by his never having been a player in the Washington social scene.|$|E

The soundtrack {{also received a}} score of 4.5/5 from Heather Phares of AllMusic. Jørn Tillnes, writing for Soundtrack Geek, highlighted the opening theme as [...] "one of the better main themes for any television series out there.

500|$|The soundtrack for Abzû was {{composed}} by Austin Wintory, {{who had previously}} worked on Journey and The Banner Saga. Wintory was first shown concept art for the project by Nava before Giant Squid Studios was founded and development began. When the studio was founded, Wintory was invited on board the project. The music was written from the start to be interactive and dynamic rather than based on specific cues. To achieve this, Wintory had {{to play the game}} extensively and repeatedly to get a sense for what players would experience and what would best match the mood. Similar to Wintory's work on Journey, the first track written was the main theme [...] "To Know, Water" [...] and further tracks were created over the game's three year development based on <b>that</b> <b>theme.</b>|$|E
500|$|Folie à deux {{is a rare}} {{psychiatric}} syndrome {{in which}} symptoms of a delusional belief are transmitted from one individual to another. The same syndrome shared by more than two people may be called folie à trois, folie à quatre, folie en famille or even folie à plusieurs ("madness of many"). Recent psychiatric classifications refer to the syndrome as dependency psychotic disorder or induced delusional disorder, although the research literature largely uses the original name. The disorder was first conceptualized in 19th century French psychiatry. In keeping with the record's socially aware nature, the band felt that the term was relevant to the candidates in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Stump further clarified the title's meaning: [...] "The irony is that people will probably mistake the title as something about romantic relationships in some way. And it's our only record where <b>that</b> <b>theme</b> is not touched upon." ...|$|E

500|$|Building on <b>that</b> <b>theme,</b> E. P. Clowney {{explained}} that three dimensions of Christian meditation are crucial, not merely for showing its distinctiveness, but for guiding its practice. The {{first is that}} Christian meditation {{is grounded in the}} Bible. Because the God of the Bible is a personal God who speaks in words of revelation, Christian meditation responds to this revelation and focuses on that aspect, in contrast to mystic meditations which use mantras. The second distinctive mark of Christian meditation is that it responds to the love of God, as in I John : [...] "We love, for he first loved us". The personal relationship based on the love of God that marks Christian communion is thus heightened in Christian meditation. The third dimension is that the revelations of the Bible and the love of God lead to the worship of God: making Christian meditation an exercise in praise.|$|E
500|$|Le Guin {{described}} {{coming of}} age as the main theme of the book, and wrote in a 1973 essay that she chose <b>that</b> <b>theme</b> since she was writing for an adolescent audience. She stated that [...] "Coming of age... {{is a process that}} took me many years; I finished it, so far as I ever will, at about age thirty-one; and so I feel rather deeply about it. So do most adolescents. It's their main occupation, in fact." [...] She also said that fantasy was best suited as a medium for describing {{coming of age}}, because exploring the subconscious was difficult using the language of [...] "rational daily life". The coming of age that Le Guin focused on included not just psychological development, but moral changes as well. Ged needs to recognize the balance between his power and his responsibility to use it well, a recognition which comes as he travels to the stone of Terrenon and sees the temptation that that power represents.|$|E
500|$|As {{with other}} social mammals, the calls reveal the sex and {{identity}} of the individual. [...] Dialects have also been detected between communities. [...] The male trill call, part of the male mating display, is much like a bird song {{in terms of its}} ordered sequence of broadband frequency modulated syllables, ranging between 13 and 35kHz in pitch and lasting 0.3 to 0.9seconds, repeating up to 1.5 times per minute. [...] Each locality has its own theme of trill calls that is distinct from those of neighboring communities, and resident males produce individually distinct trill calls within <b>that</b> <b>theme.</b> [...] These calls are not genetically programmed. [...] During play, young males produce early attempts at the trill call, which show high degrees of variability. [...] Research has shown that the male mouse lemurs consciously manipulate the dialect to resemble those of their neighbors, when transferred from their home to a new neighborhood. [...] This may reduce aggression and foster social acceptance for emigrant males as they transfer from their natal group upon maturity.|$|E
