5|$|A set of plaques {{was added}} to the south of <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> in 1949, commemorating the 29,924 Royal Artillerymen who were killed in the Second World War. Over the years, {{pollution}} and water penetration caused damage to the bronzes and stonework. English Heritage conducted a major restoration of <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> during 2011, completed in time for Remembrance Day. In 1970 <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> was protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building, and in 2014 it was one of five memorials in London to be upgraded to Grade I status to mark the centenary of the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Faversham Cottage Hospital {{opened in}} 1887. It was {{extended}} in 1922 and included a World War I memorial, which was unveiled by Vice Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas. <b>The</b> <b>memorial</b> was later adapted to commemorate World War II casualties. In 2014, <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> became Grade II listed.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the {{increased}} threat of conflict with Nazi Germany amplified the Canadian government's {{level of concern}} for the general safety of <b>the</b> <b>memorial.</b> Canada could do little more than protect the sculptures and the bases of the pylons with sandbags and await developments. When war did break out in September 1939, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) deployed to France and assumed responsibility for the Arras sector, which included Vimy. In late May 1940, following the British retreat to Dunkirk after the Battle of Arras, the status and condition of <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> became unknown to Allied forces. The Germans took control of the site and held the site's caretaker, George Stubbs, in an Ilag internment camp for Allied civilians in St. Denis, France. The rumoured destruction of the Vimy Memorial, either during the fighting or {{at the hands of the}} Germans, was widely reported in Canada and the United Kingdom. The rumours led the German Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda to formally deny accusations that Germany had damaged or desecrated <b>the</b> <b>memorial.</b> To demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> had not been desecrated, Adolf Hitler, who reportedly admired <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> for its peaceful nature, was photographed by the press while personally touring it and the preserved trenches on 2 June 1940. The undamaged state of <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> was not confirmed until September 1944 when British troops of the 2nd Battalion, Welsh Guards of the Guards Armoured Division recaptured Vimy Ridge.|$|E

5|$|Leigh Pitt, a print {{technician}} from Surrey, {{had died}} on 7 June 2007 rescuing nine-year-old Harley Bagnall-Taylor who was drowning in a canal in Thamesmead. His colleague, Jane Michele (now Jane Shaka) approached the Diocese of London {{to suggest that}} Pitt would make a suitable addition to <b>the</b> <b>memorial,</b> and despite previous opposition from the Watts Gallery to proposals to complete <b>the</b> <b>memorial,</b> on 11 June 2009 a memorial to Pitt was added to <b>the</b> <b>Memorial</b> to Heroic Self Sacrifice, the first new tablet added to <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> since that of Herbert Maconoghu 78years earlier. A spokesman for the Diocese of London said that the Diocese would now consider suitable names {{to be added to}} <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> in future.|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} {{had been}} made on <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> by 1926. While some debate occurred in respect to the form that <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> would take, {{the focus of the}} discussions concerned the location of <b>the</b> <b>memorial,</b> and this centred on the future of Government House {{and the role of the}} Governor. A number of left-wing politicians argued that the grounds of Government House should be turned over to the State and used to build <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> while the conservatives desired to retain the status quo. By 1925 the National War Memorial committee was prepared to accept the Government House grounds as the site of <b>the</b> <b>memorial,</b> but they delayed making an announcement. This proved to be fortuitous, as legal issues prevented the plan from going ahead. Instead a portion of the grounds, located at the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue, was put aside for the purpose. (The plan to move the Governor and to use the grounds as part of a larger war memorial were revisited, over 80 years later, in 2007).|$|E
5|$|Repair work {{commenced}} on {{the garden}} and undercroft in early 2008—the beams and columns supporting the terrace having become dangerously weak—and was scheduled to take three years to complete. The council commissioned NPS Architectural Group to oversee restoration and work on <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> itself started in September 2009; the council initially hoped that the project would be complete by Armistice Day 2010. During the repair work <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> itself was rotated to face the city hall, {{in accordance with the}} wishes of local veterans to allow them easier access for parades, and underwent minor restoration work. Its place in <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> garden was taken by a new bronze sculpture: Breath by Paul de Monchaux. The garden re-opened to the public in March 2011. <b>The</b> <b>memorial</b> and garden was re-dedicated after three years on Armistice Day, 11 November 2011; the repair work had cost £2.6million.|$|E
5|$|Reginald Blomfield's Menin Gate was <b>the</b> first <b>memorial</b> to <b>the</b> missing {{located in}} Europe to be completed, and was {{unveiled}} on 24 July 1927. The Menin Gate (Menenpoort) {{was found to}} have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34,984 names of the missing were instead inscribed on Herbert Baker's Tyne Cot <b>Memorial</b> to <b>the</b> Missing. Other <b>memorials</b> followed: <b>the</b> Helles <b>Memorial</b> in Gallipoli designed by John James Burnet; <b>the</b> Thiepval <b>Memorial</b> on <b>the</b> Somme and <b>the</b> Arras <b>Memorial</b> designed by Edwin Lutyens; and <b>the</b> Basra <b>Memorial</b> in Iraq designed by Edward Prioleau Warren. The Dominions and India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing: <b>the</b> Neuve-Chapelle <b>Memorial</b> for <b>the</b> forces of India, <b>the</b> Vimy <b>Memorial</b> by Canada, <b>the</b> Villers-Bretonneux <b>Memorial</b> by Australia, <b>the</b> Delville Wood <b>Memorial</b> by South Africa and <b>the</b> Beaumont-Hamel <b>Memorial</b> by Newfoundland. <b>The</b> programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of <b>the</b> Thiepval <b>Memorial</b> in 1932, though <b>the</b> Vimy <b>Memorial</b> would not be finished until 1936, <b>the</b> Villers-Bretonneux <b>Memorial</b> until 1938 and stonemasons were still conducting work on the Menin Gate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940.|$|R

5|$|The Confederate Memorial stands upon {{a raised}} mound ringed by five boxwoods within the {{original}} section of Indian Mound Cemetery, {{not far from}} the cemetery's entrance.

5|$|The {{committee}} specified {{a budget}} of £25,000 (previously figures of both £5,000 and £100,000 had been discussed), and the conditions of entry stated that <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> was to be situated {{at the entrance to}} Government House on the corner of King William Street and North Terrace, placing it just behind the existing memorial to the South African War. This location was counter to previous suggestions: a 1919 survey of architects had proposed that <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> should be built on Montefiore Hill, while in 1923 the plans for <b>the</b> <b>memorial</b> involved erecting it at the rear of Government House, rather than at the front.|$|E
