HPV is also associated with several other epithelial cancers, therefore its role as etiologic agent of carcinoma may be wider than currently known. The pathogenetic events related to <b>tumor</b> <b>transformations</b> are based upon interactions between HPV proteins E 6 and E 7 and cellular proteins playing {{a key role in}} the homeostasis of cell cycle. Their disregulation alters cell cycle functions, and activates loops that ultimately cause cell transformation and uncontrolled growth. The clear-cut correlation between HPV and cancer makes mandatory the availability of massive screenings able to precisely detect the circulation of oncogenic subtypes of HPV, and to assess the potential evolution of the HPV-related disease. The availability of vaccines with demonstrated ability to control HPV infection and development of pre-cancerous lesions makes even more relevant the screening of HPV, and the correct positioning of HPV-vaccines in the public health campaigns aimed at controlling the spread of this virus.

40|$|The oncogenic {{potential}} of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein has been demonstrated, but the precise mechanism of cell transformation triggered by HCV core is still unclear. This {{study shows that}} constitutive expression of HCV core protein (core) in NIH 3 T 3 murine fibroblasts triggers malignant transformation. At the preneoplastic stage, clones that expressed HCV core constitutively demonstrated genomic instability seen as disruption of the mitotic spindle cell checkpoint leading to increased ploidy. Transformation was completed {{by the loss of}} DNA and resistance to apoptosis induced by serum starvation. Simultaneously, cells acquired a capacity for anchorage independent growth and absence of contact inhibition. Inoculation of these transformed cells into severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice led to formation of solid core-expressing <b>tumors.</b> <b>Transformation</b> and tumorigenicity of core-expressing cell lines coincided with a 5 - to 10 -fold repression of endogenous p 53 transactivation. Thus, long-term HCV core expression alone is sufficient for complete transformation of immortal fibroblasts that can then induce tumors in a susceptible host.

40|$|STAT 3 mediates {{cytokine}} {{and growth}} factor receptor signalling, becoming transcriptionally active upon tyrosine 705 phosphorylation (Y-P). Constitutively Y-P STAT 3 is observed in many tumors that become addicted to its activity, and STAT 3 transcriptional activation {{is required for}} <b>tumor</b> <b>transformation</b> downstream of several oncogenes. We have recently demonstrated that constitutively active STAT 3 drives a metabolic switch towards aerobic glycolysis through the transcriptional induction of Hif- 1 α and the down-regulation of mitochondrial activity, in both MEF cells expressing constitutively active STAT 3 (Stat 3 C/C) and STAT 3 -addicted tumor cells. This novel metabolic function is likely involved in mediating pre-oncogenic features in the primary Stat 3 C/C MEFs such as resistance to apoptosis and senescence and rapid proliferation. Moreover, it strongly contributes {{to the ability of}} primary Stat 3 C/C MEFs to undergo malignant transformation upon spontaneous immortalization, a feature that may explain the well known causative link between STAT 3 constitutive activity and <b>tumor</b> <b>transformation</b> under chronic inflammatory conditions. Taken together with the recently uncovered role of STAT 3 in regulating energy metabolism from within the mitochondrion when phosphorylated on Ser 727, these data place STAT 3 {{at the center of a}} hub regulating energy metabolism under different conditions, in most cases promoting cell survival, proliferation and malignant transformation even though with distinct mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|Cells {{within the}} tumor {{microenvironment}} influence tumor growth through multiple mechanisms. Pericytes such as hepatic stellate cells {{are an important}} cell within the <b>tumor</b> microenvironment; their <b>transformation</b> into highly motile myofibroblasts leads to angiogenesis, stromal cell recruitment, matrix deposition, and ensuing tumor growth. Thus, {{a better understanding of}} mechanisms that regulate motility of pericytes is required. Focal adhesions (FAs) form a physical link between the extracellular environment and the actin cytoskeleton, a requisite step for cell motility. FAs contain a collection of proteins including the Ena/VASP family member, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP); however, a role for VASP in FA development has been elusive. Using a comprehensive siRNA knockdown approach and a variety of VASP mutants coupled with complementary cell imaging methodologies, we demonstrate a requirement of VASP for optimal development of FAs and cell spreading in LX 2 liver myofibroblasts, which express high levels of endogenous VASP. Rac 1, a binding partner of VASP, acts in tandem with VASP to regulate FAs. In vivo, perturbation of Ena/VASP function in tumor myofibroblast precursor cells significantly reduces pericyte recruitment to <b>tumor</b> vasculature, myofibroblastic <b>transformation,</b> <b>tumor</b> angiogenesis, and tumor growth, providing in vivo pathobiologic relevance to these findings.

Although TPA stimulates expression of the jun and fos family genes, only c-jun expression shows higher elevation in P+ cells than in P- cells. The present study tests the hypothesis that induced AP- 1 activity is required for <b>tumor</b> promoter-induced <b>transformation</b> in JB 6 P+ cells. Both retinoic acid and the glucocorticoid fluocinolone acetonide inhibited basal and TPA-induced AP- 1 activities that were tested with a stromelysin promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in P+ cells. Since both retinoic acid and fluocinolone acetonide are active in inhibiting TPA-induced anchorage-independent transformation of P+ cells in the dose range that blocks TPA-induced AP- 1 activity, their antipromoting effects may occur through inhibition of AP- 1 activity. To test the hypothesis with a more specific inhibitor, stable clonal transfectants of P+ cells expressing dominant negative c-jun mutant encoding a transcriptionally inactive product were analyzed. All transfectants showed a block in TPA and EGF induction of AP- 1 activity. All transfectants also showed inhibition of TPA-induced transformation, and most transfectants showed a block in EGF-induced transformation. These results indicate that AP- 1 activity is required for TPA- or EGF-induced transformation.
