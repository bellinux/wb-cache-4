5|$|Both {{articles}} {{address the}} issue of who the killer could alternatively have been, and both of them mention Carol's other lovers, and John Rapson, responsible for murdering Carol's sister. Both of the articles mention {{that he was in the}} Barrow area around the time of the murder, but both of them are careful <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> they are not accusing him of being the murderer.|$|E
5|$|Humphrey {{moved to}} his new home with an elderly couple in {{suburban}} London on 13 November 1997, though his retirement was not announced {{until the next day}} {{to reduce the risk of}} kidnap attempts.

5|$|Hibiki is the 18-year-old {{protagonist of}} the series. He is granted {{the ability to}} summon demons from Nicaea after {{experiencing}} a train accident {{on his way home}} from taking mock exams. With this newfound power he finds himself intertwined in a battle of survival against the Septentriones who seek to destroy the world. Kamiya did not express any opinions on Hibiki's character. However he was very clear <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> despite the series being called Devil Survivor 2, it is not a sequel to a previous series but rather an independent story all its own.|$|E

5|$|The British favoured the {{prospect}} of the Temenggong in taking over the administration of Johor from the Sultan. Sultan Ali's claims to sovereignty were quickly refuted by the British and the Temenggong, who was quick <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the Sultan's late father, Sultan Hussein had never pursued active claims to his sovereignty rights over Johor in spite of his recognition by the British in the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty. At that time, Johor came under the effective charge of the Temenggong's late father, Abdul Rahman, as with Pahang, which was {{under the control of the}} Bendahara. Further documents revealed that if Johor were to be under the control of a monarch, de jure sovereignty would have been laid under the charge of the Sultan of Lingga, Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah and not with Sultan Ali.|$|E
5|$|As the Griffin family {{prepare to}} sit down for their dinner, baby Stewie is shown {{watching}} television, with the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade taking place on the screen. Stewie notices a hot air balloon in the parade resembling himself. After the family decides {{to go to the}} Griffin family's backyard to play football, Joe approaches his son to encourage him to beat the other team. Joe then references the 2009 war film The Hurt Locker, with Kevin responding with disdain for the film, despite supposedly being in a coma during its release. Joe also goes on <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Kevin is wearing an Ed Hardy t-shirt, which also became popularized during his supposed coma, and despite Kevin telling his father that he flew straight home after he awoke. Later during dinner, when Kevin reveals that he went A.W.O.L., Peter makes an off the wall reference, causing the episode to cut to a room showing several of the show's editors, who become confused about what cutaway to play on the screen. They then decide to play a clip involving several characters from The Wizard of Oz, including the Cowardly Lion, who is shown to be actress Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist.|$|E
5|$|Through its {{absorption}} of the principalities of Novgorod (1478) and Pskov (1510), the Tsardom of Russia had become Livonia's eastern neighbour and grown stronger after annexing the khanates of Kazan (1552) and Astrakhan (1556). The conflict between Russia and the Western powers was exacerbated by Russia's isolation from sea trade. The new Ivangorod port built by Tsar Ivan {{on the eastern}} shore of the Narva River in 1550 was considered unsatisfactory on account of its shallow waters. Thereafter the tsar demanded that the Livonian Confederation pay about 6,000 marks to keep the Bishopric of Dorpat, based on the claim that every adult male had paid Pskov one mark when it had been an independent state. The Livonians eventually promised to pay this sum to Ivan by 1557, but were sent from Moscow when they failed to do so, ending negotiations. Ivan continued <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the existence of the Order required passive Russian support, and was quick to threaten use of military force if necessary. He aimed to establish a corridor between the Baltic and the new territories on the Caspian Sea, because if Russia were to engage in open conflict with major western powers, it would need imports of more sophisticated weaponry.|$|E

50|$|Thomas Dewey was {{governor}} of New York when he received the Democratic nomination for President in 1944. He and his running mate Harry S. Truman of Missouri defeat the incumbent Charles W.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the controlled system described by forward-backward stochastic differential equations with the control contained in drift, diffusion and generator of BSDE. A new verification theorem is derived {{within the framework}} of viscosity solutions without involving any derivatives of the value functions. It is worth <b>to</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> this theorem has wider applicability than the restrictive classical verification theorems. As a relevant problem, the optimal stochastic feedback controls for forward-backward system are discussed as well...|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{independence}} of strain rate, preconditioned soft tissues still present hysteresis, so the mechanical response can be modeled as hyperelastic with different material constants at loading and unloading. By this method the elasticity theory is used to model an inelastic material.

25|$|In {{addition}} to Structure A, other structures were found around the site.
