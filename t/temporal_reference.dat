This portion of the composition consists of eight-bar [...] "A" [...] sections and twelve-bar [...] "B" [...] sections, structured in an A-B-A-B pattern. The alap's lack of a distinct time signature is contrasted with a <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> in the lyrics to the opening verse: [...] "Each day just goes so fast / I turn around, it's past".

In keeping with the minimal harmonic movement of Indian music, the composition's only deviation from its I chord of C is a series of implied VII chord changes, which occur in the B sections.|$|E

40|$|Maintaining {{temporal}} information involves representing {{and reasoning}} about information with <b>temporal</b> <b>references.</b> In this thesis {{we present a}} temporal formalism to maintain temporal information in an axiomatic manner. The temporal formalism consists of five parts concerning the underlying time structure, absolute <b>temporal</b> <b>references,</b> relative <b>temporal</b> <b>references,</b> actions and their effects, and periodical knowledge. In order to support multiple common-sense time granularities such as year, month, day, or whatever, we use the rational number system as our underlying time structure. Time points are modelled by rational numbers, intervals by pairs of rational numbers, and durations by positive rational numbers. In our temporal formalism, we use time points and intervals to define modal operators to deal with information with absolute <b>temporal</b> <b>references,</b> use traditional modal operators to deal with information with relative <b>temporal</b> <b>references,</b> and use time durations to define modal operators to deal with periodical knowledge. For each time defined modal operator, axioms and inference rules are given. The interval-defined modal operators are specially studied {{through the construction of}} two propositional temporal logics and the proof of their completeness. Durational actions and their effects are considered. In particular, we discuss a generalized inertia law and an assumption of no intersected effect-competing actions. We also give some examples to show how to use our temporal formalism to represent and reason about temporal information. In all the examples temporal information is represented into our temporal formulas and new temporal information can be deduced by use of the axioms and inference rules of our temporal formalismAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

It is used determining tense of generalizations and habitual truths. In these types of utterances, there is no specific verb occurrence to observe (and thus no assertion). Instead, the purpose of such utterances is to merely inform. In these utterances, a generalization or an habitual truth is attested as true (or questioned for trueness in interrogative forms). The earliest point at which these attestations can be evaluated as true or not serves as the secondary <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> for such constructions.|$|E

40|$|A {{knowledge}} base about any domain should satisfy some basic properties. One of these properties is completeness. Assuming that a {{knowledge base}} is temporal, that is, it contains explicit time references in its rules and facts, we may face {{a problem of}} {{an infinite number of}} possible premises, as the number of <b>temporal</b> <b>references</b> (e. g. in business documents) is unlimited. A technique for reducing the number of possible rules in a temporal knowledge base is proposed in this paper. This is achieved by transforming an infinite set of possible temporal rules into a finite one by mapping an infinite set of <b>temporal</b> <b>references</b> onto a finite set, and by automatic trimming of idiomatic phrases read from business documents. The technique for reducing the number of rules is presented and illustrated by an example. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an interval-based positional logic and proves its completeness. The proposed logic combines positional operators, defined by time intervals, with modal operators {{used to express}} the subinterval relationship. Moreover, the logic can be easily extended either by including more predicates for absolute <b>temporal</b> <b>references</b> or by adding other operators for relative and periodical <b>temporal</b> <b>references.</b> The positional logic {{can be used to}} express and reason about time-stamped temporal information, particularly stored in temporal databases. The underlying time structure is motivated by the common-sense calendar-clock style time, where multiple time granularities to any precision, often involved in temporal information, can be very naturally supported. Although each positional/modal operator is normal, the completeness proof of the proposed positional logic is more complicated than the standard completeness proof of normal modal logics.

5000|$|Arom Simha {{proceeds}} to note [...] "We have already remarked that specific vertical combinations in each formula act as <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> points {{by virtue of}} their regular repetition at a given position in the periodic cycle. These combinations are the points at which several superposed melodic lines meet. They are usually based on octaves, fifths, and fourths, precisely the intervals which make up sections 1-4 of Chailley's resonance table (i960: 35), and this is certainly no accident. We may therefore assume that they take on a structural function." [...] These vertical combinations that constitute reference points are chords that, together, form a chord progression. This is similar to the concepts of chords and progressions in cyclical forms in Jazz, Blues and other musics of the African diaspora.|$|E
50|$|Clock {{signals are}} {{typically}} loaded {{with the greatest}} fanout and operate at the highest speeds of any signal within the synchronous system. Since the data signals are provided with a <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> by the clock signals, the clock waveforms must be particularly clean and sharp. Furthermore, these clock signals are particularly affected by technology scaling (see Moore's law), in that long global interconnect lines become significantly more resistive as line dimensions are decreased. This increased line resistance {{is one of the}} primary reasons for the increasing significance of clock distribution on synchronous performance. Finally, the control of any differences and uncertainty in the arrival times ofthe clock signals can severely limit the maximum performance of the entire system and create catastrophic race conditions in which an incorrect data signal may latch within a register.|$|E

40|$|People {{often use}} spatial {{vocabulary}} to describe temporal relations, and this increasingly has motivated attempts to map spatial {{frames of reference}} (FoRs) onto time. Recent research suggested that speech communities, which differ in how they conceptualize space, may also differ in how they conceptualize time and, more specifically, that the preferences for spatial FoRs should carry over to the domain of time. Here, we scrutinize this assumption (a) by reviewing data from recent studies on <b>temporal</b> <b>references,</b> (b) by comparing data we had collected in previous studies on preferences for spatial and temporal FoRs in four languages, (c) by analyzing new data from dynamic spatial tasks that resemble the temporal tasks more closely, and (d) by assessing the co-variation of individual preferences of English speakers across space and time. While {{the first set of}} data paints a mixed picture, the latter three do not support the assumption of a close link between referencing preferences across domains.

For Malotki it was imperative to demonstrate two facts in contradiction of Whorf's claims: 1. that the Hopi language has an abundance of terms, words and constructions that refer to time. 2. that the Hopi do cognitively conceptualize time in analogy with physical space, using spatial metaphors to describe durations and units of time. He also wanted to demonstrate that Whorf misanalyzed several particularities regarding specific Hopi words and expressions. Malotki states that a main goal is to present [...] "actual Hopi language data", since when he was writing very little textual data in Hopi had been published, and Whorf's publications were largely without text examples.|$|E
50|$|According to Vesely, {{the ability}} to {{reconcile}} the acquired inverted vision with the situational structure of the human body, points out to a deeper problem when dealing with situation, which is related to our ability to become situated on provisional grounds, even when lacking a fundamental 'ground' of spatial or <b>temporal</b> <b>reference.</b> The example from inverted vision also means to show that such a basis {{is far from being}} immediate; it is constituted in the process of a search within the actual space and comes about in the reciprocity between different levels and forms of representation such as visual, tactile, and so forth. Vesely elaborates on situation and the phenomenon of being situated {{as an example of how}} we contextualize spatial knowledge and on which basis; and on how a particular point of reference allows us to situate spatial knowledge. In the course of the argument, Vesely demonstrates that what constitutes the fabric of situation is a continuity of reference and experience through different forms of articulating spatiality down to an implicit structure that itself is neither visual nor tactile, and is only potentially articulated in the objective realm (pp. 48, 82-87, 378ss).|$|E
50|$|As a {{conceptual}} project the Freight Elevator Quartet combined influences from experimental music and conceptual art {{as well as}} a strong interest in musical Futurism (played out in their joint recording with DJ Spooky, File Under Futurism). In their liner notes, they referred to themselves as a group of musicians in the present imagining the past imaging the future, a concept akin to the literary conceit of Steampunk; by combining cutting-edge digital (computers, samplers), obsolescent solid state (analog synthesizers), classical 18th century (cello), and aboriginal (didjeridoo) instrumentation, the group deliberately confused the <b>temporal</b> <b>reference</b> point of their music. Stylistically FEQ was known to appropriate whatever genres they felt like, working to fuse different styles of breakbeat, drum and bass, downtempo, digital hardcore, rock, hip hop, classical, and, most conspicuously, academic computer music. Though always billing themselves as an electronica act, their music has many stylistic similarities to the later genre of post-rock. Most of their recordings are culled from composite takes of live performances, though they have released two studio albums as well, both of which feature songs with guest vocalists, including Lorraine Lelis of the band Mahogany and Spezialmaterial recording artist Josh Druckman (as JMD).|$|E

40|$|Transportation {{agencies}} manage {{data that}} is referenced in one, two, three, and four dimensions. Location referencing system (LRS) data models vary across transportation agencies and often within organizations as well. This {{has resulted in}} failed attempts and abandoned efforts to interoperate business functions and / or integrate data. A number of transportation agencies, through recognition {{of the significance of}} spatially-referenced information to their operations, have identified the need for comprehensive management of location referencing. What is lacking is a clear set of functional requirements for a comprehensive location referencing system. Detailed functional requirements and a comprehensive data model are necessary so transportation agencies can implement improved transportation information systems and advanced GIS-T technology. Linearly-referenced data constitutes the majority of data managed by transportation agencies. However, agencies are now using GPS technology for applications ranging from highway inventory to incident management. Much more detail is needed on functional requirements for data in higher dimensions and for integration across dimensions.
