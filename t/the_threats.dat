5|$|On October 18, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security warned National Football League {{officials}} in Miami, New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, and Cleveland {{about a possible}} threat involving the simultaneous use of dirty bombs at stadiums. The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22, {{the final day of}} the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of <b>the</b> <b>threats,</b> but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness. <b>The</b> <b>threats</b> came to light in the national media after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.|$|E
5|$|A five-year interim {{management}} plan {{was put in}} place by the Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation in October 2005. Actions under that plan include regular monitoring of populations, management of <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> of fire and P.cinnamomi, and the cold storage of seed. As of December 2009 a recovery plan is being developed. There is also a translocation project underway.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} of emus on mainland Australia {{is thought to be}} higher now than it was before European settlement, some local populations are at risk of extinction. <b>The</b> <b>threats</b> faced by emus include the clearance and fragmentation of areas of suitable habitat, deliberate slaughter, collisions with vehicles and predation of the eggs and young.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores <b>the</b> {{power of}} <b>threats</b> in <b>the</b> absence of binding commitment. The threatener cannot commit {{to carry out}} <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> if <b>the</b> victim refuses payment, and cannot commit not to carry out <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> if payment is made. An {{important}} assumption of the model is that once <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> is carried out it cannot be repeated. If exercising <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> is costly to the threatener, then <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> cannot succeed in extracting money from the victim. If exercising <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> would benefit <b>the</b> threatener, however, then <b>the</b> <b>threat's</b> success depends upon whether <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> may be repeated after a payment is made. In the equilibrium of a finite-period game, <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> is carried out and the victim makes no payments. In an infinite-horizon game, however, it is an equilibrium for the victim to make a stream of payments over time. The expectation of future payments keeps the threatener from exercising <b>the</b> <b>threat.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|He was {{replaced}} by Rutger von Ascheberg, in 1680, who held it to his death in 1693. It was during Ascheberg's time in office that the stricter policy of Swedification was initiated, {{as a reaction to}} <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> of war and possible Danish repossession.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ancient}} world, in {{addition}} to Salamis, major naval engagements included the Battle of Actium, which permitted the establishment of Augustus's empire. In the modern era, important naval battles include the English victories against the Armada in 1588 and at Trafalgar in 1805, which broke <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> of invasion by the superior land forces of the Spanish and French empires.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of the dynasty, semi-autonomous regional kings rivaled the emperor's authority. This autonomy was greatly diminished when the imperial court enacted reforms following <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> to central control like the Rebellion of the Seven States. The End of the Han dynasty came about during a time of civil, military and religious upheaval, which resulted in the period of Three Kingdoms.|$|E
5000|$|Risking public {{disclosure}} of <b>the</b> <b>threat,</b> thereby portraying <b>the</b> party making <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> {{in a bad}} light (see <b>the</b> Streisand effect). <b>Threats</b> of frivolous litigation against major news organisations are extraordinarily risky in this regard, as the newspaper will most often report <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> in <b>the</b> paper itself.|$|R
5000|$|Another entry {{position}} in the simple squeeze gives dummy, for example, an immediate winner and a small card in declarer's threat suit. This position is termed a split two-card threat or split two-card menace. <b>The</b> split two-card <b>threat</b> [...] "splits" [...] <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> between declarer's hand and dummy. In Example 5, <b>the</b> spade <b>threat</b> is <b>the</b> J. <b>The</b> split two-card <b>threat</b> splits <b>the</b> spade <b>threat's</b> immediate winner, <b>the</b> A, from <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> itself. Dummy holds an immediate winner in the suit where declarer holds <b>the</b> <b>threat.</b>|$|R

5|$|The longest living eastern {{green mamba}} was a captive {{specimen}} which lived for 18.8 years. Another captive specimen lived for 14 years. However, {{while it may}} be possible for wild specimens to live that long, they are thought to have shorter lifespans in general due to <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> of predation, habitat loss, disease, and other biological and environmental factors.|$|E

5|$|During {{the initial}} {{negotiations}} in the U.S. embassy, Chen did not request asylum in the United States or considered leaving China, but instead demanded to remain {{there as a}} free man. However, soon after leaving the embassy, Chen feared that Chinese authorities would renege on their promises or take punitive actions against his family members. While in the hospital, Chinese security personnel barred U.S. diplomatic staff from meeting with him. Rumors emerged that Chinese officials had coerced Chen into leaving the embassy by threatening his family. U.S. negotiators stated that while in the embassy, Chen {{had been told by}} Chinese officials that if he sought asylum in the United States, his wife and daughter would likely remain under house arrest in Shandong. However, they maintained that they had not heard of <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> from local officials that his family would be beaten, and that they had not communicated such a message to Chen. On 3 May, Chen clarified to the BBC that he had become aware of <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> against his family after leaving the embassy, and at that point changed his mind about wishing to stay in China.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, Peggy Carter must {{balance the}} routine office work she does for the Strategic Scientific Reserve while {{secretly}} assisting Howard Stark, who finds himself framed for supplying deadly weapons to {{enemies of the}} United States. Carter is assisted by Stark's butler, Edwin Jarvis, to find those responsible and dispose of the weapons. Carter eventually moves from New York City to Los Angeles to deal with <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> of the new atomic age {{in the wake of}} World War II, gaining new friends, a new home and potential new love.|$|E
5|$|In early 2013, a Mexican drug {{trafficking}} organization issued fliers offering a reward of $600,000 pesos (US$46,000) for anyone {{that could give}} out information to locate the administrator of Valor por Tamaulipas or any of his family members. The administrator, however, openly defied the criminal organization's threat through Facebook. His wife and children reportedly fled to the United States after <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> for security reasons, but the citizen journalist stated on the Facebook page that {{he had decided to}} stay in Mexico and continue updating at Valor por Tamaulipas. In December 2014, however, the administrator announced his retirement from social media.|$|E
5|$|Kr√ºper's {{nuthatch}} {{is threatened}} by urbanisation and development in and around mature coniferous forests, particularly in the Mediterranean coastal areas where the species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and {{made it easier for}} developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is a growing problem for the nuthatch.|$|E
50|$|Strategies {{to manage}} threats (uncertainties with {{negative}} consequences) typically include avoiding <b>the</b> <b>threat,</b> reducing <b>the</b> negative effect or probability of <b>the</b> <b>threat,</b> transferring {{all or part}} of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> to another party, and even retaining {{some or all of the}} potential or actual consequences of a particular <b>threat,</b> and <b>the</b> opposites for opportunities (uncertain future states with benefits).|$|R

50|$|These {{attempts}} resulted, on 30 June, in <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> {{level in}} <b>the</b> UK being raised to 'critical', {{the highest of}} five possible levels, meaning a terrorist attack was expected imminently. The raising of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> threshold effectively put Britain on par with Iran, Guatemala, Jordan, Rwanda and Uzbekistan in terms of <b>the</b> potential <b>threat</b> posed. However, on 4 July <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> level was reduced to 'severe' but that still meant that an attack was highly likely.|$|R
5|$|Like {{all other}} {{non-human}} primates, strepsirrhines face an elevated risk of extinction due to human activity, particularly deforestation in tropical regions. Much of their habitat {{has been converted}} for human use, such as agriculture and pasture. <b>The</b> <b>threats</b> facing strepsirrhine primates fall into three main categories: habitat destruction, hunting (for bushmeat or traditional medicine), and live capture for export or local exotic pet trade. Although hunting is often prohibited, the laws protecting them are rarely enforced. In Madagascar, local taboos known as fady sometimes help protect lemur species, although some are still hunted for traditional medicine.|$|E
5|$|Many {{wind power}} {{companies}} work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms. In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects. Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures {{also help to}} minimize environmental risks. Some may still object to wind farms but, according to The Australia Institute, their concerns should be weighed against the need to address <b>the</b> <b>threats</b> posed by climate change and {{the opinions of the}} broader community.|$|E
5|$|The American {{prisoners were}} quickly {{returned}} to the United States, most by plane. Those who were still sick or weakened remained at American hospitals to continue to recuperate. On February11, 1945, 280 POWs left Leyte aboard the transport USS General A.E. Anderson bound for San Francisco via Hollandia, New Guinea. In an effort to counter the improved American morale, Japanese propaganda radio announcers broadcast to American soldiers that submarines, ships, and planes were hunting the General Anderson. <b>The</b> <b>threats</b> {{proved to be a}} bluff, and the ship safely arrived in San Francisco Bay on March8, 1945.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>threats</b> {{faced by}} seabirds {{have not gone}} unnoticed by {{scientists}} or the conservation movement. As early as 1903, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt was convinced {{of the need to}} declare Pelican Island in Florida a National Wildlife Refuge to protect the bird colonies (including the nesting brown pelicans), and in 1909 he protected the Farallon Islands. Today many important seabird colonies are given some measure of protection, from Heron Island in Australia to Triangle Island in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{continues}} {{to pose a}} serious threat to nearby towns and villages. Of <b>the</b> <b>threats,</b> the one with the most potential for danger is that of small-volume eruptions, which can destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. Although much of the volcano's glacier mass has retreated, a significant volume of ice still sits atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz‚ÄìTolima massif. Melting just 10 percent of the ice would produce lahars with a volume of up to 200million cubic meterssimilar to the lahar that destroyed Armero in 1985. In just hours, these lahars can travel up to 100km along river valleys.|$|E
40|$|The {{crisis in}} Ukraine, {{which began in}} 2013, has had {{significant}} implications for European security. Cristian Nitoiu identifies three perceived security threats implied by developments in Ukraine and how these threats may develop in future years: <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of so called ‚Äòhybrid warfare‚Äô spilling over from the standoff between Ukraine and Russia; <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> posed by nuclear weapons; and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> posed by more conventional forms of warfare...|$|R
5000|$|The precautionary {{measures}} appropriate {{will depend on}} the combined effect of [...] "the degree of seriousness and irreversibility of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> and <b>the</b> degree of uncertainty‚Ä¶ the more significant and uncertain <b>the</b> <b>threat,</b> <b>the</b> greater‚Ä¶the precaution required". [...] "‚Ä¶measures should be adopted‚Ä¶ proportionate to the potential threats".|$|R
