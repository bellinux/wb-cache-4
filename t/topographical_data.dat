25|$|Research {{published}} in 2009 shows {{a much higher}} density of stream channels than formerly believed. Regions on Mars with the most valleys are comparable to what is found on Earth. The research team developed a computer program to identify valleys by searching in <b>topographical</b> <b>data</b> for U-shaped structures. The large extent of valley networks found strongly supports rain on the planet in the past. The global pattern of the Martian valleys {{could be explained by}} a big northern ocean. A large ocean in the northern hemisphere would explain why there is a southern limit to valley networks: the southernmost regions of Mars, farthest from the water reservoir, would get little rainfall and would develop no valleys. Similarly, the lack of rainfall would explain why Martian valleys become shallower from north to south.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Stepwise linear {{regression}} models were calibrated against the measured mass balance of glaciers in the Austrian Alps for {{the prediction of}} specific annual net balance and summer balance from climatological and <b>topographical</b> input <b>data.</b> For estimation of winter mass balance, a simple ratio {{between the amount of}} winter precipitation and the measured winter balance was used. A ratio with a mean value of 2. 0 and a standard deviation of 0. 44 was derived from the sample of measured winter balances. Climate input data were taken from the HISTALP database which offers a homogenized data source that is outstanding in terms of its spatial and temporal coverage. Data from the Austrian glacier inventory were used as <b>topographical</b> input <b>data.</b> From the group of possible predictors summer air temperature, winter precipitation, summer snow precipitation and continentality (as defined from seasonal temperature variation) were selected as climatological driving forces in addition to lowest glacier elevation and area-weighted mean glacier elevation as topographical driving forces. Summer temperature explains 60 % of the variance of summer mass balance and 39 % of the variance of annual mass balance. Additional factors increase the explained variance by 22 % for summer and 31 % for annual net balance. The calibrated mass-balance model was used to reconstruct the mass balance of Hintereisferner and Vernagtferner back to 1800. Whereas the model performs well for Hintereisferner, it fails for some sub-periods for Vernagtferner due to the complicated flow dynamics of the glacier...|$|R

40|$|Early human {{migration}} is largely determined by geography and human needs. These are both deterministic parameters when small populations move into unoccupied areas where conflicts and large group dynamics are not important. The early period of {{human migration}} into the British Isles provides such a laboratory which, {{because of its}} relative geographical isolation, may allow some insights into the complex dynamics of early human migration and interaction. We developed a simulation code based on human affinity to habitable land, as defined by availability of water sources, altitude, and flatness of land, in choosing the path of migration. Movement {{of people on the}} British island over the prehistoric period from their initial entry points was simulated on the basis of data from the megalithic period. <b>Topographical</b> and hydro-shed <b>data</b> from satellite databases was used to define habitability, based on distance from water bodies, flatness of the terrain, and altitude above sea level. We simulated population movement based on assumptions of affinity for more habitable places, with the rate of movement tempered by existing populations. We compared results of our computer simulations with genetic data and show that our simulation can predict fairly accurately the points of contacts between different migratory paths. Such comparison also provides more detailed information about the path of peoples' movement over ~ 2000 years before the present era. We demonstrate an accurate method to simulate prehistoric movements of people based upon current <b>topographical</b> satellite <b>data.</b> Our findings are validated by recently-available genetic data.

40|$|ABSTRACT In forward {{cantilever}} structures, segments {{are built}} from previous ones, therefore construction loads must be {{carried by the}} partly completed structure. As the cantilever is moved forward deformations increase and corrections must be made during the construction phase. In camber control, corrective displacements are applied to compensate for deformations. The proposed procedure assimilates <b>topographical</b> survey <b>data</b> collected at each construction stage to update the structural model by minimizing the differences between real and computed displacements. Concrete material properties are used as design variables in an optimization process that drives them to values that better represent the material actually used in construction. This is an iterative process where new data are assimilated at each new structural deformed configuration. New camber values are computed and applied to segments that will be cast in the future {{in order to reach}} the desired final design profile. The use of the procedure leads to residual displacements of no greater than 5 % of the total deformation without camber...|$|R

An oddball paradigm was utilized where participants had to detect a laser deviant that appeared in a stream of standard laser stimuli. Participants were instructed to fixate on a central crosshair and to selectively attend to their left or right hand. In the hands-off condition, participants' ERPs waveform and topographical iso-potential map analyses revealed a typical contra-lateral primary visual activation. In the hands-on condition, the visual activation obtained in the hands-off condition shifted significantly toward anterior primary somatosensory areas. Localization techniques such as independent components analysis, dipole fitting, and sLORETA yielded results that were convincingly convergent with the ERP waveform and <b>topographical</b> map <b>data.</b> That is, visual laser stimuli appeared to possess tactile qualities when they were projected onto visible haptic regions of participant observers...|$|R

Flood detention systems combine the use of detention basins, detention dams, and channels in order efficiently collect and regulate the runoff. The detention facilities not only regulate the amount of water that is released, but control the quality of the water that is released. The runoff is monitored in order to prevent harmful contaminates and debris from damaging resources like: lakes, rivers, and wetlands. Flood detention dams are constructed methodically. The watershed <b>topographical</b> <b>data,</b> hydrological records, and geological structure for the area are analyzed {{in order to determine the}} most effective location for the flood detention dam(s). The analyzed watershed <b>topographical</b> <b>data,</b> hydrological records, and geological structure display the potential storage capacity, environmental impacts, and physical limitations of the area. As a result, models can be generated to simulate the effectiveness of possible flood detention dam locations and designs. The general design for a flood detention dam has a cross sectional shape of a trapezoid where the longer of the parallel sides is the base of the dam, and the angled sides face upstream and downstream. The flood detention dam has an opening at the top in order to release the flood water at a controlled rate that the channels below can accommodate. The flood detention dam models can be used to determine the necessary dam height and overflow opening size in order to prevent overtopping.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a {{multichannel}} EEG decomposition model based on an adaptive topographic time-frequency approximation technique.

It takes the physiologically explainable and statistically observable topographic dependencies between the channels into account, namely the spatial smoothness of neighboring electrodes that is implied by the electric leadfield. DMMP decomposes a multichannel signal as a weighted sum of atoms from a given dictionary where the single channels are represented from exactly the same subset of a complete dictionary. The decomposition is illustrated on <b>topographical</b> EEG <b>data</b> during different physiological conditions using a complete Gabor dictionary. Further the extension of the single-channel time-frequency distribution to a multichannel time-frequency distribution is given.
