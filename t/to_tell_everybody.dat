500|$|The {{costumes and}} looks {{for each of}} the {{different}} women were chosen by Spears and Kahn. The scenes in the sauna were suggested by Kahn, {{as a response to the}} attacks Spears received over the years about her weight. He stated, [...] "I knew that the whole world would be watching, so I wanted something in there that stated, 'This is Britney, this is why you should respect her'". The set was cleared for two hours, leaving her and Kahn alone shooting the sequence. Kahn also decided to end the video with an image of Spears smiling, because [...] "We just needed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> she's OK".|$|E
500|$|The episode's cold open {{was filmed}} {{in a water}} tank, using a replica P-51 Mustang plane which had been {{designed}} by the art director. Bowman also needed to direct {{a scene in which}} Gillian Anderson would react to a memory of playing with her sister as a child; the scene involved digitally compositing the children playing into Anderson's footage. Bowman asked Anderson to act towards a tree as though it were her sister, later telling her [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> I can that you just did that great reaction to a tree". Bowman also reshot the episode's ending, as originally Duchovny and Lea were to walk past the camera and continue off-screen. Feeling this was not effective, he replaced this with a walking shot which continued straight towards and into the camera, noting that [...] "Nick will jump in front of a truck if he think it will make a scene better".|$|E
2500|$|Yulia made {{headlines}} in Russia {{with a recent}} interview where she expressed her opinion on Lena's solo career, [...] "She [...] {{has the right to}} do it , but it's so stupid, absolutely stupid. If you do a solo career, it means that you do your own work. Her stuff, that she makes, I think, is silly and very soon her career will wither away and disappear." [...] Lena responded to this interview via her YouTube Page, [...] "I saw Yulia's interview. Of course I got upset. But I want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> that I have a completely opposite attitude towards the whole situation, Yulia's project included. I believe she's a very talented person and I sincerely hope that she'll be successful in all the things she plans." ...|$|E

6000|$|Peterson {{wanted to}} hear all about him; <b>everybody</b> wanted <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him; <b>everybody</b> began. But Billy Stevens, the barkeeper, called the house to order, and said {{one at a time}} was best. He {{distributed}} the drinks, and appointed Ferguson to lead. Ferguson said, ...|$|R
60|$|The saises {{looked at}} each other gravely as they rubbed their ponies' legs. This was the time when long purses began <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> and <b>everybody</b> knew it. Kittiwynk and the others came back, the sweat {{dripping}} over their hooves and their tails telling sad stories.|$|R
2500|$|Brood's outspoken {{statements}} in the press about sex and drug use brought him into the Dutch public arena even more than his music. He was romantically involved with the German singer Nina Hagen, with whom he appeared in the 1979 film Cha-Cha. He is reputed {{to be the subject}} of her song [...] "Herrmann Hiess Er" [...] (English title [...] "Herrmann Was His Name") from the 1979 Unbehagen album, a song about a drug addict. Brood relished the media attention and became the most famous hard drug user in the Netherlands. [...] "It is quite common for an artist to use drugs, but not for him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody.</b> I admit that it scared me that my popularity could make people start using drugs," [...] he once said in an interview.|$|E
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. Well, I {{will tell}} you, if you solemnly promise <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> else.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} no need <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody,</b> and so when he telegraphed the fact to Harvey, he enjoined secrecy. He knew he could trust Harvey.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are no end {{of stories}} about him," [...] Dr. Seventon remarked. [...] "If I were the man I would put a stop <b>to</b> them by <b>telling</b> <b>everybody</b> exactly where I was during those twenty years or so. It is a big slice of one's life to seal up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no. That is <b>to</b> say, <b>everybody</b> <b>tells</b> {{me that it}} {{is really}} broken off, and that he has gone nobody knows where. At any rate he never shows himself. He doesn't mean it, Lady Chiltern." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sami, who {{was forced}} to enter the witness {{protection}} program during her pregnancy, decided to protect her child from the DiMeras by never telling E.J. about their baby. As a result, she left Grace at a convent orphanage. On March 30, 2009, Sami brought Grace home <b>to</b> Salem <b>telling</b> <b>everybody</b> she was her [...] "adopted" [...] daughter. The same day she made Rafe, her former bodyguard turned boyfriend, Grace's godfather. The baby was christened Grace Rafaela; Grace {{in honor of the}} convent and what Sami perceived as God's intervention in helping her to have and keep her baby, and Rafaela in honor of Rafe.|$|R

60|$|He became {{suddenly}} {{very anxious}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> at the Emporium, absolutely everybody, all about it. That was what wanted doing. He felt that telling {{was the thing}} to make this business real. He gripped his umbrella about the middle and walked very eagerly.|$|E
6000|$|Every {{one knew}} {{everybody}} else, and took Carl aside <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him that <b>everybody</b> was [...] "the most conscientious man in our office, Ericson; why, the Boss would trust him with anything." [...] It saddened Carl {{to hear the}} insurance adjuster boom, [...] "Oh you Tottykins!" [...] across the room, at ten-minute intervals, like a human fog-horn on the sea of ennui.|$|R
40|$|Thank you, thank you, thank you……. This is {{probably}} the section I have {{been looking forward to}} writing the most. When progression was slow and painful I looked forward <b>to</b> <b>telling</b> <b>everybody</b> who read this thesis (and I imagined there being many of them) that it came from my own sweat and tears, maybe even blood – without much help from anyone else. When progression picked up, usually always after conversations with bright-headed fellow students and/or department staff, I wanted to write this thank you to warm the hearts {{of all the people who}} indulged in my mood swings and I-can-never-do-this-depressions, and repeatedly showed me the way to renewed effort. Among these are not only fellow anthropologists, but also the people who have always been there, loving and supporting me, much more in spite of than because of. This is going to be the page where I try to partly make up for 28 years of pig-headedness and more-thanoccasional ego-centrism, and where I try to find the words that will let them all know what I have come to learn a long time ago: That this could not have been done without them. I want to start with the latter category. My family. Thank you to my mother and father for their endless love and support – and confidence. My only complaint is that facing the rea...|$|R
60|$|The {{effects of}} the hardships were {{beginning}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> on <b>everybody.</b> The boys were thin and hollow-eyed, and when they walked, or, rather, toiled along, their legs felt like lead. To get up any speed was impossible, and if in ten hours' walking they managed to cover fifteen or twenty miles {{they thought they were}} doing well. The glare on the ice and snow also affected them, so that their eyes appeared like little slits. Professor Jeffer had been in danger of having his nose frost-bitten, but the boys had noticed it just in time, and come to the old scientist's rescue by rubbing the member with soft snow, thus putting the blood again in circulation.|$|R
60|$|Boomer {{promised that}} he would, and off he started. He found Peter and told him. Of course Peter {{was very much}} {{surprised}} and, because he cannot keep his tongue still, he started off at once <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> he could find, just as Blacky the Crow had thought he would do.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{soon have}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> {{everything}} about it," [...] replied Fisher, [...] "but I've {{no objection to}} telling you something first. But, to begin with, {{will you tell me}} something? What really happened when you met Bulmer this morning? You did throw away your sword, but you didn't kill him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{laughed at}} me. He manages people till {{he thinks that}} {{everybody}} must do exactly what he tells them. He may kill me, but I will not do it. I have quite made up my mind. Felix, if you will be true to me, nothing shall separate us. I will not be ashamed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> that I love you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Of course Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, who, {{because they}} can fly, {{have nothing to fear}} from Buster, and who always delight in making other people uncomfortable, never let a chance go by <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Buster and <b>everybody</b> else within hearing what they thought of him. They delighted in flying about through the Green Forest until they had found Buster Bear and then from the safety of the tree tops {{screaming}} at him.|$|R
5000|$|Ieyasu left {{in place}} the {{majority}} of Hideyoshi's decrees and built his shogunate upon them. This ensured that Hideyoshi's cultural legacy remained. In {{a letter to his}} wife, Hideyoshi wrote: I mean to do glorious deeds and I am ready for a long siege, with provisions and gold and silver in plenty, so as to return in triumph and leave a great name behind me. I desire you to understand this and <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it <b>to</b> <b>everybody.</b>|$|R

But she answered, meekly enough: [...] "I knew you were disappointed in me, and I did not wonder for I am not good for much, thanks to my foolish education and the life I have led these last few years. But I do sincerely wish {{to be more of}} a woman, only I have no one <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me how. <b>Everybody</b> flatters me and"-- ...|$|R
60|$|Grandfather Frog didn't answer. He kept {{right on}} {{watching}} his toes. Mr. Redwing flew away <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> he met how Grandfather Frog had become foolish and was watching his toes. The sun shone down warm and bright, and pretty soon Grandfather Frog's big goggly eyes began to blink. Then his head began to nod, and then--why, then Grandfather Frog fell fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Fancy {{asking a}} woman to be reasonable! Don't you realise, you stupid man, {{that if you were}} at liberty <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> what it is that you do there, well, then I should have no more {{interest}} in it? It is just because you say that you will not and you may not tell, that, womanlike, I am curious." ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{course he}} knew that Johnny had hidden his new house {{in the corner of}} Farmer Brown's old orchard because he wanted it to be a secret. He didn't know why Johnny wanted it a secret and he didn't care. If Johnny wanted it a secret, it would be fun <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> about it. As he sat {{wondering}} who he should tell first; he saw Reddy Fox trotting down the Lone Little Path.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{you don't}} {{understand}} HER!" [...] retorted Susy sharply. [...] "Look here, Clarence Brant, you're right; I didn't ask you here <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you--what you and everybody knows--that {{your wife is}} a Southerner. I didn't ask you here <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you what <b>everybody</b> suspects--that she turns you round her little finger. But I did ask you here <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you what nobody, not even you, suspects--but what I know!--and that is that she's a TRAITOR--and more, a SPY!--and that I've only got to say the word, or send that man Jim to say the word, to have her dragged out of her Copperhead den at Robles Ranche and shut up in Fort Alcatraz this very night!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{skateboard}} deck brand {{signed a}} distribution deal with Blitz Distribution, the company that, at the time, was distributing Birdhouse and other brands, such as Fury and Hook-Ups (Blitz {{had originally been}} formed by Per Welinder and Hawk to distribute their own products). As of 2008, the brand was the top-selling brand under the Blitz Distribution umbrella. Reynolds has publicly disclosed {{that all of the}} Baker team members, including himself, receive the same amount of remuneration: [...] "I get paid the same as Braydon. Dustin tried to ask for more money one time…I had <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him, like, <b>everybody</b> gets paid the same…There’s no favoritism." ...|$|R
60|$|Father {{was rather}} conscience-stricken {{when he saw}} how the town {{accepted}} his pretense of being an explorer, but when he tried <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth <b>everybody</b> {{thought that he was}} merely being modest, and he finally settled down contentedly to being a hero, to the great satisfaction of all the town, which pointed out to unfortunate citizens of Freiburg and Hongkong and Bryan and other rival villages that none of them had a real up-to-date hero with all modern geographical improvements. In time, as his partner, the shoeman, had predicted, Father was elected president of the clubless country club, and organized a cross-country hike in which he outdistanced all the others, including the young and boastful Buck Simpson.|$|R

Why was I <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> where they were? Of course I was foolish, and now they are lost. It is I that have suffered. Major Mackintosh quite understands that, and says that nobody can do {{anything}} to me;--only I must go to Mr. Camperdown." ...|$|E
60|$|After he {{has given}} one of his great heavy dinners he always takes an {{opportunity}} to tell you, in the most public way, how many bottles of wine were drunk. His pleasure is to make his guests tipsy, and <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>everybody</b> how and when the period of inebriation arose. And Miss Clapperclaw {{tells me that he}} often comes over laughing and giggling to her, and pretending that he has brought ME into this condition--a calumny which I fling contemptuously in his face.|$|E
