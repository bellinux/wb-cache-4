This experimental report shows the effect of the circumferential oil groove and holes into the inner oil film and the slope of the bush inner side end, which are not considered in the theoretical model, on the bush rotational speed and the high-speed stability.

Three tests were performed with expander pressure ratios of 2. 4 – 3. 5, 3. 0 – 4. 6, and 3. 3 – 6. 1, which cover the over-expansion and under-expansion operating modes. The test results show a maximum expander isentropic efficiency of 72. 4 % and a relative cycle efficiency of 10. 5 % at an evaporation temperature of 101 °C and condensation temperature of 45 °C. At a given pressure ratio over the expander, a higher <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> to <b>the</b> expander causes a higher expander isentropic efficiency and higher cycle efficiency in the over-expansion mode.

The results also show that under the condition of operation at a given pressure ratio, a higher <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> yields a larger power output owing to the increased mass flow rate at <b>the</b> higher <b>supply</b> <b>pressure.</b> <b>The</b> study results demonstrate that a screw-expander ORC can be operated {{with a wide range of}} heat sources and heat sinks with satisfactory cycle efficiency...|$|R

50|$|The outlet {{pressure}} and the inlet pressure hold the diaphragm/poppet assembly in the closed position against {{the force of the}} large spring. If <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> falls, {{it is as if the}} large spring compression is increased allowing more gas and higher pressure to build in the outlet chamber until an equilibrium pressure is reached. Thus, if <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> falls, the {{outlet pressure}} will increase, provided the outlet pressure remains below the falling supply pressure. This is the cause of end-of-tank dump where the supply is provided by a pressurized gas tank. With a single stage regulator, when the supply tank gets low, the lower inlet pressure causes the outlet pressure to climb. If the spring compression is not adjusted to compensate, the poppet can remain open and allow the tank to rapidly dump its remaining contents. In other words, the lower <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressure,</b> the lower the pressure differential the regulator can achieve for a given spring setting.|$|E

50|$|Two stage {{regulators}} are two single stage regulators in one that operate {{to reduce the}} pressure progressively in two stages instead of one. The first stage, which is preset, reduces {{the pressure of the}} supply gas to an intermediate stage; gas at that pressure passes into the second stage. The gas now emerges at a pressure (working pressure) set by the pressure adjusting control knob attached to the diaphragm. Two stage regulators have two safety valves, so that if there is any excess pressure there will be no explosion. A major objection to the single stage regulator is the need for frequent torque adjustment. If <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> falls, the outlet pressure increases, necessitating torque adjustment. In the two stage regulator, there is automatic compensation for any drop in <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressure.</b> Single stage regulators may be used with pipe lines and cylinders.

5000|$|Air (or other gas) {{pressure}} {{is the power}} source for pneumatic valve actuators. They are used on linear or quarter-turn valves.

Numerical and experimental results showed that the above-mentioned wave bearing with a wave amplitude ratio of 0. 305 operates stably at rotational speeds up to 60, 000 rpm, regardless of <b>the</b> oil <b>supply</b> <b>pressure.</b> For smaller wave amplitude ratios, a threshold of stability was found. It was observed that the threshold of stability for lower wave amplitude strongly depends on <b>the</b> oil <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> and on <b>the</b> wave amplitude.

50|$|Water and gas taps have {{adjustable}} flow: {{gate valves}} are more progressive; ball valves more coarse, typically used in on-off applications. Turning a valve knob or lever sets adjusts flow by varying the aperture {{of the control}} device in the valve assembly. The result when opened in any degree is a choked flow. Its rate is independent of the viscosity or temperature of the fluid or gas in the pipe, and depends only weakly on <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>pressure,</b> so that flow rate is stable at a given setting. At intermediate flow settings the pressure at the valve restriction drops nearly to zero from the Venturi effect; in water taps, this causes the water to boil momentarily at room temperature as it passes through the restriction. Bubbles of cool water vapor form and collapse at the restriction, causing the familiar hissing sound. At very low flow settings, the viscosity of the water becomes important and the pressure drop (and hissing noise) vanish; at full flow settings, parasitic drag in the pipes becomes important and the water again becomes quiet.|$|E
