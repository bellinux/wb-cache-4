Moreover, as I shall argue, to understand Aristotle‟s finitism, it is central to understand not only what kinds of infinity he rejects but also on what grounds he rejects them, for that will allow us to recognize some subtleties of Aristotle‟s account that would otherwise remain unnoticed. In this paper, I attempt to give a systematic account of Aristotle‟s notion of the potentially infinite by closely scrutinizing Physics III 6. In part 1, I discuss Aristotle‟s argument that the infinite exist only potentially. In part 2, I argue that the distinction between infinite processes and the products of these processes is also relevant for understanding Aristotle‟s views on the existence of the infinite. 1. Existence and non-existence of the infinite After arguing in Physics III 5 that there cannot exist an infinitely extended body, Aristotle notes that we cannot deny the infinite any existence at all, for that would lead to some impossible consequences, namely “there will be a beginning and an end of time, a magnitude will not be divisible into magnitudes, number will not be infinite ” (Phys. III 6, 206 a 10 - 12). It is important <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> attention <b>to</b> this <b>stretch</b> of text, for it gives us a clue about what Aristotle is taking fo...|$|R

Due to lower formability of this material in age-hardened (T 6) condition, forming of complex-shaped components is a major challenge. Forming behavior of the sheet was studied in T 6 condition using limit dome height tests by experiment and finite element method for three different sheet directions (rolling direction, inclined direction (ID) and transverse direction). Strain path diagrams {{were obtained from the}} experimental limit dome height tests and finite element method simulations from <b>drawing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stretching</b> region, and the results were compared for all the sheet directions. Forming limit diagrams were plotted using strain localization and fracture criteria from experimental and simulated strain path curves. Effect of plastic anisotropy on crack propagation direction was studied using finite element method, and it has been found that the direction of crack propagation was strongly dependent on plastic anisotropy ratio ("r" value) of the sheet in biaxial strain paths...|$|R
