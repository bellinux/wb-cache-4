On the ramparts above the wreck strewn harbour, on the Barracca, St Angelo and Senglea, great crowds of Maltese {{men and women}} waved and cheered and a brass band {{on the end of}} the mole was giving a {{spirited}} rendition of Rule Britannia. Captain Mason, however, standing at the salute on the battered bridge of Ohio, could spare not a moment's thought for the pride of bringing the ship to harbour, since <b>the</b> <b>creaking</b> plates showed that Ohio might still go to the bottom of the Grand Harbour.|$|E
500|$|In February 1934, British fascist William Joyce (Lord Haw Haw) visited Oxford. [...] Lewis {{and future}} Ontario CCF leader Ted Jolliffe {{organized}} a noisy protest by planting Labour Club {{members in the}} dance hall where Joyce was speaking and having groups of two and three of them leave at a time, making much noise on <b>the</b> <b>creaking</b> wooden floors. [...] They were successful in drowning out Joyce, {{and he did not}} complete his speech. Afterwards, a street fight erupted between Joyce's Blackshirt supporters and members of the Labour Club, including Lewis.|$|E
500|$|Douglas became {{involved}} with the Miami Theater, and wrote some one-act plays that were fashionable in the 1930s. One, entitled [...] "The Gallows Gate", was about an argument between a mother and father regarding the character of their son who is sentenced to hang. She got the idea from her father, who had witnessed hangings when {{he lived in the}} West and was unnerved by <b>the</b> <b>creaking</b> sound of the rope bearing the weight of the hanging body. The play won a state competition, and eventually $500 in a national competition after it was written into three acts. With William W. Muir, husband of reporter Helen Muir, she authored a play called [...] "Storm Warnings" [...] loosely based on the life of mobster Al Capone. Some of Capone’s henchmen showed up at the theater, “add an extra tingle for the audience that night”, though no actual problems arose. Douglas wrote the foreword to the Work Projects Administration's guide to Miami and environs, published in 1941 as part of the Federal Writers' Project's American Guide Series.|$|E

500|$|His {{family had}} lived in Ontario for generations. His parents, the Reverend Charles and Gertrude Jolliffe, were missionaries for the Methodist Church of Canada, and were living near what was then known as Luchow, China. He was born at the Canadian Missionary {{hospital}} in Luchow, near Chunking on March 2, 1909. He was home-schooled in China by his mother until his early teens. When his family returned to Ontario, he attend Rockwood Public School {{and then went to}} high school at Guelph Collegiate Institute. He was an undergraduate at the University of Toronto's Victoria College, the United Church College. He became the head of the Victoria Student Council, and {{was a member of the}} Hart House Debates Committee. In 1930, he won the Maurice Cody scholarship, and then became one of Ontario's Rhodes Scholars that same year. He attended Oxford University for three years, and was affiliated with its Christ Church College. As a member of Oxford's Labour Club, he met David Lewis, the club's leader and a fellow Canadian. [...] Together they fought the Communist Red October club and fascists such as Lord Haw-Haw–William Joyce. Both he and Lewis planned [...] a 'silent' protest at Joyce's February 1934 speech at Oxford. [...] They carefully made sure that enough members from the Labour Club attended the meeting, and then in groups of two or three, strategically walked out of the speech, across <b>the</b> <b>creaking</b> wooden floors, effectively blotting out Joyce's speech. [...] The Blackshirts in the audience then caused riots in the street after the meeting and Jolliffe and Lewis were in the thick of it.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} criticized for its {{graphics}} and engine, which reviewers considered to be outdated. G4 called the engine [...] "old" [...] and [...] "clunky", and PC Format said that [...] "the whole thing is limited by <b>the</b> <b>creaking</b> engine." [...] However, certain sources praised the engine. Game Informer called it [...] "the best role-playing engine that has ever been invented," [...] and GameSpot said that [...] "'immortal' {{may be a better}} word to describe the engine, because the fact is, Icewind Dale II plays great." [...] In regards to the graphics, GameSpot said that [...] "in many ways Icewind Dale II represents the best use of the Infinity Engine's prerendered, isometric settings to date, [...] that doesn't change the fact that Icewind Dale II generally looks dated." [...] IGN thought the sprites had become out-dated, and that [...] "the animations are crude by today's standards." [...] New Straits Times agreed, saying that although some of the effects were attractive, the [...] "dated Infinity engine" [...] could not compare to contemporaries Dungeon Siege and Neverwinter Nights. However, Computer Gaming World believed that [...] "it consistently offers the same striking and imaginative environments that establish the tone and immersive charm of the game," [...] and Computer Games Magazine said, [...] "it may not look like much, but it's got it where it counts." [...] The game's pre-rendered backgrounds received praise. IGN said that [...] "the artwork is attractive, both conceptually and in its final form," [...] and Game Informer called them [...] "beautiful". Many reviewers complained about the game's pathfinding AI, which PC Zone called [...] "outrageously bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} the Conservative Party in reorganising itself was {{validated}} by its victory at the 1951 general election. Winston Churchill, the party leader, brought in a Party Chairman to modernise <b>the</b> <b>creaking</b> institution. Lord Woolton was a successful department store owner and wartime Minister of Food. As Party Chairman 1946–55, he rebuilt the local organisations {{with an emphasis on}} membership, money, and a unified national propaganda appeal on critical issues. To broaden the base of potential candidates, the national party provided financial aid to candidates, and assisted the local organisations in raising local money. Lord Woolton emphasised a rhetoric that characterised the opponents as [...] "Socialist" [...] rather than [...] "Labour". The libertarian influence of Professor Friedrich Hayek's 1944 best-seller Road to Serfdom was apparent in the younger generation, but that took another quarter century to have a policy impact. By 1951, Labour had worn out its welcome in the middle classes; its factions were bitterly embroiled. Conservatives were ready to govern again.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{children}} finally see {{the full extent}} of the city from the balcony of the royal palace, it extends as far as the eye can see in any direction, as if covering the entire world. It is described as being full of pyramids, bridges, palaces and towers with a great river having once run through it that has since turned to dust. [...] Jadis describes viewing the city while it was full of life, quoting, [...] "It is silent now. But I have stood here when the whole air was full of the noises of Charn; the trampling of feet, <b>the</b> <b>creaking</b> of wheels, the cracking of the whips and the groaning of slaves, the thunder of chariots, and the sacrificial drums beating in the temples. I have stood here (but that was near the end) when the roar of battle went up from every street and the river of Charn ran red." ...|$|E
2500|$|SCDS-related autophony differs {{greatly in}} quality and {{range from the}} more common form which results from an open, or patulous Eustachian tube through which sufferers of this {{disorder}} {{hear the sound of}} their own voice and breathing. In contrast, patients with SCDS-related autophony report hearing their own voice as a disturbingly loud and distorted [...] "kazoo-like" [...] sound deep inside the head as if relayed through [...] "a cracked loudspeaker." [...] Additionally they may hear <b>the</b> <b>creaking</b> and cracking of joints, the sound of their footsteps when walking or running, their heartbeat and the sound of chewing and other digestive noises. Some sufferers of this condition experience such a high level of conductive hyperacusis that a tuning fork placed on the ankle will be heard in the affected ear. The bizarre phenomenon of being able to hear the sound of the eyeballs moving in their sockets (e.g. when reading in a quiet room) [...] "like sandpaper on wood" [...] {{is one of the more}} distinctive features of this condition and is almost exclusively associated with SCDS.|$|E
