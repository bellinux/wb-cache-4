40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the effects of a quit smoking program using the Web and short message service on exhaled carbon monoxide, self-efficacy, and {{depression}} according to nicotine dependency level in undergraduate students. Methods: In this study a non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest design was applied. The participants included 90 students (52 in <b>the</b> low <b>nicotine</b> dependency group and 38 in <b>the</b> high <b>nicotine</b> dependency group) who succeeded in quitting smoking. Data were collected on 3 occasions, that is, before the program, immediately after the program, and 3 weeks after the program. Collected data were ana-lyzed using independent t-test, repeated measure ANOVA, and paired t-test with SPSS 20. 0. Results: Exhaled carbon monoxide was higher in <b>the</b> high <b>nicotine</b> dependency group than in <b>the</b> low <b>nicotine</b> dependency group. Self-efficacy significantly increased 3 weeks after the program in <b>the</b> low <b>nicotine</b> dependency group and significantly increased immediately after the program in <b>the</b> high <b>nicotine</b> dependency group.

40|$|A long-standing {{relationship}} between nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and cognition exists. Drugs that act at nAChRs can have cognitive-enhancing effects and diseases that disrupt cognition such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia {{are associated with}} altered nAChR function. Specifically, hippocampus-dependent learning is particularly sensitive to <b>the</b> effects of <b>nicotine.</b> However, <b>the</b> effects of <b>nicotine</b> on hippocampus-dependent learning vary not only with <b>the</b> doses of <b>nicotine</b> used and whether nicotine is administered acutely, chronically, or withdrawn after chronic nicotine treatment but also vary across different hippocampus-dependent tasks such as the Morris water maze, the radial arm maze, and contextual fear conditioning.

25|$|When {{tobacco is}} smoked, most of <b>the</b> <b>nicotine</b> is pyrolyzed. However, a dose {{sufficient}} to cause mild somatic dependency and mild to strong psychological dependency remains.

Using rat studies, withdrawal after repeated exposure to nicotine results in less responsive nucleus accumbens cells, which produce dopamine responsible for reinforcement.|$|E

25|$|Although {{nicotine}} does {{play a role}} {{in acute}} episodes of some diseases (including stroke, impotence, and heart disease) by its stimulation of adrenaline release, which raises blood pressure, heart and respiration rate, and free fatty acids, the most serious longer term effects are more the result of the products of the smouldering combustion process.

25|$|Nicotine, {{which is}} {{contained}} in cigarettes and other smoked tobacco products, is a stimulant {{and is one of}} the main factors leading to continued tobacco smoking. Nicotine is a highly addictive psychoactive chemical. When tobacco is smoked, most of <b>the</b> <b>nicotine</b> is pyrolyzed; a dose sufficient to cause mild somatic dependency and mild to strong psychological dependency remains. The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking depends on many factors, including the type of tobacco, whether the smoke is inhaled, and whether a filter is used. There is also a formation of harmane (a MAO inhibitor) from the acetaldehyde in cigarette smoke, which seems to play an important role in nicotine addiction probably by facilitating dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in response to nicotine stimuli. According to studies by Henningfield and Benowitz, nicotine is more addictive than cannabis, caffeine, ethanol, cocaine, and heroin when considering both somatic and psychological dependence. However, due to the stronger withdrawal effects of ethanol, cocaine and heroin, nicotine may have a lower potential for somatic dependence than these substances. About half of Canadians who currently smoke have tried to quit. McGill University health professor Jennifer O'Loughlin stated that nicotine addiction can occur as soon as five months after the start of smoking.|$|E

After Tritter causes House to trip, the doctor feigns acquiescence, but insists he has to take Tritter's temperature rectally. After inserting the thermometer, House leaves the room, with no intention of returning. Tritter later complains about his treatment to House's boss, Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), saying that he would rather [...] "beat the crap out of" [...] House than sue him; however, House refuses to apologize.
