5|$|Corzine {{has been}} <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>New</b> Jersey {{governor}} {{in recent memory}} to make any headway in addressing the crisis of municipal funding. While not directly touching the third rail of New Jersey governance – property taxes – Corzine's reform of the school funding formula (passed and signed in January 2008) resulted in significant relief to many New Jersey towns with outsize school costs but limited tax base. The plan survived a legal challenge and was declared constitutional by the New Jersey Supreme Court on May 28, 2009.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>new</b> poetry Riley {{published}} {{after the}} end of the century were elegies for famous friends. The poetic qualities of the poems were often poor, but they contained many popular sentiments concerning the deceased. Among those he eulogized were Benjamin Harrison, Lew Wallace, and Henry Lawton. Because of the poor quality of the poems, his friends and publishers requested that he stop writing them, but he refused.|$|E
5|$|Although a new {{station at}} 10th Avenue and 41st Street {{was part of}} the {{original}} plan, the intermediate station was eliminated in October 2007 due to cost overruns, leaving the terminal station at Eleventh Avenue and 34th Street as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>new</b> station on the extension. The MTA indicated that the 10th Avenue station could be included in the project if funding were found. The station {{was not included in the}} original (2007) contract award, but was listed as a $450 million option. In late December 2007, reports indicated that the postponed station might be partially built if the City of New York and the MTA agreed on the additional financing for the station shell. In February 2009, the MTA announced that it would build the station if the agency received sufficient funds from the federal economic stimulus package. In June 2010, the city announced it was seeking funding to assess the feasibility of constructing the station at a later date using a two-platform, two-entrance model without an underground connecting passage.|$|E

5|$|Anjaana Anjaani {{film was}} {{initially}} slated to release on 24 September 2010. It was postponed by one week, {{just four days}} before the expected date because this would coincide with the controversial Ayodhya dispute verdict, which many anticipated would be disputed and cause chaos in the country. Trade experts were against postponing the film, and questioned Nadiadwala's decision, as the government had already taken precautionary measures with the Commonwealth Games around the corner. They also felt that the postponement would send mixed signals and confuse viewers as the promotional campaign centred around the 25 September release. Additionally, the film would lose the advantage of being <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>new</b> release. Changing the release date would mean Anjaana Anjaani would clash with the science fiction film Enthiran, which might affect the film's box-office performance. Still, the film was postponed to 1 October 2010. Later, the Ayodhya verdict was itself postponed to three days before the film's new release date. Industry insiders started speculating again about the film's release being postponed by another week, causing rumours to spread in the media. However, Sajid Nadiadwla confirmed that the news was false and the film was releasing on 1 October 2010.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Convention, Hamilton {{was still}} not content with the final Constitution, but signed it anyway as a vast {{improvement}} over the Articles of Confederation, and urged his fellow delegates to do so also. Since the other two members of the New York delegation, Lansing and Yates, had already withdrawn, Hamilton was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>New</b> York signer to the United States Constitution. He then took a highly active part in the successful campaign for the document's ratification in New York in 1788, which was a crucial step in its national ratification. He first used the popularity of the Constitution by the masses to compel George Clinton to sign, but was unsuccessful. The state convention in Poughkeepsie in June 1788 pitted Hamilton, Jay, James Duane, Robert Livingston, and Richard Morris against the Clintonian faction led by Melancton Smith, Lansing, Yates, and Gilbert Livingston.|$|E
5|$|Back in New Zealand, Lynch {{did well}} in the premier women's road stage race in 1991 and 1992, and won bronze in the 1991 New Zealand National Road Race Championships, yet was not picked for the 1992 Olympic road cycling team. Her biographer speculates that the {{selectors}} were possibly influenced in their decision by Lynch's failure to get Harris into a medal position at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. She competed hard in the 1992 Tour Cycliste Féminin – the Tour de France for women. The ten-stage race was the most challenging event on the women's road racing calendar that year, and many big names entered. New Zealand had six competitors. Lynch {{set the tone for}} the team by coming fourth in the prologue in Paris. Jacqui Nelson and Lynch were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>New</b> Zealanders remaining in the final stage, and Lynch came sixth ascending into Alpe d'Huez. Her biographer suggests that she made her point that her omission from the 1992 Olympic team had been a mistake.|$|E

5|$|Before {{releasing}} {{their first}} album with Sire, Uncle Tupelo needed a drummer. Farrar and Tweedy interviewed twenty-four candidates and were both impressed with Ken Coomer and Bill Belzer. Belzer was chosen and Uncle Tupelo embarked on the European {{segment of the}} promotional tour for March 16–20, 1992 as the opening act for Sugar. Belzer was dismissed from the band after six months, and Coomer was hired as his permanent replacement. Coomer was not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>new</b> member added after the tour—Uncle Tupelo sought to expand beyond a trio for the Anodyne recording sessions. They recruited multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston and bassist John Stirratt—Stirratt's presence enabled Tweedy to become a full-time guitarist on the songs that he wrote.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, Prison Break was {{broadcast}} on Global one hour before it aired on Fox, {{except in the}} Maritimes where it aired two hours before Fox's airing. Prison Break was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>new</b> television series to be positioned in the top twenty television shows of 2005–2006 in Canada, achieving an average of 876,000 viewers in the key demographic of 18–49 and 1.4 million viewers nationally for its first season. Prison Break premiered on Australian television network Seven on February 1, 2006, to an average audience of 1.94 million. The first season attracted an overall average of 1.353 million viewers. After decreasing ratings throughout the second season, Seven decided to fast-track the airing of the third-season episodes. The fifth season revival moved to Network Ten and will debut on May 15, 2017.|$|E
5|$|In early 1972, Amtrak {{considered}} {{converting the}} Metroliners to locomotive-hauled operation; however, with the cars <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>new</b> rolling stock in Amtrak's possession, {{it was decided}} to continue efforts to increase their operating reliability instead. In February, one GE-powered car was shipped to Erie, Pennsylvania for the DOT-funded rebuild program, with hopes to modify all cars by 1976. It was followed by a Westinghouse-powered car in March. In late April, Amtrak accepted six of the leased cars for revenue service, which permitted an increase to 14 round trips on May 1. An additional pair of cars were sent for rebuild later in the year.|$|E

5|$|The fourth edition, {{published}} in 1769, {{is the first}} complete edition in one volume and had hard covers. He added footnotes to make certain issues clearer. In this edition he also added several of his own philosophical essays and completed the volume with an index. The fourth edition was a book volume with hard covers that {{increased the number of}} pages from 154 to 496. Franklin added papers on his lightning rod invention, meteorological observations, human nature, worldwide population increase, waterspouts, experiments on amber, and information on his Pennsylvania fireplace invention. This edition had copper plate illustrations of his lightning rod design, new fireplace, and electrical experiments. The fifth English edition was {{published in}} 1774. There was little difference between the fourth edition and the fifth edition. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>new</b> document added in the fifth edition, that was not in the fourth edition, was the French experiment with lightning done in 1752. There was an advertisement in the Public Advertiser London newspaper of September 9, 1774, that promoted the fifth edition.|$|E
5|$|The state's five public {{universities}} are {{administered by the}} University System of New Hampshire, {{which is the largest}} provider of postsecondary education in the state.

5|$|This revised {{proposal}} was continued in a further white paper in March 1970, although this {{proposed that the}} counties be unitary authorities which would have no district councils below them. The incoming Conservative government resurrected two-tier local government in a consultative document published in February 1971, again with the same upper-tier boundaries. Some minor changes having been made to the existing county boundaries due to special local factors, the Local Government Act 1972 duly created Clwyd as a merger of Flintshire with most of Denbighshire, along with the Edeyrnion Rural District from Merionethshire. The 1970 white paper had introduced the name of Clwyd by reference to the River Clwyd and the Clwydian range of hills; Clwyd was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>new</b> Welsh county which did not take its name from an ancient kingdom.|$|E

5|$|In July 1945, Gibbes was {{assigned}} to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne. Following his discharge from the Air Force on 11January 1946, he was initially employed as a stock and station agent in Coonamble, New South Wales. He flew a Butler Bat twin-engined aircraft to facilitate his work, reportedly <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>New</b> South Welshman in his profession to do so at the time. Gibbes spent much of the next 30 years in New Guinea, pioneering the island's transport, coffee and hospitality industries. In January 1948, he formed Gibbes Sepik Airways using, among other types, three German Junkers Ju52s, one of which was said to have been the personal transport of senior Luftwaffe commander Albert Kesselring. He was joined briefly in this venture, headquartered at Wewak, by Nicky Barr. Gibbes also established a tea and coffee plantation at Mount Hagen, New Guinea, in 1950, and served {{as a member of the}} RAAF Active Reserve, based in Townsville, Queensland, from 1952 until 1957. In 1958, he sold his share in Gibbes Sepik Airways to Mandated Airlines, which was later bought out by Ansett Australia. He continued to develop coffee plantations in New Guinea, and built a large chain of hotels beginning with the Bird of Paradise in Goroka.|$|E
