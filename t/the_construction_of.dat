This communications boom led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers would soon be built all over Tokyo, eventually overrunning the city.

Furthermore, because of the country's postwar boom in the 1950s, Japan was searching for a monument to symbolize its ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse.|$|E

Two years later, planning began for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the Otay Mesa crossing and <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> SR75 to connect it to I-5 and I-805. Later, the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO), the local association of municipal governments, recommended using $4million of federal funding for <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> SR75. The CPO later endorsed expediting construction of the freeway before completion of the border crossing, so that the freeway would primarily serve border traffic, thus preventing land speculation in Otay Mesa. While Mexican authorities wanted the crossing constructed in 1975, the CPO indicated that the funding for SR75 would not be available until at least 1980, or even 1985. Following this, Representative Lionel Van Deerlin attempted to accelerate <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the crossing, {{even though there was}} no funding for the highway.|$|E
