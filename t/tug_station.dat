Until June 1945 Pinto engaged in towing and salvage operations off New Guinea, the Admiralties, the Philippines and Morotai. On 4 June, Pinto departed Morotai as part of task group TG 76.20 for the amphibious assault on Brunei Bay, British North Borneo. She remained as salvage <b>tug</b> on <b>station</b> in Victoria Harbour until 2 July {{when she returned to}} the Philippine Islands for towing assignments.

50|$|Aimwell {{was laid}} down on 15 November 1941 at the Defoe Shipbuilding Company in Bay City, Michigan as BAT-7. She was {{delivered}} to the United States Navy and {{was transferred to the}} Royal Navy under the Lend-Lease Act on 6 June 1942. HMRT Aimwell was visited by Franklin D. Roosevelt on 26 January 1943, when Roosevelt was returning from the Casablanca Conference. The <b>tug</b> was <b>stationed</b> with West Africa Command between 1942 and 1943. She returned to American custody postwar on 30 March 1946. BAT-7 was struck on 1 May 1946 and sold to Moller on 6 January 1948. Renamed Patricia Moller, she was again renamed Golden Cape in 1952 and finally sold in 1971 to the Luzon Stevedoring Corporation. She was renamed Hawkeye and was mined and sunk in the Mekong on 3 February 1975.|$|R
50|$|In 1871 she {{was placed}} in service at the Norfolk Navy Yard. After repairs at Philadelphia in late 1878 and 1879, the tug served briefly at Newport, Rhode Island, before moving to Annapolis for service as a {{practice}} ship at the United States Naval Academy. Except for occasional visits to navy yards for repairs, she remained at the Naval Academy serving as a <b>station</b> <b>tug</b> when not on duty as a practice ship - through World War I. She was sold on 5 August 1921 to B. Wever & Sons, Baltimore, Maryland.|$|R
50|$|The {{segments}} {{featuring the}} tugboats in the harbour used footage from the British television series TUGS, a series produced in 1988 by Robert D. Cardona and David Mitton, who (along with Britt Allcroft) produced the popular series Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends. Whilst Allcroft drove the Thomas series to popularity among American audiences (through the PBS series Shining Time <b>Station),</b> <b>Tugs</b> did not spread far beyond its country of origin, lasting one season of 13 episodes (although it was aired and merchandised in the Japanese and Australian markets).|$|R
40|$|New {{missions}} of exploration and space operations envision architectures {{that are based}} on powerful new inspace transportation systems. Such missions as the development of human-tended operations nodes at the L 1 or L 2 Lagrange points, very large telescope assemblies, and planetary missions developed and operated from such points, will all require highly capable space transportation systems to transfer cargo and humans crews from low Earth orbit (LEO) to these locations. Such missions could involve a complex transportation infrastructure, containing a few elements or many “independent agents”, i. e., space <b>tugs,</b> refueling <b>stations,</b> and an overall control and communication system. New information technologies, which take advantage of knowledge-based software, model-based reasoning, and high performance computer systems, will enable the development of new generations of planner/schedulers, and autonomous control systems with diagnosis and recovery capabilities. Integrated system health management (ISHM) frameworks use these technologies to increase the reliability and robustness of vehicles. This paper will describe design considerations for implementing the ISHM concept on reusable, in-space transportation systems. Topics to be presented will include a mission description and needs assessment, brief description of key ISHM concepts, potential architectures for ISHM as applied to in-space transportation systems, and how ISHM concepts will be implemented for the system-ofsystems of “independent agents ” mentioned above...|$|R
50|$|Airlifts from Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Air Base {{unloaded}} at Andersen Air Force Base. Passengers were {{escorted to}} Tent City, where tents erected {{just hours before}} awaited them. Those who fled Vietnam by sea landed at the Naval Supply Station at Apra Harbor. First responders included personnel from USS PROTEUS (AS-19), the Naval Station and Camp Covington CB Base. Tasked with providing food and shelter, Naval <b>Station</b> <b>Tug</b> Base personnel improvised housing from abandoned warehouses of decommissioned Camp Minron with cots and supplies from the base emergency hurricane supplies, fed hundreds from plastic trash cans full of fish and rice from the base galley. The Hector also provided hot meals from her own stores and galley. Outside showers were made from a circle of metal lockers and fire hoses with sprinkler heads. The CB's set up Vietnam-style steel drum toilets, which were immediately overwhelmed.|$|R
50|$|Reactivated {{and placed}} in service in September 1950, Nanigo was {{assigned}} to the 13th Naval District at Seattle, Washington. Reclassified as a medium tug, YTM-537, in February 1962, she served that district until transferred, late in 1967, to the 17th Naval District at Kodiak, Alaska. Assigned then to Naval Station, Adak, punctuating her tour with routine overhauls at Seattle, Nanigo operated there into the spring of 1972. On 7 February 1970, the tug brought the U.S. fishing vessel Aleutian Queen, that had lost steering control 130 mi northwest of Adak, into port for repairs. On 3 August 1970, when the captain's gig ran aground with a fishing party 100 ft offshore in Finger Bay, Nanigo and a station medium landing craft (LCM) retrieved the fishermen without incident. Between 10 and 14 December 1971, Nanigo most likely participated as one of the three <b>station</b> <b>tugs</b> that assisted fleet tug , temporarily deployed to Naval Station, Adak, in fighting fires on board the gutted Japanese fishery factory vessel Katata Maru in gale force winds and bitter temperatures.|$|R
50|$|The {{increase}} in coastal trade along the Atlantic seaboard {{after the civil}} war and the purchase of Alaska in 1867 {{had a significant impact on}} the development of the Revenue Cutter Service. Demands by the public to do something about losses in lives and property at sea prompted Secretary of the Treasury George S. Boutwell, under President Ulysses S. Grant, to reorganize the service. He appointed N. Broughton Devereux on 1 July 1869 as chief of an interim Revenue Marine Bureau that included the Revenue Cutter Service, the Steamboat Inspection Service, the Marine Hospital Service and the Life-Saving Service. Devereaux appointed two boards to study the problems facing the service; one investigated personnel requirements, the other analyzed the requirements for the cutter fleet.The fleet board produced a study that was presented to Congress on 26 May 1870, the result of which was that of the twenty-four steaming cutters in the service, four were harbor <b>tugs,</b> six were <b>stationed</b> on the Great Lakes and the remaining steaming cutters were stationed in the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The harbor tugs were left where they were stationed and all of the lake cutters were recommended for repair and stayed located where they were except for one which was home-ported in a different city. All of the steaming coastal cutters except for two were a successful side-wheel design which were retained. The board recommended keeping only one of the propeller driven steam cutters, the USRC Mahoning. Of the twelve sail cutters in the fleet, only five of the most seaworthy were recommended by the board to be retained. Devereaux's report to Congress included a request for four new steam cutters: a large propeller-driven ship, a large side-wheeler and two smaller side-wheelers. Recommendations were made as to the types of engines to be used on various cutters and all were to be equipped with sails to save on coal consumption. Additionally, Devereaux requested $125,000 to cover the unexpected costs of operating cutters Lincoln, Wayanda and Reliance in Alaskan waters during 1869.|$|R
