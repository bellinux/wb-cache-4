500|$|For the 30th {{anniversary of}} The Joshua Tree, U2 staged a 2017 concert tour in North America, Europe, and Latin America, {{on which the}} album was played in its {{entirety}} at each show. It {{was the first time}} the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue, rather than a new release. As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Trees subject matter. He said that in looking at the record's anniversary, [...] "things have kind of come full circle, if you want. That record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest. Thatcher was in the throes of trying to put down the miners' strike; there was all kinds of shenanigans going on in Central America. It feels like we're right back there in a way. I don't think any of our work has ever come full circle to that extent. It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance <b>today</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> didn't have three years ago, four years ago.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 16, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Smaug would be voiced and interpreted with performance capture by Benedict Cumberbatch in Peter Jackson's three-part adaptation of The Hobbit, wherein Smaug is presented with a long head, red-golden scales, and piercing yellow-red eyes. The dragon speaks with Received Pronunciation with an underlying growl; Cumberbatch's vocal performance was vocoded using alligator growls. Smaug's design was created with key frame animation, in addition to Cumberbatch's motion capture performance. Weta Digital employed its proprietary [...] "Tissue" [...] software which was honoured in 2013 with a [...] "Scientific and Engineering Award" [...] from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to make the dragon as realistic as possible. In addition, Weta Digital supervisor Joe Letteri said in an interview for USA <b>Today</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> used classic European and Asian dragons as inspirations to create Smaug.|$|E

2500|$|Even after Steve Bannon's {{role was}} diminished by Trump in mid-April 2017, Voris' {{organization}} was still viewed as notable by national media. [...] On May 9, 2017 The Atlantic released {{a video of}} the Church Militant offices and personal which also included pictures of the then recent New York Times and Detroit Free Press articles. Voris told The Atlantic {{that of all the}} debates held in America, the question of which is the right religion has never been debated. He complained about [...] "A tyranny, a dictatorship of relativism. [...] 'If you don't want to have an abortion don't, I'm going to have mine, you don't want to that's fine. If you don't like gay marriage, don't marry someone of the same sex.' Societies can function like that. There is right and wrong, good and evil, truth and lies. ...The world is so mired in misunderstanding <b>today</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> need to be pointed to - here's truth." [...] Voris discussed his upbringing and the story of how he returned to Catholicism. He also challenged the label of far-right or hate group. The video ended with him saying [...] "The old Michael Voris was a lustful, prideful, acting on hurt, and sense of victim, and all that business. The new Michael Voris, or the new man, is somebody who is now dedicated to helping other people realize that there is no limit to God. It's impossible to do enough to save souls until you have drawn your last breath." ...|$|E

"I {{believe their}} general {{is doing it}} to bring large numbers of his troops close up to the stockade; partly perhaps {{to keep up the}} spirits of the front line, by their company; partly to render {{impossible}} any attempt, on our part, to make our way out by a sudden rush. Of course, they don't know what our strength is; but they have had so sharp a lesson, <b>today,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will take every precaution, in future.|$|E

6000|$|Yes, oh, yes, I am not {{overlooking}} the [...] "steady progress from age to {{age of the}} coming of the kingdom of God and righteousness." [...] "From age to age"--yes, it describes that giddy gait. I (and the rocks) will not live to see it arrive, but that is all right--it will arrive, it surely will. But you ought not to be always ironically apologizing for the Deity. If that thing is going to arrive, it is inferable that He wants it to arrive; and so it is not quite kind of you, and it hurts me, to see you flinging sarcasms at the gait of it. And yet it would not be fair in me not to admit that the sarcasms are deserved. When the Deity wants a thing, and after working at it for [...] "ages and ages" [...] can't show even a shade of progress toward its accomplishment, we--well, we don't laugh, but it is only because we dasn't. The source of [...] "righteousness"--is in the heart? Yes. And engineered and directed by the brain? Yes. Well, history and tradition testify that the heart is just about what it was in the beginning; it has undergone no shade of change. Its good and evil impulses and their consequences are the same <b>today</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were in Old Bible times, in Egyptian times, in Greek times, in Middle Age times, in Twentieth Century times. There has been no change.|$|E

50|$|Arrays of DNAFETs can be {{used for}} {{detecting}} single nucleotide polymorphisms (causing many hereditary diseases) and for DNA sequencing.

Furthermore, they work continuously and (near) real-time. DNAFETs are highly selective since only specific binding modulates charge transport.|$|R
