5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation. First, he arranged the repatriation of the body of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who also fought in the Argentine Civil Wars. Menem intended to use <b>the</b> <b>reconciliation</b> of these historical Argentine figures as a metaphor for <b>the</b> <b>reconciliation</b> of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.|$|E

Bagrat II of Georgia (grandfather of Bagrat, David’s adoptee), and Gagik I of Armenia allied themselves with David, who recaptured Manzikert from the Marwanid emir of Diyar Bakr about 993 and raided Akhlat, another important stronghold of this Kurdish dynasty, in 997. Mamlan, the Rawadid emir of Azerbaijan, was also twice defeated, the second time decisively, in 998, near Archesh.|$|E

5|$|Despite Beckham's move {{to unseat}} McCreary in the Senate, {{the two were}} once again allies by 1911, when Beckham {{supported}} the aging McCreary for the party's gubernatorial nomination. It is unclear whether McCreary sought <b>the</b> <b>reconciliation</b> {{in order to secure}} the gubernatorial nomination or Beckham made amends with McCreary because he thought he could control McCreary's actions as governor. In the Democratic primary, McCreary defeated William Adams by a majority of 25,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|House Democrats had {{expected}} {{to be able to}} negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill. Since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to pass the Senate over another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill. They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by <b>the</b> <b>reconciliation</b> process.|$|E
5|$|In addition, this marriage, {{which was}} {{endorsed}} by Emperor Justinian himself, marked Germanus out as the heir to both the East Roman and the Gothic realms.

5|$|The {{book also}} has a {{practical}} dimension, presenting debates between anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little practical consequence, and suggesting that animal rights goals can be consistent with holistic environmentalist goals. Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of <b>the</b> <b>reconciliation</b> of environmentalism and animal advocacy is too narrow, but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in the book with practical animal-related issues.|$|E

5|$|The {{springbok}} {{has been}} a national symbol of South Africa since the white minority rule in the 20th century. It was adopted as a nickname or mascot by several South African sports teams, most famously by the national rugby union team. The springbok is the national animal of South Africa.

From 1919 to 1991, the democracy and sovereignty of the Finns withstood challenges from right-wing and left-wing political radicalism, the crisis of World War II and pressure from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|Aziz al-Dawla's {{replacements}} were {{challenged by}} Salih and chaos prevailed in Aleppo. In 1023, Salih entered the Kilab into a military {{pact with the}} Banu Tayy of Transjordan and the Banu Kalb of central Syria, both of which opposed direct Fatimid rule. Medieval historian Yahya al-Antaki relates that the alliance was a renewal of a previous pact made by the same parties in circa 1021, during which they rebelled and ultimately reconciled with the new Fatimid caliph, az-Zahir (r. 1021–1036), who took power {{in the aftermath of}} Caliph al-Hakim's disappearance in 1021. However, <b>the</b> <b>reconciliation</b> unraveled by 1023 due to the Tayy's conflict with Palestine's Fatimid governor, Anushtakin al-Dizbari, which prompted the respective chieftains of Tayy and Kalb, Hassan ibn Mufarrij and Sinan ibn Ulayyan, to meet with Salih at the outskirts of Aleppo and renew the alliance.|$|E

Although White endured 20 flights {{for travel}} during his season at Iowa State, the Rockets' NBA schedule called for 98 flights. White {{had attempted to}} cope with travel in college through use of Benadryl and Xanax, but found both reduced his energy level, although it never showed in his statistical output. White cited that his concern for the increased number of flights and long term use {{of these types of}} medication could lead to dependence and addiction (which is common concern and a point of consensus concern regarding benzodiazepines in the medical community. White likened mental health conditions to a day-to-day physical injury in which symptoms can be dynamic and unclear, but support and policy should be adequately proactive).|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, {{legal action}} had embittered Carte and Sullivan, but the {{partnership}} {{had been so}} profitable that Carte and his wife eventually sought to reunite the author and composer. After several attempts by the Cartes, <b>the</b> <b>reconciliation</b> finally came {{through the efforts of}} Tom Chappell, who published the sheet music to their operas. In 1893, Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration, Utopia, Limited. While Utopia was being prepared, Carte produced Jane Annie, by J. M. Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle, with music by Ernest Ford. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing after only 51 performances.|$|E

Afterward, Raynor's wife Liddy dies {{after a period of}} depression and illness. As a result, Raynor immerses himself in his work and develops a penchant for operating alone. He is also the primary protagonist in Queen of Blades, a novelization of the events of StarCrafts Episode II in which Raynor attempts to rescue Sarah Kerrigan from the Zerg on Char and eventually allies with the high templar Tassadar and renegade dark templar Zeratul, facilitating <b>the</b> <b>reconciliation</b> between the two estranged Protoss.|$|E

5|$|The Mahavira's teachings were {{gradually}} lost after around 300BC, {{according to}} the Jain tradition, when a severe famine in the Magadha region of ancient India caused a scattering of the Jain monks. Thereafter, attempts were made by Jain monks to gather again, co-recite the canon, and re-establish it in its entirety. These efforts identified differences between recitations of the Mahavira's teachings, and {{an attempt was made}} in the 5thcentury AD to reconcile the differences. However, <b>the</b> <b>reconciliation</b> efforts failed, with Svetambara and Digambara Jain traditions continuing with their own incomplete, somewhat different versions of the Mahavira's teachings. In the early centuries of the common era, Jain texts containing Mahavira's teachings were written down in palm leaf manuscripts.|$|E

The Anglican Church of Canada set up the Anglican Healing Fund in the 1990s to respond to the ongoing need for healing related to residential schools. In the 2000s the United Church established the Justice and Reconciliation Fund to support healing initiatives and the Presbyterian Church has established a Healing & Reconciliation Program.|$|E
5|$|Griffiths {{sought a}} {{historical}} origin for the Horus–Set rivalry, and he posited two distinct predynastic unifications of Egypt by Horus worshippers, similar to Sethe's theory, {{to account for}} it. Yet the issue remains unresolved, partly because other political associations for Horus and Set complicate the picture further. Before even Upper Egypt had a single ruler, two of its major cities were Nekhen, in the far south, and Naqada, many miles to the north. The rulers of Nekhen, where Horus was the patron deity, are generally believed to have unified Upper Egypt, including Naqada, under their sway. Set was associated with Naqada, so {{it is possible that}} the divine conflict dimly reflects an enmity between the cities in the distant past. Much later, at the end of the Second Dynasty (c. 2890–2686 BCE), King Peribsen used the Set animal in writing his serekh-name, in place of the traditional falcon hieroglyph representing Horus. His successor Khasekhemwy used both Horus and Set in the writing of his serekh. This evidence has prompted conjecture that the Second Dynasty saw a clash between the followers of the Horus-king and the worshippers of Set led by Peribsen. Khasekhemwy's use of the two animal symbols would then represent <b>the</b> <b>reconciliation</b> of the two factions, as does the resolution of the myth.|$|E
