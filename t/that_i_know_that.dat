500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold {{and then there was a}} whole different team involved after <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{videos were}} {{intended}} to demonstrate the album's central theme of [...] "finding the beauty in imperfection". While working on [...] "Flawless", Beyoncé was reminded of her loss on television competition Star Search as a child, which she saw as a defining moment in her career, and believed that the competition had {{taught her how to}} embrace imperfection in the future. The theme was represented in the videos by the recurring use of trophies, which the singer saw as referencing [...] "all of the sacrifice I have made as a kid, all of the time that I lost". It was also carried into how the visuals were created, with the videos for [...] "Drunk in Love", [...] "Yoncé", [...] "No Angel", [...] "XO" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] shot without prior preparation, as the singer found enjoyment in the spontaneity of the filming locations and in resisting the urge to perfect them. Noting some of the visuals' explicit content and exposure of her body, Beyoncé said she found shooting them liberating and expressed her intention to demonstrate sexuality as a power that women should have, and not lose after becoming a mother. She went on to say, [...] "I know finding my sensuality, getting back into my body, being proud of growing up, it was important to me that I expressed <b>that...</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there are so many women who feel the same way".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on the ABC's Nightline news program, when asked to explain why 82 percent of cases were declared cleared by exception, Arpaio said, [...] "We do clear {{a higher percentage of}} <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> We clear many, many cases – not 18 percent." [...] Nightline contacted the MCSO after the interview and was told that of 7,346 crimes, only 944, or 15%, had been cleared by arrest.|$|E

2500|$|Activists say the {{movement}} is non-violent. According to the ALF's code, any act that furthers the cause of animal liberation, where all reasonable precautions are taken not to harm human or non-human life, may be claimed as an ALF action, including acts of vandalism causing economic damage to their victims. American activist Rod Coronado said in 2006: [...] "One thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> separates us from the people we are constantly accused of being—that is, terrorists, violent criminals—is {{the fact that we}} have harmed no one." ...|$|E
2500|$|This rivality [...] {{was really}} {{building}} {{from the people}} of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't know why they put this kind of rivality , because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there was something on radio by Maria.|$|E
2500|$|On the 20th {{anniversary of}} the murder, Kilroy's parents visited the Rio Grande Valley and Matamoros to thank {{the people who had}} {{supported}} them in their search for their son. Kilroy's father stated that people were supportive and called the police whenever they saw something suspicious that they thought was related to their son's disappearance. He said that it was easier to overcome their son's death because of the support they received. Kilroy's mother said she received a cross from a Brownsville woman when she was searching for her son in 1989. [...] "It's a reminder every time <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the Lord was involved in everything", she said, while she touched and showed the cross around her neck.|$|E

And what I would like to clarify here is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> my mere participation, {{even though it was}} secondary in one incident, if it contributed to the violence in society, I am deeply sorry and I regret it ... I was in prison for almost 15 years. I have reflected a great deal over it, and I understand that violence did harm to society; I understand it and I regret that I participated in it. I believe that things, a better society, are achieved by building and not by destroying ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Screams of Abel webzine, former Antestor member Morten Mageroy reacted with caution to the proliferation of unblack bands: [...] "I really hope that people (who play Christian black metal) {{know what they are}} doing. I know this sounds very rough, but I have seen people being pulled into something they do not know. I am not saying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> these musicians are going to mess their lives up, but I have seen it happen to some people and it frightens me very much." [...] Mageroy, however, defends the unblack metal bands' intentions: [...] "A lot of Christian bands have done amazing things being led by God. I know that God is using many types of communication, and it is important that Christians is [...] present in every field, in every genre, privately and in work. God might just as well use heavy metal to bring salvation to people." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in {{a letter}} dated 8 May, to Wendy's CEO Kerrii Anderson, Thompson demanded that the {{restaurant}} drop an upcoming promotion featuring children's toys designed after the Wii games Excite Truck, Wii Sports and Super Mario Galaxy, because Manhunt 2 was scheduled for release on the console. An excerpt from Thompson's letter states; [...] " [...] will feature, according to video game news sites, beheadings with hatchets, bludgeonings with baseball bats, the jamming of syringes into eyeballs, cutting opponents' testicles off, and 'environtmental [...] kills' in which common objects {{in the field of}} vision, such as electrical cords to strangle victims [...] One pro-video game industry site is referring to Manhunt 2 as a [...] "true murder simulator" [...] when played on Wii.

From <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Dave Thomas never would have tolerated the use of Wendy's good name to promote Nintendo's Wii, not with this game available on the Wii platform."
