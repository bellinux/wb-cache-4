The on-board signal processing includes switching of RF signals between multiple antennas to provide interconnection between the uplink and downlink beams. This paper describes {{the development of}} a dynamic <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> for a TDMA satellite switching system {{to be used in the}} next generation communications satellites. In this paper, a dynamic <b>switch</b> <b>matrix,</b> which includes the microwave <b>switch</b> <b>matrix,</b> the distribution control unit and the timing source, will be described. Several different microwave <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> architectures and <b>switching</b> devices were evaluated and compared. A unique coupler crossbar <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> architecture with dual-gate field effect transistor as switching element was developed.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} cyclic {{fault-tolerant}} structure for a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> {{in a tree}} arrangement by connecting the inputs of the <b>switch</b> <b>matrix</b> into a ring with additional SOAs. Upon com-ponent failures, the affected requests are rerouted through their neighboring inputs toward the desired outputs. By making use of the existing components while rerouting, the proposed structure achieves an excellent trade-off {{between the number of}} additional components, hence size and cost, and fault tolerance. Numerical simulations show that under 210 randomly distributed SOA failures in a 32 × 32 <b>switch</b> <b>matrix,</b> the proposed structure is still able to provide more than 99 % connectivity between all input– output port pairs. We also show through simulations that the proposed structure could potentially scale up to large port counts by limiting the length of the rerouted paths.
