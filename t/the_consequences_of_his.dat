This approximation is generally valid for planetary orbits and the orbit of the Moon about the Earth. This approximation also allows Newton to consider a great variety of central force laws, not merely inverse-square and inverse-cube force laws.|$|E

5|$|Maester Aemon summons Jon and {{explains}} {{to him the}} reason why members of the Night's Watch do not marry: it would force them to choose between their duty to the order or loyalty to their loved ones. Aemon knows this very well because he is actually Aemon Targaryen, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen's uncle and Daenerys's great-uncle, who dutifully and reluctantly stayed at the Wall while his family members were killed or exiled when the Targaryens were overthrown. Aemon advises Jon that he must choose either his duty to the Night's Watch or his family, but also warns that <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> choice will haunt him {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} structure is alluded to in Legea minții, {{which is about}} discovering one's true calling. The plot follows its protagonist, a scholarly priest {{by the name of}} Andrei Pascu, as he finds himself in his work as a missionary of religion and cultural nationalism, despite being set back by poverty and revisited by his worldly past. Similar themes are developed elsewhere. In Popa Man, a lapsed priest and smuggler is suddenly confronted with <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> actions, and destroys himself with drink. In Stana, named after its female protagonist, a war invalid is a passive witness to his wife's moral decay. When he dies, his wooden leg serves as a haunting reminder of his virtues, driving Stana to despair.|$|E
5|$|Historians in the 20th and 21st {{century have}} {{conducted}} extensive research on Edward and his reign. Most have concluded {{this was a}} highly significant period in English medieval history, some going further and describing Edward {{as one of the}} great medieval kings, although most also agree that his final years were less successful than his early decades in power. Three major academic narratives of Edward have been produced during this period. Frederick Powicke's volumes, published in 1947 and 1953, forming the standard works on Edward for several decades, and were largely positive in praising the achievements of his reign, and in particular his focus on justice and the law. In 1988, Michael Prestwich produced an authoritative biography of the King, focusing on his political career, still portraying him in sympathetic terms, but highlighting some of <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> failed policies. Marc Morris's biography followed in 2008, drawing out more of the detail of Edward's personality, and generally taking a harsher view of the King's weaknesses and less pleasant characteristics. Considerable academic debate has taken place around the character of Edward's kingship, his political skills, and in particular his management of his earls, and the degree to which this was collaborative or repressive in nature.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to {{pronounce}} of what disorder the master died. I concealed the fact <b>of</b> <b>his</b> having swallowed nothing for four days, fearing it {{might lead to}} trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he did not abstain on purpose: it was <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> strange illness, not the cause.|$|R
5|$|Picard confronts Q, {{who tells}} him that {{although}} the bout with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It taught him that life was too precious to squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as a nobody. Q sends {{him back to the}} bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart and laughing as he collapses to the floor. In the present, Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, he wonders if his journey into the past was one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Nevertheless, he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him.|$|E
5|$|Veronica asks Beaver {{how she got}} chlamydia—Woody had it, and Beaver {{transmitted}} it to her {{the night}} she was raped (revealing that he, not Duncan, raped her). Beaver is about {{to blow up the}} plane that has both Woody and Keith on it. Beaver pushes a button, and there is a flash in midair. Beaver tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead of facing <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> actions. Aaron and Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) are in bed, and while she is in the shower, Clarence Weidman (Christopher B. Duncan) appears and shoots him in the head. The scene moves to Australia, where we learn that Duncan organized the murder. Jackie meets Wallace and tells him that she {{had to go back to}} New York, where she is actually from, in order to care for her two-year-old son, whom she left with her mother, when she came to Neptune to reconnect with Terrence. Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not ever on the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E
25|$|The {{tragedy of}} Lear's lack of {{understanding}} of <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> demands and actions is often observed to be like that of a spoiled child, but it has also been noted that his behaviour is equally likely to be seen in parents who have never adjusted to their children having grown up.|$|E
5000|$|The {{novel is}} a tragedy in the strict sense, Clyde's {{destruction}} being <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> innate weaknesses: moral and physical cowardice, lack of scruple and self-discipline, muddled intellect and unfocused ambition; additionally, the effect <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ingratiating (Dreiser uses the word [...] "soft") social manner places temptation in his way which he cannot resist.|$|R

25|$|In {{the view}} of the majority, Judge Stump's action passed this test. Even if his {{decision}} was erroneous, it was within his jurisdiction to consider Ora McFarlin's petition. Moreover, the parties dealt with Judge Stump in his capacity as a judge, not as a private individual. Accordingly, he could not be held liable for <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> actions, even if they were arguably tragic.|$|E

25|$|It {{was thought}} that the {{introduction}} of the printing medium 'would strengthen religion and enhance the power of monarchs.' The majority of books were of a religious nature, with the church and crown regulating <b>the</b> content. <b>The</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> printing 'wrong' material were extreme. Meyrowitz used the example of William Carter who in 1584 printed a pro-Catholic pamphlet in Protestant-dominated England. <b>The</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> action was hanging.|$|R

With the occupation of Constantinople Izzet Pasha resigned. Tevfik Pasha took the position of grand vizier the same day that British ships entered the Golden Horn. Tevfik Pasha lasted until 4 March 1919, replaced by Ferid Pasha whose first order was the arrest of leading members of the CUP.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Ferdinand III's death in 1634, the war was {{progressing}} disastrously for the Habsburgs, and his son Ferdinand IV (1637–1657) who {{had been one of}} his military commanders was faced with the task of salvaging <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's extremism. Ferdinand IV was far more pragmatic and had been considered the leader of the peace party at court and had helped negotiate the Peace of Prague in 1635. However, with continuing losses in the war he was forced to make peace in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia, concluding the war. One of his acts during {{the latter part of the}} war was to give further independence to the German states (ius belli ac pacis—rights in time of war and peace) which would gradually change the balance of power between emperor and states in favour of the latter.|$|E
