Furthermore, Spinefarm had been bought by the big company Universal Music Group in 2002, forcing the band <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> would continue with Spinefarm, which would mean that their future albums would be released worldwide by UMG. They received several offers from various companies before their final decision to stay with Spinefarm (and thus UMG).|$|E

25|$|Stella Browne was {{a leading}} birth control campaigner, who {{increasingly}} began to venture into the more contentious issue of abortion in the 1930s. Browne's beliefs were heavily influenced {{by the work of}} Havelock Ellis, Edward Carpenter and other sexologists. She came to strongly believe that working women should have the choice to become pregnant and to terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labour during her pregnancy. In this case she argued that doctors should give free information about birth control to women that wanted to know about it. This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> wanted to be mothers or not.|$|E
25|$|The Danish krone is {{currently}} used by both of its dependent territories, Greenland and Faroe Islands, with their monetary policy {{controlled by the}} Danish Central Bank. If Denmark does adopt the euro, separate referendums would be required in both territories <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> should follow suit. Both territories have voted {{not to be a}} part of the EU in the past, and their populations will not participate in the Danish euro referendum. The Faroe Islands use a special version of the Danish krone notes that have been printed with text in the Faroese language. It is regarded as a foreign currency, but can be exchanged 1:1 with the Danish version. On 5 November 2009 the Faroese Parliament approved a proposal to investigate the possibility for euro adoption, including an evaluation of the legal and economic impact of adopting the euro ahead of Denmark.|$|E
25|$|The votes {{challenged}} by Miller's team {{were put in}} separate boxes, leaving it to the lawsuit <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> would be counted for Murkowski. On November 11, the Miller campaign alleged it had received reports of voter intimidation and fraud {{and that it would}} be filing a lawsuit in Alaska state court asking for voters rolls for certain precincts to determine whether the precincts had counted more ballots than there were registered voters. Miller told Fox News Channel on November 18 that his campaign may request a recount, investigate the voting machines, and look into whether the absentee ballots for the military were mailed in a timely fashion. The federal judge held the suit could be decided by reference to State law, and directed Miller to file in State court, which he did on November 22, stopping the certification of election results and possibly delaying the seating of a second Senator for Alaska at the beginning of the new term in January.|$|E

25|$|The non-Hungarian {{population}} of the territory ceded by the First Vienna Award {{can be divided into}} three groups – those who left already before the Award came into force, those who remained in their place during the war and until it was integrated to Czechoslovakia again and those who were expelled from the region. The Czechoslovak press reported after the Munich Agreement that border adjustments with Hungary were imminent, so the Czechoslovaks had five weeks <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> stayed or left. According to Janics those officials and farmers who opted to move away (81,000 people) were given administrative, military and public safety support and they were provided road vehicles and railway wagons to transport their property. Deák estimates the number of state employees and Czech colonists who left territory before the arrival of the Hungarian army as one half while the total number of Slovaks who left territory before December 1938 (voluntarily or by forced expulsion) is unknown and can be estimated only by comparison of two censuses from 1930 and 1938 and assumed population growth. His estimate is about 50,000 people of Slovak nationality.|$|E
25|$|Some {{persons have}} a {{disorder}} of consciousness (DOC). This state is defined to include persons with coma, {{as well as}} persons in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). New BCI research seeks to help persons with DOC in different ways. A key initial goal is to identify patients {{who are able to}} perform basic cognitive tasks, which would of course lead to a change in their diagnosis. That is, some persons who are diagnosed with DOC may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them). Some persons who are diagnosed with DOC die as a result of end-of-life decisions, which may be made by family members who sincerely feel this is in the patient's best interests. Given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision, there {{would seem to be a}} strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that DOC patients are given an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> want to live.|$|E

[...] With the alignment having succumbed to heavy encroachment from vegetation, an environmental report would have to be drawn up to limit the potential damage that could be caused to wildlife.

500|$|Once {{the units}} had been transferred, their members had <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> would re-enlist in the Territorial Force; the {{threshold}} for recognition was given as 30% {{of the establishment}} strength. By 5 May, the War Office had recognised 85% of the Yeomanry, 78% of the Artillery, 59% of the Engineers and 84% of the Infantry units; the total enlistment was 28% of establishment. By 1 June, the total enlistment was 48% of establishment, and the first summer camp was organised. By the end of 1908, the Territorial Force stood at 68% of establishment strength, and a popular recruiting campaign in the following spring led by the Daily Mail brought it up to 88%. In the summer of 1909, a new Territorial reserve force, the [...] "Veteran Reserve", was announced; it began recruiting in 1910, and {{by the beginning of}} 1913 contained almost 200,000 men.|$|E
500|$|However, certain {{matters are}} {{regarded}} as impervious to judicial review owing to limitations in the courts' institutional capacity. Courts are generally reluctant {{to get involved in}} affairs relating to national security, leaving this role to the Government. At the same time, Singaporean courts are committed to careful scrutiny of matters <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> are indeed non-justiciable, as affirmed in the Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co. Ltd. (2007). This case held that courts would exclude matters involving [...] "high policy" [...] from their purview, but still analyse cases carefully {{to determine whether or not}} they truly fell within areas of executive immunity. Also, limitations on the role of the court have led to the rational conclusion that certain other areas are to be excluded from judicial review. These include matters in which the court lacks expertise and those which are polycentric, as was held in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{had given}} the American teams {{until the end of}} January 1996 <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> would return for the 1996 season. By then, sources were stating that four of the five American teams had [...] "either folded, have no stadiums to play in or will not be {{permitted}} {{to be part of the}} CFL in 1996". Only the Stallions appeared to be able to take the field in some form for the 1996 season. Of the American owners, Anderson was the most amenable to retaining an American-based team in 1996. While he initially stated that the league needed at least three other American teams for the Texans to be viable, he was willing to bring the Texans back for 1996 if the Stallions moved to Houston, since this would have not only ensured two American teams but also an intrastate rivalry. The proposal would have meant a return to the league's traditional East-West divisional alignment, with San Antonio and Houston both being placed in the East. [...] Anderson estimated that if there was even one other American team in the league, he could withstand annual losses of US$2 million indefinitely. However, that scenario looked less and less likely, as Speros—under prodding from Smith—had begun serious discussions with officials in Montreal.|$|E
500|$|Gilchrist's {{actions have}} sparked debate amongst {{current and former}} players and umpires. Ricky Ponting has {{declared}} on several occasions {{that he is not}} a walker but will leave it to each player <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> wish to walk or not. While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004. In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a [...] "walking crusade" [...] when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: [...] "...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... not everyone has to walk, mate...". The taunt was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket. Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had [...] "zero support in the team" [...] for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He added that he [...] "felt isolated" [...] and [...] "silently accused of betraying the team. Implictly I was made to feel selfish, as if I was walking for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest." ...|$|E
