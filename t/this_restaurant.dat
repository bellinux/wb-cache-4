2500|$|The {{most likely}} {{source of the}} poutine would be Drummondville. [...] A {{restaurant}} in this town called Le Roy Jucep appears as {{the inventor of the}} poutine.

Jean-Paul Roy, owner of <b>this</b> <b>restaurant</b> in 1964, is the first to have served the poutine {{as we know it today}} [...] "fried potatoes, cheese and sauce". Hence the fact that it claims to be the first to have sold but not being the inventor, [...] The name would come from a mixture of a distortion of the English word pudding and the nickname of the Ti-Poutcook. Mr. Roy, according to his testimony, started serving cheese with fries and sauce after the regular request of three people. Jean-Paul Roy died in August 2007 in Drummondville. The official patent, granted by the Canadian federal government, is posted in the restaurant.|$|E

The court permitted Polanski to testify via a video link, after he expressed fears that he might be extradited were he to enter the United Kingdom. The trial started on July 18, 2005, and Polanski made English legal history as the first claimant to give evidence by video link.

2500|$|Many {{different}} {{variants of}} the hamburger {{have been created}} over the years, {{some of which have}} become very popular. Much of this diversity has been the product of other restaurant chains that have tried to reproduce the success of McDonald's and White Castle, while others served to influence McDonald's. An example of a restaurant that influenced McDonald's and its imitators is Big Boy, which was first opened in 1936 by Bob Wian in Glendale, California and became known in that locale as Bob's Big Boy. It was at <b>this</b> <b>restaurant</b> that a major hamburger variant, the double deck cheeseburger, with two beef patties, was first made. Wian's creation was distinctively served by Big Boy restaurants with the bun sliced twice, the center slice—known as the club section—separating the two patties. The chain also popularized the drive-in restaurant format, taken and simplified by McDonald's type fast food operators. By the 1960s, Big Boy had expanded throughout the United States and Canada. Despite the benefits it provided to Wian, the chain was sold along with the rights to their signature Big Boy hamburger to the Marriott Corporation in 1967. This same year McDonald's franchisee Jim Delligatti, created an imitation of the Big Boy — the Big Mac.'This wasn’t like discovering the lightbulb,' Mr. Delligatti later told the Los Angeles Times. 'The bulb was already there. All I did was screw it in the socket.'|access-date=January 3, 2017}} An example of the many McDonald's and White Castle imitators is Kewpee Hamburgers, a fast-food chain founded in 1923 in Flint, Michigan by Samuel V.
