The principle, also {{sometimes}} called “positive introspection”, says <b>that</b> if one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P. It is widely, although not universally, {{acknowledged that the}} KK principle is false, {{and not just for}} the boring reason <b>that</b> one can <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P without having formed the belief <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P. One can <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P, and believe <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, without knowing <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, because one is not in a strong enough epistemic position to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P (Williamson 2000 : 114 - 30). One’s epistemic position is weaker with respect to the fact <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P than it is with respect to the fact that P itself. But how much weaker can one’s epistemic position be with respect to the fact <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P than it is with respect to the fact that P? Of course, if one does <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P, one’s epistemic position with respect to the fact <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P cannot be so bad <b>that</b> one positively <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> one does not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P, as opposed to merely failing to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, for knowing is 1 factive: one can know only what is indeed the case.

The British suffered from several disadvantages. First, they lacked pilots <b>that</b> <b>knew</b> the Kettle-Bottoms, a difficult stretch of the river. Second, the winds blew in the wrong direction, slowing their advance. Consequently, it took them ten days to reach the fort, and during the journey all the ships grounded at least 20 times. For five successive days they had to warp over a distance of 50 miles.|$|E
25|$|The Germans renewed their {{offensive}} on 5 June on the Somme. During {{the next}} three weeks, far from the easy advance the Wehrmacht expected, they encountered strong resistance from a rejuvenated French Army. It had fallen back on its interior lines of supply and communications, and had closer access to repair shops, supply dumps and stores. Moreover, 112,000 evacuated French soldiers were repatriated via the Normandy and Brittany ports. It was some substitute for the lost divisions in Flanders. The French were also able to make good {{a significant amount of}} their armoured losses and raised the 1st and 2nd DCR (heavy armoured divisions). De Gaulle's division—the 4th DCR—also had its losses replaced. Morale rose and was very high by the end of May 1940. Most French soldiers <b>that</b> <b>knew</b> about the defeats, and were now joining the line, only knew of German success by hearsay.|$|E

Prohibition of unnatural practices, social tact and permission to his suite not invariably to be present at his banquets nor to attend his progress from Rome, as a matter of obligation, and always to be found the same by those who had failed to attend him through engagements. Exact scrutiny in council and patience; not that he was avoiding investigation, satisfied with first impressions. An inclination to keep his friends, and nowhere fastidious or the victim of manias but his own master in everything, and his outward mien cheerful. His long foresight and ordering of the merest trifle without making scenes. The check in his reign put upon organized applause and every form of lip-service; his unceasing watch over the needs of the empire and his stewardship of its resources; his patience under criticism by individuals of such conduct. No superstitious fear of divine powers nor with man any courting of the public or obsequiousness or cultivation of popular favour, but temperance in all things and firmness; nowhere want of taste or search for novelty.|$|E

In his research for the book, the author interviewed approximately 40 people <b>that</b> <b>knew</b> Van Morrison. Turner spoke with Van Morrison, and they discussed the musician's views on philosophy. Some of the photographs included in the book were obtained by Turner from a guitarist with Van Morrison's band Them.|$|E

500|$|Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now is a {{biography}} of musician Van Morrison, written by Steve Turner.

Turner first met Van Morrison in 1985; he interviewed approximately 40 people <b>that</b> <b>knew</b> the subject in his research for the biography. Van Morrison did not think positively of the biography, and multiple newspapers reported he attempted to purchase all of the book's 25,000 copies.

[...] Mark Savage from BBC stated that True Blue is the album which cemented Madonna's {{reputation as the}} 'First Lady of Pop'. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine said that with the album [...] "Madonna made the transition from pop tart to consummate artist, joining the ranks of '80s icons like Michael Jackson and Prince." [...] Similarly, Robert C.

[...] Writing for The Irish Times, John Boland was critical of the book's text but wrote positively of its images: [...] "Steve Turner's Van Morrison: Too Late to Stop Now, has a trite, fanzine style text and isn't very informative about the great man, but it has some splendid pictures and in its coffee table format is well worth the asking price". A review in the Herald Sun was critical: [...] "Too Late To Stop Now is more suited to the coffee table than a library shelf. It is browsing material, fleshed with snapshots, album covers, PR shots, posters and prints. The words are mere stitches, there to hold the pictures in place." [...] The Herald Sun noted that the author left out critical quotes from individuals <b>that</b> <b>knew</b> Van Morrison, and questioned Turner's objectivity.|$|E

Although Exton had been a leading member {{in what has been}} called Brembre's [...] "Ricardian faction" [...] in London, and stayed with Brembre {{as long as he could}} (until March 1387), he deserted him decisively soon after that date. Exton was, it has been said, [...] "in a particularly difficult position." [...] Exton and other aldermen were questioned as to whether Brembre could be supposed to have realised that his actions were treasonous. To this, Exton is supposed to have replied that he [...] "supposed he [...] was aware rather than ignorant of them." [...] Bembre's fate was sealed by Exton and [...] "those <b>that</b> <b>knew</b> him best." [...] Exton had continued the tradition of loyalty to the crown demonstrated by his predecessor, but, significantly, [...] "within limits never acknowledged by the headstong Brembre." [...] As J. A.

500|$|In July 1849, the South Australian Advocate General {{produced}} {{a summary of}} the investigation to date. Several difficulties were detailed, including the fact that Parker denied any knowledge of the crime, as did others who were believed to have heard the incident discussed in Brown's presence. Brown's co-accused, the overseer Eastwood, alias [...] "Yorkie", had fled when the investigation began and had apparently left the colony aboard a whaling ship off Kangaroo Island. An important witness named Joice had gone to the neighbouring Port Phillip District of the colony of New South Wales, and Leandermin himself, who it appears was being detained at Guichen Bay, absconded and had apparently been [...] "made away with". The remaining witnesses were those <b>that</b> <b>knew</b> Brown, and apparently would not give evidence against him. Despite the extremely difficult task faced by the prosecution under these circumstances, the Advocate General ordered that investigations continue and issued warrants for the arrest of those that had fled South Australia. Brown appeared at the Supreme Court yet again on 10 and 28 September, but the judge again refused to hear the case without additional evidence. By the November sittings of the court, Brown's case had been removed from the listings, and this {{was the end of the}} matter as far as the formal investigation was concerned. Effectively, settler solidarity and the law of evidence ensured that Brown was never tried for the murders, despite the fact that those involved in the investigation had no doubt of his guilt. Possibly in response to Brown's case, the Aboriginal Witnesses Act of 1848 was amended in July 1849 to allow a person to be convicted on the sole testimony of an Aboriginal person.|$|E
