5|$|The text is {{presented}} in six stanzas of nine lines each. It is in bar form, three lines form the Stollen, three the Abgesang, with the meter 6.6.5.6.6.5.7.8.6. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> of the last stanza repeats {{the first line of}} the first stanza. The song is written in the first person, addressing Jesus.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, von Pahlen's Corps {{attacked}} forts 23 and 24, and the Polish {{position at}} the Evangelical Cemetery. Heavy fighting followed, and many Russian commanders, including Paskevich, proposed that further fighting be postponed until the following day. General von Toll insisted on reaching <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> of Polish defences before sunset. The surrounding forts changed hands many times, {{but in the end}} most of them remained in Russian hands by 22:00, when the Russians broke off. Around midnight General Berg arrived in Warsaw with a new ultimatum signed by Paskevich.|$|E
5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to a request from the New Zealand government, Barrowclough was nominated by Freyberg for command of the Pacific Section of 2NZEF, which was based in Fiji. With the entry of Imperial Japan into the war, this was an important command as Fiji was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> of defence for mainland New Zealand. Barrowclough embarked for New Zealand in early 1942 but during his transit, the commanding officer of the Pacific Section became seriously ill and was invalided home to be immediately replaced by Major General Owen Mead. On Barrowclough's arrival in New Zealand, he was disappointed to find that his expected command was no longer available. He was eventually posted as {{the commander of the}} Northern Division with the rank of major general. He was responsible for the defence of the upper North Island, and {{for the next few months}} oversaw the reorganisation and training of his new command.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{soldiers}} marched from Shanghai to Nanking at a breakneck pace, rapidly defeating {{pockets of}} Chinese resistance. By December 9 {{they had reached}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> of defense, the Fukuo Line, behind which lay Nanking's fortified walls. On December 10 Matsui ordered an all-out attack on Nanking, and after less than two days of intense fighting Chiang decided to abandon the city. Before fleeing, Tang ordered his men to launch a concerted breakout of the Japanese siege, but by this time Nanking was largely surrounded and its defenses were at the breaking point. Most of Tang's units simply collapsed, their soldiers often casting off their weapons and uniforms in {{the streets in the}} hopes of hiding among the city's civilian population.|$|E
5|$|The Green Line {{is one of}} the six heavy rail subway {{lines that}} make up the Washington Metro rapid transit system in the Washington, D.C., {{metropolitan}} area. The Green Line consists of 21 stations, with termini at Branch Avenue and at Greenbelt. The Green Line runs through Prince George's County, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. It was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> in the original Metrorail plan to be constructed, and is one of three north–south lines through the city of Washington. It shares nine stations with the Yellow Line, one station with the Blue, Silver and Orange lines, and two stations with the Red Line.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} One Direction {{waking up in}} a tent. Outside, Payne starts singing the opening lines, as others are seen playing guitars sitting on hay bales in a camp setting. Subsequent scenes inter cut {{featuring}} One Direction performing the song at the camp setting in a circle, on an open field, driving a car, and at a lake where {{members of the group}} play in plastic bubbles and boats. As it turns to nighttime, the camp is the main setting; they conduct a football match and afterwards a pool party. The video ends with One Direction looking at the camera, with Malik singing <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line.</b> Throughout the video, teenage boys and girls are showing with the band.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins in}} orbit above planet Reach, as {{humanity}} fights the Covenant invasion forces. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> {{of defense for}} the planet is an array of magnetic accelerator cannons (MACs) orbiting the planet. The Master Chief sends a team of Spartans {{to the surface of}} Reach to protect the MAC's planet-based power generators. Ultimately, the Covenant are able to destroy the generators and begin bombarding the planet's surface - melting its surface to glass ('glassing the planet'). The surviving Spartans flee underground to the hidden headquarters of the Office of Naval Intelligence. There they meet Dr. Halsey who, with help of some of the surviving Spartans, uncovers a strange crystalline shard in a cavern built by the ancient Forerunners. Pursued by the Covenant, the Spartans retrieve the shard and collapse the passage behind them, which saves them from the pursuing Covenant forces, but also traps them deep under the surface of Reach.|$|E
25|$|MS-DOS and Windows use {{a common}} text file format, with each line of text {{separated}} by a two-character combination: carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF). It is common for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> of text not to be terminated with a CR-LF marker, and many text editors (including Notepad) do not automatically insert one on <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{placement}} of the sonnet in the sequence has also caused some confusion. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>line,</b> which is not evidently sarcastic, appears to contradict the tone of betrayal and reproach {{of many of the}} closest neighboring sonnets in the sequence as first presented.|$|E
25|$|Originally, a full-back was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> of defence, but as {{the game}} {{developed}} in the early 20th century, the centre-half role was dropped backwards and {{came to be known}} as 'centre-back', and the full-backs were then pushed out wider to create the right-back and left-back positions.|$|E
25|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have noticed that}} tablet G contains two structurally very different texts. Most of Gr is paraphrased as text K, while <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> {{and a half of}} Gr and the whole of Gv share short phrases with I and T (or at least Ta) but not the rest of the rongorongo corpus (Pozdniakov 1996:290, 299).|$|E

25|$|This runestone {{is found}} near a {{homestead}} named Hagstugan. It is either style Fp or possibly style Pr1 {{and it is}} raised in memory {{of a man who}} fell in what is today Russia.

25|$|Most of the recto (lines 1-7) is {{repeated}} with little {{change on the}} younger London tablet; after this {{the structure of the}} text changes radically, making <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>line</b> and a half of Gr and the whole side of Gv distinct {{from the rest of the}} rongorongo corpus. In addition, Pozdniakov found a brief sequence of glyphs that crosses from Gr8 to Gv1, confirming Barthel's reading order.|$|E
