He sees the box (Carter 001k tomb naming her alongside Akhenaten and Neferneferuaten) as depicting Meritaten in simultaneous roles using the name Neferneferuaten as coregent and using her birth name in the role of royal wife to Akhenaten. He has also proposed that the Meryre drawing was executed in advance of an anticipated coronation, which ended up not taking place due to his death.|$|E

There were also infantry detachments scrounged from eight RLA battalions, and a contingent of Commando Raiders. The defense began on 15 May 1971.|$|E

Justin soon realizes that they are Mari's parents, and {{intentionally}} leaves Mari's necklace on <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> alert them about their daughter. When John and Emma find Mari barely alive on their porch, and the necklace on the counter, they realize {{that the people who}} did this to Mari are in their house. As they try to find the key to their boat so that they can take Mari to the hospital, they decide to get revenge on those responsible. When Francis happens upon Mari, he is attacked and killed by John and Emma. When the couple go after Krug and Sadie, they find Justin in possession of Krug's gun; Justin gives the gun to John so that he can kill Krug. Sadie awakens and interrupts John, allowing Krug to escape from the couple: he then realizes that they are Mari's parents. After Emma shoots Sadie in the head, John chases Krug. With a combined effort from Emma, John, and Justin, Krug is knocked unconscious. John paralyzes Krug from the neck down and leaves him to die with his head in an active microwave oven (his head explodes), then he, Emma, Mari, and Justin take the boat to the local hospital.|$|E

500|$|A {{fortnight}} later, Arsenal {{played the}} second leg, with Adams {{returning to the}} side, deployed in a five-man defence. This did not keep Monchengladbach quiet, for it was they who scored the opening goal, through Juskowiak. Wright replied for Arsenal two minutes before the break and the team brought the aggregate scoreline level, when Merson [...] "pump home a cracking 25-yard drive into the top right-hand corner." [...] Effenberg equalised, by which point Arsenal had made attacking substitutions to score a third goal. Late in the match, Juskowiak scored his second on <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> <b>to</b> help Monchengladbach win 6–4 on aggregate score.

500|$|On {{the day of}} broadcast, The Mirror {{reported}} that EastEnders producers may have to re-write the episode or run a pre-recorded rehearsal tape rather than {{go ahead with the}} live transmission, as Turner was suffering from the flu and was unable to speak. In the event, Turner recovered enough to appear, though was given permission to whisper her lines if necessary. She was able to deliver her dialogue as planned, however was too ill to appear on EastEnders Live: The Aftermath following the episode. Turner commented that nothing could have stopped her from appearing in the episode, as the cast had worked so hard on it, and it was [...] "such a big part of TV history". Several errors were made during the transmission. Barbara Windsor as Peggy incorrectly called Janine [...] "June" [...] and Maslen stumbled over several of his lines. During the final scene, a camera was visibly jostled, sound became muffled and some zoom shots [...] "misfired". Following Bradley's fall, Wood was observed inserting his fingers into his throat to help him retch. The script called for Wood to be sick, though there was not enough time for him to put the liquid into his mouth, and he stated that a person would put their fingers into their throat anyway, [...] "to get it all out".

As a result a stopgap tank was required. The Type 3 Chi-Nu medium tank was developed to cope with the M4 Sherman. Finally, the first prototype Type 4 Chi-To was delivered in 1944. [...] Similar in appearance but significantly larger than the Type 97, it was the most advanced Japanese tank to reach production.|$|E

2500|$|This {{implies that}} a [...] "traditional combination" [...] of bread, beer, cheese, and pickle was popular before {{rationing}} in the United Kingdom (during and after World War II). In 1956, author Adrian Bell reported: [...] "There's a pub {{quite close to}} where I live where ... all you need say is, 'Ploughboy's Lunch, Harry, please'. And {{in a matter of}} minutes a tray is handed across <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> you on which is a good square hunk of bread, a lump of butter and a wedge of cheese, and pickled onions, along with your pint of beer". Only one year later, in June 1957, another edition of the Monthly Bulletin of the Brewers' Society, referred to a ploughman's lunch using exactly that name, and said that it consisted of [...] "cottage bread, cheese, lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, cold sausages and, of course, beer". The Glasgow newspaper The Bulletin from 15 April 1958 and The Times from 29 April 1958 refer to a ploughman's lunch consisting of bread, cheese and pickle.|$|E

In {{the case of the}} D 0 detector, the detector upgrade includes changes to the muon systems. Part of these changes is the addition of scintillation <b>counters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central muon trigger. These scintillation <b>counters</b> are referred <b>to</b> as <b>the</b> A-phi <b>counters.</b> NIU's contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> D 0 upgrade was to construct and test <b>the</b> small A-phi <b>counters.</b> <b>The</b> <b>counters</b> were tested for efficiency and for the location of the signal amplitude peak. The efficiency tests insured that all of <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> were usable on the detector and gave an initial idea of the kind of variation to be expected between <b>counters.</b> <b>The</b> signal amplitude tests were used to quantify the variation between <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> after <b>the</b> installation of the final phototubes.

2500|$|On Sunday 13 October {{experienced}} sailor Lieutenant Commander Peter Eden {{volunteered to}} accompany Crowhurst {{on his last}} leg from Cowes to Teignmouth. Crowhurst {{had fallen into the}} water several times while in Cowes, and as he and Eden climbed aboard Teignmouth Electron, he once again ended up in the water after slipping on the outboard bracket on the stern of the rubber dinghy. Eden's description of his two days with Crowhurst provides the most expert independent assessment available for both boat and sailor {{before the start of the}} race. He recalls that the trimaran sailed immensely swiftly, but could get no closer to the wind than 60 degrees. The speed often reached 12 knots, but the vibrations encountered caused the screws on the Hasler self-steering gear to come loose. Eden said, [...] "We had to keep leaning over <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> do up the screws. It was a tricky and time consuming business.

[...] Eden also commented that the Hasler worked superbly and the boat was [...] "certainly nippy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{theoretical}} {{issue that}} soon held center stage {{was the matter}} of taxation without representation. Benjamin Franklin had raised this {{as far back as}} 1754 at the Albany Congress when he wrote, [...] "That it is suppos’d an undoubted Right of Englishmen not to be taxed but by their own Consent given thro’ their Representatives. That the Colonies have no Representatives in Parliament." [...] <b>The</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> this argument was the theory of virtual representation. Thomas Whately enunciated this theory in a pamphlet that readily acknowledged that there could be no taxation without consent, but the facts were that at least 75% of British adult males were not represented in Parliament because of property qualifications or other factors. [...] Members of Parliament were bound to represent the interests of all British citizens and subjects, so colonists were the recipients of virtual representation in Parliament, like those disenfranchised subjects in the British Isles. [...] This theory, however, ignored a crucial difference between the unrepresented in Britain and the colonists. [...] The colonists enjoyed actual representation in their own legislative assemblies, and the issue was whether these legislatures, rather than Parliament, were in fact the sole recipients of the colonists' consent with regard to taxation.|$|E
