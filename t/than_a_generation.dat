5|$|The {{field of}} AI {{research}} was founded at a workshop {{held on the}} campus of Dartmouth College during the summer of 1956. Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the last}} European war of the old style, in which armies maneuvered sedately at a {{distance}} while diplomats hustled between capitals to resolve their Majesties' differences. Given the length of time—six months—the cost in life and treasure was high. In light of the scale of warfare experienced in Europe less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> later in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, though, this six-month engagement seems mild. Yet while historians often dismissed it {{as the last of}} the archaic mode of Ancien Régime warfare, elements of the war foreshadowed conflicts to come: the sheer sizes of the armies deployed reflected emerging abilities and willingness to conscript, train, equip and field larger armies than had been done in previous generations.|$|E

50|$|It is {{difficult}} for cults and sects to maintain their initial enthusiasm for more <b>than</b> about <b>a</b> <b>generation.</b> <b>As</b> children are born into the cult or sect, members begin to demand a more stable life. When this happens, cults tend to lose or de-emphasise many of their more radical beliefs, and become more open to the surrounding society; they then become denominations.|$|R
5000|$|Preserving intergenerational equity {{acknowledges}} natural fluctuations and {{regards as}} unsustainable only practices which damage the genetic structure destroy habitat, or deplete stock levels {{to the point}} where rebuilding requires more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> single <b>generation.</b> Providing rebuilding takes only one generation, overfishing may be economically foolish, but it is not unsustainable. This definition is widely accepted.|$|R
25|$|Mark Chaves, a Duke University {{professor}} of sociology, religion and divinity, found that 92% of Americans believed in God in 2008, but that significantly fewer Americans have great {{confidence in their}} religious leaders <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> ago.|$|E
25|$|Many leftist {{groups with}} close ties to the PRC were {{destroyed}} during the riots of 1967. The murder of radio host Lam Bun, in particular, outraged many Hong Kong residents. The credibility of the PRC and its local sympathisers among Hong Kong residents was severely damaged for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} health study Born in Bradford studied births {{in the city}} between 2007-2011 {{and found that the}} rate of birth defects was 3%, nearly twice the national average of 1.7%. The leading cause was found to be a 37% rate of consanguineous marriage among British Pakistanis, which had become more common <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> earlier. A contributing cause was babies born to mothers over 34 years of age.|$|E

50|$|Like many {{indigenous}} tribes, the Mehinaku do {{not keep}} detailed, chronological historical records going back more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few <b>generations.</b> The oldest known village {{established by the}} Mehinaku was set up at some time around or before 1850, and was called Yulutakitsi. Because the community no longer exists, however, {{the exact location of}} its former site is unknown.|$|R
60|$|With {{respect to}} the {{productiveness}} of the crossed and self-fertilised plants of the successive generations, my observations unfortunately were not made on any uniform plan, partly from the want of time, and partly from not having at first intended to observe more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> single <b>generation.</b> <b>A</b> summary of the results is here given in a tabulated form, the fertility of the crossed plants being taken as 100.|$|R
25|$|Although Cleomenes {{was mainly}} {{in charge of}} {{overseeing}} Alexandria's continuous development, the Heptastadion and the mainland quarters {{seem to have been}} primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined Tyre and becoming the center of the new commerce between Europe and the Arabian and Indian East, the city grew in less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> to be larger than Carthage. In a century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with Greek people from diverse backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|Blacks cleared land, selling {{timber and}} {{developing}} bottomland to achieve ownership. In 1900, two-thirds of farm owners in Mississippi were blacks, a major achievement {{for them and}} their families. Due to the poor economy, low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit, many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties. Two decades later, the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers. The low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> of African Americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debts.|$|E
25|$|The Normans {{thereafter}} {{adopted the}} growing feudal doctrines {{of the rest}} of France, and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both Normandy and in England. The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old French aristocracy, most of whom traced their lineage to Franks of the Carolingian dynasty. Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry, and by 1066 Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation.</b> Many Normans of Italy, France and England eventually served as avid Crusaders under the Italo-Norman prince Bohemund I and the Anglo-Norman king Richard the Lion-Heart.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{communities}} sprung up alongside Flagler’s railroad, including West Palm Beach in 1894. Miami, {{which consisted of}} about 400 inhabitants when the train arrived in 1896, grew into a thriving city of more <b>than</b> 29,000 residents <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> later.|$|R
50|$|The figs {{discovered}} at Gilgal lack embryonic seeds, a mutation {{that does not}} survive in nature more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> single <b>generation.</b> This suggests that the fig trees at Gilgal were artificially maintained by planting live branches in the ground, a horticultural technique known as vegetative propagation.

25|$|Hegel's {{influence}} was immense both within philosophy {{and in the}} other sciences. Throughout the 19th century many chairs of philosophy around Europe were held by Hegelians, and Søren Kierkegaard, Ludwig Feuerbach, Marx, and Friedrich Engels—among many others—were all deeply influenced by, but also strongly opposed to, many of the central themes of Hegel's philosophy. Scholars continue to find and point out Hegelian influences and approaches {{in a wide range of}} theoretical and/or learned works, such as Carl von Clausewitz's magnum opus on strategic thought, On War (1831). After less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation,</b> Hegel's philosophy was suppressed and even banned by the Prussian right-wing, and was firmly rejected by the left-wing in multiple official writings.|$|E
500|$|The oldest {{references}} to Nagar comes from Mari and tablets discovered at Nabada. However, {{the most important}} source on Nagar come from the archives of Ebla. Most of the texts record the ruler of Nagar using his title [...] "En", without mentioning a name. However a text from Ebla mentions Mara-Il, a king of Nagar; thus, {{he is the only}} ruler known by name for pre-Akkadian Nagar and ruled a little more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> before the kingdom's destruction.|$|E
500|$|Walters {{endorsed}} Smith. In the May run-off election, Smith defeated Griswold 56%-44%. [...] It was {{the first}} time that a candidate defeated someone who had resigned from the City Council to run for mayor in more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation.</b> Al Brooks was successful in 1983 and Willie Wong was successful in 1991. His first attempt at public office, Smith {{was the first}} person since 1966 to be elected mayor of Mesa without having first served on the Mesa City Council.|$|E
30|$|Most households, {{irrespective}} of their welfare status, depended on three {{major sources of}} income: sale of livestock (live animals), sale of livestock products and sale of charcoal/firewood. Rich households had a fourth source of income: wages that supported 50  % of these households. Dependence on charcoal/firewood {{as a source of}} income declined with improved welfare status, an indication that this activity was more of <b>a</b> coping strategy <b>than</b> <b>an</b> income <b>generation</b> activity.|$|R
50|$|The Speculum became {{central to}} the debate about astrology in the medieval, Renaissance, and early-modern periods, with {{its status as a}} source not declining until the early seventeenth century (Hendrix, 2007). For more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> dozen <b>generations</b> those who wrote upon astrology almost {{invariably}} cited the Speculum or used its arguments, whether to defend celestial divination, such as the 13th century physician Peter d'Abano did, or to attack it as did the 15th century humanist Pico della Mirandola.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} data {{appears to}} provide hints of an underlying high scale theory. These {{arise from the}} gauge coupling unification, from the smallness of the neutrino masses, and via a non-vanishing muon anomaly. An overview of high scale models is given {{with a view to}} possible tests at the Large Hadron Collider. Specifically we discuss here some generic approaches to deciphering their signatures. We also consider an out of the box possibility of <b>a</b> four <b>generation</b> model where the fourth <b>generation</b> is <b>a</b> mirror <b>generation</b> rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> sequential <b>generation.</b> Such <b>a</b> scenario can lead to some remarkably distinct signatures at the LHC. 1 Based on invited lectures at the 46 th Course at the International School of Subnuclea...|$|R
500|$|Attalus won an {{important}} {{victory over the}} Galatians, newly arrived Celtic tribes from Thrace, who had been, for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation,</b> plundering and exacting tribute throughout most of Asia Minor without any serious check. This victory, celebrated by the triumphal monument at Pergamon (famous for its Dying Gaul) and the liberation from the Gallic [...] "terror" [...] which it represented, earned for Attalus the name of [...] "Soter", and the title of [...] "king". A courageous and capable general and loyal ally of Rome, he {{played a significant role}} in the first and second Macedonian Wars, waged against Philip V of Macedon. He conducted numerous naval operations, harassing Macedonian interests throughout the Aegean, winning honors, collecting spoils, and gaining for Pergamon possession of the Greek islands of Aegina during the first war, and Andros during the second, twice narrowly escaping capture at the hands of Philip.|$|E
500|$|More immediately, {{although}} al-Mu'tasim's new professional army proved militarily highly effective, it also posed {{a potential}} {{danger to the}} stability of the Abbasid regime, as the army's separation from mainstream society meant that the soldiers were entirely reliant on the ʿaṭāʾ for their very survival. Consequently, any failure to provide their pay or policies that threatened their position were likely to cause a violent reaction. This became evident less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> later, during the [...] "Anarchy at Samarra" [...] (861–870), where the Turks played the main role. The need to cover military spending would henceforth be a fixture of caliphal government, and that at a time when government income began to decline rapidly—partly through the rise of autonomous dynasties in the provinces and partly through the decline in productivity of the lowlands of Iraq that had traditionally provided the bulk of tax revenue. Less than a century after al-Mu'tasim's death, this process would lead to the bankruptcy of the Abbasid government and the eclipse of the caliphs' political power with Ibn Ra'iq's rise to the position of amīr al-umarāʾ.|$|E

40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century the Jewish people, {{importing}} from Europe the notion of nationalism, laid the foundations for the realization of a dream of eighty preceding generations: the reconstitution of a separate Jewish entity in Zion.

5000|$|Although more {{progressive}} <b>than</b> <b>an</b> earlier <b>generation</b> of Protestant theologians, Roth was also deeply enmeshed in theology. Adluri and Bagchee argue that his newly created discipline of a so-called [...] "universal history of religions" [...] (allgemeine Religionsgeschichte) nominally secularized the discourse on religions, {{at the same}} time as it institutionalized Protestant ideas of religion (e.g., the idea of religious degeneracy, requiring a reformation to restore the true religion). Roth was additionally responsible for much of the criticisms of the tradition and anti-Brahmanism characteristic of German Indology.|$|R
25|$|The {{railways}} changed British {{society in}} numerous and complex ways. Although recent attempts {{to measure the}} economic significance of the railways have suggested that their overall contribution {{to the growth of}} GDP was more modest <b>than</b> <b>an</b> earlier <b>generation</b> of historians sometimes assumed, it is nonetheless clear that the railways had a sizeable impact in many spheres of economic activity. The building of railways and locomotives, for example, called for large quantities of heavy materials and thus provided a significant stimulus or ‘backward linkage’, to the coal-mining, iron-production, engineering and construction industries.|$|R
2500|$|Bowles had a cameo {{appearance}} {{at the beginning and}} end of the film version of The Sheltering Sky (1990), directed by Bernardo Bertolucci.

50|$|Because {{they are}} things of continual {{discovery}} and re-invention, {{science and technology}} have historically generated forms of speech and writing which have dated and fallen into disuse relatively quickly.

50|$|Armenians in Egypt are a {{community}} with a long history. They are a minority with their own language, churches, and social institutions. The number of Armenians in Egypt has decreased due to migrations to other countries and integration {{into the rest of}} Egyptian society, including extensive intermarriage with Muslims and Copts. Today they number about 6000, much smaller <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few <b>generations</b> ago. They are concentrated in Cairo and Alexandria, the two largest cities. Economically the Egyptian Armenians have tended to be self-employed businessmen or craftsmen and to have more years of education than the Egyptian average.|$|R
50|$|Spaniards in Equatorial Guinea did not {{generally}} immigrate {{with the intent}} of permanently establishing themselves, but rather of working for a given time period, and nearly always returned to Spain. The result was a reduced sense of permanency, and a greater bilateral contact between Spain and expatriate Spaniards in Guinea. Even though a number of Spaniards were born in Guinea, few considered themselves as anything other than Spaniards, similar to their countrymen in the Canary Islands or Ifni, and there were few families that had lived continuously in Spanish Guinea for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> single <b>generation.</b>|$|R
