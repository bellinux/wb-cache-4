25|$|These {{goals for}} {{structural}} change could have improved {{the efficiency of}} resource allocation while doing {{a great deal to}} lessen poverty. But the goals clearly required both time and the ability to restore expansion without worsening inflation and external deficits. The government initially emphasized such macroeconomic objectives as necessary conditions for the structural changes. The first step was to stop the built-in inflationary process, but <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> adopting orthodox measures of monetary and fiscal restraint.|$|E

Scientology leaders announced that {{his body had}} become an impediment to his work {{and that he had}} decided to [...] "drop his body" [...] to continue his research on another planet, having [...] "learned how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> a body".|$|E
500|$|En Esch, {{one of the}} {{longtime}} core members of KMFDM, had almost {{nothing to do with}} Xtort, contributing to just two songs. With regard to Esch's lack of participation, Konietzko said, [...] "En Esch is just En Esch. He never made himself available to do this album, and so it's always my belief that the thing must keep moving; I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> him."

500|$|Chaiken also didn't want {{to portray}} Jenny's ordeal in an {{explicit}} manner, confirming this she said: [...] "I am loath to portray rape as a filmmaker. I {{think it is}} really hard <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> somehow becoming complicit and exploitative. And so as much as it's important to talk about it, I wanted to be vague and not milk it." [...] Chaiken has also admitted {{that the use of}} dream sequences involving Jenny were not a successful inclusion, but claimed it was necessary to portray Jenny coming to terms with her abuse. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen criticized the storyline because there was no conclusion to it, also stating it was never explored enough, leading everyone to think she was just a jerk.|$|E
500|$|Following Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na, Khan {{starred in}} Sanjay Gadhvi's thriller Kidnap. He was cast as Kabir Sharma, a {{kidnapper}} who abducts {{a girl to}} settle an old score with her father, played by Minissha Lamba and Sanjay Dutt, respectively. The actor was initially hesitant to play the part (calling it [...] "tricky and tough") because he couldn't relate to the character; according to him, {{he would not have}} been able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> Gadhvi's support and backing. In preparation for his role, Khan listened to metal and rock music for a year to become aggressive. While the film was a critical failure, his performance was generally well received by critics. Gaurav Malani, in a review for The Economic Times, wrote: [...] "Imran Khan is effective as the intelligent abductor who's always two steps ahead of his opponent. However, the natural actor could go easy on his lip movements that appear synthetic at times." [...] Kidnap was also a commercial failure.|$|E

[...] "We achieved much more than we had ever imagined, so I'm content with what we did. Individually, of course, there's so much left to do and it'll be a challenge <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> the band – but it's also exciting {{at the same time to}} map out a new plan. Right now it's too early to think about my musical future, so I'll cross that bridge when I reach it." [...] said Omar Bilal Akhtar. Where as, Yasir Qureshi and Ali Alam said that would continue to pursue their career as musicians. On 14 May, The Express Tribune released an article about the history of the band and suggesting the band as one of the most active band's from Karachi coming to an end.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{read the}} {{emphatic}} words of [...] "you shall surely release it," [...] repeating the verb in the Hebrew, to teach that [...] required a passer-by to unload an enemy's animal {{to let it}} get up and to reload the animal.

[...] If {{the owner of the}} animal simply sat down and said to the passer-by that the obligation rested upon the passer-by to unload, then the passer-by was exempt, because [...] says, [...] "with him." [...] Yet if the animal's owner was old or infirm, the passer-by was bound <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> the owner's help. The Mishnah taught that [...] required the passer-by to unload the animal, but not to reload it. But Rabbi Simeon said that [...] required the passer-by to load it too.

2500|$|ABC {{required}} Wallenda to wear {{a safety}} harness for the walk. After {{the decision was made}} in mid-May, a spokesperson for ABC explained: [...] "We had always made clear from the beginning that significant safety precautions would need to be taken. This is the outcome of that." [...] Wallenda was not happy about the decision, stating [...] "It's disheartening—I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>without</b> anything." [...] The Niagara Parks Commission indicated it was unaware of such a requirement when they were considering approval. [...] During the walk, Wallenda told his dad that he felt [...] "like a jackass" [...] wearing the harness. Many observers predicted he would remove the harness partway through the walk, but ultimately he did not do so. Before the crossing, Wallenda had promised that he only would remove the harness if it became a hazard during the walk. [...] "When I first found out about it, {{there was no doubt in}} my mind I was going to take it off", he later said. [...] "But as [...] got closer and closer, I realized I had to honor my word. I've always said I'm a man of integrity." [...] He also acknowledged that removing the harness would have created contractual problems with ABC. [...] "The way a TV network works, if something goes wrong, they fire people," [...] he said. [...] "If I would have dropped that tether, four people would have been fired because I'm too selfish to care or because it's all about me." [...] In addition to the harness, Wallenda wore a waterproof track suit and shoes custom made by his mother for the walk. Part moccasin, part ballet shoe, the shoes were designed to get a good grip when wet.|$|E
