5|$|Although the {{breakout}} crew in {{the weapons}} storage began to inspect <b>the</b> <b>missiles,</b> an early-arriving transport crew hooked up the pylons and towed them away without inspecting or ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> had been inspected or cleared for removal. The munitions control center failed {{to verify that}} the pylon had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the pylon for loading on the B-52 at 0925. After taking eight hours to attach the pylons, the aircraft with <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without the special guard required for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2007, six AGM-129 ACM cruise missiles, each {{loaded with}} a W80-1 {{variable}} yield nuclear warhead, were mistakenly loaded onto a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H heavy bomber at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and transported to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The nuclear warheads in <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> {{were supposed to}} have been removed before <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> were taken from their storage bunker. <b>The</b> <b>missiles</b> with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Larry Hagman and Rex Reed {{also make}} cameos; Hagman plays an army major {{in charge of}} a convoy that is {{transporting}} one of <b>the</b> <b>missiles,</b> and Reed plays himself as he meets Lois and Clark outside the Daily Planet headquarters.|$|E
50|$|Tracking the flares on <b>the</b> <b>missile,</b> <b>the</b> pilot {{would then}} guide <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> {{optically}} (<b>the</b> <b>missile's</b> engine was smokeless as to not obscure the view) with a joystick towards the target. Guidance commands were transmitted to <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> via a jam-proof radio transmission link.|$|R
50|$|The AS-30 has a {{two-stage}} solid-fuel rocket motor. A short-burn-time booster section exhausts {{through two}} large nozzles located midway between the rear edges of <b>the</b> <b>missile's</b> large fins, after which a longer-burn-time sustainer ignites, and exhausts through a nozzle {{located at the}} center of the back of <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> body. As with the AS-20, the AS-30 uses a simple MCLOS guidance with the pilot aligning the flares located near <b>the</b> <b>missile's</b> rear with <b>the</b> target and controlling <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> in flight after launch with a small joystick, sending steering commands to <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> via a radio link. The steering commands steer <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> back to <b>the</b> line-of-sight by thrust vectoring, by the movement of one of four metal vanes around the sustainer nozzle. <b>The</b> <b>missile's</b> internal gyro gives <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> command unit <b>the</b> correct position of <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> in flight, so each of the four thrust vanes can actuate at the correct time to steer <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> back to <b>the</b> correct flight path.|$|R
50|$|The main rocket was angled {{downward}} at 45 {{degrees in}} order to give <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> <b>the</b> necessary lift and to propel <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> forward. While <b>the</b> six “tangential rocket nozzles” stabilized <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> by controlling <b>the</b> pitch, roll, and yaw. While in flight <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> is guided by means of joystick and binoculars.|$|R
5|$|The RAF {{activated}} 20 squadrons between September 1958 and December 1959 {{to operate}} the 120 Thor missiles. They were located at 20 old wartime airfields so that {{the government did not}} have to purchase the land. Each missile was supplied with its own Mark 49 warhead, a variant of the Mark 28 with a thinner and lighter casing. While the Thor missile bases were manned by the RAF, the warheads were supplied under Project E. Each one had a USAF authorisation officer. <b>The</b> <b>missiles</b> used a dual key system, one of which was held by the authorisation officer. Occasionally a missile would be chosen for test firing, for which the missile and its RAF crew would be flown to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Twelve test firings were conducted between 6 October 1959 and 12 June 1962. Under the original agreement, the USAF paid the cost of maintenance for <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> for five years. After a debate over costs and benefits, the Air Council decided on 31 May 1962 that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963. <b>The</b> <b>missiles</b> were returned to the United States.|$|E
5|$|After a fight, Storm Shadow and the Baroness {{retrieve}} the warheads {{and take them}} to Baron DeCobray, the Baroness's husband, for him to weaponize. Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue the Baroness and Storm Shadow, but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching one of <b>the</b> <b>missiles.</b> The missile hits the Eiffel Tower and releases the nanomites in it, destroying the tower and some of the surrounding area before Duke manages to hit the kill switch. However, in so doing, he is captured and taken to McCullen's base under the Arctic.|$|E
5|$|An {{operation}} is {{launched by the}} task force {{to take back the}} site from Zakhaev’s forces via halo jump. However, Zakhaev promptly launches nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, with the potential of causing 41 million casualties. The SAS and Force Recon, however, manage to breach the facility, seize the command room and remotely destroy <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> over the Atlantic Ocean. They escape in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>missile</b> is {{launched}} {{from an open}} framed launcher at an angle of 15 degrees. The operator steers <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> using a control box, which sends commands down a wire that is trailed from <b>the</b> <b>missile.</b> A gyroscope in <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> compensates for pitch and yaw.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>missile</b> was {{successfully}} tested without control and guidance systems on 9 May to 12 May 2003. <b>The</b> <b>missile</b> was again successfully tested on 25 March 2007. On 27 March, vertical launch of <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> was carried out, suggesting {{the use of}} <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> as a long-range surface-to-air <b>missile</b> for <b>the</b> Indian Navy to arm its destroyers and frigates and for the Indian Air Force. The ground testing of <b>the</b> Astra <b>missile</b> was successful. <b>The</b> <b>missile</b> {{was successfully}} tested on 13 September 2008.|$|R
50|$|In {{its basic}} {{infantry}} form, the system comprises a missile {{in a sealed}} tube which is inserted into a launch tube prior to use. When the target is sighted and <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> is fired, <b>the</b> launch motor fires through the rear nozzle propelling <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> from <b>the</b> tube. As <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> exits <b>the</b> launch tube first four wings just forward of the flight motor spring open forwards followed by four tail control surfaces which flip open rearwards as <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> completely exits <b>the</b> launch tube. At approximately 50-65 meters downrange the flight motor ignites and boosts <b>the</b> <b>missile's</b> speed to approximately 600 miles per hour (or 1000 kilometers per hour). IR sensors bore-sighted to the optical sight continuously monitor {{the position of a}} IR source on <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> relative to <b>the</b> line-of-sight, and generates error signals which are sent via the command link to <b>the</b> <b>missile's</b> integral guidance unit. <b>The</b> <b>missile's</b> guidance unit then corrects the trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> via <b>the</b> control surface actuators.|$|R
5|$|As {{the crisis}} unfolded, {{tensions}} were {{high in the}} U.S.; less so in the Soviet Union, where Khrushchev made several public appearances, {{and went to the}} Bolshoi Theatre to hear American opera singer Jerome Hines, who was then performing in Moscow. By 25 October, with the Soviets unclear about Kennedy's full intentions, Khrushchev decided that <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> would have to be withdrawn from Cuba. Two days later, he offered Kennedy terms for the withdrawal. Khrushchev agreed to withdraw <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> in exchange for a U.S. promise not to invade Cuba and a secret promise that the U.S. would withdraw missiles from Turkey, near the Soviet heartland. As the last term was not publicly announced {{at the request of the}} U.S., and was not known until just before Khrushchev's death in 1971, the resolution was seen as a great defeat for the Soviets, and contributed to Khrushchev's fall less than two years later. Castro had urged Khrushchev to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the U.S. in the event of any invasion of Cuba, and was angered by the outcome, referring to Khrushchev in profane terms.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the missile and the need for extensive testing prior to launch, the V-2's designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> could be stored, armed, and fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant before launching. But the German Army and the V-2 project's head, Major-General Walter Dornberger, were concerned that the sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies. The Army's preferred option was to use Meillerwagens, mobile firing batteries, which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces.|$|E
5|$|Militarily {{weaker than}} NATO, Khrushchev wanted to install Soviet R-12 MRBM nuclear {{missiles}} on Cuba {{to even the}} power balance. Although conflicted, Castro agreed, believing it would guarantee Cuba's safety and enhance the cause of socialism. Undertaken in secrecy, only the Castro brothers, Guevara, Dorticós and security chief Ramiro Valdés knew the full plan. Upon discovering it through aerial reconnaissance, in October the U.S. implemented an island-wide quarantine to search vessels headed to Cuba, sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis. The U.S. saw <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> as offensive; Castro insisted they were for defense only. Castro urged Khrushchev to threaten a nuclear strike on the U.S. should Cuba be attacked, but Khrushchev was desperate to avoid nuclear war. Castro was {{left out of the}} negotiations, in which Khruschev agreed to remove <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> in exchange for a U.S. commitment not to invade Cuba and an understanding that the U.S. would remove their MRBMs from Turkey and Italy. Feeling betrayed by Khruschev, Castro was furious and soon fell ill. Proposing a five-point plan, Castro demanded that the U.S. end its embargo, withdraw from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, cease supporting dissidents, and stop violating Cuban air space and territorial waters. Presenting these demands to U Thant, visiting Secretary-General of the United Nations, the U.S. ignored them, and in turn Castro refused to allow the U.N.'s inspection team into Cuba.|$|E
5000|$|When {{launched}} <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> is propelled {{from the}} launch tube at around 72 {{meters per second}} by a gas generator {{at the rear of}} the launch tube. Once <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> is clear of the launch tube the sustainer motor engages and accelerates <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> to a speed of 250 meters per second. Once <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> is about 400 meters from the launcher, the sustainer motor cuts out and <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> continues in free flight.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>missile</b> is transported and {{launched}} from a glass-reinforced plastic tube. <b>The</b> <b>missile</b> uses a Soyuz NPO solid-rocket sustainer, {{with a small}} booster stage to launch <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> from its tube.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Wagtail <b>missile</b> was {{intended}} to be fitted with a guidance system that utilised an inertial navigation system and a terrain-following radar, which allowed <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> to be fired from and navigate at extremely low altitudes. <b>The</b> <b>missile</b> was equipped with small retrorockets that retarded <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> following release, allowing the launching aircraft the opportunity to escape the blast wave from <b>the</b> <b>missile's</b> warhead.|$|R
5|$|North Vietnam's {{deployment}} of SAMs forced American pilots to make hard choices: either approach targets at higher altitudes (to avoid anti-aircraft fire) and become prey to SAMs, or fly lower to avoid <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> {{and become the}} target of anti-aircraft batteries. Due to altered tactics and {{the increased use of}} electronic radar jamming, the record of SAM kills decreased over time. The already dismal missile success rate fell from one kill in 30 launches to less than one kill in 50.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 1962, President Kennedy {{ordered a}} naval {{quarantine}} of Cuba {{in response to}} the presence of Soviet missiles on the soil of that island nation. Yancey sortied in support of the American operations in the Caribbean, and remained on station until <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> were removed and tensions were relaxed. Over the next few years, Yancey made regular deployments to the Mediterranean to take part in joint exercises with NATO forces.|$|E
5|$|Salinger then accompanies Wexler to Istanbul, where Skarssen {{is buying}} the crucial {{components}} from their only other manufacturer. Salinger attempts {{to record the}} conversation {{so that he can}} obstruct the deal by proving to the buyers that <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> will be useless, but he ultimately fails. Both Wexler and Skarssen are then killed by a hitman contracted by Enzo and Mario Calvini to avenge their father's murder by the bank. Salinger is left stunned, his investigation, pursuit, and determination to bring down the IBBC, have led him to nothing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>missile</b> uses a {{multi-function}} doppler-monopulse active radar seeker {{developed by}} OAO Agat. The radar features two modes of operation, over short distances, <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> will launch in an active [...] "fire-and-forget" [...] mode. Over longer distances <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> {{is controlled by}} an inertial guidance auto pilot with occasional encoded data link updates from the launch aircraft's radar on changes in spatial position or G of the target. As <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> comes within 20 km of its target, <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> switches to its active radar mode. The host radar system maintains computed target information in case the target breaks <b>the</b> <b>missile's</b> lock-on.|$|R
50|$|Commands {{from the}} {{joystick}} are relayed to <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> along <b>the</b> trailing wires, these commands are amplified {{by a small}} transistor circuit in <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> and are routed to vibrating spoilers on {{the trailing edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>missile's</b> four wings based on the direction of the command and the gyro-sensed orientation of <b>the</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>missile</b> {{is fired}} from <b>the</b> M171 <b>missile</b> launcher. First <b>the</b> seeker is cooled to {{operating}} temperature {{and then the}} operator begins to visually track the target using the sight unit on the launcher. Once the target is locked onto by <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> a buzzer in the launcher hand grip begins vibrating, alerting the operator. The operator then presses the trigger, which fires the initial booster stage and launches <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> out of <b>the</b> tube at a speed of around 80 feet per second (25 m/s). As <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> leaves <b>the</b> tube spring-loaded fins pop out, four stabilizing tail fins {{at the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>missile,</b> and two control surfaces at the front of <b>the</b> <b>missile.</b> Once <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> has travelled six meters, the sustainer motor ignites. The sustainer motor takes <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> to its peak velocity of Mach 1.7 in 5.8 seconds. 1.25 seconds after the sustainer is ignited, the warhead is armed.|$|R
5|$|The RAF {{high command}} never warmed to missiles, and always ranked them {{secondary}} to the V-bomber force. The missile bases were separate {{from the rest of}} the RAF and its personnel considered outside the mainstream. Project Emily gave the RAF considerable experience in missile operations, but the cancellation of Blue Streak on 2 February 1960 in favour of Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, rendered this expertise of dubious value. Given the amount of time and money spent on Thor, consideration was given to extending the deployment. Responding to the arguments made for and against Blue Streak, there were proposals for improving Thor. If <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> were already fuelled, then they could be launched in as little as 60 seconds, but they could only remain fuelled for two hours, after which components froze from contact with the liquid oxygen. <b>The</b> <b>missiles</b> then needed six hours to thaw out. It was impractical to base them underground, but being above ground made them very vulnerable to a nuclear attack. Yet the twenty Thor missiles squadrons were equivalent to seven and a half squadrons of V-bombers. Without them, there would be just fourteen V-bombers on quick alert.|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} catapults resembling windmills, {{that can}} fire rapidly, and a ballista that can fire three projectiles at a time. The practical versions {{of these were}} metal with fibreglass painted and aged to resemble wood on top. Weta created props of <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> thrown by the Telmarine equipment. The practical version of the catapult had its upper half painted blue, to composite a digital version programmed for rapid firing movement.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>missiles</b> were {{launched}} {{three days after}} Clinton testified on the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused Clinton of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie Wag the Dog, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.|$|E
50|$|Blowpipe was {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> Javelin surface-to-air <b>missile,</b> which was of a generally similar design but with an improved performance and a semi-automatic guidance system (SACLOS) - the operator now controls <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> by keeping <b>the</b> target in his sight, and the aiming unit steers <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> to remain centered in the sight. A computer in <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> launcher calculates <b>the</b> difference between the current aim spot and <b>the</b> <b>missile's</b> location, and sends commands to <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> via radio {{to bring it to}} an impact point.|$|R
5000|$|After <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> {{was about}} 30-50 meters from <b>the</b> gunner, <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> was {{propelled}} forward and guided towards the target by 3 rows of thrusters aligned longitudinally along <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> body. <b>The</b> rocket spiraled {{as it moved}} forward, and the thrusters were fired in pairs to move <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> forward as well as keep <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> on target. These were activated by the sight controller which sent signals from the sight mechanism to <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> along <b>the</b> wire which spooled out behind <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> and remained connected to the sight. The operator kept the sight crosshairs on the target; the sight tracked the infrared flare and sent corrections to <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> service motor to bring the flight of <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> to <b>the</b> aim point. The service charges were fired as needed both to keep <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> correcting toward <b>the</b> aim point and to keep it up and moving forward. A missile moving towards a stationary target and tracked by a steady gunner would fire the thrusters about every [...]5 to 1 second, resulting in its signature 'popping' sound as it moved downrange. If the operator over-corrected his aim point beyond the service motor's capability to keep up, <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> grounded itself. Conversely, if the guidance wire broke, <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> would fire its rockets rapidly, sending <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> into a rapid ascent. This was a recoilless weapon—the launcher did not [...] "kick" [...] per se when fired—but the sudden loss of <b>the</b> 30 lb <b>missile</b> weight from <b>the</b> shoulder caused many soldiers to flinch badly enough to lose track of the target, resulting in a missile grounding.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> is launched, <b>the</b> {{solid rocket}} {{propellant}} booster accelerates {{the speed of}} <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> to Mach 0.9 in a few seconds. After the booster burns out, it detaches from <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> body and <b>the</b> <b>missile's</b> turbojet engine starts. Controlled by the inertial autopilot system and radio altimeter, <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> flies at a cruising speed of Mach 0.9, and the cruise altitude is reduced to 10-20 metres (depending on the sea state) from the original 20-30 metres of the C-801/YJ-81.|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II Germany {{introduced}} the V-1 cruise missile and V-2 ballistic missiles in combat against the Allied forces. <b>The</b> <b>missiles</b> arrived too late to alter {{the course of the}} war, but after the fall of Nazi Germany the V-1 and V-2 rockets would form the foundations for the space race and for the policy of Mutually Assured Destruction by providing each superpower with Ballistic Missiles and Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles that could carry nuclear warheads.|$|E
5|$|When Amato breaks his {{telephone}} in a rage, he finds {{one of the}} surveillance devices. Tubbs quickly calls him, claiming to have been bugged as well, and the two arrange to move the buy to that evening. Amato is noticeably on-edge during the meet, and is desperate to unload <b>the</b> <b>missiles.</b> The buy is set to {{take place at the}} docks, and the remainder of the Metro-Dade vice squad arrive with federal agents to complete the bust, taking Amato into custody safely.|$|E
5|$|When {{the system}} was first being {{proposed}} {{it was not clear}} whether the phased-array systems could provide the accuracy needed to guide <b>the</b> <b>missiles</b> to a successful interception at very long ranges. Early concepts retained Zeus Missile Tracking Radars and Target Tracking Radars (MTRs and TTRs) for this purpose. In the end, the MAR proved more than capable of the required resolution, and these additional radars were dropped.|$|E
2500|$|To launch <b>the</b> <b>missile,</b> <b>the</b> carrier vessel had {{to surface}} and deploy <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> and launch apparatus, which {{consisted}} of a zero length launcher. Once deployed, <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> had {{to be linked to}} the submarine or ship's navigation system to align the inertial navigation system and input target co-ordinates. With the navigation system ready and launch authorisation given, <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> engine would be run-up to full power with afterburner and the large solid-fuelled rocket booster ignited, immediately <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> would leave <b>the</b> zero length launcher and [...] continue to the target autonomously.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>missile</b> {{jettison}} alarm on Ohio-class submarines {{does not}} have a handle like other submarine alarms. It is a key-activated alarm that only sounds upon energizing <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> jettison panel located in <b>the</b> <b>Missile</b> Control Center.|$|R
50|$|Command {{guidance}} {{is a type}} {{of missile}} guidance in which a ground station or aircraft relay signals to a guided missile via radio control (or, in a wire-guided missile, through a wire connecting <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> to <b>the</b> launcher) and tell <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> where to steer in order to intercept its target. Additionally, it is possible to send a command to <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> to detonate, even if <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> itself has a fuze or fuzes. (It may be possible to detonate <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> and destroy or damage the target, even though <b>the</b> <b>missile</b> was not actually going to strike the target, due to the blast radius of the warhead).|$|R
