Girls are learning to use porn and porn archetypes to impress boys as early as middle school.|$|E

The Akan are noted for their expertise in several forms of craftwork, particularly their weaving, wood carving, ceramics, fertility dolls, metallurgy and kente cloth). Traditional kente cloth is woven in complex patterns of bright, narrow strips. It is woven outdoors, exclusively by men. It outdoors the dignity and pride of the people when <b>they</b> <b>dress</b> in it. In fact, the manufacture of many Akan crafts is restricted to male specialists. Pottery-making is the only craft that is primarily a female activity; men usually fashion pots or pipes depicting anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{individuals}} may actually {{find it easier}} to escape situations of abuse in the United States than they would have in their countries of origin. Among some immigrants there is much criticism {{of the way in which}} women in particular have been changed by American culture. Women may be seen as too Americanized because of the way <b>they</b> <b>dress</b> or their lack of deference to men. The general support for gender equality within American society can undermine traditional power hierarchies within the family in which men had control over the actions of women. One of the ways that such power is undermined is through the presence of laws against domestic violence. In some patriarchal societies, husbands may have complete control over their wives, including control over their bodies. U.S. laws do not support this sort of arrangement and women who are aware of their rights can utilize formal legal institutions to combat such gender imbalances within the family. The ability of government authorities to intervene in the realm of the family can undermine the traditional power balance and leave men feeling dispossessed.|$|E
500|$|Wishing {{to depict}} Jessica as the [...] "Extreme Female", Chase {{emphasizes}} her clothing and gives Dain [...] "a chance to exercise his caustic wit", as he deems the latest fashions to be ridiculous. Upon {{their first meeting}} he silently observes that Jessica is wearing [...] "a blue overgarment of some sort {{and one of the}} hideously overdecorated bonnets currently in fashion". Jessica differs from many other Chase heroines by being interested in fashion; the author felt that [...] "the way <b>they</b> <b>dress,</b> to a great extent, tells us who they are, {{in the same way that}} other heroines’ simpler or less fashionable attire expresses something about them".|$|E

[...] Their music {{was described by}} Asiaweek as having [...] "an angry sound that rejected the cookie-cutter principles of Japanese society." [...] In 1998, Radio and TV host Bryan Burton-Lewis explained [...] "In Japan, the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going through a rebellion phase. They put their life into being X fans: <b>they</b> <b>dress</b> like it, they breathe it." [...] In the documentary Global Metal, Yoshiki stated that the music industry and media hated the band and would not even interview them, [...] "but eventually we sold 20 million albums, so they had no choice." ...|$|E
500|$|Butters {{confesses to}} writing the novel himself. However, Stan {{and the boys}} are furious to learn that {{not only do the}} South Park adults love the book, a {{publisher}} has agreed to sign Butters for a book deal. The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs becomes a huge success, and everybody who reads it vomits profusely, but declares it a masterpiece nonetheless. As Butters becomes a literary icon, the four boys unsuccessfully campaign to have the book banned. They are angered to find readers interpreting passages from the novel as allegories for contentious political issues, even though the boys never intended to convey such messages. Since the book made many references to the supposed unattractiveness of actress Sarah Jessica Parker, Cartman and Kenny plan to get her killed, believing the negative publicity will cause the book to be banned. <b>They</b> <b>dress</b> Parker as a moose (by simply putting antlers on her head), then leave her out in the woods during hunting season.|$|E

5000|$|Besharmi Morcha, {{also known}} as [...] "Slutwalk arthaat Besharmi Morcha", is the Indian {{equivalent}} of SlutWalk.

2500|$|Ade Varney, {{creator of}} the petition, said that goths [...] "get verbal assaults every day, and not just from young people. But now younger {{teenagers}} have the mentality of hardened criminals, and I definitely sense this violent aspect getting worse.... Sophie's death has made people think, and I have heard of teenagers, especially girls, modifying the way <b>they</b> <b>dress</b> when they walk through certain areas". [...] This led to political developments: [...] "Rossendale MP Janet Anderson and Hyndburn MP Greg Pope are set to request a debate in the Commons to call for the widening of the law to include such an attack under {{the definition of a}} hate crime as soon as possible. They will also be putting forward an early day motion calling on the government to give the matter [...] "urgent consideration"".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the prologue}} to The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien writes that hobbits are between [...] tall, the average height being [...] <b>They</b> <b>dress</b> in bright colours, favouring yellow and green. Nowadays (according to Tolkien's fiction), {{they are usually}} shy, but are {{nevertheless}} capable of great courage and amazing feats under the proper circumstances. They are adept with slings and throwing stones. For the most part, they cannot grow beards, {{but a few of}} the race of Stoor can. Their feet are covered with curly hair (usually brown, as is the hair on their heads) with leathery soles, so most hobbits hardly ever wear shoes. The race's average life expectancy is 100 years. Two Hobbits, Bilbo Baggins and the Old Took, are described as living to the age of 130 or beyond, though Bilbo's long lifespan owes much to his possession of the One Ring. Hobbits are considered to [...] "come of age" [...] on their 33rd birthday, so a 50-year-old hobbit would be regarded as entering middle-age.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} John Stalker, Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester {{in the early}} 1980s and himself a Detective Inspector in 1973, has stated that the depiction of the police [...] "has {{got nothing to do}} with real policing in the 1970s. It could not be more inaccurate in terms of procedure, the way they talk or the way <b>they</b> <b>dress.</b> In all the time I was in the CID in the 1970s I never saw a copper in a leather bomber jacket and I never heard an officer call anyone 'guv'.... Actually, there were a few police officers in London who started to behave like Regan and Carter in The Sweeney, but that was a case of life following art, not the other way round". The journalist who interviewed Stalker, Ray King, remarks that the depiction of the police can be defended if we assume that Sam is indeed in a coma and that we are seeing his imaginary idea of 1973, filtered through 1970s cop shows.|$|E

2500|$|Tony's First Communion {{experience}} {{leaves him}} disillusioned {{as he did}} not receive the spiritual knowledge he had expected. He begins to question {{the value of the}} Catholic Church, concentrated on the Virgin Mary and a Father God, and on ritual, as unable to answer his moral and metaphysical dilemmas. At the same time, realizing that the Church represents the female values of his mother, Tony cannot bring himself to accept the lawlessness, violence and unthinking sensuality which his father and older brothers symbolize. Instead through his relationship with Ultima, he discovers a oneness with nature. Through his discovery that [...] "All is One" [...] he is able to resolve the major existential conflict in his life.One day, while socializing with his friends they tell him the story of the Golden Carp. Antonio also continues to be an example for the children, who praise his religious savant as <b>they</b> <b>dress</b> him as a priest while preparing for first communion. [...] Antonio’s admiration for Ultima strengthens as he continues to question his faith, hoping to understand once he takes communion for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|..... they artfully produce, {{both for}} {{themselves}} and for their wives and children, clothing beflowered and wrought with ten thousand objects....When, therefore, <b>they</b> <b>dress</b> themselves and appear in public, they look like pictured walls {{in the eyes of}} those that meet them. And perhaps even the children surround them, smiling to one another and pointing out with the finger the picture on the garment; and walk along after them, following them for a long time. On these garments are lions and leopards; bears and bulls and dogs; woods and rocks and hunters ... You may see the wedding of Galilee, and the water-pots; the paralytic carrying his bed on his shoulders; the blind man being healed with the clay; the woman with the bloody issue, taking hold of the border of the garment; the sinful woman falling at the feet of Jesus; Lazarus returning to life from the grave. In doing this they consider that they are acting piously and are clad in garments pleasing to God. But if they take my advice let them sell those clothes and honour the living image of God. Do not picture Christ on your garments. It is enough that he once suffered the humiliation of dwelling in a human body which of his own accord he assumed for our sakes. So, not upon your robes but upon your soul carry about his image.|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky {{returned}} as the costume designer for Jessica Jones from Daredevil, and was assisted {{on the first}} episode by Jenn Rogien, who crafted Jessica Jones' costume of leather jacket, faded jeans, and boots. Maslansky's fashion choices for each character were influenced by their comic incarnations, with her saying, [...] "You really have to study your history of the original characters and see how <b>they</b> <b>dress,</b> how they were originally drawn, how they evolved through the years in these comics. And what you might discover is that, as illustrated, they kind of do wear the same thing all the time." [...] Maslansky also stated that [...] "everyone has a very specific look, and you can vary within that look, but it’s not over the top. It has to feel realistic and feel very grounded in this authentic reality we’ve created in Hell’s Kitchen." [...] On Jones' costume, Maslansky said she [...] "considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from {{having to deal with}} the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way." [...] At least 10 versions of Jones' jacket were made, which started as an Acne Studios leather motorcycle jacket that had any [...] "bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details" [...] removed, while 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both being aged and distressed.|$|E
60|$|He {{crouched}} down between the sheets, glad of their tepid glow. He heard the fellows talk among themselves {{about him as}} <b>they</b> <b>dressed</b> for mass. It was a mean thing to do, to shoulder him into the square ditch, they were saying.|$|R
