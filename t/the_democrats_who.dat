5|$|Major {{political}} differences between Democrats and Republicans and wartime propaganda caused many Hoosiers to become suspicious of dissenters and fearful of potential insurrections, especially from secret societies {{sympathetic to the}} South. During the Indianapolis city election In May, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>who</b> decided a fair election could not be held, withdrew their ticket. Only 14 votes were cast for Democratic candidates in the nine Indianapolis wards.|$|E
5|$|Morton's moves caused {{considerable}} rage among <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>who</b> {{launched a}} vicious {{attack on the}} governor. He responded by accusing his Democratic opponents of treason. Following {{the suppression of the}} General Assembly in 1862, Morton asked General Henry B. Carrington for assistance in organizing the state's levies for service. He also established an intelligence network under Carrington's leadership to deal with rebel sympathizers affiliated with the Knights of the Golden Circle, and, beginning in 1863, the American Knights, which merged with the Sons of Liberty. Members of these secret groups included Democrats and others who supported states-rights and opposed the Union cause during the war. Carrington succeeded in keeping the state secure, but his operatives also carried out arbitrary arrests, suppressed freedom of speech and freedom of association, and generally maintained repressive control over the southern-sympathetic minority. In an incident that would later be referred to as the Battle of Pogue's Run, Morton had soldiers disrupt a Democratic state convention, where many leaders of the Democratic Party were arrested, detained, or threatened. Morton also urged pro-war Democrats to abandon their party in the name of unity {{for the duration of the}} war, and met with some success. Former governor Joseph A. Wright was among <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>who</b> had been expelled from the party in 1854, and in an attempt to show his bipartisanship, Morton appointed him to the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|In the 1876 presidential election, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio {{defeated}} Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York {{in one of}} {{the most}} hotly contested presidential elections to that time in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes. Payne was named to the committee at Tilden's request, but the results went against the Democrats as Hayes was declared the winner of the disputed votes. After the Commissions result, Payne joined many Democrats in attempting to delay the House proceedings in hopes of forcing a more favorable result, but was outvoted by Republicans and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>who</b> sided with Speaker Samuel J. Randall in accepting the Commission's result. The effort failed, and Hayes became president on March 4, 1877.|$|E

5|$|Tillman believed, {{and often}} stated as senator, that blacks must submit to either white {{domination}} or extermination. He {{was reluctant to}} undertake the latter, fearing hundreds of whites would die accomplishing it. He campaigned in the violent 1898 North Carolina elections, in which white Democrats were determined to take back control from a biracial Populist-Republican coalition elected in 1894 and 1896 on a fusion ticket. He spoke widely in North Carolina {{in the fall of}} 1898, often to crowds wearing red shirts, disheartening his Populist supporters. Terror and intimidation again won the day for <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>who</b> were elected statewide. They failed to win in the coastal city of Wilmington, but white supremacists took over by force. South Carolina saw violence as well: an effort to register black voters in Phoenix led whites to provoke a confrontation, after which a number of African Americans were murdered. Tillman warned African Americans and those who might combine with them that black political activism would provoke a murderous response from whites.|$|E
25|$|When Sabin's fellow Republicans {{would not}} support her efforts, she went to <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>who</b> {{switched}} their support of the dry cause to endorse repeal {{under the leadership of}} liberal politicians such as Fiorello La Guardia and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sabin and her supporters emphasized that repeal would generate enormous sums of much-needed tax revenue, and weaken the base of organized crime.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic party saw the Preparedness {{movement}} as a threat. Roosevelt, Root and Wood were prospective Republican presidential candidates. More subtly, the Democrats were rooted in localism that appreciated the National Guard, and the voters were hostile to {{the rich and powerful}} in the first place. Working with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>who</b> controlled Congress, Wilson was able to sidetrack the Preparedness forces. Army and Navy leaders were forced to testify before Congress to the effect that the nation's military was in excellent shape.|$|E

25|$|A 2006 restructure of the ABC board, {{undertaken}} by the Howard government, abolished the position of staff elected director. The elected director was previously nominated and elected by employees of the ABC. Nominees for this director office were to have been employed at least 24 hours a week by the ABC and the term of office was two years with eligibility for re-election to a second term. An elected director was not eligible for a third term of office. This move drew criticism from the Labor Party, Australian Greens, and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>who</b> {{saw it as a}} 'revenge measure' taken against the Corporation.|$|E
25|$|The Geneva {{agreement}} also {{stipulated that}} general elections {{should be held}} in Cambodia during 1955 and that the International Control Commission should monitor them to ensure fairness. Sihanouk was more determined than ever to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> (<b>who,</b> {{on the basis of}} their past record, were expected to win the election). The king attempted unsuccessfully to have the constitution amended. On March 2, 1955, he announced his abdication in favor of his father, Norodom Suramarit. Assuming the title of samdech (prince), Sihanouk explained that this action was necessary in order to give him a free hand to engage in politics.|$|E
25|$|The Cowboy Democrats {{did well}} in the 1978 {{election}} and demanded a strong presence on the committees. Martinez turned them down. During the opening session of the House on 16 January 1979 thirty Democrats and three rogue Republicans voted for Martinez. In an unusual move, eleven conservative Democrats allied with twenty-six Republicans to elect the conservative Democrat Gene Samberson speaker by thirty seven votes. Samberson appointed nine Democrats to committee positions. Martinez refused to chair the Votes and Elections Committee, effectively giving control of this committee to the Republicans. Five of <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>who</b> had backed Martinez refused appointments as vice-chairs of committees. The Mama Lucy Gang was out of power.|$|E

25|$|JP Morgan Chase's PAC and its {{employees}} contributed $2.6 million to federal campaigns in 2014 and financed its lobbying team with $4.7 {{million in the}} first three quarters of 2014. JP Morgan's giving has been focused on Republicans, with 62 percent of its donations going to GOP recipients in 2014. Still, 78 House Democrats received campaign cash from JPMorgan's PAC in the 2014 cycle at an average of $5,200 and a total of 38 of <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>who</b> voted for the 2015 spending bill took money from JPMorgan's PAC in 2014.

25|$|During the Senate {{session on}} June 8, Republican Senator Thomas Libous {{proposed}} a resolution, {{similar to a}} motion of no confidence, that would allow for {{the election of a}} new leader of the Senate. The entire 32 Senator coalition voted for the resolution. After the resolution was passed, but before the vote was recognized by officiating officer, Senator Neil Breslin, Senator Jeffrey Klein moved for adjournment. Libous demanded that his resolution be recognized, but instead Breslin quickly granted Klein's motion for adjournment. Republicans objected, claiming a majority of the Senate did not vote to adjourn. After Breslin declared the meeting adjourned, all but four Democratic senators walked out of the Senate chamber. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>who</b> stayed were Espada and Monserrate, who had voted for the resolution, and Carl Kruger and Ruben Diaz, who abstained from all voting during the course of events, but stayed to show their support.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression {{ushered in}} President Franklin Roosevelt and strong control by Democrats and {{historic}} New Deal policies. Roosevelt's election in 1932 marked {{a shift in}} government power towards the executive branch. Numerous New Deal initiatives came from the White House rather than being initiated by Congress. The Democratic Party controlled both houses of Congress for many years. During this time, Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed the Conservative Coalition. Democrats maintained control of Congress during World War II. Congress struggled with efficiency in the postwar era partly by {{reducing the number of}} standing congressional committees. Southern Democrats became a powerful force in many influential committees although political power alternated between Republicans and Democrats during these years. More complex issues required greater specialization and expertise, such as space flight and atomic energy policy. Senator Joseph McCarthy exploited the fear of communism and conducted televised hearings. In 1960, Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy narrowly won the presidency and power shifted again to <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>who</b> dominated both houses of Congress until 1994.|$|E

500|$|On December 16, 1861 Wilson {{introduced}} a bill to abolish slavery in Washington D.C. something he had desired to do since {{his visit to the}} nation's capital 25 years earlier. At this time fugitive slaves from the war were being held in prisons of Washington D.C. and faced the possibility of return to their owners. Wilson said of his bill that it would [...] "blot out slavery forever from the nation's capital". The measure met bitter opposition from <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>who</b> remained in the Senate after those from the southern states vacated their seats to join the Confederacy, but it passed. After passage in the House, President Lincoln signed Wilson's bill into law on April 16, 1862.|$|E
500|$|During this period, Congress was debating a Puerto Rico Tariff Act {{that would}} have been unconstitutional had the first {{definition}} been kept. This was a largely partisan issue at the time—the Republicans were in favor of this Act, but it was strongly denounced by Democrats. During the ensuing debate, the existence of the original report was discovered by <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>who</b> requested that the War Department release the earlier report to them so they could be compared [...] "side by side". The request was refused, but a copy of the report was leaked, allowing Minority Leader James D. Richardson to read it aloud on the Senate floor, prior to the vote. These efforts failed; the vote remained along party lines and the measure was passed.|$|E

500|$|In early 1949 Sihanouk {{traveled}} to Paris {{with his parents}} {{to negotiate with the}} French government for more autonomy over Cambodia. The Modus Vivendi was replaced by a new Franco-Khmer treaty, which recognised Cambodia as [...] "independent" [...] within the French Union. In practice, the treaty granted only limited self-rule to Cambodia. While Cambodia was given free rein in managing its foreign ministry and to a lesser extent, its defence, most of the other ministries remained under French control. Meanwhile, dissenting legislators from the national assembly started attacking the government led by prime minister Penn Nouth over its failure to resolve deepening financial and corruption problems plaguing the country. The dissenting legislators, led by Yem Sambaur, who had defected from the Democrat party in November 1948, deposed Penn Nouth. Yem Sambaur replaced him, but his appointment did not sit well with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>who</b> in turn pressured Sihanouk to dissolve the national assembly and hold elections.|$|E
500|$|Most of Johnson's Cabinet {{supported}} him but Secretary of War Stanton did not, {{and with the}} General of the Army, war hero Ulysses S. Grant, worked to undermine Johnson's Reconstruction policies. [...] Johnson obeyed the laws that Congress had passed, sometimes over his veto, though he often interpreted them in ways contrary to their intent. [...] After Stanton refused Johnson's request that he resign in August 1867, Johnson suspended Stanton, as permitted by the Tenure of Office Act, and made General Grant interim Secretary of War. Republicans campaigned in that year's election {{on the issue of}} African-American suffrage, but were met with a voter surge towards <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>who</b> opposed it. [...] Although no seats at Congress were directly at stake, voters in Ohio both defeated a referendum on black suffrage and elected the Democrats to the majority in the legislature, meaning that Wade, whose term was due to expire in 1869, would not be reelected.|$|E
500|$|Not {{long after}} Marcus Morton won the 1839 gubernatorial election, Whig {{leadership}} prevailed on Davis {{to run again}} for governor.

[...] Harrison's death in April 1841 reenergized <b>the</b> <b>Democrats,</b> <b>who</b> attacked Davis in that year's election. [...] They charged that protectionist tariffs he supported taxed the poor, and that his opposition to western land policies was hypocritical because he also speculated in those lands. [...] Davis won a narrow majority over Morton, and was reelected in 1841. [...] This period in office, like his first term as governor, also did not contain any new programs or initiatives, but was overshadowed by the ongoing negotiations between Daniel Webster (now Secretary of State) and Lord Ashburton over the boundary issue. [...] Davis and Webster had contentious disagreements over the negotiations, although Webster {{was finally able to}} convince Davis to accept the final agreement. [...] The matter deepened the division between the two men, who stopped speaking to each other.|$|E
