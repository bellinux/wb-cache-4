40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{elaborate}} upon {{a measure of}} node influence in social networks, which was recently proposed by Vassio et al., IEEE <b>Trans.</b> <b>Control</b> Netw. Syst., 2014. This measure quantifies {{the ability of the}} node to sway the average opinion of the network. Following the approach by Vassio et al., we describe and study a distributed message passing algorithm that aims to compute the nodes' influence. The algorithm is inspired by an analogy between potentials in electrical networks and opinions in social networks. If the graph is a tree, then the algorithm computes the nodes' influence in a number of steps equal to the diameter of the graph. On general graphs, the algorithm converges asymptotically to a meaningful approximation of the nodes' influence. In this paper we detail the proof of convergence, which greatly extends previous results in the literature, and we provide simulations that illustrate the usefulness of the returned approximation.

40|$|To {{test whether}} human GATA- 1 (hGATA- 1) is {{involved}} in the transcriptional control of globin gene switching, we produced transgenic mice overexpressing hGATA- 1, crossed them with mice carrying a human β-globin locus yeast artificial chromosome (βYAC), and analyzed globin gene expression in their progeny. Mice carrying both the hGATA- 1 and the βYAC transgenes had normal levels of γ- and β-globin mRNA and no distortion in the rate or in the timing of γ-to-β switch, indicating that hGATA- 1 is not involved in the developmental control of γ- and β-globin genes. In contrast, mice carrying the hGATA- 1 and the βYAC transgenes had 5 - to 6 -fold lower expression of the human ɛ globin gene compared with βYAC mice lacking the hGATA- 1 transgene. These results provide direct in vivo evidence that hGATA- 1 is a specific repressor of human ɛ gene expression. Our findings also suggest that binary transgenic mouse systems based on overexpression of transcriptional factors can be used to investigate the <b>trans</b> <b>control</b> of human globin gene switching.

40|$|International audienceThe {{harmonic}} {{influence is}} a measure of node influence in social networks that quantifies the ability of a leader node to alter the average opinion of the network, acting against an adversary field node. The definition of harmonic influence assumes linear interactions between the nodes described by an undirected weighted graph; its computation is equivalent to solve a discrete Dirichlet problem associated to a grounded Laplacian for every node. This measure has been recently studied, under slightly more restrictive assumptions, by Vassio et al., IEEE <b>Trans.</b> <b>Control</b> Netw. Syst., 2014, who proposed a distributed message passing algorithm that concurrently computes the harmonic influence of all nodes. In this paper, we provide a convergence analysis for this algorithm, which largely extends upon previous results: we prove that the algorithm converges asymptotically, under the only assumption of the interaction Laplacian being symmetric. However, the convergence value does not in general coincide with the harmonic influence: by simulations, we show that when the network has a larger number of cycles, the algorithm becomes slower and less accurate, but nevertheless provides a useful approximation. Simulations also indicate that the symmetry condition is not necessary for convergence and that performance scales very well in the number of nodes of the graph...|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} {{that in a}} variety of organisms the majority of meiotic recombination events occur at a relatively small fraction of loci, known as recombination hotspots. If hotspot activity results from the DNA sequence at or near the hotspot itself (in cis), these hotspots are expected to be rapidly lost due to biased gene conversion, unless there is strong selection in favor of the hotspot itself. This phenomenon makes it very difficult to maintain existing hotspots and even more difficult for new hotspots to evolve; it has therefore {{come to be known as}} the “hotspot conversion paradox. ” I develop an analytical framework for exploring the evolution of recombination hotspots under the forces of selection, mutation, and conversion. I derive the general conditions under which cis- and trans-controlled hotspots can be maintained, as well as those under which new hotspots controlled by both a cis and a trans locus can invade a population. I show that the conditions for maintenance of and invasion by trans- or cis-plus-trans-controlled hotspots are broader than for those controlled entirely in cis.

40|$|This is post-print (post refereeing) version. The {{published}} version can {{be obtained}} via Sciencedirect at: [URL] methodology for generating optimal sensor network design for multirate systems is presented. Location of sensors, cost of measurement and frequency of sampling are important factors that have been incorporated in the sensor network design formulation. The proposed methodology is based on evaluating trade-off (Pareto optimal) solutions between the quality of state estimation and the total measurement cost associated with the sensor network. To accommodate different sampling frequencies and evaluate their effect on state estimation accuracy, a generic multirate extension of the traditional Kalman filter is used. In general, higher accuracies of the state estimates are realizable at expense of higher measurement cost. Incorporation of these conflicting objectives of minimizing measurement cost and maximizing estimation accuracy results in a combinatorial, implicit multiobjective optimization problem, which is solved using the well known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II. The resulting solutions can be then analyzed by the process designer for determining an appropriate sensor network. The methodology is demonstrated by generating optimal sensor network design for the benchmark quadruple tank set up [K. H.
