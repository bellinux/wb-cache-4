5|$|Bart and Milhouse visit a joke shop. Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa plan {{a trip to}} the Springsonian Museum so {{they can}} see the Egyptian Treasures of Isis exhibit and the Orb of Isis. Marge has to take Bart to a doctor instead, since he has superglued various novelty items to his face. Since this is Lisa's last chance to see the exhibit, she phones Homer to ask him if she can <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus.</b> He seems uncertain, which prompts her to trick him into letting her <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Writer Mike Scully came up {{with the}} idea for the plot because he used to live in West Springfield, Massachusetts and he would ask his parents if he could <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> to Springfield, Massachusetts and they finally agreed to let him one day. The {{production}} team faced several challenges during development of this episode. The animators had to come up with a special mouth chart to draw Bart's mouth with the joke teeth in. The pile of dead animals in the back of Cletus' truck originally included dead puppies, but the animators thought it was too sad, so they removed them. Scully used to write jokes for Yakov Smirnoff so he called him up to get the signs in Russian. Dan Castellaneta had to learn proper Russian pronunciation so he could speak it during the chess scene in which he voiced the Russian chess player.|$|E

25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He had to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> {{to go to school}} even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew {{that the most important thing}} for his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished to be as good as him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was trying to do it like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E

When he leaves the club, he sees that the bus he was travelling on crashed. Back at Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, House is diagnosed with a concussion and post-traumatic retrograde amnesia and orders his team to check the bus driver for a possible seizure that precipitated the crash. Chase (Jesse Spencer) performs hypnosis on House to stimulate his memory; during this, House finds himself getting drunk alone in a bar. Chase, Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), and Wilson's girlfriend Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek) guide House through the hallucination, and {{the only other person}} House recognizes is the bartender (Fred Durst), who forced him to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> by taking away his keys.|$|E
500|$|The Winter Dance Party tour {{began in}} Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on January 23, 1959. The amount of travel created {{logistical}} problems, as {{the distance between}} venues had not been considered when scheduling each performance. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences. Holly's drummer Carl Bunch suffered frostbite to his toes (while aboard the bus) and was hospitalized, so Buddy Holly {{made the decision to}} find another means of transportation. Before their performance at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly chartered a four-seat Beechcraft Bonanza airplane at Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City, Iowa, for himself, Jennings, and Tommy Allsup, to avoid the long bus trip to their next venue in Moorhead, Minnesota. Following the Clear Lake show (which ended around midnight), Allsup lost a coin toss and gave up his seat on the charter plane to Ritchie Valens, while Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson, who was suffering from the flu and complaining about how cold and uncomfortable the tour bus was for a man of his size. When Holly learned that his bandmates had given up their seats on the plane and had chosen to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> rather than fly, a friendly banter between Holly and Jennings ensued, and it would come back to haunt Jennings for decades to follow: Holly jokingly told Jennings, [...] "Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up!" [...] Jennings jokingly replied, [...] "Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes!" [...] Less than {{an hour and a half}} later, shortly after 1:00am on February 3, 1959 (later known as The Day the Music Died), Holly's charter plane crashed at full throttle into a cornfield outside Mason City, Iowa, instantly killing all on board.|$|E

However, there are moments where George exhibits remarkable courage, but usually accidentally and often in support of inane lies he'd rather not confess to. For instance, in [...] "The Marine Biologist", {{he goes into the}} sea alone to save a beached whale because his date, a woman on whom he had a crush in college, thinks he's a marine biologist and even tells her the truth about his occupation after he saves the day. However, this causes her to reject him immediately, and he's forced to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> home.|$|E
