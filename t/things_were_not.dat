5|$|WWE 2K16 {{details the}} {{historical}} career of Steve Austin, {{from his days}} at ECW when he was angry that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> {{going to happen in}} a good sense for him to WCW when he and Brian Pillman began to become a strong tag team leading to Austin suffering injury and going through a rub shot in WWE as Stone Cold, an anti-hero that {{was not going to be}} tame into a corporate man. Video Packages contain commentary that was remixed from WWE '13 and WWE 2K14 with the exception of some not documented before. Through DLC, the WWE Hall of Fame showcase contains what if matches and some from WCW; these matches were announced on Oct 7th 2015 and to be released alongside the Deluxe Editions of the video game.|$|E
25|$|Havel’s message, “We are all responsible, {{we are all}} guilty,” was not popular. He {{enacted a}} general amnesty {{for all but the}} most serious criminals, apologized on behalf of Czechoslovakia for the post-World War II {{expulsion}} of the Sudeten Germans and resisted demands for a more draconian purge of secret police collaborators. These <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> popular either. And as the government undertook privatization and restitution, Havel confronted pyramid schemes, financial corruption and robber baron capitalism. He saw his country fall apart (if bloodlessly), becoming in 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia.|$|E
25|$|As was {{the case}} in most of central Berlin, almost all of the {{buildings}} around Potsdamer Platz were turned to rubble by air raids and heavy artillery bombardment during the last years of World War II. The three most destructive raids (out of 363 that the city suffered), occurred on 23 November 1943, and 3 February and 26 February 1945. <b>Things</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> helped by the very close proximity of Hitler's Reich Chancellery, just one block away in Voßstraße, and many other Nazi government edifices nearby as well, and so Potsdamer Platz was right in a major target area.|$|E

25|$|Docker {{retired as}} a BSA {{director}} in 1912 and installed Lincoln Chandler on the BSA board as his replacement. Docker liked to draw a comparison between the BSA~Daimler merger he engineered {{and that of his}} 1902 merger of Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Company and Patent Shaft. However, there was not the integration of facilities in the BSA~Daimler case, nor was there a reorganisation of either BSA or Daimler. In view of the earlier criticism contained in the 1909 report of the investigation committee, BSA continued to produce cars of their own, using Daimler engines. In 1913, Daimler employed 5,000 workers to manufacture 1,000 vehicles, an indication that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> well.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} of the evening session on June 8 was the {{discussion}} and adoption of the new Constitution of the Russian Orthodox Church, developed and presented by the Cathedral by Archbishop Kirill of Smolensk and Viazemsky (Gundyaeva) was discussed at the Bishops Pre-Council Conference March 28 to 31, 1988. During the discussion held at the Local Council, have been reviewed and amended {{the text of the}} Constitution, clarified some wording. When developing a new charter Archbishop Kirill (Gundyaev) used the achievements of the Cathedral 1917-1918. Was rejected by the charter of 1945. This is {{explained by the fact that}} the statute of 1945 was preparing to urgently during the war, and many <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> identified - the charter is recognized as obsolete.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> going {{according}} to Bitar's and Aflaq's plan. The reconstituted party {{was divided into}} many factions which differed on policy issues, {{but most of them}} supported Aflaq's ouster as Secretary General of the National Command. Immediately after the attempted coup, Aflaq and Bitar re-delegated basic organizational work to Hammud al-Shufithe eventual Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Branch. By doing this, they were giving momentum to their opponents. Shufi, who was at first believed to be an Aflaq supporter, was a radical Marxist. Shufi's group, which controlled the Syrian Regional Command, became allies of the Military Committee in their fight to topple Aflaq and Bitar. Aflaq and Bitar could not rely upon support in the National Command from the Iraqis; the Iraqi Regional Branch had undergone a sudden radicalization under the leadership of Ali Salih al-Sadi. A moderate faction within the Iraqi Regional Branch, headed by Talib El-Shibib and Hazim Jawad, still supported the National Command.|$|E

25|$|The {{winter of}} 194445 was {{especially}} difficult {{for most of}} the population. Inflation showed no sign of slowing down and food shortages were severe. The prime minister and the other Gaullists were forced to try to balance the desires of ordinary people and public servants for a return to normal life with pressure from Bidault's MRP and the Communists for the large scale nationalisation programme and other social changes that formed the main tenets of the CNR Charter. At the end of 1944 the coal industry and other energy companies were nationalised, followed shortly afterwards by major banks and finance houses, the merchant navy, the main aircraft manufacturers, airlines and a number of major private enterprises such as the Renault car company at Boulogne-Billancourt, whose owner had been implicated as a collaborator and accused of having made huge profits working for the Nazis. In some cases, unions, feeling that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> progressing quickly enough, took matters into their own hands, occupying premises and setting up workers' committees to run the companies. Women were also allowed the vote for the first time, a new social security system was introduced to cover most medical costs, unions were expanded and price controls introduced to try to curb inflation. At de Gaulle's request, the newspaper Le Monde was founded in December 1944 to provide France with a quality daily journal similar to those in other countries. Le Monde took over the premises and facilities of the older Le Temps, whose independence and reputation had been badly compromised during the Vichy years.|$|E

Daltrey finished his first solo album, which included the hit single [...] "Giving It All Away", fueling rumours of a split in the press. <b>Things</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> helped by Daltrey discovering that managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp had large sums of money unaccounted for, and suggested they should be fired, which Townshend resisted.|$|E

An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, [...] "His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day." [...] The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form. The critic Henry Colles, wrote, {{a few days after}} the composer's death: ...|$|E

Which is a singular event, just to announce what we have when it's ready. I thought that might be early August, or mid-September, it ended up being [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|When {{he began}} work on the score for A New Beginning, Manfredini created a theme just for the {{character}} of Tommy Jarvis. The idea was {{to suggest that there}} was [...] "madness afoot", which he believed helped to [...] "'point the finger' at various characters [...] to suggest that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> as you might expect". For Jason Lives, Tom McLoughlin instructed Manfredini to create a score that would not alert the audience about what was happening or about to happen, [...] "but instead allow the audience to do it to themselves". McLoughlin took this idea from John Carpenter's 1978 film Halloween, which would always follow any shock in the film with Carpenter's [...] "Eeeeeeee!" [...] sound. McLoughlin wanted something more subtle, with a [...] "Gothic" [...] resonance.|$|E

This departure was reported at the time as amicable, with Noel stating that Arthurs wanted {{to spend more time with}} his family. Arthurs' statement clarified his leaving as [...] "to concentrate on other things". However, Noel has since offered a contradicting version: that a series of violations of Noel's [...] "no drink or drugs" [...] policy (imposed by Noel so that Liam could sing properly) for the album's sessions resulted in a confrontation between the two. Two weeks later the departure of bassist Paul McGuigan was announced. The Gallagher brothers held a press conference shortly thereafter where they assured reporters that [...] "the future of Oasis is secure. The story and the glory will go on." ...|$|E

500|$|The website Touch Arcade {{said that}} they loved the game, {{and that it was}} one of their {{favorite}} role-playing games on iOS. They did however think that the game was bad at explaining things, including the system of saving one's progress. Pocket Gamer, too, thought that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> explained enough. For instance, they said that the game does not guide players from point A to point B, and often does not even let players know where to start looking for point B. RPGFan echoed this, and said that it is not uncommon for players to wander around, wondering where to go. Gamezebo said they did not think the battle system was particularly exciting, but appreciated how the conversation system and the demon fusion adds elements of risk and reward to the game. The British newspaper Metro found the game more entertaining than most role-playing games from its time. Gamezebo found the iOS version's touch screen-based virtual buttons clumsy to use, while Pocket Gamer found the interface to work [...] "reasonably well" [...] while using the landscape mode, and RPGFan found the interface to be excellent. Both Gamezebo and Touch Arcade wished the game had been a [...] "universal app", so that it could have been played on other devices than iPhone and iPod Touch without having the graphics upscaled.|$|E
500|$|The show's sound {{production}} team had two major special effects to create for the episode: the mole creature, and Olivia's superhearing. They decided to voice the creature using Automated Dialogue Replacement (ADR) [...] "because his range of actions and emotions {{was simply too}} broad for a library monster vocal set to cover". Sound editor Bruce Tanis cut [...] "creepy moans and breaths" [...] when the creature was heard but not seen, and added [...] "a layer of vicious attack growls and wounded screams" [...] for when it died. Tanis commented that the actor voicing the creature placed pieces of orange in his mouth {{in order to have}} [...] "a slobbery, sputtering voice". For Olivia's scenes with superhearing, Tanis made ordinary, far off items like phones, typewriters, and cars [...] "sound a little beefier than normal and kept them a bit more up in the mix than they usually would be," [...] as these <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> in the same room as her. The sound editors wanted to emphasize that the various sounds she hears could be coming from anywhere, such as next door, or a block away, or could perhaps be all inside her head. Torv later noted in a BuddyTV interview that while shooting, she was unsure whether her newfound abilities were permanent or temporary, to which the writers replied that [...] "apparently it's just something that comes and goes". After expressing her confusion, they responded [...] "Oh that's good, Olivia's confused too".|$|E
500|$|In 2009, IGN {{named the}} Dreamcast the 8th {{greatest}} video game console of all time, giving {{credit to the}} innovations and software for the system. [...] According to IGN, [...] "The Dreamcast was the first console to incorporate a built-in modem for online play, and while the networking lacked the polish and refinement of its successors, {{it was the first}} time users could seamlessly power on and play with users around the globe." [...] In 2010, PC Magazines Jeffrey L. Wilson named the Dreamcast the greatest video game console, emphasizing that the system was [...] "gone too soon". In 2013, Edge named the Dreamcast the 10th best console of the last 20 years, highlighting innovations that it added to console video gaming, including in-game voice chat, downloadable content, and second screen technology through the use of VMUs. Edge explained the system's poor performance by stating, [...] "Sega's console was undoubtedly ahead of its time, and it suffered at retail for that reason... ut its influence can still be felt today." [...] Writing in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Duncan Harris noted [...] "One of the reasons that older gamers mourned the loss of the Dreamcast was that it signaled the demise of arcade gaming culture... Sega's console gave hope that <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> about to change for the worse and that the tenets of fast fun and bright, attractive graphics were not about to sink into a brown and green bog of realistic war games." [...] Parish, writing for USgamer, contrasted the Dreamcast's diverse library with the [...] "suffocating sense of conservatism" [...] that pervaded the gaming industry in the following decade. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer, discussing the Dreamcast's portrayal [...] "as a small, square, white plastic JFK", commented that the system's short lifespan [...] "may have sealed its reputation as one of the greatest consoles ever": [...] "Nothing builds a cult like a tragic demise". According to IGN's Travis Fahs, [...] "Many hardware manufacturers have come and gone, but it's unlikely any will go out with half as much class as Sega." ...|$|E
