Their diagnostic criteria and management options {{are still a}} matter of debate. This review focuses on recent findings in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of these disorders and on their prognostic factors. RECENT FINDINGS: The more widespread use of consensus criteria has improved diagnostic strategies for immune-mediated neuropathies. Studies of large prospective series have defined the spectrum of these disorders and their respective prognoses. Although treatment of these disorders mostly relies on corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin, recent controlled trials have indicated the value of <b>targeted</b> <b>immunotherapies.</b> The further development of these therapies requires {{better understanding of the}} pathophysiology of these disorders. Immunological and immunopathological studies have improved our understanding of immune-mediated neuropathies over the last few years.

Diagnostic strategies have improved our capacity to recognize affected patients who can be offered effective treatments. Therapeutic options for immune-mediated neuropathies are still rather limited, although <b>targeted</b> <b>immunotherapies</b> may improve the prognosis of these disorders in the near future...|$|R

40|$|There are {{currently}} no effective therapies for metastatic melanoma and <b>targeted</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> {{results in the}} remission of {{only a very small}} percentage of tumors. In this study, we show that the noncanonical Wnt ligand, Wnt 5 A, can increase melanoma metastasis in vivo while down-regulating the expression of tumor-associated antigens important in eliciting CTL responses (e. g., MART- 1, GP 100, and tyrosinase). Melanosomal antigen expression is governed by MITF, PAX 3, and SOX 10 and is inhibited upon signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT 3) activation, via decreases in PAX 3 and subsequently MITF expression. Increasing Wnt 5 A in Wnt 5 A-low cells activated STAT 3, and STAT 3 was decreased upon Wnt 5 A knockdown. Downstream targets such as PAX 3, MITF, and MART- 1 were also affected by Wnt 5 A treatment or knockdown. Staining of a melanoma tissue array also highlighted the inverse relationship between MART- 1 and Wnt 5 A expression. PKC activation by phorbol ester mimicked Wnt 5 A effects, and Wnt 5 A treatment in the presence of STAT 3 or PKC inhibitors did not lower MART- 1 levels. CTL activation studies showed that increases in Wnt 5 A correspond to decreased CTL activation and vice versa, suggesting that targeting Wnt 5 A before immunotherapy may lead to the enhancement of current <b>targeted</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> for patients with metastatic melanoma...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recommendations about {{funding of}} {{interventions}} through {{the full spectrum}} of the disease often have been made in isolation. The authors of this report optimized budgetary allocations by comparing cost-effectiveness data for different preventive and management strategies throughout the disease course for breast cancer in Hong Kong (HK) Chinese women. METHODS: Nesting a state-transition Markov model within a generalized cost-effectiveness analytic framework, costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were compared to estimate average cost-effectiveness ratios for the following interventions at the population level: biennial mass mammography (ages 40 - 69 years or ages 40 - 79 years), reduced waiting time for postoperative radiotherapy (by 15 % or by 25 %), adjuvant endocrine therapy (either upfront aromatase inhibitor [AI] therapy or sequentially with tamoxifen followed by AI) in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive disease, <b>targeted</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> in those with tumors that over express human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and enhanced palliative services (either at home or as an inpatient). Usual care for eligible patients in the public sector was the comparator. RESULTS: In descending order, the optimal allocation of additional resources for breast cancer would be the following: a 25 % reduction in waiting time for postoperative radiotherapy (in US dollars: $ 5000 per QALY); enhanced, home-based palliative care ($ 7105 per QALY); adjuvant, sequential endocrine therapy ($ 17, 963 per QALY); <b>targeted</b> <b>immunotherapy</b> ($ 62, 092 per QALY); and mass mammography screening of women ages 40 to 69 years ($ 72, 576 per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Given the lower disease risk and different age profiles of patients in HK Chinese, among other newly emergent and emerging economies with similar transitioning epidemiologic profiles, the current findings provided direct evidence to support policy decisions that may be dissimilar to current Western practice.
