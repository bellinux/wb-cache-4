There seems to be the mistaken idea that it would be {{necessary}} to close the roads. This, of course, is entirely wrong... There would be no better time than now to introduce this form of racing to the roads, what with the decreased amount of motor traffic and the important part that the cycle is playing in wartime transport.|$|E

It is not in vain that the Holy Quran tells us the story of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the Queen of Sheba, whose story with Solomon is told in Surat Al Naml. I have observed in the University of Qatar that girls make better students than boys.|$|E
25|$|Boyer moves {{outside the}} leading {{currents}} in mainstream cognitive psychology {{and suggests that}} we can use evolutionary biology to unravel the relevant mental architecture. Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's theory of evolution. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those reproductive ends.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the three}} gods {{are at the}} falls, Ótr (in {{the form of an}} otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead Ótr) and show him their catches, {{including}} the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar [...] "seized them and made them ransom their lives" [...] in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.|$|E
2500|$|Translation of Abulafia's poems, as well {{as other}} medieval poems written in Hebrew, {{presents}} some challenges because some words could be interpreted with several meanings. A good example of such challenge is the poem [...] "Figs". Asking a friend for some figs, the poet writes: [...] "end a ripening fig, give a portion for seven of them, even for eight." [...] The next line of the poem was translated as [...] "And in return, here is my flatus." [...] The Hebrew word used in the poem was zemorah that means [...] "vine twig". Howard Tzvi Adelman from Queen's University says that [...] "Zemorah means 'penis' and 'fig,' a reference to 'vagina.' I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a sexual and not a scatological reference; both, however, fit the category of the grotesque. The next line—'Henceforth I won't give it to strangers'—could fit either way." ...|$|E

Most of them won't say it [...] because they're not being real and they don't have the balls to say it. But I do think that a fighter like the Ray Leonards or anyone like that would beat a guy [...] if they come with their game. Listen, this ain't a racial thing, but then again, maybe it is. But the style that is embedded in most of us black fighters, that style could be a problem to any other style of fighting." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first voices seeking {{compromise}} {{have started}} {{to be heard in}} Skopje.

Some accuse me that with my stance I am undermining the negotiating position of the Republic of Macedonia, yet I do not agree, because we are not in the beginning, but in the final phase of the negotiations.

Do the math: the other option is more chaotic, given that those expected to fill the vacuum are al-Qaeda and the Salafist organizations. It is better to face a state, because not having a clear address is much worse for us. There are almost 400 gangs operating in Syria, so with whom do you talk and who do you hold accountable?" [...] Minister for International Affairs, Strategy and Intelligence Yuval Steinitz said on 10 June 2013 that [...] "I always thought that it might be the case {{that at the end of}} the day Assad, with a very strong Iranian and Hezbollah backing, might gain the upper hand.

2500|$|The {{first book}} of the Talmud—Berachot 5a applies Isaiah 53 {{to the people of}} Israel and those who study Torah—"If the Holy One, blessed be He, is pleased with Israel or man, He crushes him with painful sufferings.

Now, you might <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> so even if he did not accept them with love. Therefore it is said: [...] "To see if his soul would offer itself in restitution" [...] (Isaiah 53:10). Even as the trespass-offering must be brought by consent, so also the sufferings must be endured with consent. And if he did accept them, what is his reward? [...] "He will see his seed, prolong his days" [...] (Isa. 53:10). And more than that, his {{knowledge}} [...] will endure with him. For it is said: [...] "The purpose of the Lord will prosper in his hand" [...] (Isa. 53:10). It has been taught: R. Simeon b.

2500|$|Regarding {{elements}} of game design, {{areas such as}} gameplay, mechanics, and similar features {{have been described as}} gender neutral, however presentational aspects of games have been identified as strongly gender-linked. Specifically, gaming is often seen as fantasy and escapism in which empathy and identification with the character is much more easily achieved if the character shares the same gender as the player. Gamers of both genders tend to crave realism and the more realistic the gender of the character, the easier it is for a player to identify with the character. A 2009 academic study published in New Media & Society, however, found that 85% of playable characters in video games are male. Erin Hamilton argues that part of the problem comes from the difficulty in [...] "juxtaposing femininity and feminism in a good video game." [...] When female characters do appear in video games, they are often regarded as presenting unhealthy messages concerning unrealistic body images and provocative sexual and violent behaviors for players of both genders. Stereotypical female behaviors such as giggling or sighing are often presented non-ironically, and this leads young children (especially girls who identify with the female character) to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> how girls are supposed to look and act. Furthermore, over-sexualized depictions of scantily clad female video game characters such as Tomb Raiders Lara Croft are not appealing to some girls.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for The American Spectator, Jeremy Lott commented {{positively}} {{about the}} protest movement: [...] "While the suits at Comedy Central and Yale University Press have been cowed, {{people across the}} country have decided to speak up and thereby magnify the offense a thousandfold." [...] Helge Rønning, a professor at the Institute of Media and Communication at the University of Oslo, said the offense to Muslims was outweighed by freedom-of-speech concerns. [...] "Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion {{is as important as the}} indignation that comes from the Muslim side," [...] he told the [...] NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not." [...] Vebjørn Selbekk, a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted Danish cartoons of Mohammed in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. [...] "I think maybe this is the right way to react—with humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area," [...] he said. In an analysis of the protest movement and surrounding controversy, staff writer Liliana Segura of AlterNet noted, [...] "In a democratic society where free speech is vigilantly protected, it is perfectly reasonable to call out censorship, particularly when it springs from some form of tyrannical religious extremism." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his inaugural lecture, Lake published two important books on historical and exegetical matters concerning the New Testament during his time in Leiden: The Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ (1907) and The Earlier Epistles of St. Paul: Their Motive and Origin (1911). [...] As Metzger explains: [...] "These studies, particularly the latter, revealed Lake's ability to analyze and evaluate complex historical and literary data and to set forth scholarly reconstructions with clarity and a certain persuasiveness." [...] In Historical Evidence Lake sets forth his approach: [...] "The first task of the historical inquirer is to collect the pieces of evidence; the second is to discuss the trustworthiness and meaning of each separate piece; {{and the third is}} to reconstruct the events to which the evidence relates" [...] (p.6). [...] As for the reconstruction, he explains: [...] "In any such attempt it is desirable to remember that the reconstruction of an original tradition from forms of later dates and of divergent contents must be guided by exactly the same principle as is the reconstruction of an original text from a number of extant MSS. [...] In each case the fundamental problem is the retracing of the line of development followed by the various authorities, and the solution depends chiefly on the ability to detect errors of transmission and to explain their existence" [...] (p.167). [...] As for The Earlier Epistles, Neill writes: [...] "I think {{that those of us who}} read Lake when we were young will be inclined to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> one of the best books on the New Testament that has ever been written in the English language. [...] This is the way it ought to be done. [...] Under Lake's skillful guidance, we feel ourselves one with those new and struggling groups of Christians, in all the perplexities of trying to discover what it means to be a Christian in a non-Christian world. [...] And there is the Apostle, so very much in working clothes and without a halo; we feel in our bones the passionate eagerness of Paul for better news from Corinth, the passionate relief when the good news arrives." [...] The book brought the conclusions of the German history of religions school to the attention of English-speaking world for the first time, and all later New Testament study has been influenced by this book.|$|E
