5|$|Muslim {{women also}} {{generally}} wear similar dresses as the Hindu women. However, the one {{difference is that}} the <b>tunic</b> they wear is considerably shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called a angi, worn beneath the bodice. A small shirt or kurta is also common. Hindu men wear an angrakha, long <b>tunic</b> that touches the knees. A cloth waist-band and tight fitting pajama and a small pagri (top hat) worn on top of the head completes their ensemble.|$|E
5|$|The basic garment for all Romans, {{regardless}} of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved <b>tunic.</b> The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's {{fell to her}} feet, and a child's to its knees. The tunics of poor people and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined {{by the type of}} work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a <b>tunic</b> with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the <b>tunic.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the most}} celebrated episode of the Vita Sancti Paternus, King Arthur tries to steal St Padarn's <b>tunic.</b> King Arthur covets Padarn's <b>tunic,</b> and when he is refused, stamps the earth, at which Padarn calls on the earth to swallow him; it does so. Arthur has to beg {{forgiveness}} before he is released. This seems to borrow {{the story of a}} different Padarn, Padarn Redcoat, whose coat was one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain (Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain). This story takes place about a century before Saint Padarn; it is, however, important because of the link drawn between Saint Padarn and the Romano-British King Arthur, the legendary British leader of the late fifth and early sixth centuries.|$|E
40|$|Squid <b>tunics</b> {{were divided}} in two batches: {{freeze-dried}} and air-dried. Dried squid <b>tunics</b> were directly hydrolyzed with pepsin, Alcalase, and Esperase. Freeze-dried <b>tunics</b> showed better aptitude for hydrolysis than air-dried <b>tunics.</b> Pepsin showed the lowest efficiency in protein breakdown and gave hydrolysates with low antioxidant activity, whereas Alcalase and Esperase peptide fractions showed strong radical scavenging ability, ACE-inhibitory activity, and noticeable antimicrobial properties. B. cereus, B. coagulans, and D. hansenii {{were found to}} be the most sensitive bacteria. Dried squid <b>tunics</b> proved to be an alternative to a previously extracted gelatin for obtaining bioactive peptides. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Generally, most forces do {{not have}} a formal uniform for their PCSOs, but a few provide <b>tunics.</b> <b>Tunics</b> are the same as a Police Constable but may have special badging to {{distinguish}} the wearer as a PCSO. As with police constables, PCSOs very rarely wear <b>tunics</b> (provided they have been given them). One of the few examples was during the funeral of PCSO Mark Marshall of Devon and Cornwall Police who was killed in Afghanistan whilst serving in the Territorial Army. His funeral was attended by police colleagues wearing <b>tunics</b> including PCSOs.|$|R

5|$|Mere {{depictions of}} the festival do not {{necessarily}} imply a long reign; for example, a relief showing pharaoh Sahure in the <b>tunic</b> of the Sed festival was found in his mortuary temple, although both historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest Sahure ruled Egypt for less than 14 full years.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate Infantry, {{the largest}} Corps of the Army, {{had a large}} variety of uniforms, and the greater amount of records. The initial Confederate Army uniform {{consisted}} of a kepi, double-breasted <b>tunic,</b> trousers, and Jefferson bootees/brogans. The kepi was not specified until the 1862 Regulations, as a sky-blue kepi, reflecting the Infantry Corps, with a dark blue band, and leather visor. The <b>tunic</b> was to be of cadet gray, with two rows of yellow-metal (brass or gold) buttons, 'solid' cuff and collar facings in sky-blue, and lined with a lighter gray fabric. The coat was of the same pattern specified as regulation for the field and company officers, {{as well as for}} the artillery and cavalry enlisted men.|$|E
5000|$|... 1100-1200 in Europe, fashion {{was simple}} and {{differed}} only in details from the clothing {{of the preceding}} centuries. Men wore knee-length <b>tunics</b> for most activities, and men of the upper classes wore long <b>tunics,</b> with hose and mantles or cloaks. Women wore long <b>tunics</b> or gowns. A close fit to the body, full skirts, and long flaring sleeves were characteristic of upper-class fashion {{for both men and}} women.|$|R

The winter uniform consists of the <b>tunic,</b> long-sleeve white blouse, the blazer, green jumper or vest, Black Watch Tartan tie, Black Watch Tartan scarf and either green knee-high socks or black stockings. School pockets are awarded for student achievements, and are embroidered in red on the pockets of junior blazers (R10 girls), and white on the left-breast of senior blazers (1112 girls).|$|E
5|$|The typical Parthian riding outfit is {{exemplified}} by the famous bronze statue of a Parthian nobleman found at Shami, Elymais. Standing 1.9m (6ft), the figure wears a V-shaped jacket, a V-shaped <b>tunic</b> fastened in place with a belt, loose-fitting and many-folded trousers held by garters, and a diadem or band over his coiffed, bobbed hair. His outfit is commonly seen in relief images of Parthian coins by the mid-1st century BC.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, the regiment, {{in common}} with other Yeomanry and Militia units, sported a range of uniforms. Jackets were always dark blue. Between 1812 and 1873, a leather shako was worn, {{replaced}} in 1873 by a fur Busby with a red cloth bag. Service dress during the First World War was a khaki <b>tunic</b> and breeches, with a red stripe down the seam and a red lanyard worn by all ranks round the left armpit. The chevrons of sergeants and corporals were surmounted by a regimental badge on a red baize backing, a practice that continued through the inter-war years and beyond.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the leaves}} die back in summer, the roots also wither. After some years, the roots shorten pulling the bulbs {{deeper into the}} ground (contractile roots). The bulbs develop from the inside, pushing the older layers {{outwards}} which become brown and dry, forming an outer shell, the <b>tunic</b> or skin. Up to 60 layers have been counted in some wild species. While the plant appears dormant above the ground the flower stalk which will start {{to grow in the}} following spring, develops within the bulb surrounded by two to three deciduous leaves and their sheaths. The flower stem lies in the axil of the second true leaf.|$|E

5|$|As {{detailed}} in the De Ceremoniis, the Droungarios of the Watch always accompanied the Emperor {{and was a}} frequent participant in various imperial ceremonies, often accompanied by his principal aide, the akolouthos. His ceremonial dress is indicated as the skaramangion <b>tunic</b> and a red sagion cloak, while on some occasions he bore a sword, a mace and an axe. The latter weapon was highly unusual for a Byzantine officer, and the French scholar Rodolphe Guilland suggests that this was connected to his command of foreign troops via the akolouthos (who later notably became {{the commander of the}} axe-bearing Varangian Guard). In the 10th century, when several holders of the post were scions of the most prominent families of the military aristocracy, including Eustathios Argyros, John Kourkouas and Manuel Kourtikes, the droungarios occupied the 36th place in the imperial hierarchy and usually held the senior court dignities of anthypatos, patrikios or prōtospatharios.|$|E
5|$|Hristofor Žefarović, {{an artist}} from Macedonia, painted the frescos in the rebuilt {{church of the}} Serbian Monastery of Bođani, in the Bačka region (then part of the Kingdom of Hungary) in 1737. There, he {{depicted}} Jovan Vladimir {{in a row of}} six Serb saints, wearing a crown and sceptre, clad in a full-length <b>tunic,</b> loros (a type of stole), and chlamys. In the same row stands another Serb saint from present-day Montenegro, Stefan Štiljanović. Žefarović's frescos in Bođani are regarded as the earliest work showing Baroque traits in the Serbian art. Žefarović created in 1742 in Vienna a copperplate with scenes of the saint's life and miracles. Its printed impressions were disseminated to many Orthodox Christian homes in the Balkans. The same author included him among the rulers and saints whom he illustrated in his Stemmatographia.|$|E
