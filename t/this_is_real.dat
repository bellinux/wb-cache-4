500|$|There was {{widespread}} comment {{in the media}} after the race about the weather conditions. Cyclingnews.com described it as [...] "mayhem" [...] and [...] "one of the wildest [...] in recent years". Paolini {{said that he had}} crashed twice on the way to victory and had used a total of three bikes, but also that he had been lucky later in the race. He said [...] "we're up in the north and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> cycling". Paolini pointed at his head and heart as he crossed the finish line – the same gesture that he had performed when winning a stage in the 2013 Giro d'Italia – and explained the gesture as indicating that such wins required [...] "head and heart as much as legs".|$|E
500|$|Amy Sciarretto for Popcrush {{noted that}} Lewis {{appeared}} to be restraining her vocals on the song, writing [...] "Lewis exercising incredible restraint, as she doesn’t let her remarkable, room-filling, enviable voice soar like we are used to." [...] Sciarretto continued to note that {{towards the end of}} the song, the singer does not show any restraint, and that it is a common device used in song production as it allows the singer to build tension. Lyrically, [...] "Collide" [...] is a love song, in which Lewis sings [...] "I'll pick you up when you're down / Be there when no one's around / I'm in tune with how you feel / Everything 'bout <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> / When you're in unfamiliar places / Count on me through life's changes." [...] Sciarretto also noted that it is when Lewis performs the lyric [...] "Crash into me / At full speed," [...] that she allows herself to not hold back in her vocal performance, and delivers it with [...] "power and breadth".|$|E

The song received some praise by Leila Cobo of Billboard who called it [...] "a standout for impeccable production and enviable mix that allows every instrumental line (and there are many) to resonate with bell-like clarity. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> music, to be danced {{to as much as}} cherished for its adept skill". The song was a success on the Latin charts, becoming Estefan's fourteenth number-one on the [...] "Hot Latin Songs" [...] chart and was also another number-one on the Tropical Airplay charts. It was also a Top 20 hit in other Latin major charts such as Latin Pop Airplay, Latin Regional Mexican Airplay and Latin Rhythm Airplay charts. However, the song didn't make it onto the Billboard Hot 100 charting outside it at #117. To promote the song further in different formats, some remixes were made for the single, Cuban rapper Pitbull performed on a Hip-Hop version of the song, and a Reggae mix featuring Puerto-Rican Wisin & Yandel was also released. A Salsa remix was also made.|$|E

60|$|I SHOULD {{very much}} like to deliver a {{dissertation}} on the American army and the possibilities of its extension. You see, it is such a beautiful little army, and the dear people don't quite understand what to do with it. The theory is that it is an instructional nucleus round which the militia of the country will rally, and from which they will get a stiffening in time of danger. Yet other people consider that the army should be built, like a pair of lazy tongs--on the principle of elasticity and extension--so that in time of need it may fill up its skeleton battalions and empty saddle troops. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> wisdom, be-cause the American army, as at present constituted, is made up of:--Twenty-five regiments infantry, ten companies each.|$|E

"Subject to the {{qualifications}} thus disposed of (vide {{first part of}} notice), 'An Outcast of the Islands' is perhaps the finest piece of fiction that has been published this year, as 'Almayer's Folly' {{was one of the}} finest that was published in 1895.... Surely <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> romance--the romance that is real. Space forbids anything but the merest recapitulation of the other living realities of Mr. Conrad's invention--of Lingard, of the inimitable Almayer, the one-eyed Babalatchi, the Naturalist, of the pious Abdulla--all novel, all authentic. Enough has been written to show Mr. Conrad's quality. He imagines his scenes and their sequence like a master; he knows his individualities and their hearts; he has a new and wonderful field in this East Indian Novel of his.... Greatness is deliberately written; the present writer has read and re-read his two books, and after putting this review aside for some days to consider the discretion of it, the word still stands."--Saturday Review.|$|E

[...] I {{do not know whether}} Victor Hugo ever used this antithesis; but I am certain that he would have used it and thanked his stars if he had thought of it. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>real</b> parody, inseparable from admiration. It is the same in the parody of Dumas, which is {{arranged}} on the system of [...] "Aramis killed three of them. Porthos three. Athos three." [...] You cannot write that kind of thing unless you have first exulted in the arithmetical ingenuity of the plots of Dumas. It is the same in the parody of Charlotte Brontë, which opens with a dream of a storm-beaten cliff, containing jewels and pelicans. Bret Harte could not have written it unless he had really understood the triumph of the Brontës, the triumph of asserting that great mysteries lie under the surface of the most sullen life, and that the most real part of a man is in his dreams.|$|E
