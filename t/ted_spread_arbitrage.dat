40|$|Standardizing a futures contract's {{specifications}} {{to enhance}} its transfer-ability is problematic for any commodity whose cash market adopts relational contracting procedures. Standardization implies the contract's value cannot be completely determined by competitive arbitrage order flow, inhibiting the market's price discovery function, {{and leaving the}} futures price susceptible to manipulation. These effects may result in the market's failure. The model, based on the theory of storage, predicts that contracts with a higher spread-open position price volatility {{are more likely to}} contain a range of arbitrage indeterminacy, hence to experience difficulties in sustaining trading. The prediction is supported in an empirical examination of 104 US futures markets. The range of indeterminacy also increases the informational requirements of spread traders, reducing the effectiveness of <b>spread</b> <b>arbitrage</b> in maintaining the equilibrium intertemporal futures pricing relationship.

Such systems run strategies including market making, inter-market <b>spreading,</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> or pure speculation such as trend following. Many fall into the category of high-frequency trading (HFT), which are characterized by high turnover and high order-to-trade ratios. As a result, in February 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) formed a special working group that included academics and industry experts to advise the CFTC on how best to define HFT. HFT strategies utilize computers that make elaborate decisions to initiate orders based on information that is received electronically, before human traders are capable of processing the information they observe. Algorithmic trading and HFT have resulted in a dramatic change of the market microstructure, particularly in the way liquidity is provided.|$|R
40|$|Risk {{arbitrage}} is {{a strategy}} that seeks to profit from takeover offers by generally simultaneously purchasing and selling the shares of the merging companies. This dissertation consists of three essays that address three different issues related to risk arbitrage strategy: takeover success prediction, risk arbitrage for stock swap offers with collars and the determinants of risk <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spreads.</b> The first essay addresses methodology issues related to takeover success prediction modeling: case-control design vs. non-case-control design; logistic regression model vs. neural networks. The case-control design is shown to bias the intercept upward and, thus, tends to increase the estimated probability of failure, which will, in turn, result in a biased estimate of the expected return on each merger deal. Next, an adjustment to the probability estimates that removes the bias is explored. Second, neural networks is found to outperform logistic regression in predicting failed takeover attempts and performs as well as logistic regression in predicting successful takeover attempts. The second essay explores the risk and return characteristics of risk arbitrage strategy for {{a particular type of}} merger offers: stock swap offers with collars, utilizing an option type dynamic delta hedging strategy. A strong positive correlation in the risk return profile is found in a declining market and an insignificant correlation in a flat or rising market. This latter finding appears to be due to the increased probability of deal failure in market downturn. Contingent claims analysis shows a monthly abnormal return of 1. 8 %. The third essay studies the determinants of the cross sectional variation in risk <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spreads</b> and extends the literature by relating <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spreads</b> to transaction costs, supply of capital and price pressure. The empirical evidence shows that <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spread</b> is positively correlated with transaction costs. Limitation on the supply of arbitrage capital increases the deviation of the <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spread,</b> in either direction, from the efficient level. This finding is consistent with the limited arbitrage theory. Moreover, information costs dominate the selling pressure from the target shareholders in determining the <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spread.</b> ...|$|R

It critically examines the complexity of the products that were created and the AAAratings that were assigned to tranches. It reaches conclusions on how the subprime experience should influence the way securitizations are structured in the future. 1 Credit Ratings and the Securitization of Subprime Mortgages During the 1999 to 2007 period securitization became increasingly popular in the United States. Many different types of assets were securitized: corporate loans, credit card receivables, auto loans, mortgages, etc. There are a number of reasons why securitization was so attractive. One is regulatory arbitrage. When banks securitized the assets on their balance sheets and bought the products that were created, they reduced their regulatory capital. Another is <b>spread</b> <b>arbitrage.</b> A bank may be able to package the cash inflows on the assets on its balance sheet so that the average interest rate paid on the products created is less than the average interest rate earned on the assets.

40|$|Abstract There is {{a mythical}} question, well {{described}} by Duarte, Longstaff and Yu (2006), whether fixed-income arbitrage strategies are truly arbitrage or merely strategies that earn small positive returns {{most of the}} time, but occasionally experience dramatic losses. The question can be summarized in the anecdote “picking up nickels {{in front of a}} steamroller”. This master’s thesis studies two of these specific fixed-income <b>arbitrage</b> strategies: Swap <b>Spread</b> <b>Arbitrage</b> and Yield Curve Arbitrage. The methodology used in this master’s thesis is to apply these two arbitrage strategies through time from November 1988 to December 2011, using R language coding developed by the author of the master’s thesis, and to analyze their risk and return characteristics. The data used in this master’s thesis was gathered from different sources such as: Bloomberg™, Federal Reserve System (FED), Thompson Reuters Datastream™, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, Kenneth French and Yahoo® Finance. The main hypothesis of this thesis is that the global financial crisis of 2008 had a big impact on these strategies return indexes. This proved to be wrong.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} methods and the empirical results {{of various types}} of arbitrage strategies in past numerical studies. Although arbitrage can be generally dividend into two categories including risk-free arbitrage and risky arbitrage, {{there is still a}} certain level of risk which arbitrageurs should take, no matter what kinds of arbitrage. Since there are limitations and transactions costs in conducting arbitraging strategies, the profit of arbitrage may be plentiful in theory but it could be misleading in practice after considering transactions costs and potential risk. It appears that all arbitrage strategies are theoretically sound, but it is debatable that arbitrage strategies will succeed in the real world. The key factors for arbitrage strategies to succeed depend on how to identify various types of arbitrage strategies, exploit market inefficiency, to reduce transaction costs, and to evaluate potential risk.

We now report {{that in an}} antigen-independent manner, ICOS also induces adhesion and spreading in human effector/memory T cells, consequently inhibiting cell migration. <b>T</b> cell <b>spreading</b> and elongation after ICOS ligation are accompanied by the formation of two types of actin-rich membrane protrusions: thin, finger-like structures similar to filopodia and short, discrete microspikes. Although filopodia/microspike formation occurs independently of the PI- 3 K signaling cascade, ICOS-mediated T cell elongation depends on PI- 3 K activity, which inhibits the accumulation of GTP-bound RhoA. Further inhibition of RhoA activation exacerbates the ICOS-mediated, elongated phenotype.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop and test a new method for interpolating and extrapolating prices of European options. The {{theoretical}} base originates {{from the local}} variance gamma model developed by Carr (2008), in which the local volatility model by Dupire (1994) is combined with the variance gamma model by Madan and Seneta (1990). By solving a simplied version of the Dupire equation under the assumption of a continuous ve parameter di usion term, we derive a parameterization dened for strikes in an interval of arbitrary size. The parameterization produces positive option prices which satisfy both conditions for absence of arbitrage in a one maturity setting, i. e. all adjacent vertical spreads and buttery spreads are priced non-negatively. The method is implemented and tested in the FX-option market. We suggest two sub-models, one with three and one with ve degrees of freedom. By using a least-square approach, we calibrate the two sub-models against 416 Reuters quoted volatility smiles. Both sub-models succeeds in generating prices within the bid-ask spread for all options in the sample. Compared to the three parameter model, the model with ve parameters calibrates more exactly to market quoted mids but has a longer calibration time. The three parameter model calibrates remarkably quickly; in a MATLAB implementation using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm the average calibration time is approximately 1 ms. Both sub-models produce volatility smiles which are C 2 and well-behaving. Further, we suggest a technique allowing for arbitrage-free interpolation of calibrated option price functions in the maturity dimension. The interpolation is performed in parameter space, where every set of parameters uniquely determines an option price function. Furthermore, we produce sucient conditions to ensure absence of calendar <b>spread</b> <b>arbitrage</b> when calibrating the proposed model to several maturities. We use this technique to produce implied volatility surfaces which are suciently smooth, satisfy all conditions for absence of arbitrage and fit market quoted volatility surfaces within the bid-ask spread.

40|$|Arbitrageurs play an {{important}} role in keeping market prices close to their fundamental values by providing market liquidity. Most arbitrageurs however use leverage. When funding conditions worsen they are forced to reduce their positions. The resulting selling pressure depresses market prices, and in certain situations, pushes <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spreads</b> to levels exceeding many standard deviations. This phenomenon drove many century old financial institutions into bankruptcy during the 2007 − 2009 financial crisis. In this thesis, we provide empirical evidence and demonstrate analytically the effects of funding liquidity on arbitrage. We further discuss the implications for risk management. To conduct our empirical studies, we construct a novel Funding Liquidity Stress Index (FLSI) using principal components analysis. Its constituents are measures representing various funding channels. We study the relationship between the FLSI index and three di↵erent arbitrage strategies that we reproduce with real and daily transactional data. We show that the FLSI index has a strong explanatory power for changes in <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spreads,</b> and is {{an important}} source of contagion between various arbitrage strategies. In addition, we perform “event studies” surrounding events of changing margin requirements on futures contracts. The “event studies” provide empirical evidence supporting important assumptions and predictions of various theoretical work on market micro-structure. Next, we explain the mechanism through which funding liquidity affects <b>arbitrage</b> <b>spreads.</b> To do so, we study the liquidity risk premium in a market micro-structure framework where market prices are determined by the supply and demand of securities. We extend the model developed by Brunnermeier and Pedersen [BP 09] to multiple periods and generalize their work by considering all market participants to be risk-averse. We further decompose the liquidity risk premium into two components: 1) a fundamental risk premium and 2) a systemic risk premium. The fundamental risk premium compensates market participants for providing liquidity in a security whose fundamental value is volatile, while the systemic risk premium compensates them for taking positions in a market that is vulnerable to funding liquidity. The first component is therefore related to the nature of the security while the second component is related to the fragility of the market micro-structure (such as leverage of market participants and margin setting mechanisms) ...|$|R
