5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>question</b> posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E

25|$|The {{resulting}} upheavals {{from his}} son Akhenaten's reforming zeal would shake these old certainties to their very foundations and bring forth <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>question</b> of whether a pharaoh was {{more powerful than the}} existing domestic order as represented by the Amun priests and their numerous temple estates. Akhenaten even moved the capital away from the city of Thebes in an effort to break the influence of that powerful temple and assert his own preferred choice of deities, the Aten. Akhenaten moved the Egyptian capital to the site known today as Amarna (though originally known as Akhetaten, 'Horizon of Aten'), and eventually suppressed the worship of Amun.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>question</b> {{was whether}} the duchy of Schleswig was or was not an {{integral}} part of the dominions of the Danish crown, with which it had been associated in the Danish monarchy for centuries or whether Schleswig should, together with Holstein, become an independent part of the German Confederation. Schleswig itself was a fiefdom of Denmark, as the duchy of Holstein had been a fief of the Holy Roman Empire until 1806, and become a component state of the German Confederation with the Danish king as duke. This involved the question, raised by the death of the last common male heir to both Denmark and the two duchies, as to the proper succession in the duchies, and the constitutional questions arising out of the relations of the duchies to the Danish crown, to each other, and of Holstein to the German Confederation.|$|E

500|$|Within {{evolutionary}} biology, signalling {{theory is}} a body of theoretical work examining communication between individuals, both within species and across species. [...] <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>question</b> is when organisms with conflicting interests, such as in sexual selection, {{should be expected to}} provide honest signals (no presumption being made of conscious intention) rather than cheating.

500|$|Distinguishing {{between science}} and non-science is {{referred}} to as the demarcation problem. For example, should psychoanalysis be considered science? How about so-called creation science, the inflationary multiverse hypothesis, or macroeconomics? Karl Popper called this <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>question</b> in the philosophy of science. [...] However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninteresting. Martin Gardner has argued for the use of a Potter Stewart standard ("I know it when I see it") for recognizing pseudoscience.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Pinker, with Paul Bloom, {{published}} the paper [...] "Natural Language and Natural Selection", {{arguing that the}} human language faculty must have evolved through natural selection. The article provided arguments for a continuity based view of language evolution, contrary to then current discontinuity based theories that see language as suddenly appearing {{with the advent of}} Homo sapiens as a kind of evolutionary accident. This discontinuity based view was prominently argued by two of the main authorities, linguist Noam Chomsky and Stephen Jay Gould. The paper became widely cited and created renewed interest in the evolutionary prehistory of language, and has been credited with shifting <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>question</b> of the debate from [...] "did language evolve?" [...] to [...] "how did language evolve". The article also presaged Pinker's argument in The Language Instinct.|$|E

500|$|Wheels incur {{mechanical}} and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that {{would represent a}} decreased fitness when compared with limbed locomotion. These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life {{may not be the}} [...] "missed opportunity" [...] of biology that it first seems. In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>question</b> can be reversed: not [...] "Why does nature not produce wheels?", but rather, [...] "Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?" [...] The use of wheels rather than limbs in many engineered vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of design required to construct and control limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.|$|E
500|$|Voices {{has been}} {{described}} as a depiction of how culture may persist despite authoritarian attempts to end it, and as such to make a [...] "plea for cultural relativity". The idea of cultural openness is illustrated by the character of Tirio Actamo: once a well-known citizen of Ansul who was taken to be the concubine of the Gand, she then wins his love and uses her position to bring about an end to the conflict. Scholar Marek Oziewicz identified the story as critiquing the notion of retributive justice, considered the norm in Western societies, and instead supporting the idea of restorative justice. The protagonists of Voices succeed in [...] "making things right" [...] without punitive action. According to Oziewicz, <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>question</b> of the story is one that Memer asks the Oracle: [...] "How can we be free of the Alds?" [...] The answer is not a bloody revolution, but a compromise, possible because both parties are willing to recognize and end the conflict. Desac symbolizes the idea of retributive action, which is more emotionally satisfying but ultimately unsuccessful, while Orrec offers the more difficult, but successful method.|$|E
