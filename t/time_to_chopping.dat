40|$|Fault {{detection}} during chopped-wave impulse {{tests on}} transformers {{requires that the}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> be constant at various levels of applied voltage. Apparatus devised for this purpose is described. <b>Time</b> <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> in the 1 - to 6 -μs range can be selected and reproduced with a precision better than 0. 1 μs at voltage levels up to 400 kV. This system has been successfully used for over {{five years in the}} impulse testing of transformers rated at 66 kV and under. Copyrigh...|$|R
50|$|In reality, {{other factors}} {{intervene}} {{to reduce the}} simplicity of this model. If some elements of the task have a natural timespan, adding more staff will have a reduced effect: although having two chefs will double the speed of some elements of food preparation, they roast a chicken no faster than one chef. Some tasks also have a natural number of staff associated with them: the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> the vegetables will be halved {{with the addition of}} the second chef, but the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> carve the chicken will remain the same.|$|R
5000|$|Their ascent closely {{followed}} the 1970 first ascent by Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell, completed with a heavy-handed reliance on bolts - {{a method that}} offended Robbins and other clean climbing advocates. Harding had left all his bolts in the rock; Robbins and Lauria used the bolts to repeat the climb; and Robbins then chopped the heads off the bolts behind them. After two pitches, Robbins stopped chopping the bolts because (according to Lauria) [...] "the quality of the aid climbing was much higher {{than he had ever}} expected of Harding or Caldwell and, of course, it was also taking us an awful long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> all those goddam bolts." ...|$|R
50|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of a {{lumberjack}} in the game. He or she has a limited amount of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> down a given number of trees that sequentially pop up from the ground. The controls consist of two joysticks, with one controlling the player's movement and the other corresponding to left or right chops with the player's axe. Difficulty increases with each level since the number of trees <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> down slightly increases (maxing out at 19) and the allotted time slightly decreases. While playing, the player must avoid beehives that are thrown by bears or lose a life. These beehives, however, can be destroyed with the player's axe for a 500-point reward. Some trees contain birds that will run around the level after they have been chopped down, yielding 1,000 points if touched by the player.|$|R

As they struck the side the Malays tried to climb up, but, attacking as they did only at three points, our men had little difficulty in keeping them off, thrusting through the nettings with their boarding-pikes, and giving the Malays no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> down the nettings with their creases.|$|R

Had it been otherwise the traveller would have been a dead man before I had <b>time</b> <b>to</b> strike. I wonder who the wounded man is? He looked like a London trader. I wonder how he got into so sore a plight? But, doubtless, we shall hear in the morning." ...|$|R

As both of the rival candidates were equally sure of his vote, and each had called upon him and offered a conveyance, it is but fair to presume they were equally beneficent. But Daddy insisted upon walking to the polls,--a distance of two miles,--as a moral example, and a text for the California paragraphers, who hastened to record that such was the influence of the foot-hill climate, that [...] "a citizen of Rough-and-Ready, aged eighty-four, rose at six o'clock, and, after milking two cows, walked a distance of twelve miles to the polls, and returned in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> a cord of wood before dinner." ...|$|R

40|$|The drying {{behavior}} of tarragon leaves {{as well as}} chopped plants were evaluated at air temperatures ranging from 40 to 90 °C, at various air relative humidities and a constant air velocity of 0. 6 m/s. The experimental data was fitted {{to a number of}} thin layer drying equations. The equations were classified to select the more relevant one. Three equations were selected and the coefficients of the equations were compared by three statistical parameters as residual sum of squares, standard error of estimate and mean relative deviation. The effect of temperature on the coefficients of the three selected equations was evaluated by nonlinear regression. The results show that higher temperature cause shorter drying time. Separated leaves have shorter drying <b>time</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>chopped</b> plants. Although the Diffusion approach equation showed the best fit, the Page equation was selected, since it had almost a similar performance but the equation is simpler with two parameters instead of three. Then a function was derived describing {{the relationship between the two}} parameter values and drying temperature...|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{a player}} should adhere <b>to</b> a {{consistent}} <b>chopping</b> policy for each game they play. For example, a common chopping policy which many players adopt for community card games such as Texas hold 'em is <b>to</b> always <b>chop</b> {{if there are}} at least 6 players dealt in, and <b>to</b> never <b>chop</b> if there are fewer than 6 players dealt in. Another common policy is simply never <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> at all.|$|R

This can be very confusing for other players, as it can give the illusion of partnership and collusion, even if such collusion is unintended.|$|R
