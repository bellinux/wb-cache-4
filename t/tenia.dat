Just below the moulding and above the <b>tenia</b> there is a channel 17mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds {{it is easier to}} move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a crowbar to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges. No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style, however, Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given. It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion. Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as Poseidon’s trident and the laurel in Apollo’s hand. The many drill holes found in Hera’s and Apollo's heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} reduced abdominal compression in prone position on ascending colonic movement during supine-to-prone positional change during CT colonography (CTC). Materials and Methods: Eighteen consecutive patients who had undergone prone CTC scanning with cushion blocks placed under the chest and hip/thigh to reduce abdominal compression and had confirmed sessile polyps ≥ 6 mm in the well-distended, straight, mid-ascending colon, were included. Radial location along the ascending colonic luminal circumference (°) was measured for 24 polyps and 54 colonic <b>teniae</b> on supine and prone CTC images. The supine-to-prone change ranging between- 180 ° and + 180 ° (- and + for internal and external colonic rotations, respectively), was determined. In addition, possible causes of any ascending colonic rotations were explored. Results: Abdominal compression during prone CTC scanning completely disappeared with the use of cushion blocks in 17 of 18 patients. However, some degrees of ascending colonic rotation were still observed, with the radial location changes of- 22 ° to 61 ° (median, 13. 9 °) for the polyps and similar degrees for <b>teniae.</b> Fifty-four percent and 56 % of polyps and <b>teniae,</b> respectively, showed changes> 10 °. The radial location change of the polyps was significantly associated with the degree of anterior shift of the small bowel and mesentery (r = 0. 722, p < 0. 001) and the degree of posterior displacement of the ascending colon (r = 0. 566, p = 0. 004) during supine-to-prone positional change. Conclusion: Ascending colonic rotation upon supine-to-prone positional change during CTC, mostly in the form of external rotation, is not eliminated by removing abdominal compression in prone position...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the impact of {{surgical}} access to sigmoid resection on recurrence rates in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis of the sigmoid (UDS) at a minimum follow- up of five years. Recurrence after surgery was defined as left lower quadrant pain, fever and leucocytosis with consistent CT and enema findings on admission and at 6 weeks, respectively. Outcome measures included splenic flexure mobilization, specimen length, inflammation at proximal resection margin and presence of <b>teniae</b> coli at distal resection margin. Seventy-nine patients undergoing laparoscopic sigmoid resection (LSR) were compared with 79 matched controls with open sigmoid resection (OSR) operated on at two institutions during the same period. Patients were well matched for age, gender, body mass index, ASA grading and symptoms duration, but not for follow-up length (81. 9 vs. 86. 9 months, p = 0. 046). The rate of splenic flexure mobilization (19 vs. 41, p 0. 001), specimen length (16. 1 vs. 18. 3 cm, p = 0. 048), presence of inflammation at proximal resection margin (21 vs. 4, p 0. 001), and presence of <b>teniae</b> coli at distal resection margin (4 vs. 53, p 0. 001). Three LSR patients and 7 OSR patients had one recurrence (p = 0. 19). There were no significant differences in rates of flexure mobilization, specimen length, and rates of inflammation present at proximal resection margin in 10 recurring and 145 non-recurring patients. The rate of <b>teniae</b> coli present at distal resection margin was significantly increased in recurring patients (7 vs. 43, p = 0. 03).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{synchronous}} navigation module for CT colonography (CTC) reading. The {{need for such}} a system arises because most CTC protocols require a patient to be scanned in both supine and prone positions to increase sensitivity in detecting colonic polyps. However, existing clinical practices are limited to reading one scan at a time. Such limitation {{is due to the}} fact that building a reference system between scans for the highly flexible colon is a nontrivial task. The conventional centerline approach, generating only the longitudinal distance along the colon, falls short in providing the necessary orientation information to synchronize the virtual navigation cameras in both scanned positions. In this paper we describe a synchronous navigation system by using the <b>teniae</b> coli as anatomical references. <b>Teniae</b> coli are three parallel bands of longitudinal smooth muscle on the surface of the colon. They are morphologically distinguishable and form a piecewise triple helix structure from the appendix to the sigmoid colon. Because of these characteristics, they are ideal references to synchronize virtual cameras in both scanned positions. Our new navigation system consists of two side-by-side virtual colonoscopic view panels (for the supine and prone data sets respectively) and one single camera control unit (which controls both the supine and prone virtual cameras). The capability to examine the same colonic region simultaneously in both scanned images can raise an observer’s confidence in polyp identification and potentially improve the performance of CT colonography...|$|R

40|$|Aim: {{to study}} the special {{features}} of {{the male and female}} corpus callosum internal organization at the mature age. Materials and methods: the total preparations of the male and female corpus callosum (10 preparation of each sex) at 45 – 60 years old were used as the material. The given preparations were used to get from it the plate cuts in the two mutually perpendicular planes with 2 mm. thick. Then the received tissue plates of the corpus callosum underwent plastination in the epoxy. Then the preparations were extracted from the non-polymerized epoxy and placed on the polyethylene film that was covered with the other film of the same size. Further this stratified block was placed amid the two glasses of the equal size that shrunk together by placing the small load on it. After the complete polymerization the received epoxy plates with the corpus callosum tissue contained in it underwent the gentle grinding and the accurate polish and as the result was obtained the surface denudation of its tissue structures that were colored with the 1 % solution of blue methylene for 1 % borax solution. Results of research: at the study of the corpus callosum plastinated cuts in saggital plane was revealed that the transverse platen-form elevations of its higher surface are the cord-form <b>tenias</b> standing out from within and going through the corpus callosum. At its studying in the transverse cut was established that in adults can be separated two types of corpus callosum by its density: the dense one and disperse one. At the large increases of the binocular loupe (microscope MBS- 9) can be seen the gaps between the adjacent commissural cords. Within it can be detected the blood vessels. On the transverse cut of commissural cords in its depth are revealed the thinnest streaks which totality consists of the two alternate dark and light lines that form the layered striation.

40|$|Não foi delimitado nenhum traço anatômico preciso no apêndice vermiforme do ceco no recém-nascido e na criança até dois anos idade. O apêndice vermiforme se prolonga a partir do ceco e se apresenta de forma cônica, com uma base alargada e o ápice estreito. Relacionaram-se parâmetros anatômicos com as diferentes faixas etárias, com o objetivo de definir quando este órgão assemelha-se à anatomia do adulto. Sessenta e sete (67) peças da transição ileocecal foram agrupadas segundo as diferentes faixas etárias: grupo A (18 peças de recém-nascidos à termo) - grupo B (14 peças de 6 meses de idade) - grupo C (13 peças de 12 meses de idade) - grupo D (11 peças de 24 meses de idade) e o grupo E (11 peças de adultos). Foram medidos: o comprimento do apêndice vermiforme, o ponto de contato da borda anti-mesentérica do íleo e a distância entre este e as bordas, direita (d. b. d. i) e esquerda (d. b. e. i.) da base do apêndice. Finalmente, o diâmetro do órgão foi avaliado em três diferentes pontos ao longo de seu comprimento: em sua base, na porção média e próximo do ápice (extremidade distal). As <b>tênias</b> foram avaliadas através da mesoscopia. Para a análise dos resultados utilizouse o teste não-paramétrico de Mann-Whitney. Dentre as sessenta e sete (67) peças submetidas ao estudo do desenvolvimento do apêndice vermiforme, quarenta e sete (70, 1 %) eram do sexo masculino e vinte (29, 9 %) do sexo feminino. O comprimento do apêndice variou de 2, 5 a 12, 5 cm, com média em extensão de 5, 3 cm. A posição retro ileal predominou no primeiro ano de vida (grupos A, B e C). A média das variáveis, de acordo com a faixa etária (grupos A, B, C, D e E), foram: d. b. e. i. = 0, 0 - 0, 0 - 0, 5 - 2, 0 - 2, 5 cm.; d. b. d. i. = 1, 1 - 1, 0 - 1, 3 - 2, 3 - 2, 8 cm; diâmetro da base = 1, 0 - 0, 8 - 0, 4 - 0, 3 - 0, 5 cm; diâmetro do ápice = 0, 31 - 0, 32 - 0, 37 - 0, 58 - 0, 53 cm. Foi realizado o cruzamento dos valores das médias das distâncias da margem esquerda da base do apêndice ao íleo (d. b. e. i.) nos grupo A, B, C e D com o valor médio no grupo E (adulto). A diferença entre esta variável é estatisticamente significante com p= 0, 00 para os grupos A, B e C; e p= 0, 003 para o grupo D, refutando a hipótese nula e confirmando a hipótese alternativa. Quando analisada a distância da margem direita da base do apêndice ao íleo (d. b. d. i) entre os grupos A, B, C, D e grupo E, os resultados se mostraram também estatisticamente significativos com p= 0, 00 e p= 0, 004. Os dados sugerem que o crescimento da distância da borda esquerda da implantação do apêndice vermiforme ao íleo é considerado o parâmetro anatômico mais importante tanto para a aquisição derradeira da forma do órgão (base estreita), semelhante àquela encontrada no adulto, quanto na definição da transição anatômica entre os dois órgãos. ________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThere is no precise {{anatomical}} trace {{that limits}} the vermiform appendix of the cecum in the newborn {{and in the}} child {{in the first years of}} life. The appendix prolongs from the cecum and presents a conical form, with an enlarged base and a narrow apex. The objective of the present work was to identify certain anatomical parameters, and to relate them chronologically to the different age groups in order to define when exactly the base of implantation of this organ in the cecum resembles the adult's anatomy. Sixty-seven (67) ileocecal transition pieces were grouped according to the different ag groups: Group A (18 pieces of newborns at term) – Group B (14 pieces of six months- old children) – Group C (13 pieces of 12 month-old children) – Group D (11 pieces of 24 month-old children) and Group E (11 pieces of adults). Initially, the length of the vermiform appendix was measured. The point of contact of the ileum anti-mesenteric edge in the cecum was identified and the distance between this and the edges, right (d. b. d. i) and left (d. b. e. i.), of the appendix implantation was assessed. Finally, the diameter of the organ was evaluated in three different points along its length: on its base, in the middle portion and next to the apex (distal extremity). The tapeworms were evaluated with a mesoscope. For the analysis of data, the non-parametric Mann- Whitney test for independent samples was used. The results were demonstrated through the crossing of variables in the different age groups and the statistical significance level was considered for p< 0. 05. Results and discussion: From the sixty-seven (67) pieces submitted to the vermiform appendix development study, forty-seven (70. 1 %) were obtained from males and twenty (29. 9 %) from females. The total vermiform appendix length in centimeters ranged from 2. 5 cm to 12. 5 cm, with average extension of 5. 3 cm. The retro ileum position was predominant in the first year of life (groups A, B and C). The average of the variables according to the age group (groups A, B, C, D and E) was: d. b. e. i. = 0. 0 - 0. 0 - 0. 5 - 2. 0 - 2. 5 cm respectively. d. b. d. i. = 1. 1 - 1. 0 - 1. 3 - 2. 3 - 2. 8 cm respectively. diameter of the BASE = 1. 0 - 0. 8 - 0. 4 - 0. 3 - 0. 5 cm respectively. diameter of the apex = 0. 31 - 0. 32 - 0. 37 - 0. 58 - 0. 53 cm respectively. The crossing of the average values of the distances from the left margin of the appendix base to the ileum (d. b. e. i.) was performed in groups A, B, C and D with the average value in group E (adult). Differences between these variables are statistically significant with p= 0. 00 for groups A, B and C and p= 0. 003 for group D, refuting the null hypothesis and confirming the alternative hypothesis. When the distance from the right margin of the appendix base to the ileum (d. b. d. i.) between groups A, B, C, D and group E is analyzed, the results also seemed to be statistically significant with p= 0. 00 and p= 0. 004 respectively. It was concluded that the development of the distance between the left margin of the vermiform appendix implantation to the ileum is considered as the most important anatomical parameter as much to the utmost acquisition of the form of the organ (narrow base), similar to that found in the adult individuals, as to the definition of the anatomical transition between the cecum and the vermiform appendix...|$|R
