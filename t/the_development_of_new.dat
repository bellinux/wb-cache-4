5|$|As China {{entered the}} early modern period, the I Ching took on renewed {{relevance}} in both Confucian and Daoist study. The Kangxi Emperor was especially fond of the I Ching and ordered new interpretations of it.

5|$|Because of the {{differences}} in the metabolic pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area for <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> antibiotics. For example, the enzyme nicotinamidase, which converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, is a target for drug design, as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria.|$|E

5|$|Seed {{multiplication}} may be {{used for}} <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> cultivars or to increase the yield of native species. Seeds are generally sown in early summer in seedbeds, and then transplanted to larger containers. They require warmth frequent watering, and should not be given a dormant period.

5|$|Beginning in July 1940, the Red Army General Staff {{developed}} war {{plans that}} identified the Wehrmacht {{as the most}} dangerous threat to the Soviet Union, {{and that in the}} case of a war with Germany, the Wehrmacht's main attack would come through the region north of the Pripyat Marshes into Belorussia, which later proved to be correct. Stalin disagreed, and in October he authorized <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> plans that assumed a German attack would focus on the region south of Pripyat Marshes towards the economically vital regions in Ukraine. This became the basis for all subsequent Soviet war plans and the deployment of their armed forces in preparation for the German invasion.|$|E

5|$|Brown's main {{contribution}} to the game, however, was not to <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> plays but to the organization and administration of teams. Before Brown, football {{was seen as a}} chaotic affair where winning was a product mostly of physical prowess. Few coaches took strategy and preparation seriously. Brown, by contrast, hired a full-time staff of assistants, tested his players on their intelligence and their knowledge of plays, instituted strict organization of practices and analyzed game film to get an edge on opponents. Brown created a detailed system for scouting college talent as a means to improve the Browns' college draft.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially {{registered}} synagogues {{and prayer}} houses that spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life {{had moved to}} new centres like Podgórze. This in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz and <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> districts in Kraków. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.|$|E

With <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps {{that could be}} lowered for tanning. Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure. Coco Chanel made suntans fashionable, and in 1932 French designer Madeleine Vionnet offered an exposed midriff in an evening gown. They were seen a year later in Gold Diggers of 1933. The Busby Berkeley film Footlight Parade of 1932 showcases aquachoreography that featured bikinis. Dorothy Lamour's The Hurricane (1937) also showed two-piece bathing suits.|$|E
