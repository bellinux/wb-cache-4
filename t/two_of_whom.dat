5|$|Cagney was {{the second}} of seven children, <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> died within months of birth.

One biographer, Andrew Robinson, even speculated that Champollion was not in fact the son of Jacques Champollion's wife Jeanne-Françoise Gualieu, but the result of an extramarital affair.|$|E
