The Proder project “Avaliação da poda mecânica em pomares de pera” was designed to contribute to solutions that would reduce the present dependence in labour and therefore to promote a reduction in pruning costs. This paper shows {{the results of a}} trial made to evaluate the influence of mechanical topping in manual pruning complement field work and pear yield. Topping was performed using a Reynolds 6 DT 3. 0 m cutting bar with six hydraulic-driven circular disc-saws mounted in the <b>three</b> <b>point</b> tractor <b>linkage</b> system. The field trial was performed in a commercial orchard with 20 years, planted in an array of 4 m x 2 m with tree lines oriented in North-South direction. Trees were trained as the central leader system. In this trial, in a randomised complete block design with four replications, two treatments are being compared leading to 8 plots with one line of 14 trees per plot. The treatments tests were: T 1 - manual pruning performed by workers using pneumatic shears, in each year; T 2 - Topping the canopy parallel to the ground, using a discs-saw pruning machine mounted in a front loader of an agricultural tractor, followed by manual pruning complement performed by workers with pneumatic shears. Tree height and width was measured, before and after pruning. Work was timed and pear yields evaluated. Mechanical topping seems to be effective in the control of tree height, which can contribute to increase 14 % of work rates on manual pruning complement. No significant differences in pear yield were found between treatments...|$|R

50|$|Transmission was 8 speed {{through a}} single clutch with {{the option of}} the Allis-Chalmers half shaft clutch to achieve 'live' power take-off. Converging <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> was powered by an engine mounted {{hydraulic}} pump giving hydraulic power whenever the engine was running regardless of transmission status. An hydraulic weight transfer system was built in to increase traction and a simple mechanical depth stop was provided on the earlier machines.

Other modifications and options included improved gear ratios; a pick-up hitch; an increase in power through higher maximum revs and revised battery arrangement. An option on both models was the patent Allis-Chalmers PAVT rear wheels (Power Adjusted Variable Track),a system adopted by other manufacturers after patents expired.

40|$|Tractors {{of today}} come {{equipped}} with a CAN-system. A CAN-system sends information from sensors to electronic control units who process the signals. The sensors measure several interesting parameters such as force, pressure and speed for various components of the tractor. This thesis discuss a force sensor which {{is placed in the}} pivot of the tractors <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>linkage,</b> the sensor measure the horizontal reaction force from the load that the tractor is exposed to. Signals from this sensor can be used to measure the force from any implement that the tractor is exposed to during an operation. The results from this thesis can be used for research purposes, for example, to compare implements from different manufacturer or to optimize the implement settings during an operation. However, there is a problem that this thesis aimed to solve by developing a method which can be put into practice. When a constant force from an implement is acting on the <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>linkage,</b> the reaction force in the pivot of the <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> (where the force sensor is attached) is going to vary depending on the angel of the lower lift arm. It is not uncommon that the angel of the lower lift arm is varying, because different implement and soil require different settings on the linkage. This means that the force which is measured by the sensor may vary in size even though the actual force does not vary. To solve this problem, theoretical calculations have been performed and equations to describe the variation of the reaction force depending on the geometry have been created. The theory has also been verified by a finite element analysis and a practical verification test. The conclusions from these three parts correspond to each other. Theoretically that means by knowing the horizontal reaction force (measured by the force sensor) and the angles of the geometry on the <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> (can be measured with a position sensor) you can calculate the force an implement influence the tractor with. However, there is a problem which prevents this method from being completely reliable. It is only working when the impact force is completely parallel to the horizontal plane. Since many implements are being pulled to the soil (plow, cultivator, etc.) in practice there are also vertical forces affecting the tractor. This is no problem to solve in theory, but in practice this method does not compensate for the vertical force. This vertical force should be examined more carefully before the method can be used reliably in full scale...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to analyze the effect of setup of <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> on {{energetic}} and performance parameters of tractor aggregate. For this purpose were made two series of measurements. The first series was realized with the tractor NewHolland T 7050 aggregate with 5 -furrow reversible plough plough KUHN HUARD VM 150 5 NS. Data such as engine load, engine revolution, diesel fuel consumption, diesel fuel temperature, were got from CAN Bus network during the measurement. Then were measured following parameters total time of ploughing, dephth of ploughing, time of turning and swath of the tractor aggregate. The specific consumption of diesel fuel and the efficiency of the aggregate were calculated using the aforementioned parameters. The second series of measurements was realized with the tractor Zetor Proxima Plus 115 aggregate with four-furrow plough Kverneland 150 B. During the measurement the data such theoretical and actual speed of the tractor and force in the top link of three point hitch were recorded in the computer.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design a height control system that {{could be applied to}} a <b>Three</b> <b>Point</b> <b>Linkage</b> mounted implement. Several methods of {{achieving}} this goal were investigated. The two methods that were investigated in detail were an electrical over hydraulic system and a mechanical over hydraulic system. The unique operation of the <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> implements when lift assist is used presents problems when accurate frame height is required, such as when seeding operations are being performed. The system has been designed so that it is constantly sensing the height of the frame {{at both ends of the}} implement. The output from this sensing is used to control a hydraulic valve mechanically or electrically. If a height discrepancy between the front and rear of the implement is detected, this valve will be activated to allow a flow of hydraulic oil to the lift assist system, levelling the implement. The investigation of the electrical control system involved constructing a prototype circuit that was based on a PICAXE microcontroller to provide computing power. This chip was programmed to read the output from two variable resistors and detect any height discrepancies. When a discrepancy was detected, the microcontroller activated a servomechanism that used mechanical motion to correct the position of one of the resistor to match the mechanical position of the two resistors, thus proving the concept of mechanical height control. The mechanical system was designed so that the output from two height sensing wheels was mechanically input into the hydraulic valve to actuate it when the wheels sensed that there was a height discrepancy. This system was modelled using the solid modelling package SolidWorks and basic engineering analysis was performed on the design...|$|E
40|$|In {{cooperation}} with the two companies SYMACON Bildverarbeitung GmbH Barleben and Müller-Elektronik GmbH & Co. KG Salzkotten a sensor controlled field sprayer for precise plant protection was developed at the Leibniz-institute for Agricultural Engineering. In narrow seeded field crops like cereals, the weed detection is done within the tramlines. Because {{of the way the}} system operates, there is no discrimination between cultivated crops and weeds. In later growth stages, crop and weed are overlapping and discrimination within the plant stand becomes difficult or even impossible. Situational, the weed number (early growth stages) or the weed coverage level (late growth stages) can be used as parameter to control the field sprayer. The sensor is positioned at the front <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> of the tractor. Field sprayers with a fast adaption of the application rate are not yet commercially available. In contrast to other “on/off” sensor controlled application systems which are on the market or under development, the application rate in the presented technology is in- or decreased according to the sensor signal. At heavy weed infested sites of the field, the customary application rate is sprayed. It is reduced up to 50 % at sites with low weed pressure. Between the volume of 50 % and 100 %, the application rate is proportional adapted to the weed infestation. In contrast to the “on/off” switching of single nozzles or boom sections, no sites are left unsprayed using the variable rate approach. There is no risk of unobstructed weed development or seed setting. In autumn 2009, a 26 ha winter barley field on a farm was sprayed against weeds with the sensor controlled field sprayer. The product Falkon® was used with the dosage of 1 l/ha. The spray volume was varied between 100 and 200 l/ha. The product savings were on average 20 %...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the slip}} {{indicator}} {{was designed and}} constructed {{for the purpose of}} monitoring the slippage of the tractor powered wheel during the operation of plowing and of applying the output signal to control the draft force acting on the plow. In the previous work conducted by one of the authors, two AC generators were attached to front and rear wheels of the tractor to detect their rotational speed, and the slippage was calculated from the output voltage signal proportional to the rotational speed of the wheels. In the use of this type of slip sensor, some difficulty was found in adjusting and resetting the voltage corresponding to the zero slippage, depending on the running gear prior to the operation. A different type of slip sensor was therefore designed and constructed to remedy this disadvantage. The photo-electric type pulse generator was used to detect the rotational speed of both front and rear wheels through the mechanical amplification by use of gears to obtain the required numbers of pulses per unit rotation of the wheel. The number of pulses generated from the wheels was converted to the frequency and then to the voltage. This output voltage was compared to the set voltage which corresponds to the set slippage. In turn this is properly determined from the relationship between the slippage and the pulling froce expressing the different shape due to the soil condition and running device. The difference between the output voltage and set voltage was amlified. Then the relay connected to the hydraulic directional valve to control lifting and lowering the implement mounted on the <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> moved on off, depending on the voltage difference. The slippage calculated from the difference indicated through the monitoring device mounted on the platform located in front of operator's seat. This monitoring device worked quite satisfactorily to help the operator in knowing how much draft force was acting on the implement through the indicated value of the slippage. The field test was done to validate the accurate response and action of the implement under slip draft control in two kinds of fields, sandy and paddy, after harvesting of rice. Through the satisfactory result of the field experiments, it was observed that this type of slip draft control system described here would be possible to apply to a commercial tractor without much modification and improvements. No problems of cost, accuracy or durability for practical use were found...|$|E
40|$|Although, {{mulberry}} {{plants are}} grown in Australia as ornamentals or fruit, {{there are no}} data available or work done to assist in establishing a sericulture industry. This research conducted in Lockyer Valley in South East Queensland covered four areas of mulberry leaf production in identifying mulberry varieties and practices suitable for Australian conditions. The first trial involved identifying local mulberry varieties with desirable characters of high leaf yield, high protein content, high carbohydrate content and high moisture content; these are the characters desirable for sericulture production. Nine mulberry varieties consisting of Morus nigra, Morus alba and Morus macroura cv. Shahtoot, were identified as planting material in South East Queensland. Cuttings were raised in polybags in a glasshouse for 18 weeks. The plants of nine varieties (LV 1 to LV 9) were transplanted into the field on raised plastic mulch beds at a row by tree spacing of 4 m × 2 m. A randomised block design and three replications was used. Irrigation and fertiliser were applied through a drip system. Three sets of data were recorded over the trial period. Harvest 1 was taken at 20 weeks after transplanting, Harvest 2 at 13 weeks after first pruning and Harvest 3 at 30 weeks after second pruning. The characters evaluated were leaf and shoot yield (fresh and dry weight), crude protein and carbohydrate (TNC) content, moisture content, growth rate, number of shoots, number of branches, stem diameter, longest shoot height, internode length, leaf size and shape, number of leaf lobe and 20 leaf weight. The number of branches, stem diameter, longest shoot height, internode length were measured on the longest shoot at harvest. Using Harvest 2 data, when leaves are normally harvested and fed to silkworms, varieties, LV 5 and LV 7, recorded higher fresh leaf yields (2. 13 t/ha and 2. 21 t/ha respectively), leaf moisture content (60 % and 59 %), and intermediate carbohydrate content (17. 5 % and 14. 9 %). Although both varieties, LV 5 and LV 7, recorded low protein contents (13. 6 % and 15. 7 % respectively), they were recommended for sericulture production based on overall performance. LV 9, at Harvest 3 recorded high fresh leaf yield (5. 6 t/ha), protein content (18. 6 %), carbohydrate content (12. 5 %) and moisture content (65 %), therefore it was also recommended for sericulture production. The second trial involved five varieties Morus alba sp. (MA), Morus nigra sp. cathayana, Morus nigra sp. kanva (MK), Morus nigra sp. multicaulis (MM) and Morus nigra sp. (MN) imported from Indonesia. The trial set up, {{data collection and analysis}} were the same as in the first trial. Two sets of data, Harvests 1 and 2, were recorded over the research period. Varieties, MM, MK and MC were recommended for silkworm feeding based on leaf yield, protein content, carbohydrate content and moisture content. MM recorded the highest leaf yield (6. 57 and 8. 13 t/ha), followed by MK (3. 66 and 4. 79 t/ha) and then MC (3. 43 and 4. 54 t/ha) for Harvests 1 and 2. Moisture content for MM (68 % and 75. 1 %), MK (71 % and 77. 5 %) and MC (71 % and 76. 2 %) were high at both harvests except for MM (68 %) which recorded the lowest at Harvest 1. MM (17. 5 % and 15. 5 %) recorded the lowest at both harvests for protein content, whereas MK (17. 8 % and 18. 9 %) and MC (17. 6 % and 18. 9 %) maintained intermediate protein contents at both harvests. MK (18. 1 % and 15. 5 %) recorded the highest carbohydrate at both harvests while MM, in general, recorded intermediate carbohydrate contents. MC recorded intermediate and lowest carbohydrate content (13. 8 % and 12. 7 %) at Harvests 1 and 2 respectively. In general, MM, MK and MC showed characters which were higher than MA and MN, although MM recorded low protein content. The third trial looked at the effect of plant density on the main economic characters of mulberry plants. A local variety, LV 1, was planted using six density treatments of row x plant spacing 0. 6 m x 0. 5 m, 0. 6 m x 1. 0 m, 0. 6 m x 1. 5 m, 4. 0 m x 0. 5 m, 4. 0 m x 1. 0 m, 4. 0 m x 1. 5 m using a strip plot design. Two sets of readings were measured over the research period. Harvest 1 occurred at 26 weeks after first pruning and Harvest 2 at 37 weeks after the second pruning. The 4. 0 m x 0. 5 m spacing treatment (5, 000 plants/ha) was recommended for sericulture practice because leaf yield was high (2541 kg/ha and 4274 kg/ha) at Harvests 1 and 2, protein content was highest (19. 7 % and 19. 1 %) at both harvests, carbohydrate content was lowest (14. 1 %) but second highest (20. 2 %) at Harvest 1 and 2 respectively. Moisture content was highest (59. 9 %) and low (61. 4 %) at Harvests 1 and 2. The fourth area of study involved designing, developing and testing a mechanical mulberry leaf harvester. The harvester consisted of a reel, reciprocating cutting knife, conveyor, hydraulic system, lift mast, collection bin and support frames. The harvester was supported at the tractors <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>linkage</b> and operated by the tractors hydraulics. The harvester was field tested on 14 and 20 week mulberry plants, planted at 1 m apart and at row spacing of 4 m. Harvesting operations were performed at three tractor forward speeds (1. 5, 2. 0 and 3. 0 km/h) in combination with reel, cutting knife and conveyor speeds. It was observed that all mulberry plants within the effective cutting area (100 % cutting efficiency) were harvested at the three forward speeds. The collected yield ranged from 0. 63 t/ha to 2. 25 t/ha, collection efficiency ranged from 65 % to 93 % and damaged shoots ranged from 9 % to 34 %. New shoots budded and grew from all the harvested shoots (damaged and undamaged). The four trials showed that local varieties LV 5, LV 7, and LV 9 together with imported varieties MC, MK and MM produced high leaf yield, protein, carbohydrate and moisture content. A 4 m x 0. 5 m spacing (5000 trees/ha) treatment showed high values for the desirable characters, therefore the six high production varieties as well as the 4 m x 0. 5 m spacing arrangement are recommended for sericulture production in Australia. Also the mechanical leaf harvester which showed satisfactory performance can be utilised to minimise labour costs...|$|E
