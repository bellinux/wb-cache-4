25|$|Episodic {{memory is}} {{the memory of}} autobiographical events (times, places, {{associated}} emotions, and other contextual who, what, when, where, why knowledge) that can be explicitly stated or conjured. It is the collection of past personal experiences that occurred {{at a particular time}} and place. For example, if one remembers the party on his or her 6th birthday, this is an episodic memory.

The book is about divine attributes and it served as an answer to a question from the city of Hama, Syria. At <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time</b> Ash'arites held prominent positions within the Islamic scholarly community in both Syria and Egypt, and they held a certain position on the divine attributes of God. Ibn Taymiyyah in his book strongly disagreed with their views and this heavy opposition to the common Ash'ari position, caused considerable controversy.|$|E

The character is featured in the songs [...] "Rough Landing, Holly" [...] and [...] "Holly Wood Died". The band explained the meaning of the title track, which they said is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged after the release of Ocean Avenue. Key also commented that when he was preoccupied with making the album, there were distractions while in the process; he simply referred to the distractions as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album just that. He also says that the main reason behind that was how it affected the band during <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

Out of all the mainstream-inspired attempts The Bama Boyz sent to Solange, she eventually chose that last and most unexpected track and penned [...] "Why Don't You Love Me".

500|$|Moondance was {{recorded}} from August to September 1969 at the Studio A penthouse of A & R Studios in New York City. It {{was the first}} album for which Morrison was credited as the producer; he later said [...] "no one knew what I was looking for except me, so I just did it." [...] Around this time, the singer made it known to Warner Bros. {{that he would be}} lead production duties for all his future recordings, which forced producers recruited by the label into assisting roles. It also led to frequent enlisting and dismissal of musicians to meet Morrison's creative vision. Lewis Merenstein—Moondances executive producer—had brought in Astral Weeks session musicians Richard Davis, Jay Berliner, and Warren Smith, Jr. for the first recording session at A & R Studios, but Morrison—according to Platania—"sort of manipulated the situation" [...] and [...] "got rid of them all. For some reason he didn't want those musicians." [...] While not an overbearing presence among the record's personnel, the singer later conceded to creating an atmosphere of artistic autonomy during the sessions: [...] "When I go into the studio, I'm a magician. I make things happen. Whatever is working in that particular space at <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time,</b> I use, I take advantage of." ...|$|E

[...] No 4 Commando's troops also reported that they achieved surprise against the gun batteries they were tasked with destroying.

The city became the capital of the newly formed Lviv Oblast. The Soviets reopened uni-lingual Ukrainian schools, which were discontinued by the Polish government due to low enrolment with the Ukrainian – mostly bilingual population hovering at around 10% citywide at <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time.</b> The only change over imposed by the Soviets was the language of instruction, with the actual net loss of about 1,000 schools in short order.

Reflecting on the event in 1969, Presley claimed that Sullivan had expressed a very different opinion off-camera: [...] "So they arranged to put me on television. At <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> <b>time</b> there was a lot of controversy—you didn't see people moving—out in public. They were gettin' it on in the back rooms, but you didn't see it out in public too much. So there was a lot of controversy ... and I went to the Ed Sullivan Show.

We applied a three-parameter curve-fitting function to serial measures of recumbent length from 569 infants (birth to 2 years of age) in 188 families enrolled in the Fels Longitudinal Study. This yielded three growth pattern parameters that represented estimated recumbent length at birth (parameter 1), rate of growth (parameter 2), and intrinsic rate of change in growth (parameter 3). The growth pattern parameter estimates for each individual were examined {{in a series of}} genetic analyses using a maximum -likelihood method for pedigree data. Significant heritabilities were found for all three growth pattern parameters: parameter 1, h 2 — 0. 83 ± 0. 12; parameter 2, h 2 = 0. 67 ± 0. 18; and parameter 3, h 2 = 0. 78 ± 0. 17. In addition, genotype by sex interaction was indicated for growth pattern parameters 2 and 3, suggesting that the genes influencing rate of growth and intrinsic rate of change in growth are them selves influenced by the sex of the individual...|$|R
