5|$|A {{common and}} popular {{structural}} alignment method is the DALI, or distance alignment matrix method, which breaks the input structures into hexapeptide fragments and calculates a distance matrix by evaluating the contact patterns between successive fragments. Secondary structure features that involve residues that are contiguous in sequence {{appear on the}} matrix's main diagonal; other diagonals in the matrix reflect spatial contacts between residues that are not near {{each other in the}} sequence. When these diagonals are parallel to the main diagonal, <b>the</b> <b>features</b> they represent are parallel; when they are perpendicular, their features are antiparallel. This representation is memory-intensive because <b>the</b> <b>features</b> in the square matrix are symmetrical (and thus redundant) about the main diagonal.|$|E
