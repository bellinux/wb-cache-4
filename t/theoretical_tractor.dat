40|$|Dependence of tractor {{wheel torque}} on <b>theoretical</b> <b>tractor</b> motion speed {{has been used}} for {{comparison}} of tractor operation with electromechanical transmission with installation of energy accumulating mechanism and without its installation. In this case a traction asynchronous electric motor is operating under nominal and limit conditions. The paper also considers dependence diagrams of actual input power for the traction asynchronous electric motor and its losses due to <b>theoretical</b> <b>tractor</b> motion speed. Tractor wheel torque is limited during the operation of the traction asynchronous electric motor with energy accumulating mechanisms by the following factors: maximum electric motor torque at the given frequency of supply voltage; maximum value of internal combustion motor output which can be transferred to the traction asynchronous electric motor; grip of the wheels. During the operation of the traction asynchronous electric motor with energy accumulating mechanisms there is a possibility for short power consumption without regard to the second limitation because it is possible to use power not only of internal combustion motor but also the power which is stored in the energy accumulating mechanisms. Comparison of characteristics has been made when a tractor is operating at high gear and when it is operating at all gears (that is two gears). Operation of the 5 th class tractors has been analyzed for all possible cases (operation with energy accumulating mechanisms and without the mechanisms while being operated at all gears) and various types of work: tilling, sowing, cultivation, bulldozing work, transport mode. In this case equipment has been used which is aggregated with the 5 th class tractor.  </p...|$|E

40|$|Soil working {{operations}} in conventional farming systems involving {{the use of}} tractors {{are some of the}} operations which incur the highest energy costs. Sustainability of such systems requires strictly-controlled management of resources which can lead to a significant reduction in crop-production costs, derived from savings in fuel consumption. A novel data acquisition system has been successfully integrated on-board the Massey Ferguson 3000 series agricultural tractors for measuring tractor-implement performance. A commercial load cell was incorporated into the existing system for the needed tractor-implement performance measurements. This system is capable of measuring, displaying and recording, in real-time, the <b>tractor’s</b> <b>theoretical</b> travel speed, the actual travel speed, the engine speed, the fuel consumption rate, and the drawbar pull. Static calibration tests on various associated sensors for the required measurements show excellent linearity with correlation coefficients that are close to 1. The developed system has been extensively and successfully field demonstrated for tractor-implement performance with offset disc harrows on dry, undisturbed loamy soils. Under these conditions, a ratio of tractor power to implement width is suggested. The data also show the existence of a linear relationship between fuel consumption per hectare and specific draught, for the 4 to 9 kN m- 1 range, which suggests the possibility of extending the ASABE model of draught prediction to forecast fuel consumption. The configuration of the tractor-harrow combination, based on the measurement of the draught required under operational conditions, provides the manufacturers with a reliable indication of the recommended power required for each harrow model. With this type of information farmers can make decisions regarding selection of a suitable tractor-implement combination for their farms. As a consequence, there is improved tractor-harrow productivity and field efficiency...|$|R
