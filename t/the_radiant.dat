5|$|In Chinese astronomy, {{the stars}} {{that make up}} Andromeda were members of four {{different}} constellations that had astrological and mythological significance; a constellation related to Andromeda also exists in Hindu mythology. Andromeda is the location of <b>the</b> <b>radiant</b> for the Andromedids, a weak meteor shower that occurs in November.|$|E
5|$|In Chinese mythology, Auriga's {{stars were}} {{incorporated}} into several constellations, including the celestial emperors' chariots, {{made up of the}} modern constellation's brightest stars. Auriga is home to <b>the</b> <b>radiant</b> for the Aurigids, Zeta Aurigids, Delta Aurigids, and the hypothesized Iota Aurigids.|$|E

5|$|On 9 and 10 October 1946, the {{telescope}} {{was used to}} observe the ionisation in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the background level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were indeed from meteors. Shortly after this, {{the telescope}} {{was used to determine}} <b>the</b> <b>radiant</b> points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at <b>the</b> <b>radiant</b> point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. The telescope, as well as other receivers on the site, was also used to study auroral streamers that were visible at the site in early August 1947.|$|E
5|$|Circinus is <b>the</b> <b>radiant</b> of {{an annual}} meteor shower, the Alpha Circinids (ACI). First {{observed}} in Queensland in 1977, the meteors {{have an average}} velocity of 27.1km/s and {{are thought to be}} associated with a long-period comet. In 2011, Peter Jenniskens proposed that the debris trail of comet C/1969 T1 could intersect with the Earth's orbit and generate a meteor outburst coming from a radiant close to Beta Circini. The ACI shower peaks on 4 June, the day it was first observed.|$|E
5|$|Pavo is <b>the</b> <b>radiant</b> of two annual meteor showers: the Delta Pavonids and August Pavonids. Appearing from 21 March to 8 April and {{generally}} peaking around 5 and 6 April, Delta Pavonids {{are thought to}} be associated with Comet Grigg-Mellish. The shower was discovered by Michael Buhagiar from Perth, Australia, who observed meteors on six occasions between 1969 and 1980. The August Pavonids peak around August 31 and {{are thought to be}} associated with the Halley-type Comet Levy (P/1991 L3).|$|E
5000|$|The Filaret Association (Zgromadzenie Filaretów, Filaretai, Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Pożytecznej Zabawy, filareci, {{from the}} Greek [...] "philáretos," [...] "Lovers of Virtue), (1834) a secret {{organization}} created by Zan within the Philomaths after {{the dissolution of}} <b>the</b> <b>Radiants.</b> It continued <b>the</b> traditions of <b>the</b> <b>Radiants,</b> but with a much clearer pro-independence goal, and was dedicated {{to the study of}} Polish and Lithuania patriotic literature. It was disbanded in 1823 after the arrests of the Philomaths.|$|R

5000|$|A full shardbearer, one {{wielding}} both Shardblade and Shardplate, {{is a force}} {{capable of}} turning the tide of battle on their own. Kaladin and Syl express a revulsion to the Shardblades wielded by the Alethi. During Dalinar's visions he sees <b>the</b> Knights <b>Radiant</b> wearing Shardplate and wielding Shardblades, but {{he notes that the}} plate when worn by <b>the</b> <b>Radiants</b> glow. Additionally, <b>the</b> number of Blades and Plate worn by <b>the</b> <b>Radiants</b> is much greater than the number left in the world at the main timeline of the The Way of Kings. There are also references to [...] "Honorblades" [...] and [...] "Dawnshards", though the terms are only applied to the weapons of the Heralds of the Almighty and only on occasion. An Honorblade is a sword that gives the user Surgebinding abilities. One such sword is used by Szeth and allows him to Windrun. The Shardblades used by <b>the</b> Knights <b>Radiant</b> can be summoned instantly. They can also change forms. For example, Kaladin's Shardblade changes into a spear and again into a shield when fighting Szeth.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed <b>the</b> <b>Radiant</b> A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if they are given the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix is <b>the</b> <b>radiant</b> of two annual meteor showers. The Phoenicids, {{also known}} as the December Phoenicids, were first {{observed}} on 3 December 1887. The shower was particularly intense in December 1956, and is thought related to the breakup of the short-period comet 289P/Blanpain. It peaks around 4–5 December, though is not seen every year. A very minor meteor shower peaks around July 14 with around one meteor an hour, though meteors can be seen anytime from July 3 to 18; this shower {{is referred to as the}} July Phoenicids.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{appear in}} art, either to {{illustrate}} their botanical appearance, {{or for the}} purposes of the artist, which may include decoration or religious symbolism. For example, the Virgin Mary was compared by the Venerable Bede to a lily, the white petals denoting purity of body, while the yellow anthers signified <b>the</b> <b>radiant</b> light of the soul; accordingly, European portraits of the Virgin's Annunciation may depict a vase of white lilies in her room to indicate her attributes. Plants are also often used as backgrounds or features in portraits, and as main subjects in still lifes.|$|E
5000|$|Randy and <b>the</b> <b>Radiants</b> (or Randy & <b>the</b> <b>Radiants)</b> were an American garage {{rock band}} from Memphis, Tennessee who were active from 1962-1966 {{and then again}} 1976-1984. They {{were one of the}} most popular groups in the Memphis area during the 1960s, and though their {{association}} with Knox Phillips, son of Sam Phillips, they signed with Sun Records and recorded two singles on the label which became hits in the region, particularly their second release, [...] "My Way of Thinking", which became one of the top hits in the area, reaching #1 on WGMN's charts. The group's work has today become highly regarded amongst garage rock enthusiasts and collectors.|$|R
5000|$|Caston {{was born}} in Chicago, the son of blues {{musician}} Leonard [...] "Baby Doo" [...] Caston. After spending {{some time in the}} US Army, in 1964 he joined Maurice McAlister, a fellow member of the Greater Harvest Church, in his vocal group, <b>The</b> <b>Radiants.</b> [...] <b>The</b> group recorded for the Chess label (for whom Caston's father also recorded), and while working at the label Caston co-wrote, with Billy Davis, new words for James Cleveland's gospel song, [...] "I Had A Talk With God Last Night". Recorded by Mitty Collier with secular lyrics as [...] "I Had A Talk With My Man", it became a hit single (no. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100) in late 1964. [...] Caston left <b>the</b> <b>Radiants</b> in 1965, after their first two hit singles, [...] "Voice Your Choice" [...] and [...] "It Ain't No Big Thing", and began working as a session musician, songwriter and producer at Chess. He played piano on Fontella Bass' hit [...] "Rescue Me", and also worked with singers Bobby McClure, Jan Bradley and Laura Lee. [...] He returned to work with <b>the</b> <b>Radiants</b> in 1967, writing and producing their final hit, [...] "Hold On".|$|R

5|$|The {{brightest}} star, Alpha Phoenicis, {{is named}} Ankaa, an Arabic word meaning 'the Phoenix'. It is an orange giant of apparent magnitude 2.4. Next is Beta Phoenicis, actually a binary system {{composed of two}} yellow giants with a combined apparent magnitude of 3.3. Nu Phoenicis has a dust disk, while the constellation has ten star systems with known planets and the recently discovered galaxy clusters El Gordo and the Phoenix Cluster—located 7.2 and 5.7 billion light years away respectively, two of the largest objects in the visible universe. Phoenix is <b>the</b> <b>radiant</b> of two annual meteor showers: the Phoenicids in December, and the July Phoenicids.|$|E
5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} the Milky Way passes through Perseus, whose {{brightest}} star is the yellow-white supergiant Alpha Persei (also called Mirfak or Mirphak), which shines at magnitude 1.79. It {{and many of the}} surrounding stars are members of an open cluster known as the Alpha Persei Cluster. The best-known star, however, is Algol (Beta Persei), linked with ominous legends because of its variability, which is noticeable to the naked eye. Rather than being an intrinsically variable star, it is an eclipsing binary. Other notable star systems in Perseus include X Persei, a binary system containing a neutron star, and GK Persei, a nova that peaked at magnitude 0.2 in 1901. The Double Cluster, comprising two open clusters quite near each other in the sky, was known to the ancient Chinese. The constellation gives its name to the Perseus cluster (Abell 426), a massive galaxy cluster located 250 million light-years from Earth. It hosts <b>the</b> <b>radiant</b> of the annual Perseids meteor shower—one of the most prominent meteor showers in the sky.|$|E
5|$|Three of the constellation's {{stars are}} {{visible to the}} naked eye: Alpha Comae Berenices, Beta Comae Berenices and Gamma Comae Berenices. They form a 45-degree triangle, from which Berenice's {{imaginary}} tresses, formed by the Coma Star Cluster, hang. The constellation's brightest star is Beta Comae Berenices, a 4.2-magnitude main sequence star similar to the Sun. Coma Berenices contains the North Galactic Pole and one of the richest known galaxy clusters, the Coma Cluster, part of the Coma Supercluster. Galaxy Malin 1, in the constellation, is the first known giant low-surface-brightness galaxy. Supernova SN 2005ap discovered in Coma Berenices is the brightest known, and SN 1940B was the first observed example of a type II supernova. The star FK Comae Berenices is the prototype of an eponymous class of variable stars. The constellation is <b>the</b> <b>radiant</b> of one meteor shower, Coma Berenicids, which has one of the fastest meteor speeds, up to 65km/s (40 mps).|$|E

5|$|An early {{goal of the}} Dota 2 {{team was}} the {{adaptation}} of Defense of the Ancients aesthetic style for the Source engine. <b>The</b> <b>Radiant</b> and Dire factions replaced the Sentinel and Scourge from the mod, respectively. Character names, abilities, items and map design from the mod were largely retained, with some changes due to trademarks owned by Blizzard. In the first Q session regarding Dota 2, IceFrog explained that the game would build upon the mod without making significant changes to its core. Valve contracted major contributors from the Defense of the Ancients community, including Eul and artist Kendrick Lim, {{to assist with the}} sequel. Additional contributions from sources outside of Valve were also sought regularly for Dota 2, as to continue Defense of the Ancients tradition of community-sourced development. One of the composers of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, Jason Hayes, was hired to collaborate with Tim Larkin to write the original score for the game, which was conducted by Timothy Williams and performed and recorded by the Northwest Sinfonia at Bastyr University. Valve had Half-Life series writer Marc Laidlaw, science fiction author Ted Kosmatka, and Steam support employee Kris Katz write new dialog and background lore for the heroes. Notable voice actors for the English version include Nolan North, Dave Fennoy, Jon St. John, Ellen McLain, Fred Tatasciore, Merle Dandridge, Jen Taylor, and John Patrick Lowrie.|$|E
