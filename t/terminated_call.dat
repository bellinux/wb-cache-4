5000|$|A Mobile Station Roaming Number (MSRN) is an E.164 defined {{telephone}} number used to route telephone {{calls in a}} mobile network from a GMSC (Gateway Mobile Switching Centre) to the target MSC (see Network Switching Subsystem). It can also {{be defined as a}} directory number temporarily assigned to a mobile for a mobile <b>terminated</b> <b>call.</b> A MSRN is assigned for every mobile <b>terminated</b> <b>call,</b> not only the calls where the terminating MS lives on a different MSC than the originating MS. Although this seems unnecessary since many vendors' VLR's are integrated with the MSC, the GSM specification indicates that the MSC and VLR (Visitor Location Register) do not need to reside on the same switch. They are considered two different nodes as they have their own routing addresses. The MSRN is one of the returned parameters into SRI_Response message. In particular the MSRN is used into an MNP scenario (in this case it can be modified as 'RgN + MSISDN' ...|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{methods for}} {{location}} area code (LAC) planning in mobile networks require prediction values of the expected signaling traffic (paging, location update, etc.) {{that have to be}} provided by traffic and mobility models. Modeling can be based on a learning data set consisting of geographic information (population distribution, land use) as input data and performance measurement values from the operations and maintenance center (OMC) as output data. In this paper, the performance of fast modeling methods based on classification and regression trees (CART) is investigated and compared to linear regression analysis. It will be shown that a combination of these two methods shows modeling results of arbitrary accuracy. The analysis of the modeling performance is carried out by comparing the mobile <b>terminated</b> <b>call</b> (MTC) prediction values with OMC measurement values from a real network...|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of mobile {{telecommunication}} to meet demanding end user requirements in terms of quality of experience and service, different protocol specifications have been defined ranging from GSM to WCDMA and now LTE which includes LTE-Advanced. Specifications of these protocols are being revised on a frequent basis and thus bringing more challenges at development side. For the development teams, tracking and analyzing the cause of failure in protocol stacks is a daunting task and consumes valuable engineering resources {{where they have to}} use conventional debugging methods. One widely used conventional method till now is to generate logs and ask an expert to analyze and interpret issues against protocol specifications by scanning through hundreds of lines of traces. This master thesis describes an implementation of a Generic Log Analyzer which can ease the analysis of logs generated across the fields. The experiment to verify the validity of the log analyzer was done using two different log formats. The first one was a formal and consistent format and most of the information was coded. It was learned that the log analyzer can point out missing signals/messages from the scenarios in log files after decoding the log messages. Two scenarios were selected for formal file format, namely Mobile Originated Call and Mobile <b>Terminated</b> <b>Call</b> from 3 GPP specifications. The second selected file format was informal and inconsistent because there was no standard defined format for log entries and one log file can have multiple types of message formats. It was learned that the log analyzer not only filtered out required messages but also reports problematic areas in the selected scenario where the mobile phone transitions from one to another state frequently. The scenario selected for the informal type of format was “Power on” of a mobile device as per defined in the 3 GPP specifications. After the experiments were conducted, it was learned that such a tool can be extended to domain specific rules to add more intelligence if the rule framework was provided for the end user. Thus, such a tool can not only consolidate experience at a single place and help intended users to find minor to advanced level problems in the log files. It can also act as a watchdog to ensure system quality by reporting level of test coverage based on finding scenarios from logs generated during the system test.

40|$|The {{accounting}} rate system currently in place {{is used to}} reimburse telephone companies {{around the world for}} <b>terminating</b> <b>calls</b> originating in foreign countries. Increased competition in more liberalized countries has led to imbalances between traffic originating in these countries and traffic coming in from less liberalized countries, leading to huge settlement payments being made to less liberalized countries. Some variation in {{accounting rate}}s across countries can be explained by traditional factors such as the actual cost of <b>terminating</b> <b>calls.</b> Our results suggest that accounting rates are also significantly affected by non-traditional factors such as the extent of government regulation, the level of corruption, and the like. These findings support the need for consideration of these factors in reforming the accounting rate system currently in place. “High settlement rates are a product of oligopolistic cooperation in a market with little transparency and anti-competitive regulation in the majority of nations” [Cowhey, 1998; p. 908].

The term MNP allows customers {{who wish to}} switch mobile operator to keep their mobile numbers, avoiding the costs of switching to new numbers. Customers are predominantly reluctant to switch their network operator if this means {{that they would have}} to change their telephone number. Changing one’s telephone numbers can be a major inconvenience and a potential barrier preventing the general public from taking advantage of the options available in a developed competitive telecommunications market. The implementation of number portability initiatives in many key markets created new opportunities and improved the consumer’s experience, but <b>terminating</b> <b>calls</b> into number-portability countries became more difficult, confusing and expensive as a result.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} new {{bandwidth}} reservation strategy (Two Level Guarantee) in wireless environment {{based on the}} user mobility specification which {{is assumed to be}} given at call set up time.

Like other VoIP protocols, SIP is designed to address the functions of signaling and session management within a packet telephony network. Signaling allows call information to be carried across network boundaries. Session management provides the ability to control the attributes of an end-to-end call.

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) defines a way to carry voice calls over an Internet Protocol (IP) network including the digitisation and packetization of the voice streams. Signalling protocols are needed to establish and control sessions or calls in the VOIP system, and one of the main signalling protocols in the IP network is session initiation protocol (SIP). SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) developed by IETF for VoIP signalling is a Communication control protocol capable of running on different transport layers, e. g., TCP, UDP or SCTP. it is used to establish, modify and terminate sessions of the Internet telephony calls.
