5|$|Below Prado Dam, the Santa Ana River crosses into Orange County, {{and cuts}} between the Santa Ana Mountains and Chino Hills via the narrow Santa Ana Canyon. The river roughly bisects the county as it flows {{southwest}} towards the ocean. In Anaheim, the entire {{flow of the}} river (except during wet seasons) is diverted into spreading grounds for groundwater recharge of the north Orange County aquifer, providing {{about half of the}} county's municipal water supply. Downstream of there, the river is mostly confined to a concrete channel, serving only for flood control and urban runoff drainage, and is usually dry or a small trickle. At Orange it receives Santiago Creek from the east before entering Santa Ana. After crossing under Interstate 5 it passes through the River View Golf Course, one of its few non-concreted sections within Orange County, and then becomes a concrete channel again through most of Santa Ana and Fountain Valley to a point below the 405 Freeway, where the river bed becomes natural (though the banks remain concrete). The mouth of the river is located in a small <b>tidal</b> <b>lagoon</b> between Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, at the northern end of Santa Ana River County Beach.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Wadden Sea {{consists}} {{of a series of}} <b>tidal</b> <b>lagoons</b> which are connected to the North Sea by tidal inlets. Boundaries to each lagoon are the mainland coast, the barrier islands {{on both sides of the}} tidal inlet, and the tidal watersheds behind the two barrier islands. Behind each Wadden Island there is a tidal watershed separating two adjacent <b>tidal</b> <b>lagoons.</b> The locations of the tidal watersheds in the Wadden Sea are not fixed. Especially after a human interference in one of the <b>tidal</b> <b>lagoons,</b> a <b>tidal</b> watershed can move and thereby influence the distribution of area between the lagoons. This appears to be important for the morphological development in not only the basin in which the interference takes place, but also in the adjacent basins. This paper describes theoretical analyses and numerical modelling aimed at improving the insights into the location of the tidal watersheds, their movements, and the impact of the movements of tidal watersheds on the morphological development of a multi-basin system like the Wadden Sea...|$|R
40|$|The Bay of Fundy {{is home to}} some of the world's largest tides and {{has long}} been {{identified}} as one of the world's premier locations for the installation of tidal power generating systems. This paper deals with the assessment of hydrodynamic impacts throughout the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine due to power generation by <b>tidal</b> <b>lagoons</b> located in Minas Basin. The lagoon concept involves temporarily storing seawater behind an impoundment dike and generating power by gradually releasing the seawater through conventional low-head hydroelectric turbines. <b>Tidal</b> <b>lagoons</b> represent a relatively novel approach to tidal power generation, and are intended to achieve high efficiency while avoiding some of the environmental problems associated with tidal barrages. A detailed two-dimensional (depth-averaged) finite-element numerical model, based on the TELEMAC system, has been developed, calibrated against observed water levels and velocities, and applied to simulate tidal hydrodynamics throughout the Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine, both for existing conditions without a lagoon and for two scenarios with <b>tidal</b> <b>lagoons</b> operating in Minas Basin. A 12 km 2 offshore lagoon with 14 turbines generating 2 ̆ 23 c 124 MW on average and a 24 km 2 coastal lagoon with 24 turbines generating 2 ̆ 23 c 220 MW on average have been investigated.

Tidal range energy is an attractive renewable energy option, particularly in areas of high tidal range, such as the UK. Historically {{one of the main}} barriers to tidal range developments in the UK, specifically tidal barrages, has been regulatory environmental concerns and uncertainty surrounding environmental impacts. <b>Tidal</b> <b>lagoons</b> are often suggested as a means of reducing the environmental impact of barrage options. Recent developments in the lagoon sector mean it is now more important than ever to further consider the environmental impacts arising from <b>tidal</b> <b>lagoons</b> and the potential constraints these impacts may pose to the industry’s future growth. Environmental impacts and their interactions are complex, often making them difficult to understand and manage. Here we develop a conceptual framework to categorise impacts, present results from consultation with regulatory and policy organisations and discuss potential impact and enhancement solution options. The article includes a number of case studies to present lessons learnt, opportunities, cautions and successful implementation of past solutions. In the absence of operational <b>tidal</b> <b>lagoons,</b> these case studies are based on barrages and other relevant developments.

40|$|Recent {{concerns}} about sea level rise {{and the loss}} of areas of natural habitat have focussed attention on the problems associated with siltation in <b>tidal</b> <b>lagoons.</b> In the UK, Pagham Harbour is a small (4 km 2) tidal system that is part of a series of <b>tidal</b> <b>lagoons</b> characterised by a narrow entrance and multiple fresh water input points. While some progress has previously been made in measuring long-term siltation rates in these <b>tidal</b> <b>lagoons,</b> {{there is a need for}} a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which fine sediment is transported by tidal action, fresh water flows and wind-induced wave action. Three field deployments are described at 3 different sites in the lagoon for three spring-tide tidal cycles, and results presented of varying water depth, velocity and vertical profiles of salinity and suspended sediment concentration. From these data, some preliminary conclusions have been made about the likely mechanisms that control fine sediment transport near the tidal limits of these harbours, including the influence of strong vertical salinity gradients, modified at one site by the influence of intermittent pumped discharge of fresh water into the lagoon. These tend to enhance flood-tide sediment transport by increasing near bed velocity. It is further suggested that the absence of significant observed sediment transport at a point in mid lagoon, away from the tidal limit, points to a cycling of fine sediment at and around the tisal limits. No new material is imported, and no material is lost, from the pool of sediment at these tidal limits, under these relatively quiescent conditions. It is posited that any changes to the overall sediment budget of the lagoon linked with siltation must occur at other times of year, possibly under more stormy conditions...|$|R
