5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{visited the}} set {{frequently}} during filming. Members {{of the main}} cast approached Stillwell with questions {{about the nature of}} the altered universe, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if they were still playing the same characters. Goldberg asked Ganino about changing a piece of dialogue on set, but since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay, he deferred to Stillwell, who in turn notified the production office. When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were on set and talking to the actors, he banned them from setting foot on the sets again.|$|E
5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E

25|$|Antimatter {{may exist}} in {{relatively}} large amounts in far-away galaxies due to cosmic inflation in the primordial {{time of the}} universe. Antimatter galaxies, if they exist, {{are expected to have}} the same chemistry and absorption and emission spectra as normal-matter galaxies, and their astronomical objects would be observationally identical, making them difficult to distinguish.

25|$|The most {{brilliant}} analysis ever {{done on a}} structural puzzle was surely the solution (1953) of the terramycin problem. It was a problem of great industrial importance, and hence many able chemists had performed {{an enormous amount of}} work <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the structure. There seemed to be too much data to resolve the problem, because a significant number of observations, although experimentally correct, were very misleading. Woodward took a large piece of cardboard, wrote on it all the facts and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin. Nobody else could have done that at the time.|$|E
25|$|Investigators were {{evaluating}} reports that, in May 2001, Hasan {{had attended}} {{a mosque in}} Virginia for the funeral of his mother, which was attended that spring and summer {{by two of the}} 9/11 hijackers.

In this article we <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the consumers' general degree of trust in food safety and in the health safety of the fruit offered in Croatia. A comparison is made between the trust degrees for domestic and imported fruit.

25|$|In <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> {{the impact}} of new media on {{political}} campaigning and electioneering, the existing research has tried to examine whether new media supplants conventional media. Television is still the dominant news source, but new media's reach is growing. What is known is that new media has {{had a significant impact}} on elections and what began in the 2008 presidential campaign established new standards for how campaigns would be run. Since then, campaigns also have their outreach methods by developing targeted messages for specific audiences that can be reached via different social media platforms. Both parties have specific digital media strategies designed for voter outreach.|$|E
25|$|The {{modified}} tactics {{were put}} into effect on an escort mission the morning of 22 May, when the 61st FS attacked {{a large number of}} Fw 190s of JG 11 over Höperhöfen airfield near Rotenburg an der Wümme and shot down 11 without loss. (meant here is Rotenburg-Wümme airfield. There were at least two losses, C.B. Nale, HV-J near Süderwalsede and R. Heineman, HV-N, near Westerwalsede) In a second mission that afternoon, the 56th was part of a 4-group Thunderbolt raid against a railroad bridge at Hasselt, Belgium, dropping 500-pound bombs at varying altitudes and using level, glide-bombing, and dive-bombing tactics, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the most effective means of using the P-47 as a fighter-bomber.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} {{resulted in}} the first fatality on a spacecraft in flight since the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003.

Investigators are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how Siebold managed to get out of the rocket plane and parachute to the ground from an altitude of roughly 50,000 feet, an altitude virtually devoid of oxygen. On November 7, Siebold told investigators that the aircraft broke up around him. He was still strapped into his seat. He released the straps and his parachute later deployed automatically. Siebold was not wearing a pressure suit during the flight.|$|E

25|$|<b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> who {{was indeed}} the lawful Mrs. Frankie Lymon was {{complicated}} by more issues. Waters was already married when she married Lymon; she had separated from her first husband, but their divorce was finalized in 1965, after she had married Lymon. Taylor claimed to have married Lymon in Mexico in 1965, but could produce no acceptable evidence of their union. Lymon's marriage to Eagle, on the other hand, was properly documented as having taken place at Beulah Grove Baptist Church in Augusta, Georgia, in 1967; however, the singer was still apparently twice-married and never divorced when he married Eagle. The first decision was made in Waters' favor; Eagle appealed, and in 1989, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court reversed the original decision and awarded Lymon's estate to Eagle.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Ephorus, {{who lived}} in the fourth century BC, is one potential candidate for establishing the use of Olympiads to count years, although credit for codifying this particular epoch usually falls to Hippias of Elis, to Eratosthenes, or even to Timaeus, whom Eratosthenes may have imitated. The Olympic Games were held at four-year intervals, and later, the ancient historians' method of counting the years even referred to these games, using the term Olympiad for the period between two games. Previously, the local dating systems of the Greek states were used (they continued to be used by everyone except the historians), which led to confusion when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> dates. For example, Diodorus states that there was a solar eclipse in the third year of the 113th Olympiad, which must be the eclipse of 316BC. This gives a date of (mid-summer) 765BC for {{the first year of the}} first Olympiad. Nevertheless, there is disagreement among scholars as to when the games began.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} the prophetic works, the {{character}} Oothoon represented America in Visions of the Daughters of Albion and she is raped by the character Bromion. The book represents her as trapped by a philosophical system created by John Locke, {{and no one is}} able to hear her pleas except for the daughters of Albion. The implications of the work are taken up again in America with the King of England trembling as he witnesses Orc and the rebelling colonies. Although there is a vision of rebellion, there is no actual freedom {{at the end of the}} poem just as in the Visions of the Daughters of Albion. Unlike the Visions of the Daughters of Albion, America, as well as Europe, describes nations that are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> their own destiny instead of individuals trying to deal with theirs. The Song of Los is connected to both America and Europe in that it describes Africa and Asia, which operate as a sort of frame to the other works. As such, the three works are united by the same historical and social themes.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{mobilization}} of 1915 the Bulgarian General Staff was left with few unmobilized reservists. In order to secure a source of reinforcements for the army it opened new military schools for young infantry, cavalry, artillery officers and soldiers. Thus {{from the end of}} 1915 until the beginning of 1918 the four regular annual contingents of young conscripts were called and received their training. Their total number was 214,343 and was sufficient for the replacing the 181,515 casualties that had occurred. The exact number of all the mobilized men during the war however remains unclear. Some sources point at a number of 1,200,000 men which seems to be on the high side but still may be close to the truth. When <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the precise number it {{must be taken into account}} that towards September 1918 the Bulgarian Army reached a strength ranging between 855,175 and 877,392 men under arms in all branches of the service, or some 18% of the population, and that for the duration of the war the army also used the manpower of the territories it had occupied – some 133,837 men from the Macedonian regions were mobilized.|$|E

At one point, the hijackers dropped the demand for the release of the party leaders. Two hours after the hijacking began, the hijackers asked the captain to depart for Paris so the hijackers could hold a press conference there. The captain could not take off as the aircraft boarding stairs were still attached to the A300 and the Algerian authorities blocked the runway with parked vehicles. When the captain, forced by the hijackers, asked for the removal of the boarding stairs, the Algerian authorities, determined not to give in to any of the hijacker demands, refused. The hijackers announced that they would detonate the aircraft unless the Algerian authorities gave in to the demands.|$|E
