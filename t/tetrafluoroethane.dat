Difluoromethane in a zeotropic (50%/50%) m/m mixture with pentafluoroethane (R-125) {{is known as}} R-410A, a common replacement for various chlorofluorocarbons (aka Freon) in new refrigerant systems, especially for air-conditioning.

50|$|Commercial {{refrigerator}} and freezer units, which go by many other names, were in use for almost 40 {{years prior to}} the common home models. They used gas systems such as ammonia (R-717) or sulfur dioxide (R-764), which occasionally leaked, making them unsafe for home use. Practical household refrigerators were introduced in 1915 and gained wider acceptance in the United States in the 1930s as prices fell and non-toxic, non-flammable synthetic refrigerants such as Freon-12 (R-12) were introduced. However, R-12 damaged the ozone layer, causing governments to issue a ban on its use in new refrigerators and air-conditioning systems in 1994. The less harmful replacement for R-12, R-134a (<b>tetrafluoroethane),</b> has been in common use since 1990, but R-12 is still found in many old systems today.|$|E
5000|$|Many gas dusters contain HFC-134a (<b>tetrafluoroethane),</b> {{which is}} widely used as a {{propellant}} and refrigerant. HFC-134a sold for those purposes is often sold {{at a much higher}} unit price, which has led to the practice of using gas dusters as a less expensive source of HFCs for those purposes. Adapters have been built for such purposes, though in most cases, use of such adapters will void the warranty on the equipment they are used with. One example of this practice is the case of airsoft gas guns, which use HFC-134a as the compressed gas. Several vendors sell [...] "duster adapters" [...] for use with airsoft guns, though it is necessary to add a lubricant when using gas dusters to power airsoft guns.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, the {{inhalation}} of any {{gas that}} {{is capable of}} displacing oxygen in the lungs (especially gases heavier than oxygen) carries the risk of hypoxia {{as a result of the}} very mechanism by which breathing is triggered. Since reflexive breathing is prompted by elevated carbon dioxide levels (rather than diminished blood oxygen levels), breathing a concentrated, relatively inert gas (such as computer-duster <b>tetrafluoroethane</b> or nitrous oxide) that removes carbon dioxide from the blood without replacing it with oxygen will produce no outward signs of suffocation even when the brain is experiencing hypoxia. Once full symptoms of hypoxia appear, it may be too late to breathe without assistance, especially if the gas is heavy enough to lodge in the lungs for extended periods. Even completely inert gases, such as argon, can have this effect if oxygen is largely excluded.|$|E

40|$|Efficient heat {{management}} in energy intensive {{applications such as}} server and data centers has become a national concern due to {{the magnitude of the}} energy consumed. In that matter, the absorption refrigeration system is an attractive solution because the abundant waste heat available in the data centers can be recycled to run the heat pump, which will bring about significant cooling cost savings. The use of absorption refrigeration has been limited due to the drawbacks related to the working fluids in commercially available equipment. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have been suggested as the absorbent in absorption heat pumps due to their tunable properties, negligible volatility and high thermal stability. The non-random-two-liquid-model was initially used to analyze the feasibility of the new IL based working fluid. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were paired with IL absorbents due to their good properties as refrigerants. The cooling-to-total-energy (CE) efficiency had a local maximum with respect to desorber temperature due to the solubility limit at lower temperatures and large heating requirements at higher temperatures. The waste heat recycling coefficient of performance (COP) continually increased with respect to desorber temperature and among the HFCs studied in this work, R 134 gave the highest COP value, which is up to 40 times higher than that of typical vapor compression systems and 60 times higher than NH 3 /H 2 O and H 2 O/LiBr absorption refrigeration systems. A Redlich-Kwong equation of state (RK-EOS) was employed for accurate computation of mixture properties over a wide range of operating conditions. Analysis using the RK-EOS model showed that the CE trend in refrigerants followed the trend of solubility in the [bmim][PF 6] IL. However, the trend in COP was different from that of CE as the operating pressure ranges became an important factor. Required pumping work of the working fluids has also been analyzed using a two phase pressure drop equation and the results show that the impact of viscous IL flow is insignificant compared to the total pumping work. The HFCs studied in this work have very similar structures. However, the extent of solubility and system efficiency in the same IL, [bmim][PF 6], made a large difference. Most surprisingly, even when the refrigerant had the same chemical formula, the change in fluorine position in <b>tetrafluoroethane</b> showed significantly different system performance. The symmetrical <b>tetrafluoroethane</b> had superior CE and COP over the asymmetrical <b>tetrafluoroethane</b> most likely due to the higher probability to form hydrogen bonding with the absorbent. The computational results for various HFC/IL pairs show that in selecting the working fluid pairs, the refrigerant should have high overall solubility in the IL and a large gradient of solubility with respect to temperature. Also, refrigerants with small pressure ranges are preferred. In addition to the simulation study, a bench-top absorption refrigeration system was built and operated using IL based working fluids for the first time. The effect of cooling was observed by operating the test system. The experimental results were congruent with the predictions from the modeling work. In conclusion, an absorption refrigeration system based on the IL chemical compressor {{has been shown to be}} a promising solution in applications which need efficient cooling and generate abundant waste heat.
