Most thermal screw systems circulate a hot heat-transfer oil through the hollow flights of the auger and return the hot oil through the shaft to the heat transfer fluid heating system. The heated oil is also circulated through the jacketed trough in which each auger rotates. Thermal screws can also be steam-heated.

50|$|Low-temperature thermal {{desorption}} (LTTD), {{also known as}} low-temperature thermal volatilization, thermal stripping, and soil roasting, is an ex-situ remedial technology that uses heat to physically separate petroleum hydrocarbons from excavated soils.

Although they are not designed to decompose organic constituents, thermal desorbers can, depending upon the specific organics present and {{the temperature of the}} desorber system, cause some organic constituents to completely or partially decompose. The vaporized hydrocarbons are generally treated in a secondary treatment unit (e.g., an afterburner, catalytic oxidation chamber, condenser, or carbon adsorption unit) prior to discharge to the atmosphere. Afterburners and oxidizers destroy the organic constituents. Condensers and carbon adsorption units trap organic compounds for subsequent treatment or disposal.|$|E

50|$|The first {{operation}} to occur during desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization is desorption. Desorption {{of the sample}} is initiated by a hot jet of solvent vapor that is targeted onto the sample by a nebulizer microchip. The nebulizer microchip is a glass device bonded together by pyrex wafers with flow channels embedded from a nozzle {{at the edge of}} the chip. The microchip is heated to 250-350C in order to vaporize the entering solvent and create dopant molecules. Dopant molecules are added to help facilitate the ionization of the sample. Some of the common solvents include: nitrogen, toluene, acetone, and anisole. The desorption process can occur by two mechanisms: thermal desorption or momentum transfer/liquid spray. Thermal desorption uses heat <b>to</b> <b>volatilize</b> the sample and increase the surface temperature of the substrate. As the substrate's surface temperature is increased, the higher the sensitivity of the instrument. While studying the substrate temperature, it was seen that the solvent did not have a noticeable effect on the final temperature or heat rate of the substrate. Momentum transfer or liquid spray desoprtion is based on the solvent interaction with the sample, causing the release of specific ions. The momentum transfer is propagated by the collision of the solvent with the sample along with the transfer of ions with the sample. The transfer of positive ions, such as protons and charge transfers, are seen with the solvents: toluene and anisole. Toluene goes through a charge exchange mechanism with the sample, while acetone promotes a proton transfer mechanism with the sample. A beam of 10 eV photons that are given off by a UV lamp is directed at the newly desorbed molecules, as well as the dopant molecules. Photoionization then occurs, which knocks out the molecule's electron and produces an ion. This technique alone is not highly efficient for different varieties of molecules, particularly those that are not easily protonated or deprotonated. In order to completely ionize samples, dopant molecules must help. The gaseous solvent can also undergo photoionization and act as an intermediate for ionization of the sample molecules. Once dopant ions are formed, proton transfer can occur with the sample, creating more sample ions. The ions are then sent to the mass analyzer for analysis.|$|E
