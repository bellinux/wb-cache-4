Smaller theatres include the Bratislava Puppet Theatre, the Astorka Korzo '90 theatre, the Arena Theatre, L+S Studio, and <b>the</b> <b>Naive</b> Theatre of Radošina.|$|E

He tries to convince <b>the</b> <b>naive</b> Giselle that her beau cannot be trusted, but she ignores his warnings. Giselle's mother, Berthe, is very protective of her daughter, as Giselle has a weak heart that leaves her in delicate health. She discourages a relationship between Giselle and Loys, and disapproves of Giselle's fondness for dancing.|$|E

5|$|Quintel {{initially}} {{worked as}} a writer and staff director for the Cartoon Network series Camp Lazlo and The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack before he was offered to produce a short for the network's showcase project The Cartoonstitute. Quintel developed the Regular Show pilot for the project, utilizing characters from his California Institute of the Arts student films <b>The</b> <b>Naïve</b> Man from Lolliland (2005) and 2 in the AM PM (2006). While The Cartoonstitute was ultimately scrapped, Cartoon Network executives approved the production of a Regular Show series. Its first two seasons were ratings successes, with Nielsen Media Research ranking the series at number one in its time period amongst its primary demographic. As of May 2013, the program averages approximately 2 to 2.5 million viewers each week.|$|E
5|$|A {{principal}} cast of six actors received star billing in the show's first season. Poehler {{portrayed the}} lead character, Leslie Knope, <b>the</b> <b>naive</b> but well-meaning, eager-to-please {{deputy director of}} the parks and recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. Also among the cast were Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, a sarcastic parks department employee, and Rashida Jones as Ann Perkins, a nurse who befriends Leslie and tries to help her turn a giant construction pit into a park. Daniels and Schur intended to cast Ansari and Jones (who previously appeared in The Office as Karen Filippelli) from the series' earliest stages of development, but the ultimate Parks and Recreation concept did not coalesce until they learned Poehler would be available to star. After her recruitment, the general concept of the series was established and the script for the pilot episode was written.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVehicles {{makers are}} now {{extremely}} {{concerned by the}} perceived quality of their products. For the design of many parts of vehicles, sensory profiling techniques are used, which are traditionally carried out by experts. These tests incur a significant financial effort and are time consuming. We propose in this paper an evaluation method with naive subjects, based on paired comparisons. Two studies {{have been carried out}} on diesel motor sounds: firstly, the panel of experts of a car maker made a conventional sensory profile and an evaluation by paired comparison. Secondly, 30 naive subjects also completed two tests (ratings and paired comparisons). For the experts, we noticed a very good agreement between the sensory profile and the paired comparisons. For <b>the</b> <b>naives,</b> <b>the</b> paired comparisons gave a better agreement between the subjects and were more discriminating than the ratings. The results of these two tests with <b>the</b> <b>naives</b> were then compared with the conventional sensory profile of the experts using Generalized Procrustes Analysis. Results show that the consensus is better with the paired comparison test. As a result, the evaluation method proposed with naives could be an interesting method for the perceptual evaluation of products...|$|R

25|$|In the {{foundations}} of mathematics, Russell's paradox (also known as Russell's antinomy), discovered by Bertrand Russell in 1901, showed that some attempted formalizations of <b>the</b> <b>naïve</b> set theory created by Georg Cantor led to a contradiction.

25|$|As {{a pioneer}} of a self-reflexive {{sociology}} who prefigured Bourdieu's ability to factor in the effect of reflection on the societal object, Adorno realized that some criticism (including deliberate disruption of his classes in the 1960s) could never be answered in a dialogue between equals if, as {{he seems to have}} believed, what <b>the</b> <b>naive</b> ethnographer or sociologist thinks of a human essence is always changing over time.|$|E

Faster responses occur upon reinfection because memory T cells have already undergone confirmation and can produce effector cells much sooner.|$|E
