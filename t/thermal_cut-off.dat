40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for characterizing electro-thermal effects in GaN based HEMTs. The proposed method characterizes the thermal and bias {{dependence of the}} current through the 2 -DEG individually. The temperature dependence is characterized by TLM measurements versus ambient temperature, showing an increasing sheet resistivity with temperature. The thermal impedance is determined from low frequency impedance measurements, indicating thermal response up to at least 100 MHz. The isothermal bias dependence is measured above the <b>thermal</b> <b>cut-off</b> with a LSNA, showing a nonlinear current versus voltage characteristic...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — By {{measuring}} the frequency-noise {{power spectral density}} of a cryogenically-cooled mid-infrared quantum cascade laser, we investigate the different contributions to the noise spectrum and identify the main differences with respect to stan-dard bipolar semiconductor devices. In particular, {{the existence of a}} <b>thermal</b> <b>cut-off</b> on the 1 / f noise allows to identify the current fluctuations through the heterostructure as the physical mechanism, intrinsic to the device, at the basis of the measured flicker noise. This result, marking the difference with bipolar semiconductor devices, is confirmed analyzing the laser frequency response to a modulation of the driving current.

40|$|International audienceDark matter (DM) haloes forming {{near the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>cut-off</b> {{scale of the}} density {{perturbations}} are unique, since they are the smallest objects and form through monolithic gravitational collapse, while larger haloes contrastingly have experienced mergers. While standard cold dark matter (CDM) simulations readily produce haloes that follow the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile with an inner slope, ρ∝ r^-α, with α= 1, recent simulations have found that when the free-streaming cut-off expected for the CDM model is resolved, the resulting haloes follow nearly power-law density profiles of α∼ 1. 5. In this paper, we study the formation of density cusps in haloes using idealized N-body simulations {{of the collapse of}} proto-haloes. When the proto-halo profile is initially cored due to particle free-streaming at high redshift, we universally find ∼ r^- 1. 5 profiles irrespective of the proto-halo profile slope outside the core and large-scale non-spherical perturbations. Quite in contrast, when the proto-halo has a power-law profile, then we obtain profiles compatible with the NFW shape when the density slope of the proto-halo patch is shallower than a critical value, α_ ini∼ 0. 3, while the final slope can be steeper for α_ ini 0. 3. We further demonstrate that the r^- 1. 5 profiles are sensitive to small scale noise, which gradually drives them towards an inner slope of - 1, where they become resilient to such perturbations. We demonstrate that the r^- 1. 5 solutions are in hydrostatic equilibrium, largely consistent with a simple analytic model, and provide arguments that angular momentum appears to determine the inner slope...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the <b>thermal</b> load during <b>cut-off</b> {{grinding}} of high-strength bearing rings. Linear cut-off operations {{lead to a high}} rise in temperature over the cutting process. These leads, together with the limited material volume, in a heat build-up and the resulting grinding burn. The aim of this work was to prevent this head build-up by using two-axis cut-off operations. Therefore, known methods were theoretically considered and from this, alternative two-axis strategies were determined. For testing, experiments were carried out on a test set-up developed in this work. The tests showed that the two-axis strategies lead to significantly reduced temperatures, as well as non-grinding burn and partially burr-free cutting surfaces. However, the two-axis methods lead to increased process times, which is why approaches for their optimization have been discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cool season {{rainfall}} {{variability in}} southeastern Australia is investigated via classification and {{characterization of the}} predominant types of synoptic systems occurring in the region. These types are frontal systems, cut-off low systems, and other systems. Rainfall {{in the region is}} dominated by cut-off systems and these systems are the main influence on the interannual variability of rainfall. Both cut-off systems and frontal systems display an enhancement of thermal (thickness) gradient as rainfall increases, but the mechanisms for intensification differ. Cut-off systems intensify in the region in association with local increases in baroclinicity and the subtropical jet, whereas frontal systems tend to intensify via a confluence of subtropical and polar jets. Interannual rainfall variability is examined for groupings of years based on both clustering of continental rainfall patterns and on El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) /Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) years. Cut-off systems exhibit consistent enhancements of thermal gradients for groupings of years in which they produce more rainfall. For ENSO/IOD groupings, the <b>cut-off</b> <b>thermal</b> gradients are consistent with the underlying sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Wet years in southeastern Australia are usually produced by cut-off systems, but can also be produced by frontal systems. In those cases the mid-tropospheric flow pattern is reminiscent of the negative Southern Annular Mode (SAM) pattern. The positive SAM pattern is also associated with enhanced rainfall in the southeast via local intensification of blocking and cut-off systems. Copyright 2008 Royal Meteorological Societ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} how {{the presence of}} a non-thermal tail beyond a Maxwellian electron distribution affects the synchrotron process as well as Comptonization in plasmas with parameters typical for accretion flows onto black holes. We find that the presence of the tail can significantly increase the net (after accounting for self-absorption) cyclo-synchrotron emission of the plasma, which emission then provides seed photons for Compton upscattering. Thus, the luminosity in the thermally-Comptonized spectrum is enhanced as well. The importance of these effects increases with both increasing Eddington ratio and the black hole mass. The enhancement of the Comptonized synchrotron luminosity can be as large as by factors of ∼ 10 ^ 3 and ∼ 10 ^ 5 for stellar and supermassive black holes, respectively, when the energy content in the non-thermal tail is 1 per cent. The presence of the tail only weakly hardens the thermal Comptonization spectrum but it leads to formation of a high-energy tail beyond the <b>thermal</b> <b>cut-off,</b> which two effects are independent {{of the nature of the}} seed photons. Since observations of high-energy tails in Comptonization spectra can constrain the non-thermal tails in the electron distribution and thus the Comptonized synchrotron luminosity, they provide upper limits on the strength of magnetic fields in accretion flows. In particular, the measurement of an MeV tail in the hard state of Cyg X- 1 by McConnell et al. implies the magnetic field strength in this source to be at most an order of magnitude below equipartition.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of the accretion flow around stellar mass and supermassive black holes depends on the accretion rate. Broad iron emission lines originating from the irradiation of cool matter can indicate {{that there is an}} inner disk below a hot coronal flow. These emission lines have been detected in X-ray binaries. Observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM Newton and Suzaku have confirmed the presence of these emission lines also in a large fraction of Seyfert- 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). We investigate the accretion flow geometry for which broad iron emission lines can arise in hard and soft spectral state. We study an ADAF-type coronal flow, where the ions are viscously heated and electrons receive their heat only by collisions from the ions and are Compton cooled by photons from an underlying cool disk. For a strong mass flow in the disk and the resulting strong Compton cooling only a very weak coronal flow is possible. This limitation allows the formation of ADAF-type coronae above weak inner disks in the hard state, but almost rules them out in the soft state. The observed hard X-ray luminosity in the soft state, of up to 10 % or more of the total flux, indicates that there is a heating process that directly accelerates the electrons. This might point to the action of magnetic flares of disk magnetic fields reaching into the corona. Such flares have also been proposed by observations of the spectra of X-ray black hole binaries without a <b>thermal</b> <b>cut-off</b> around 200 keV.
