In July, the Bears signed four free agents to one-year contracts: defenseman Tyson Strachan, winger Matt Watkins, forward Derek Whitmore and goaltender David Leggio.

40|$|In this study, {{we argue}} that share price {{reaction}} to a firm’s capital expenditure deci-sions depends critically on the market’s assessment {{of the quality of}} its investment op-portunities. We postulate <b>that</b> <b>announcements</b> of increases (decreases) in capital expenditures positively (negatively) aect the stock prices of firms with valuable invest-ment opportunities. Contrarily, we predict <b>that</b> <b>announcements</b> of increases (decreases) in capital spending negatively (positively) aect the share prices of firms without such opportunities.

He responded that he would discuss matters with his family and Tech head coach Frank Beamer before making a decision. <b>That</b> <b>announcement</b> sparked a fresh round of speculation from sports pundits and fans wondering if Vick would choose to return to school or enter the 2001 NFL Draft. Virginia Tech, through its football coaching staff, began an intensive lobbying campaign in an effort to convince Vick to stay. On January 11, 2001, Vick held a press conference to announce that he would be forgoing his final two years of collegiate eligibility to enter the NFL Draft. Immediately after the announcement, he was predicted to be the No. 1 pick in the draft, a hypothesis realized on April 21, when he was selected by the Atlanta Falcons, who had traded draft picks in order {{to have the right to}} select Vick.|$|E
