5|$|In 2013, a well-preserved carcass {{was found}} on Maly Lyakhovsky Island, one of the islands in the New Siberian Islands archipelago, a female between 50 and 60 {{years old at the}} <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> The carcass {{contained}} well-preserved muscular tissue. When it was extracted from the ice, liquid blood spilled from the abdominal cavity. The finders interpreted this as indicating woolly mammoth blood possessed anti-freezing properties.|$|E
5|$|Other wrong {{beliefs are}} killing {{those who are}} in state of {{happiness}} or {{those who are in}} meditation under wrong belief that the mental state at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> will be perpetuated in future lives. It is also a wrong belief that killing of self and others is justified as the soul that is imprisoned in the body will be permanently released and achieve salvation.|$|E
5|$|The {{third stage}} is the {{transfer}} of memory and personality from the original person to the mature clone. For the process to maintain one branch for personality and memory, as opposed to two, a recording of the individual's mind would be required before the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> and would be transferred to an adult clone body after the original has died.|$|E

50|$|The hymn text {{forms an}} allegory {{for the journey}} of a Christian {{throughout}} their life on earth requiring the Redeemer's guidance and ending {{at the gates of}} Heaven (the verge of Jordan) and end <b>of</b> <b>time</b> (<b>death</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and hell's destruction).|$|R
50|$|Domingos was 46 {{years old}} at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his <b>death.</b> He was married to Fabiana Domingo, and the couple had three {{children}} and 2 grandchildren at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his <b>death.</b> He was buried at the Memorial do Carmo, in Caju.|$|R
5|$|The <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> is {{also much}} discussed; one version {{claims that the}} poison was so potent that he died instantly, while another says that he endured agony until dawn of the {{following}} day. It {{has been suggested that}} Claudius may have died as late as noon on 13 October.|$|E
5|$|While {{reviewing}} the O'Dell case, Veronica notices that the TV station the dean {{was watching the}} night he was murdered had moved its programming back an hour, meaning their estimated <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> was wrong. The forensic results about the prints in O'Dell’s room come back, {{and they are the}} fingerprints of Steve Botando (Richard Grieco). Steve Botando is investigated by Sheriff Lamb.|$|E
5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death),</b> or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples and can help narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E
50|$|At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Wisut's <b>death,</b> Thailand lacked {{freedom of}} speech as several journalists were imprisoned for {{insulting}} the monarchy. There were several other murders related to the real estate industry in the province around the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Wisut's <b>death</b> as well.|$|R

50|$|Mutula Kilonzo died at {{his ranch}} in Maanzoni, Machakos County. He was not sick or {{suffering}} at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his <b>death.</b> His death shocked many people and was mourned by Kenyans of all walks of life. The cause <b>of</b> his <b>death</b> were scanty at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his <b>death.</b>|$|R
5|$|At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> Jackson {{had been}} {{administered}} propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam, and the Los Angeles coroner decided {{to treat the}} death as a homicide. Law enforcement officials conducted a manslaughter investigation of his personal physician Conrad Murray, and charged him with involuntary manslaughter in Los Angeles on February 8, 2010. Jackson's body was entombed on September 3, 2009, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.|$|E
5|$|Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) {{operates}} {{on a woman}} who flatlines, and despite his attempts to revive her, his father Christian Shephard (John Terry) forces him to stop and call the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> It is later revealed that it was actually Christian's operation; Jack was called in by a nurse after it becomes apparent {{that his father was}} performing the surgery under the influence of alcohol. Christian attempts to cover this up by making Jack sign a form detailing the surgery, albeit with his inebriation omitted from the report, stating that the hospital will revoke his medical license if alcohol is mentioned.|$|E
5|$|The early texts do {{not contain}} just-war {{ideology}} as such. Some argue that a sutta in the Gamani Samyuttam rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha {{if it is true}} that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.|$|E
50|$|By the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his <b>death</b> in 1956, Kenning had {{the largest}} set of car dealerships in Derbyshire and he had 80 dealerships spread over 18 counties. The {{business}} employed 2,000 people. At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Kenning's <b>death,</b> the firm had a turnover of £20m.|$|R
50|$|At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> her <b>death</b> in March 1993, Hannah was {{the oldest}} American ever and second oldest person ever whose age has been verified, behind only Jeanne Calment.

50|$|According to FreeBMD, Ellis Clarkson's {{birth was}} {{registered}} during January→March 1885, and {{his death was}} registered during October→December 1947, this would mean {{he would have been}} aged 62 at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his <b>death,</b> however FreeBMD states he was 60 at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his <b>death.</b>|$|R
5|$|At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> Lindow Man was {{a healthy}} male in his mid-20s, {{and he may}} have been someone of high status, as his body shows little {{evidence}} of heavy or rough work. There has been debate over the reason for Lindow Man's death, for the nature of his demise was violent, perhaps ritualistic; after a last meal of charred bread, Lindow Man was strangled, hit on the head, and his throat cut. Dating the body has proven problematic, but it is thought that Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss, face down, some time between 2 BC and 119AD, in either the Iron Age or Romano-British period. The body has been preserved by freeze-drying and is on permanent display at the British Museum, although it occasionally travels to other venues such as the Manchester Museum.|$|E
5|$|Cases {{have been}} {{recorded}} by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when {{the body of a}} pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from the body of the pregnant woman about the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives late to {{the crime}} scene and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) tells her that the man's blood all drained {{abruptly}} in the hotel. A child’s bloody print is found, but Scully doesn’t believe that a child did this. Meanwhile, the beggar, somehow disguised as an ordinary-looking Caucasian man, applies for a janitorial job at a Cheverly, Maryland elementary school. In the morgue, Scully describes the massive stomach damage done to the body which leads Doggett to the idea of drugs being forcibly cut out of him. However, the man showed no sign of drugs in the blood tests and Scully tells Doggett that his <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> was 24 to 36 hours prior, long before he left India. Due to a discrepancy in weight, she begins to believe that there was a passenger in the corpse.|$|E
50|$|At the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his <b>death</b> in 2010 {{he was in}} {{the final}} stages of {{compiling}} a book of photographic works produced in collaboration with his granddaughter. Carter also produced a three-volume series of semi-autobiographical novels, Snowmaidens, which remained unpublished at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his <b>death.</b>|$|R
50|$|A 2014 study {{classified}} cases {{into three}} types—epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) -- and reviewed their <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> The first two types tended {{to die in}} infancy and the last in early adulthood.|$|R

5|$|Evidence that Daspletosaurus {{lived in}} social groups {{comes from a}} bonebed found in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana. The bonebed {{includes}} the remains of three Daspletosaurus, including a large adult, a small juvenile, and another individual of intermediate size. At least five hadrosaurs are preserved at the same location. Geologic evidence indicates that the remains were not brought together by river currents but {{that all of the}} animals were buried simultaneously at the same location. The hadrosaur remains are scattered and bear many marks from tyrannosaur teeth, indicating that the Daspletosaurus were feeding on the hadrosaurs at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> The cause of death is unknown. Currie speculates that the daspletosaurs formed a pack, although this cannot be stated with certainty. Other scientists are skeptical of the evidence for social groups in Daspletosaurus and other large theropods; Brian Roach and Daniel Brinkman have suggested that Daspletosaurus social interaction would have more closely resembled the modern Komodo dragon, where non-cooperative individuals mob carcasses, frequently attacking and even cannibalizing each other in the process.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the experiment in American Medicine, physician Augustus P. Clarke criticized the experiment's validity. Clarke noted that at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> there is a sudden rise in body temperature as the lungs are no longer cooling blood, causing a subsequent rise in sweating which could easily account for MacDougall’s missing 21 grams. Clarke also pointed out that, as dogs do not have sweat glands, they would not lose weight in this manner after death. Clarke's criticism was published in the May issue of American Medicine. Arguments between MacDougall and Clarke debating the validity of the experiment continued to be published in the journal until at least December that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Biko had {{enrolled}} for a {{law degree}} by correspondence from the University of South Africa. He passed several exams, but had not completed the degree at his <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> His performance on the course was poor; he was absent from several exams and failed his Practical Afrikaans module. The state security services repeatedly sought to intimidate him; he received anonymous threatening phone calls, and gun shots were fired at his house. A {{group of young men}} calling themselves 'The Cubans' began guarding him from these attacks. The security services detained him four times, once for 101 days. With the ban preventing him from gaining employment, the strained economic situation impacted his marriage.|$|E
