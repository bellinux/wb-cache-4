Liquid rocket engines are usually fired in a vertical position because the propellant pump intakes are designed to draw fuel from the bottoms of the fuel tanks.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} {{of the performance of}} any propulsion device requires the accurate <b>measurement</b> of <b>thrust.</b> While chemical rocket thrust is typically measured using a load cell, the low thrust levels associated with electric propulsion (EP) systems necessitate the use of much more sensitive measurement techniques. The design and development of electric propulsion thrust stands that employ a conventional hanging pendulum arm connected to a balance mechanism consisting of a secondary arm and variable linkage have been reported in recent publications by Polzin et al. These works focused on performing steady-state <b>thrust</b> <b>measurements</b> and employed a static analysis of the thrust stand response. In the present work, we present a calibration method and data that will permit pulsed <b>thrust</b> <b>measurements</b> using the Variable Amplitude Hanging Pendulum with Extended Range (VAHPER) thrust stand. Pulsed <b>thrust</b> <b>measurements</b> are challenging in general because the pulsed thrust (impulse bit) occurs over a short timescale (typically 1 micros to 1 millisecond) and cannot be resolved directly. Consequently, the imparted impulse bit must be inferred through observation of the change in thrust stand motion effected by the pulse. Pulsed <b>thrust</b> <b>measurements</b> have typically only consisted of single-shot operation. In the present work, we discuss repetition-rate pulsed thruster operation and describe a method to perform these <b>measurements.</b> The <b>thrust</b> stand response can be modeled as a spring-mass-damper system with a repetitive delta forcing function to represent the impulsive action of the thruster...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} test the {{feasibility}} of a new thrust stand system based on impulse <b>thrust</b> <b>measurement</b> method, a liquid-fueled pulse detonation engine (PDE) is designed and built. Thrust performance of the engine is obtained by direct <b>thrust</b> <b>measurement</b> with a force transducer and indirect <b>thrust</b> <b>measurement</b> with an eddy current displacement sensor (ECDS). These two sets of thrust data are compared {{with each other to}} verify the accuracy of the thrust performance. Then thrust data measured by the new thrust stand system are compared with the verified thrust data to test its feasibility. The results indicate that thrust data from the force transducer and ECDS system are consistent with each other within the range of measurement error. Though the thrust data from the impulse <b>thrust</b> <b>measurement</b> system is a litter lower than that from the force transducer due to the axial momentum losses of the detonation jet, the impulse <b>thrust</b> <b>measurement</b> method is valid when applied to measure the averaged thrust of PDE. Analytical models of PDE are also discussed in this paper. The analytical thrust performance is higher than the experimental data due to ignoring the losses during the deflagration to detonation transition process.

40|$|Miniature {{electric}} thrusters {{have been}} in development for decades for use in space applications such as satellite station keeping and propulsion. The development of these miniature thrusters has created a need to test and measure a number of parameters, including the amount of thrust (force) generated by the thrusters. As the generated thrust has decreased from the milli-Newton (mN) to the micro-Newton (µN) and nano-Newton (nN) scale, more and more precise <b>thrust</b> <b>measurement</b> stands have been created to accurately analyze their output. Successful measurement of sub micro-Newton thrust levels have been completed by individuals {{at a number of}} universities and laboratory institutions, but <b>thrust</b> <b>measurement</b> stands are typically built in larger, more stable, and more expensive vacuum systems than the chamber for the Boise State University (BSU) electric propulsion project. The need for a <b>thrust</b> <b>measurement</b> stand with µN resolution at BSU arose with the awarding of a research grant to the electric propulsion team. The purpose of this thesis is to support the development of a unique miniaturized propulsion system for use on micro-satellites (3 ̆c 50 kg). The propulsion system will consist of a ceramic-based Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) electric propulsion device. The device will be constructed using Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) materials. The LTCC substrate will be used to embed all electric connections and gas delivery channels within the body of the thrusters. The development of these thrusters at BSU requires the creation of a full spectrum of test and calibration equipment, including a test stand to measure the thrust provided by the thrusters. Knowing the thrust levels provided by the thrusters will allow multi-thruster packages to be constructed with precisely matched equipment and the physical models of the thrusters to be validated. A µN <b>thrust</b> <b>measurement</b> stand was modeled, designed, fabricated, and calibrated for use with testing and matching thrust levels of future electric thruster designs. A counterbalanced pendulum design, which incorporates the best combination of stability and resolution characteristics, was the final design configuration selected for use in the BSU vacuum chamber system.

The energy transfer from high-pressure to kinetic energy is quantified using <b>thrust</b> plate <b>measurements.</b> Non-dimensional <b>thrust</b> data {{is used to}} quantify performance by normalizing measured thrust by thrust for the same water flow rate at zero air flow rate. A total of 13 expander configurations are investigated and geometries with the shortest cavity length and the smallest exit diameter are found to result in the largest non-dimensional thrust increase. Results show that thrust augmentation increases with the initiation of slug flow in the SFE. The analysis performed on the normalized thrust readings suggested that as the water and air flow were increased to critical conditions, the liquid slugs produced by the SFE augmented the <b>thrust</b> <b>measurements.</b> The final performance evaluation was based on linear regression of the normalized <b>thrust</b> <b>measurements</b> where slug flow was generated for each SFE architecture.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the accuracy and sensitivity of a pendulum-type <b>thrust</b> <b>measurement</b> system, a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) and a laser optical displacement sensor have been used simultaneously to determine the displacement resulting from an applied thrust. The LVDT sensor uses an analog interface, whereas the laser sensor uses a digital interface to communicate the displacement readings to the data acquisition equipment. The data collected by both sensors show good agreement for static mass calibrations and validation with a cold gas thruster. However, the data obtained using the LVDT deviate significantly {{from that of the}} laser sensor when operating two varieties of plasma thrusters: a radio frequency (RF) driven plasma thruster, and a DC powered plasma thruster. Results establish that even with appropriate shielding and signal filtering the LVDT sensor is subject to plasma noise and radio frequency interactions which result in anomalous thrust readings. Experimental data show that the thrust determined using the LVDT system in a direct current plasma environment and a RF discharge is approximately a factor of three higher than the thrust values obtained using a laser sensor system for the operating conditions investigated. These findings are of significance to the electric propulsion community as LVDT sensors are often utilized in <b>thrust</b> <b>measurement</b> systems and accurate <b>thrust</b> <b>measurement</b> and the reproducibility of thrust data is key to analyzing thruster performance.
