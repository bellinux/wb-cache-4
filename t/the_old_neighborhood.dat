The twins Veda and Star remain in <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> and hang out at Cascade on Sundays, while Erin goes to Spelman College, the school she wanted to attend, in which Rashad appreciates a lot more because she's still close. Uncle George starts attending church more often and finds a good woman to date.

Rashad, lastly, becomes a comic artist for the Sunday edition of the Atlanta Evening Standard, the city's newspaper. The film ends with Rashad leaving his skates in Cascades, and the building's lights go off.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1950s, Montevideo's prosperous {{middle classes}} {{have tended to}} abandon the {{formerly}} fashionable downtown areas for the more modern high-rise apartment buildings of Pocitos, a beachfront neighborhood east of the center. Still farther east lies the expensive area of Carrasco, a zone of modern luxury villas {{that has come to}} replace <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>neighborhood</b> of El Prado in the north of the city as home to the country's wealthy elite. Its beaches were less polluted than those closer to the center. Montevideo's Carrasco International Airport is located nearby, crossing the border to Canelones Department. The capital's principal artery, 18 July Avenue, was long the principal shopping street of Montevideo, but it has been hurt since the mid-1980s by the construction of a modern shopping mall strategically located between Pocitos and Carrasco.|$|E

2500|$|The Bronx {{has been}} {{featured}} significantly in fiction literature. All {{of the characters}} in Herman Wouk's [...] (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there. Kate Simon's Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near Arthur Avenue and Tremont Avenue. In Jacob M. Appel's short story, [...] "The Grand Concourse" [...] (2007), a woman {{who grew up in the}} iconic Lewis Morris Building returns to the Morrisania neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in Avery Corman's book <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Neighborhood</b> (1980), an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood (Fordham Road and the Grand Concourse), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.|$|E

5000|$|Since 1977, LuPone {{has been}} a {{frequent}} collaborator with David Mamet, appearing in his plays The Woods, All Men are Whores, The Blue Hour, The Water Engine (1978), Edmond and <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Neighborhood</b> (1997). The New York Times reviewer wrote of LuPone in <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Neighborhood</b> [...] "Those who know Ms. LuPone only as a musical comedy star will be stunned by the naturalistic fire she delivers here. As Jolly, a part inspired by Mr. Mamets real-life sister and his realized female character, Ms. LuPone finds conflicting layers {{of past and present}} selves in practically every line. She emerges as both loving matriarch and wounded adolescent, sentimental and devastatingly clear-eyed." [...] In 1978, she appeared in the Broadway musical adaptation of Studs Terkel’s Working, which ran for only 24 performances.|$|E
