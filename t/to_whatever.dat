Several dozen small employers in the state have also said that same-sex marriage will be good for their businesses, helping to attract and retain talent.|$|E
5|$|It wasn't like Janet , {{where we}} all grew up together. Mariah had done her own thing and had been very {{involved}} with the arranging and production of her records, so we respected that and said, 'What can we do for you?' She would fly into town {{for five or six}} hours. She'd get on a plane and fly <b>to</b> <b>whatever</b> was the next thing she was doing.|$|E

5|$|His {{family moved}} to Surrey, British Columbia, in 1966, then settled in Port Coquitlam, in 1968. His parents were {{dedicated}} to their family, {{and his mother was}} especially protective of her children; it was through her that Fox developed his stubborn dedication <b>to</b> <b>whatever</b> task he committed to do. His father recalled that he was extremely competitive, noting that Terry hated to lose so much that he would continue at any activity until he succeeded.|$|E
5|$|Luperón would {{eventually}} arrive in Paris as a named ambassador, but Betances' {{connections in the}} city proved to be key <b>to</b> <b>whatever</b> success Luperón had as a diplomat in France. They would assume this role until political turmoil in the Dominican Republic forced Luperón to return and lead yet another revolt, which had another Puerto Plata native, Ulises Heureaux, installed as president. Betances sought support for Luperón's efforts, and gave him tactical and financial assistance from France.|$|E

5|$|One further {{variation}} {{places a}} 6-sided die (although other sided die {{could also be}} used) {{on top of the}} bottle. If the bottle is knocked over and the die knocked onto the table, the player is awarded points equal <b>to</b> <b>whatever</b> side of the die lies facing upward when the die comes to a stop. This adds a random effect to hitting the bottle and in practice often results in players only striking the bottle in combination with other point-scoring shots.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{stated that}} he was {{infringing}} its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman {{stated that he}} had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed <b>to</b> <b>whatever</b> farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation. In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.|$|E
5|$|The {{wedding of}} Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is halted when Lord Cutler Beckett, {{chairman}} of the East India Trading Company, arrives with arrest warrants for them, and also for Commodore James Norrington, who allowed Captain Jack Sparrow to escape. Norrington has resigned and disappeared after losing the Navy's flagship, HMS Dauntless in a hurricane while pursuing Sparrow. Jack Sparrow is visited by Will’s father Bootstrap Bill Turner, aboard the Black Pearl. Bootstrap is now a crewman on the Flying Dutchman, captained by Davy Jones. Jack previously bartered a deal with Jones to raise the Pearl from the depths. Now Jack must join Jones' crew or be dragged to Davy Jones' Locker by the Kraken. Beckett, meanwhile, promises to free Elizabeth if Will brings him Jack's magic compass which points <b>to</b> <b>whatever</b> the holder wants most.|$|E

25|$|A mafioso's {{legitimate}} occupation, if any, generally {{does not}} affect his prestige within Cosa Nostra.

25|$|The {{safety pin}} is a {{fastening}} device, {{a variation of}} the regular pin, which includes a simple spring mechanism and a clasp. The clasp serves two purposes, to form a closed loop thereby properly fastening the pin <b>to</b> <b>whatever</b> it is applied to, and to cover the end of the pin to protect the user from the sharp point. The safety pin was invented by Walter Hunt, and patented in April 1849. The rights to the invention were sold for $400.|$|E

A plurality (that is, more votes than any opponent) is sufficient for a major party candidate to win nomination; candidates need not get more than 50% of the vote {{to advance to the}} General Election.|$|E
