Historians estimate that the peasant families were required to pay six to nine gold florins, although {{the value of an}} average peasant lot was only about 40 florins. Most peasants were unable to pay this amount, especially because they also had to pay the seigneurial <b>taxes</b> <b>to</b> the owners of their parcels.|$|E

5|$|Between 1788 and 1789, the Minister-Plenipotentiary of the Austrian Netherlands {{decided that}} the only way in which reform could be {{provoked}} would be by rapid and uncompromising enforcement.

5|$|Despite these {{economic}} indicators, the Budget presented in August 1974 saw large increases in spending, especially in education. Treasury officials had advised {{a series of}} tax and fee increases, ranging from excise <b>taxes</b> <b>to</b> the cost of posting a letter; their advice was mostly rejected by Cabinet. The Budget was unsuccessful {{in dealing with the}} inflation and unemployment, and Whitlam introduced large tax cuts in November.

5|$|In July 1452, Grubiša {{sought for}} his family and all {{residents}} of Krajina to become Venetian vassals. Venice accepted the request, confirmed their old customs, allowed the foundation of fort and port in Makar, and forgave older violence.

5000|$|With regard <b>to</b> <b>taxing</b> <b>to</b> deter {{agents from}} buying {{dangerous}} products, {{he makes a}} distinction. He states that <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> solely <b>to</b> deter purchases is impermissible because prohibiting personal actions is impermissible and [...] "every increase of cost is a prohibition, to those whose means do not {{come up to the}} augmented price." [...] However, because a government must <b>tax</b> <b>to</b> some extent in order to survive, it may choose <b>to</b> take its <b>taxes</b> from what it deems most dangerous.|$|R

They also sought military training by Turkish officers.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's {{primary concern}} was the Panic of 1837. He {{advocated}} raising property <b>taxes</b> <b>to</b> offset spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature borrowed money to meet the current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state's credit by paying the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he called for more spending were improvements in river navigation, preservation of state archives, and public education. Aside from these concerns, he was inundated with requests for clemency.|$|E

His life was dominated by warfare, if not on the front lines, then on the political scene against other Lithuanian magnates, particularly the Radziwiłł family and the Sejm politicians whom he held responsible for not passing enough <b>taxes</b> <b>to</b> support the army he wanted.|$|E

The state legislature believed priority should be given to creating government infrastructure. Lack of public funds postponed creation of a state library system until Governor James B. Ray's administration in 1826.|$|E

Incorporation made it possible to collect <b>taxes</b> <b>to</b> build a formal fire-fighting system and to establish building codes that prohibited tents and other fire hazards within the town limits. Local merchant and rancher William Munds was the first mayor.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad's {{taxation}} {{was considered}} exploitative by Tripoli Eyalet's inhabitants.

Muhammad's death with no male heirs marked the end of Assaf rule. Following his death, Yusuf Sayfa was transferred control of the Assafs' nawahi in Tripoli Eyalet, and he expelled the Hubaysh clan, promoting his Shia Muslim Hamade allies from Jbeil at their expense. In 1593, Yusuf Sayfa wed Muhammad's widow and thus acquired the Assafs' wealth. He concurrently took control over Keserwan and Assaf properties in Beirut.|$|E
