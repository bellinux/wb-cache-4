40|$|The causal {{relationship}} between several virus infections and human cancers are well established. However, {{it is also}} possible that additional cancers may be caused by known or yet unknown viruses. The present thesis has sought to both further elucidate known relationships between virus and cancer as well as to provide a basis for further exploration in the area of infections and cancer. Infections during pregnancy have been suspected to be involved in the etiology of childhood leukemias. However, no specific infectious agent is yet linked to the etiology of these diseases. As a basis for further studies in this area, we applied high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) technology to describe the viruses most readily detectable in serum samples of mothers to leukemic children. The most common <b>viruses</b> found were <b>TT</b> <b>viruses,</b> including several previously not described <b>TT</b> <b>viruses.</b> Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) is found in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare and aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin. To explore whether MCV infection might be associated with additional cancers, we investigated whether MCC patients are at excess risk of other cancers, using population-based Nordic cancer registries. Bidirectional evaluation of excess risk of other diseases among MCC patients revealed that they are at increased risk of other skin cancers as a second cancer, compared to the general Nordic population. Shared causative factors, such as exposure to ultraviolet light and/or MCV infection are among the possible explanations. Also, impact of increased surveillance of the skin should be noted as an explanation of the excess risk. Cutaneous human papillomaviruses (HPV) are suspected to be involved in the etiology of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). To evaluate whether there are any consistent association between cutaneous HPV infections and skin cancer, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that investigated HPV prevalences among cases of skin lesions and their healthy controls. We found that HPV species Beta- 1, Beta- 2, Beta- 3 and Gamma- 1 were more frequently detected in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to healthy controls. To provide clues about possible carcinogenicity of 47 mucosal HPV types, out of which 12 are established as causes of cervical cancer, we also investigated the prevalence of 47 mucosal HPV types across the entire range of cervical diagnoses from normal to cervical cancer. To investigate diversity of HPVs in skin lesions with increased sensitivity, different sample types from different skin lesion were subjected to high-throughput NGS after PCR amplification. Conventional molecular detection methods such as PCR are biased towards the primers used. Thus they might miss viruses that are divergent from the primer sequences. We also investigated whether NGS technology can be used to assess presence of virus DNA in an unbiased manner, both in skin lesions as well as in condylomas that were classified as “HPV negative” by conventional PCR methods. Unbiased sequencing identified two putatively new HPV types that were missed by NGS after PCR amplification. The advantage of unbiased sequencing over conventional molecular detection methods was further demonstrated in the study of “HPV negative” condylomas. We found several known as well as several putatively novel HPV types in condylomas that were previously found to be HPV negative by PCR. In conclusion, we have used registry linkage studies, systematic reviews and metaanalyses and modern NGS technology applied to biobanked specimens to extend our knowledge of the epidemiology of cancer-associated viruses and to provide a basis for further exploration in this area...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>TT</b> <b>viruses</b> are {{single-stranded}} DNA viruses, {{suggested to}} be involved in non A-E hepatitis. We studied the prevalence of TTV infection in acute or chronic hepatitis in Belgium in comparison with that in blood donors and in patients regularly receiving blood products. METHODS: TTV-DNA was detected by PCR using the primer set of Takahashi et al (1998) or a nested-PCR specific for genotype- 2, because it had been reported that this subtype might be more pathogenic (Tagger et al. 1999). RESULTS: TTV-DNA was present in 49 % of 128 patients with chronic hepatitis C, in 54 % of 54 with chronic hepatitis B and in 54 % of 24 with acute liver failure. This prevalence is similar to the 47 % in 127 patients with clotting disorders, or the 64 % in 103 undergoing chronic haemodialysis, but lower than the 29. 7 % found in 340 healthy blood donors. Significant differences in clinical or biochemical characteristics between TTV- positive or TTV-negative patients could not be substantiated. The genotype- 2 subgroup comprised 3. 9 %, but they also did not differ from non genotype- 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of TTV infection was higher in patients than in healthy blood donors. Its clinical significance remains questionable since clinical and biochemical characteristics were not different between TTV positive and TTV negative patients. The higher prevalence of TTV in patients might be related to parenteral transmission, but the relatively high prevalence in healthy blood donors points to an additional presumably faeco-oral infection. The presence of TTV in animals suggests that infection might also originate from food. Long term follow-up will have to define whether co-infection with TTV eventually alters the natural history of chronic hepatitis. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedThe {{function}} of viral protein 2 (VP 2) of the immunosuppressive circovirus chicken anemia virus (CAV) {{has not yet}} been established. We show that the CAV VP 2 amino acid sequence has some similarity to a number of eukaryotic, receptor, protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) alpha proteins as well as to a cluster of human <b>TT</b> <b>viruses</b> within the Sanban group. To investigate if CAV VP 2 functions as a PTPase, purified glutathione S-transferase (GST) -VP 2 fusion protein was assayed for PTPase activity using the generalized peptide substrates ENDpYINASL and DADEpYLIPQQG (where pY represents phosphotyrosine), with free phosphate detected using the malachite green colorimetric assay. CAV GST-VP 2 was shown to catalyze dephosphorylation of both substrates. CAV GST-VP 2 PTPase activity for the ENDpYINASL substrate had a V(max) of 14, 925 units/mg. min and a K(m) of 18. 88 microm. Optimal activity was observed between pH 6 and 7, and activity was specifically inhibited by 0. 01 mm orthovanadate. We also show that the ORF 2 sequence of the CAV-related human virus TT-like minivirus (TLMV) possessed PTPase activity and steady state kinetics equivalent to CAV GST-VP 2 when expressed as a GST fusion protein. To establish whether these viral proteins were dual specificity protein phosphatases, the CAV GST-VP 2 and TLMV GST-ORF 2 fusion proteins were also assayed for serine/threonine phosphatase (S/T PPase) activity using the generalized peptide substrate RRApTVA, with free phosphate detected using the malachite green colorimetric assay. Both CAV GST-VP 2 and TLMV GST-ORF 2 fusion proteins possessed S/T PPase activity, which was specifically inhibited by 50 mm sodium fluoride. CAV GST-VP 2 exhibited S/T PPase activity with a V(max) of 28, 600 units/mg. min and a K(m) of 76 microm. Mutagenesis of residue Cys(95) to serine in CAV GST-VP 2 abrogated both PTPase and S/T PPase activity, identifying it as the catalytic cysteine within the proposed signature motif. These studies thus show that the circoviruses CAV and TLMV encode dual specificity protein phosphatases (DSP) with an unusual signature motif that {{may play a role in}} intracellular signaling during viral replication.

The sequence analysis of our 24 isolates revealed the remarkable heterogeneity of <b>TT</b> <b>virus</b> isolates {{not only from the}} same patient but also from the same biopsy material. These isolates belong to four phylogenetic groups of TT viruses. Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed five distinct genotypes (tth 3, tth 4, tth 5, tth 6, and tth 7). The limited variation in sequence identity of the other isolates defines the latter as variants of four of these genotypes.

Eight different SENV isolates have been found, some with an association with posttransfusion hepatitis. A phylogenetic analysis of near-complete open-reading frame 1, including conserved motifs and excluding recombinant regions, was performed. The analysis used TTV-like minivirus as an outgroup, to determine a root of the phylogenetic tree, and compared 8 SENV isolates, 6 prototype TTV isolates, and 7 TTV variants (including SANBAN, TUS 01, PMV, and YONBAN). Four distinct clus-ters separated by a bootstrap value of 100 % were observed. YONBAN isolates formed a distinct outer group, representing the earliest recognized phylogenetic divergence (group 1). Prototype TTV formed group 2, PMV formed group 3, and SENV, SANBAN, and TUS 01 isolates formed group 4, the most recently evolved group. This taxonomic classi®cation sug-gests that these circular ssDNA viruses probably evolved from a common ancestor virus. Recently, a new family of single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses, distantly related to the <b>TT</b> <b>virus</b> (TTV) [1, 2], was isolated and was designated as SEN virus (SENV), after the initials of th...|$|E
40|$|Two {{overlapping}} sets of <b>TT</b> <b>virus</b> (TTV) ±speci®c polymerase {{chain reaction}} primers were used to test for presence of TTV, which was found in approximately 10 % of US volunteer blood donors, 13 % of commercial blood donors, and 17 % of intravenous drug abusers. The rate of TTV infection among US non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis patients was only 2 %. Among commercial blood donors and intravenous drug abusers, only 1 %± 3 % of the TTV-positive individuals were coinfected with GB virus C (GBV-C), a parenterally transmitted virus. This suggests that GBV-C and TTV may have different routes of transmission. Com-parison of the sensitivities of 2 TTV {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) primer sets showed {{that the majority of}} samples were detected with only 1 of the 2 sets. Therefore, previous studies in which only a single PCR primer pair was used may have signi®cantly underestimated the true prevalence of TTV. Recently, a novel human DNA virus was isolated from the serum of a Japanese patient (patient T. T.) with cryptogenic hepatitis [1]. By means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), <b>TT</b> <b>virus</b> (TTV) was detected in sera from 3 of 5 patients wit...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>TT</b> <b>virus</b> (TTV) is a newly {{identified}} blood-borne virus. Its {{association with}} disease is still unknown, and screening of blood donors {{has not been}} implemented. Several genotypes of the TTV have been identified. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Three hundred seventy healthy blood donors were randomly selected and tested for TTV by the PCR method. Sequencing of {{a part of the}} genome was performed to identify various genotypes of the virus. ALT levels were determined in both infected and uninfected individuals. RESULTS: The <b>TT</b> <b>virus</b> (TTV), was detected in the sera of 23 (6. 2 %) of 370 healthy Icelandic blood donors; this prevalence is lower than that reported in Japan but higher than that in Scotland. The virus was found in all groups over the age of 19. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 202 bp from open reading frame 1 demonstrated genotypes 1 b and 2 b 2 c and genotype 4 isolates, with the latter bearing 89 -percent nucleotide homology with other genotype 4 sequences deposited at GenBank. One sample showed a mixed genotype 1 b/ 2 c infection. Serum ALT levels were within normal limits in all infected individuals. CONCLUSION: The TTV carrier state does not cause significant liver injury...|$|E

40|$|The {{regulation}} of <b>TT</b> <b>virus</b> (TTV) gene expression was characterized. Transient-transfection assays using reporter constructs {{revealed that a}} 113 -nucleotide (nt) sequence within the untranslated region, proximal to the transcription initiation site and containing a TATA box motif, has a basal promoter activity. This sequence is well conserved among different TTV genotypes. Upstream stimulating factor bound to a consensus binding motif within this region and positively regulates TTV transcription. Furthermore, a 488 -nt region upstream of the basal promoter exhibited enhancer activity, presumably in a cell type-specific manner. This study illustrates some of the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional {{regulation of}} TTV...|$|E
40|$|<b>TT</b> <b>virus</b> (TTV) {{produces}} chronic plasma viremia {{in around}} 90 % of healthy individuals {{of all ages}} and has, therefore, been proposed as a commensal human virus. We recently demonstrated that in children hospitalized for acute respiratory diseases high TTV loads were associated with severe forms of disease. Here, we report that in such children TTV loads showed an inverse correlation with the percentage of circulating total T and helper T cells and a direct correlation with the percentage of B cells. Thus, florid TTV replication might contribute to lymphocyte imbalances and, possibly, immunosuppressive effects, thus resembling related animal viruses...|$|E
