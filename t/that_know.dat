25|$|Until 1984, the north-northwestern face of Cannon was {{operated}} {{under the name}} Mittersill Ski Area (Cannon Mountain Ski Area occupies the north-northeastern face). The trails are often skied by those <b>that</b> <b>know</b> the area {{as a result of}} their ease of accessibility (only a short hike is required from Taft Slalom to find them). However, in the late 1990s/early 2000s (decade), the state of New Hampshire unveiled plans to purchase the north-northwestern face and use the already-cut trails as an expansion to the current ski area. The purchase was completed in 2008. A $2.6 million Doppelmayr double chairlift was ordered, to be installed for the 2010-2011 ski season.|$|E

40|$|How {{much can}} we turn the screw on counter-examples to the KK principle? The principle, also {{sometimes}} called “positive introspection”, says <b>that</b> if one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P. It is widely, although not universally, {{acknowledged that the}} KK principle is false, {{and not just for}} the boring reason <b>that</b> one can <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P without having formed the belief <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P. One can <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P, and believe <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, without knowing <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, because one is not in a strong enough epistemic position to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P (Williamson 2000 : 114 - 30). One’s epistemic position is weaker with respect to the fact <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P than it is with respect to the fact that P itself. But how much weaker can one’s epistemic position be with respect to the fact <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P than it is with respect to the fact that P? Of course, if one does <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P, one’s epistemic position with respect to the fact <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P cannot be so bad <b>that</b> one positively <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> one does not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> P, as opposed to merely failing to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> P, for knowing is 1 factive: one can know only what is indeed the case.

The new Commander refuses to believe anything, despite the fact that everyone knows Root was like a father to Holly.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the Dean of the College, {{implemented}} a grade deflation policy {{to curb the}} number of A-range grades undergraduates received. Malkiel's argument was that an A was beginning to lose its meaning as {{a larger percentage of}} the student body received them. While the number of A's has indeed decreased under the policy, many argue that this is hurting Princeton students when they apply to jobs or graduate school. Malkiel has said that she sent pamphlets to inform institutions about the policy so that they consider Princeton students equally, but students argue that Princeton graduates can apply to other institutions <b>that</b> <b>know</b> nothing about it. They argue further that as other schools purposefully inflate their grades, Princeton students' GPAs will look low by comparison. Further, studies have shown that employers prefer high grades even when they are inflated. The policy remained in place even after Malkiel stepped {{down at the end of}} the 2010–2011 academic term. The policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{publication}} of Dogs <b>That</b> <b>Know</b> When Their Owners Are Coming Home, Sheldrake invited Richard Wiseman, Matthew Smith, and Julie Milton to conduct an independent experimental study with the dog Jaytee. They concluded that their evidence did not support telepathy as {{an explanation for the}} dog's behaviour, and proposed possible alternative explanations for Sheldrake's conclusions, involving artefacts, bias resulting from experimental design, and post hoc analysis of unpublished data. The group observed that Sheldrake's observed patterns could easily arise if a dog were simply to do very little for a while, before visiting a window with increasing frequency the longer that its owner was absent, and that such behaviour would make sense for a dog awaiting its owner's return. Under this behaviour, the final measurement period, ending with the owner's return, would always contain the most time spent at the window. Sheldrake argued that the actual data in his own and in Wiseman's tests did not bear this out, and that the dog went to wait at the window sooner when his owner was returning from a short absence, and later after a long absence, with no tendency for Jaytee to go to the window early in the way that he did for shorter absences.|$|E

500|$|During his {{election}} campaign in 1988, Vice President Bush denied {{any knowledge of}} the Iran–Contra affair by saying he was [...] "out of the loop". Though his diaries included that he was [...] "one {{of the few people}} <b>that</b> <b>know</b> fully the details", he repeatedly refused to discuss the incident and won the election.

[...] "Nir could have incriminated the incoming President. The fact that Nir was killed in a mysterious chartered airplane crash in Mexico in December 1988 has given rise to numerous conspiracy theories", writes Bergman. On December 24, 1992, nearing the end of his term in office after being defeated by Bill Clinton the previous month, Bush pardoned six administration officials, namely Elliott Abrams, Duane Clarridge, Alan Fiers, Clair George, Robert McFarlane, and Caspar Weinberger.|$|E

500|$|The song's bleak lyrics were {{explained}} by Marker as {{a mockery of}} the angsty [...] " [...] thing" [...] themes prevalent in mid-1990s alternative rock songs, as well as a self-deprecating reference to Garbage's own dark lyrics, with Manson explaining that the song was [...] "a dig at ourselves because we like records that don't make us feel very happy, and at this so-called 'alternative' scene of 'we're so weird and more wonderful than everybody else'". Vig added that [...] "'Only Happy When It Rains' was about what happened with grunge and the angst-filled thing which has dominated the American alternative rock scene.

[...] Garbage said they referenced both the title of The Jesus and Mary Chain song [...] "Happy When It Rains" [...] (1987) and Manson's own Scottish psyche.
