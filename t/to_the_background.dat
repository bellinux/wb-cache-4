He {{believed}} that money was essential for his survival and {{to look after the}} family, and that the money he earned from giving music lessons and his compositions for the film world sufficed. He valued honesty and sincerity in his work and placed importance on purity and originality, whether in his music, lyrics or style of singing. He stopped composing songs for the film company when he was upset about the management's decision to cut production costs by borrowing existing music to be used for dubbing on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> music of some films.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage {{is the use}} of any {{combination}} of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling.|$|E
5|$|Hale {{had spent}} many {{hundreds}} of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius. Hale first established {{that there was no}} other deep-sky object near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.|$|E
5|$|On 9 and 10 October 1946, the {{telescope}} {{was used to}} observe the ionisation in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were indeed from meteors. Shortly after this, {{the telescope}} {{was used to determine}} the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. The telescope, as well as other receivers on the site, was also used to study auroral streamers that were visible at the site in early August 1947.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} Positivists in Brazil was Lieutenant-colonel Benjamim Constant, a professor in the Military Academy. Although admired to the point of veneration by the young cadets, he was completely unknown to the public. Constant and other Positivist instructors inculcated students with his ideology. Gradually consigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> of the Academy's curriculum were military exercises and military studies of Antoine-Henri Jomini and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz, replaced by a focus on political discussions and readings from Auguste Comte and Pierre Lafitte. The cadets soon became insubordinate political agitators. Even so, Positivists still expected to make a peaceful transition to their fantasy of a republican dictatorship and Constant, who had also taught the emperor's grandsons, met with Pedro II and tried to convince him join their cause. Unsurprisingly, given Pedro II's character, this proposal was steadfastly refused, and Constant began to believe that there was no remaining alternative to a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|Quadrophenia was revived for a {{film version}} in 1979, {{directed}} by Franc Roddam. The film attempted to portray an accurate visual interpretation of Townshend's vision of Jimmy and his surroundings, and included Phil Daniels as Jimmy and Sting as the Ace Face. Unlike the Tommy film, the music was largely relegated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background,</b> and was not performed by the cast as in a rock opera. The film soundtrack included three additional songs written by Townshend, which were Kenney Jones' first recordings as an official member of the Who. The film was a commercial and critical success, as it conveniently coincided with the mod revival movement of the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The Greeks {{used the}} word planēton {{to refer to the}} seven {{celestial}} bodies that moved with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> stars and they held a geocentric view that these bodies moved about the Earth. In his work, The Republic (X.616E–617B), the Greek philosopher Plato provided the oldest known statement defining the order of the planets in Greek astronomical tradition. His list, in order of the nearest to the most distant from the Earth, was as follows: the Moon, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. In his dialogue Timaeus, Plato proposed that the progression of these objects across the skies depended on their distance, so that the most distant object moved the slowest.|$|E

5|$|The Moon and Earth orbit {{a common}} {{barycenter}} every 27.32days relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> stars. When {{combined with the}} Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, {{the period of the}} synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|The Reformation brought {{changes in}} outlook and artistic {{expression}} as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery {{was shown in}} a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background.</b> Pieter Bruegel the Elder, {{one of the few}} who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his genre scenes were complex, with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Kishi {{specifically}} {{requested that}} sound and music director Satoki Iida {{work on the}} project, who also helped with the proofreading of the script due to Maeda's fixation on the music production. Iida was interviewed in the April 2010 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where it was stated that Maeda and the group Anant-Garde Eyes received Iida's approval to employ a minimalist approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> music (BGM) used throughout the anime. Iida admitted that it was uncustomary to use this music genre in anime {{and that he had}} to go through various trials and errors with Maeda and Anant-Garde Eyes to get the music right. Maeda and Anant-Garde Eyes strove to create individual quality music tracks, while Iida pursued the goal of having music that would be useful as BGM tracks, which caused problems during the creation process. Iida realized that it was important for the music and the visuals to combine together to create a synchronization between the two. Toba first took notice of Angel Beats! character designer and chief animator Katsuzō Hirata during the production of Gurren Lagann (2007) with his skill as an artist and ability to finish work quickly, but thoroughly. It was after Toba saw Hirata's work as chief animator of Strike Witches (2008), however, that he pursued Hirata to join the Angel Beats! staff; Maeda also gave his seal of approval for Hirata.|$|E

5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>background.</b> The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone dripped on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E
