5|$|His {{introduction}} to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt {{who lived in}} Brooklyn opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, {{one of the first}} settlement houses in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake. Therefore, Florence James has the unique distinction of being the first director to put him on a stage. Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles.|$|E
5|$|The {{flanking}} party {{consisted of}} Knowlton's Rangers, {{which had been}} reinforced by three companies of riflemen, in total about 200 men. As they approached, an officer accidentally misdirected the men, and the firing broke out on the British flank, not their rear. The British troops, realizing that they had almost been surrounded, retreated to a field, {{where there was a}} fence. The Americans soon pursued and, during the attack, Knowlton was killed. Despite this, the American troops pushed on; driving the British troops beyond <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> the top of a hill. When they reached the hill, the British forces received reinforcements; including some artillery. For two hours, the British troops held their ground {{at the top of the}} hill until the Americans once again forced them to retreat, into a buckwheat field where Barnard College now stands.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} by a low scoring Second Test in Sydney when Australia were 4/77 needing 223 to win on a poor wicket against the lethal pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. The express Tyson was bowling with the help of tailwind and the slips cordon were over 50m behind the bat. Harvey stood firm while Tyson scattered the stumps of his partners, and he farmed the strike ruthlessly, protecting the tailenders and counter-attacking the England fast bowlers, relying on the cut shot and clipping anything on his pads through the leg side. Schoolboys watching the game leaned over <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> beckon the boundaries towards them. Last man Bill Johnston came in at 9/145 with 78 runs still required, but protected by Harvey he only had to face 16 balls in 40 minutes and they almost produced an unlikely Australian victory. Harvey continued to attack the bowling, and he hooked Tyson over fine leg's head for four. Together, Harvey and Johnston they had added 39 for the last wicket and halved the runs required. At this point, the Australian pair were confident. Harvey and Johnston felt that Tyson was about to run out of energy, and that their prospects would improve when Hutton would have been forced to change bowlers in the near future. However, it was not enough and England won by 38 runs when Johnston gloved a Tyson delivery down the leg side to the wicket-keeper. Harvey had played what many observers thought was the greatest innings of his life, a defiant, unbeaten 92, exactly half of the Australian innings of 184 in which no other batsmen reached 15.|$|E

50|$|In 1839, John Reynell {{claimed he}} was the first settler to enclose an entire 80 acre section. A little later he had <b>to</b> cut <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> <b>to</b> allow for <b>the</b> {{alignment}} of a proposed road for the passage of a regular mail run to Encounter Bay which was established by the end of 1839.|$|R
25|$|Thousands of Filipinos and non-interned foreigners from neutral {{countries}} {{gathered around}} the fenced compound every day and passed food, money, letters, and other goods across <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> the internees. The Japanese {{put a stop to}} that by ordering <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> be shielded by bamboo mats but they permitted parcels to enter the compound after being searched. However, the loose Japanese control of the camp had teeth. Two young Englishmen and an Australian who escaped from the camp were captured, beaten, tortured, and executed on February 15. Carroll, Stanley, and the monitors of the two rooms where the men had been accommodated were forced to watch. Thereafter, no escapes from Santo Tomas, which would have been relatively easy given the small size of the Japanese guard force, were recorded.|$|E
25|$|The 1984–85 {{season is}} also notable for the {{erection}} {{of an electric}} perimeter fence around the pitch at Stamford Bridge, the response of chairman Ken Bates to regular pitch invasions and fights during matches. The local council, however, refused permission for the electric supply to <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> be switched on, and it was dismantled within months of being erected.|$|E

50|$|A {{sacrificial}} {{fence is}} a woodworking fence {{that is made}} out of wood and often bolted to the surface of a metal <b>fence</b> in order <b>to</b> allow <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> be used very close to the blade (where it might be damaged). The word sacrificial is used because <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> is expected <b>to</b> be accidentally hit by the cutting blade, and will thus be eventually sacrificed and replaced.|$|R

25|$|The {{first major}} show jumping {{competition}} held in England was at Olympia in 1907. Most of the competitors {{were members of}} the military and it became clear at this competition and in the subsequent years, that there was no uniformity of rules for the sport. Judges marked on their own opinions. Some marked according to the severity of the obstacle and others marked according to style. Before 1907 there were no penalties for a refusal and the competitor was sometimes asked to miss <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> please the spectators. The first courses were built with little imagination, many consisting of only a straight bar fence and a water jump. A meeting was arranged in 1923 which {{led to the formation of}} the BSJA in 1925. In the United States, a similar need for national rules for jumping and other equestrian activities led to the formation of the American Horse Shows Association in 1917, which now is known as the United States Equestrian Federation.|$|E
25|$|The War Department {{appointed}} Colonel James C. Strong as the {{new head}} of the garrison. His command began during General Orme's command of the camp and continued through Colonel Sweet's command. At the beginning of his duty, Strong had only about 650 healthy men to guard almost 6,000 prisoners. Strong prepared new prison rolls and found that 84 prisoners were missing. He was the first garrison commander to force prisoners to work, but work details were restricted to four hours per day. Between January and March 1864, when Colonel Strong had only 550 men available for guard duty, thirty-two escapes were made from the camp. Strong realized placement of the buildings in Prisoner's Square contributed to the problem and had them moved away from the fences and closer {{to the middle of the}} square. The fence separating Prisoner's Square from the rest of the camp was completed on March 22, 1864. About this time General Orme attached many bright oil–burning lamps to <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> illuminate the area at night.|$|E
25|$|On August 29, 2007, a {{chain link}} fence was {{constructed}} around the protesters. The fence was erected to prevent {{confrontation between the}} protesters and the sellout crowd of 72,516 people (17,000 of them from Tennessee, the opposing team) that were expected to attend the opening game of the California Golden Bears' football season. Protesters responded with shouts and promises to {{make it difficult for}} the UCPD to guard the fence. The protesters claimed the fence was erected not to protect them, but to starve them out. Some have drawn comparisons between the building of the fence, and the attempted take back of People's Park in 1969, in which the California National Guard was called in to remove protesters. Initially the police did not allow food and water to be passed over <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> the tree sitters, but started to allow the deliveries by the evening. Two men were arrested following scuffles with police. Around 200 additional people joined hands around the fence in support of the tree sitters. The fence cost the University between $10,000 and $12,000 to build. Despite the fence more protesters took up spots in the trees.|$|E

On the day of the competition Sugita and two fellow countrymen and contestants, Kozo Sudo and Masashi Enomoto, posed for photographs in London's Hyde Park Square, an event which caused much interest to passers-by, who lined up along <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> <b>to</b> watch.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to fan complaints, the stadium has undergone numerous renovations since the 2001 season {{in order to}} retrofit the facility to current architectural trends. These changes have included building a multi-tiered concourse beyond center field, adjusting <b>the</b> <b>fences</b> <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> outfield less symmetrical and, most significantly, the removal of 6,600 seats {{at the top of}} the upper deck.|$|R
50|$|The {{sprawling}} prison complex {{was divided}} into compounds. The perimeter of the each compound was secured by a double barbed-wire fence, fifteen feet in height, on top of which ran a high-voltage wire. The space between <b>the</b> two <b>fences</b> was a tangled mass of barbed-wire. On the prisoners' side of <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> a wire ran parallel with <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> staked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground approximately ten feet from <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> six <b>to</b> eight inches above the ground. Any man who stepped between the wire and <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> was shot on sight. Every so many yards along <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> was a guard tower, fully armed and manned.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} of a three-game road series against the Mets on September 19, the Braves put up seven runs, {{including}} a solo homer by Freeman, and Blair surrendered just two runs off four hits in six innings pitched to earn his first victory of the season in a 7-3 win over the Mets. In the second game, the Braves put up five runs, including a three-run homer in the seventh inning by Garcia, and Johnson earned the save to win series in a 5-4 victory over the Mets. The Mets jumped to a three-run lead in the final game of the series, but the Braves rallied back with four unanswered runs, which included a two-run homer by Anthony Recker in the seventh inning, {{to take the lead in}} the top of the ninth. In an almost exact repeat of the night before, Braves closer Johnson faced off against Cespedes with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. Cespedes hit the ball to deep right-center and had the distance for a three-run homer, but center fielder Inciarte raced towards the wall, made the jump and caught the ball above <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> get the final out for a 4-3 Braves victory in their final game of the season against the Mets.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{advanced}} to the NLCS {{for the first time}} since 2009, where they faced off with the St. Louis Cardinals. In the first game of the series at Busch Stadium, Zack Greinke allowed only two runs in eight innings, while striking out a season high 10 batters, the first pitcher to strike out 10 Cardinals in a post-season game since Denny Galehouse in the 1944 World Series. Andre Ethier, making his first post-season start of the season after being limited to pinch hitting the previous round, just missed catching Carlos Beltrán's double at <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> allow the two runs to score in the third. The Dodgers also managed two runs, on a single by Juan Uribe in the top of the third. The game remained tied into extra innings until Beltran recorded the walk-off hit off Kenley Jansen in the bottom of the 13th inning to give the Cardinals a 3-2 victory. This was the longest game in Dodgers post-season history since the 1916 World Series. In the second game, Clayton Kershaw and two relievers combined to allow only 2 hits and 1 run but that was enough as the Dodgers offense failed to score at all and they lost 1-0. Kershaw was the first starting pitcher in post-season history to lose a game while allowing no earned runs and two or fewer hits.|$|E

500|$|References to Shaun of the Dead {{are also}} present in the film. In one scene, Nicholas wants to chase a {{shoplifter}} by jumping over garden fences; however, Danny is reluctant. Nicholas says, [...] "What's the matter, Danny? You never taken a shortcut before?" [...] He smiles assuredly before jumping over {{three in a row}} (according to the DVD commentary, Pegg vaulted over three fences, and a stunt man did a back flip over the fourth). When Danny attempts it, he trips and falls through the fence. This is almost identical to a scene in Shaun of the Dead, including the fall-through-fence gag, albeit with the pratfalling role reverse: in Shaun of the Dead it happens to Pegg's character rather than Frost's, and he falls over the fence rather than through it. The DVD commentary says that Frost purposely looked back at the camera after crashing through <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> <b>to</b> show that he had done the stunt rather than someone else.|$|E
500|$|The {{photos on}} the album were taken by Michael Maggid, a friend of Morrison's then wife Janet Planet, {{in the town of}} Fairfax. The {{original}} LP was released in a gatefold sleeve. The cover photograph showed Planet, riding bareback on a horse, with Morrison walking alongside. The gatefold and back cover photographs showed Morrison perched upon the fence of the horse's paddock, with his wife standing to his right and a black-and-white kitten on <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> his left. [...] This rural setting depicting a bygone era was in vogue on album covers at the time as rock artists moved from cities to rural communities. [...] The Band, CSNY and Grateful Dead had similar themes on album covers in 1969 and 1970. [...] Morrison later complained of the cover, explaining that, [...] "The picture was taken at a stable and I didn't live there. We just went there and took the picture and split.

500|$|A decade later, a New York Times {{reporter}} {{visiting the}} zoo noted that [...] "...an Asiatic Black Bear {{lay on a}} rock {{a short distance from}} a guard rail. A shattered wine bottle, a cracked stick, and a number of empty beer cans were strewn about the ground a few feet in front of him. 'How many times have I seen a bear lift his foot and leave a bloody foot print?' said John Kinzig, a park supervisor at the Prospect Park Zoo. 'Vandalism is a major problem, and deterioration is overtaking repairs.'" [...] Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo, which, in 1983, was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the [...] "10 worst" [...] zoos in the country. Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds. A fatal accident of an 11-year-old boy scaling <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> the polar bear pit only served to underscore difficulties with the fifty-year-old facility.|$|E

500|$|Relations {{between the}} Olympians and the Australian Government {{remained}} tense {{after months of}} political struggle regarding the boycott. A prime minister would customarily send a congratulatory message to Olympic medallists. However, the Australian Olympic chef de mission Phil Coles confirmed at the following day's press conference that the quartet had not received a message from Malcolm Fraser. Australian journalists soon bombarded Fraser's office with phone calls asking why he had not applauded the athletes. Various members of the government recommended that Fraser congratulate the swimmers, but the prime minister baulked. When questioned in a radio interview, he said [...] "I hope that circumstances do not arise {{over the next few}} years which will cause them to have very great regrets about the fact that they've gone". Fraser relented and late in the night, his office sent a telegram. However, he would not send his message directly to the Olympic village, so the telegram was sent to the Australian Embassy in Moscow. Fraser had ordered the Australian diplomatic mission to close its doors to the Olympians, so the embassy staff had to pass the envelopes containing the message through <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> <b>to</b> Australian Olympic officials.

Chima was the winner. On Day 34, HouseGuests competed in [...] "The Goods" [...] luxury competition. For this competition, actor Jeremy Piven entered the house to inform the HouseGuests of the competition. The HouseGuests split into teams and were required to fill a station wagon with various items that were worth different amounts of points; the team would only earn a point for the items they successfully fit into their car, and {{the team with the}} most points would earn the right to see the film The Goods. The team of Chima, Jordan, Jessie, Natalie, and Russell won the competition, meaning Jeff, Kevin, Lydia, and Michele were the Have-Nots for the week. Later that day, Chima chose to nominate Lydia and Russell for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jeff, Kevin, and Natalie were selected to compete; Michele was selected to host.
