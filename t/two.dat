5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{evolution}} of circular permutations is the fission and fusion model. The process starts with <b>two</b> partial proteins.

5|$|Any initial <b>two</b> {{disjoint}} given circles can {{be rendered}} concentric as follows. The radical {{axis of the}} <b>two</b> given circles is constructed; choosing <b>two</b> arbitrary points P and Q on this radical axis, <b>two</b> circles can be constructed that are centered on P and Q and that intersect the <b>two</b> given circles orthogonally. These <b>two</b> constructed circles intersect each other in <b>two</b> points. Inversion in one such intersection point F renders the constructed circles into straight lines emanating from F and the <b>two</b> given circles into concentric circles, with the third given circle becoming another circle (in general). This follows because the system of circles is equivalent {{to a set of}} Apollonian circles, forming a bipolar coordinate system.|$|E

2500|$|The term <b>two's</b> {{complement}} {{can mean}} either a number format or a mathematical operator. For example, 0111 represents decimal 7 in two's-complement notation, but the <b>two's</b> complement of 7 in a 4-bit register {{is actually the}} [...] "1001" [...] bit string (the same as represents [...] in unsigned arithmetics) which is the <b>two's</b> complement representation of −7. The statement [...] "convert [...] to <b>two's</b> complement" [...] may be ambiguous, since it could describe either the process of representing [...] in two's-complement notation without changing its value, or the calculation of the <b>two's</b> complement, which is the arithmetic negative of [...] if <b>two's</b> complement representation is used.|$|R

5000|$|In some places, owning 4 <b>Twos</b> {{is also a}} {{condition}} for Immediate Win. Some play Immediate Win rule in three-player game too. There are more cards involved, the chance of occurring and points transfer is therefore very high. On the contrary, some variations said that it's an automatic draw when 1 player has all 4 <b>twos,</b> as having all 4 <b>twos</b> gives the player amazing amount of power.

50|$|<b>Two's</b> {{complement}} is {{the easiest}} to implement in hardware, {{which may be the}} ultimate reason for its widespread popularity. Processors on the early mainframes often consisted of thousands of transistorseliminating a significant number of transistors was a significant cost savings. Mainframes such as the IBM System/360, the GE-600 series, and the PDP-6 and PDP-10 use <b>two's</b> complement, as did minicomputers such as the PDP-5 and PDP-8 and the PDP-11 and VAX. The architects of the early integrated circuit-based CPUs (Intel 8080, etc.) chose to use <b>two's</b> complement math. As IC technology advanced, virtually all adopted <b>two's</b> complement technology. x86, m68k, Power Architecture, MIPS, SPARC, ARM, Itanium, PA-RISC, and DEC Alpha processors are all <b>two's</b> complement.|$|R

5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{analysis}} the music scholar Jane Glover has divided Monteverdi's list of instruments into three main groups: strings, brass and continuo, with a few further items not easily classifiable. The strings grouping is formed from ten members of the violin family (viole da brazzo), <b>two</b> double basses (contrabassi de viola), and <b>two</b> small violins (violini piccoli alla francese). The viole da brazzo are in <b>two</b> five-part ensembles, each comprising <b>two</b> violins, <b>two</b> violas and a cello. The brass group contains four or five trombones (sackbuts), three trumpets and <b>two</b> cornetts. The continuo forces include <b>two</b> harpsichords (duoi gravicembani), a double harp (arpa doppia), <b>two</b> or three chitarroni, <b>two</b> pipe organs (organi di legno), three bass viola da gamba, and a regal or small reed organ. Outside of these groupings are <b>two</b> recorders (flautini alla vigesima secunda), and possibly one or more citterns—unlisted by Monteverdi, but included in instructions relating {{to the end of}} act 4.|$|E

5000|$|Number <b>Twos</b> often vary in personality, {{methods and}} aims.

Most Number <b>Twos</b> are congenial and polite, but some are sadistic or simply brusque and rude. The schemes of the various Number <b>Twos</b> range from deception, intimidation, and elaborate role-play to the use of drugs and outright mind control. Number <b>Twos</b> are often seen reporting by telephone to an unseen higher authority, presumably Number One, who has the power to remove them; some Number <b>Twos</b> live in terror of their superiors, while others appear to have good or even personal relationships with them.|$|R
