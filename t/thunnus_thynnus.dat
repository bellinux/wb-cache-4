50|$|The Atlantic {{bluefin tuna}} (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>thynnus)</b> is {{a species of}} tuna in the family Scombridae. It is {{variously}} known as the northern bluefin tuna (mainly when including Pacific bluefin as a subspecies), giant bluefin tuna (for individuals exceeding 150 kg) and formerly as the tunny.|$|E
50|$|S. ficus {{does not}} have many predators. This may be because it has an {{unpleasant}} odour or because the spicules make it unpalatable. It is eaten however by some marine gastropods and some nudibranchs. It forms part of the diet of the Atlantic bluefin tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>thynnus).</b>|$|E
5000|$|It is {{commonly}} known as the longtail tuna or northern bluefin tuna. The usage of the latter name, mainly in Australia to distinguish it from the southern bluefin tuna, leads to easy confusion with <b>Thunnus</b> <b>thynnus</b> of the Atlantic and Thunnus orientalis of the North Pacific. Compared to these [...] "true" [...] bluefins, Thunnus tonggol is more slender and has shorter pectoral fins.|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{quantities}} of high-grade tuna are reared in net pens and fed bait fish. In Australia, former fishermen raise southern bluefin tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, and another bluefin species. Farming its close relative, the Atlantic bluefin tuna, <b>Thunnus</b> <b>thynnus,</b> is {{beginning in the}} Mediterranean, North America and Japan. Hawaii approved permits for the first U.S. offshore farming of bigeye tuna in water 1300 ft deep in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Tuna and {{tuna-like fishes}} are highly migratory, and stocks cross {{numerous}} international boundaries. ICCAT {{is involved in}} management of 30 species, including the Atlantic bluefin (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>thynnus</b> thynnus), yellowfin (T. albacares), albacore (T. alalunga) and bigeye tuna (T. obesus); from the billfishes, swordfish (Xiphias gladius), white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), sailfish (Istiophorus albicans); mackerels such as spotted Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) and king mackerel (S. cavalla); and, small tunas like skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis).|$|E
5000|$|Fried fish—pescaíto frito—and seafood {{are common}} {{on the coast}} and also eaten well into the {{interior}} under coastal influence. Atlantic bluefin tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>thynnus)</b> from the Almadraba areas of the Gulf of Cádiz, prawns from Sanlúcar de Barrameda (known as langostino de Sanlúcar), and deepwater rose shrimp (...) from Huelva are all highly prized. Fishing for the transparent goby or chanquete (Aphia minuta), a once-popular small fish from Málaga, is now banned because the techniques used to catch them trap too many immature fish of other species.|$|E
5000|$|Big-game tunny fishing off Scarborough was a sport practised by wealthy aristocrats and {{military}} officers {{mostly in the}} 1930s. The British Tunny Club was founded in Scarborough in 1933 and had its headquarters there. The Atlantic bluefin tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>Thynnus)</b> (or [...] "tunny" [...] as it was known in Britain at the time) is a large and powerful fish, arguably the strongest fish in the world, which is frequently the target of big-game fishermen. Off the Yorkshire coast in that era various records were made (including a world record) for size of tunny caught with rod and line. Tunny was present in the North Sea until the 1950s when commercial herring and mackerel fishing depleted its food supply and it became extirpated.|$|E

50|$|The Strait of Messina is an {{important}} migratory route of the Mediterranean Sea. The best known and important, from an economic point of view, are the great pelagic fish - that is the Tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>thynnus),</b> the Albacore (Thunnus alalunga), the Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda), the Mediterranean Spearfish (Tetrapturus belone) and the Swordfish (Xiphias gladius). The fish of the Strait are captured with boats called feluche or small engine powered fishing boats called passerelle. These pelagic fish are assets unique {{to this part of}} the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, only in the Strait, using various techniques, it is possible to capture Tuna throughout the year and in all age classes (from juveniles to adults) as the population moves between the Tyrrhenian and the Ionian Seas. The Strait of Messina is also an established route for the migration of Cetacea, and it is probably the most important in the Mediterranean Sea in terms of whale species diversity. Worthy of note, besides the several species of Dolphins are the Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus) and particularly the Sperm Whales which migrate to the Strait to their breeding area, probably the Aeolian Islands. Sharks also migrate through the Strait of Messina, including the Great White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (Hexanchus griseus).|$|E
50|$|In June 2009, Kriton Arsenis {{became a}} Member of the European Parliament in the S&D. He was {{recruited}} to the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), by George A. Papandreou, the ex {{prime minister of}} Greece, after receiving the European Grand Prize for the “Sustainable Aegean” campaign. In May 2013 he resigned from PASOK expressing his strong opposition to water privatisation. He was a Member of the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Fisheries. He was also a substitute Member of the Committee on Development.He was active in issues related to biodiversity and the fight against climate change. He was also instrumental in the European Union Timber Regulation. Likewise, {{he has been in}} the front line in the battle to save the bluefin tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>thynnus)</b> in the Mediterranean. He led the Parliament in adopting the EU legislation on monitoring emissions from Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). On fisheries he introduced the policy of fish stock recovery areas - no take zones which was incorporated into the EU Common Fisheries Policy. He also led the EP in the vote that ended derogation from the implementation of EU legislation on Shark Finning. He drafted and led proposals that were successfully approved by the European Parliament asking for an EU cetacean protection legislation and a ban on bottom trawling of deep sea species in the Atlantic.On biodiversity his amendments led to the rejection of the proposed EU legislation on banning the use of traditional seeds in agriculture and tabled the amendment that successfully ended the derogation from implementation of the EU environmental assessment legislation.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{foods are}} {{swallowed}} whole, including most fish and even other gulls. When foods are {{too large to}} be swallowed at once, they will sometimes be shaken in the bill until they fall apart into pieces. Like some other gulls, when capturing molluscs or other hard-surfaced foods such as eggs, they will fly into the air with it and drop it on rocks or hard earth to crack it open. Alternate foods, including berries and insects, are eaten when available. They will readily exploit easy food sources, including chum lines made by boats at sea. They are skilled kleptoparasites who will readily pirate fish and other prey captured by other birds and dominate over other gulls when they encounter them. At tern colonies in coastal Maine, American herring gulls (L. smithsonianus) occasionally also attack nestling and fledging terns but in a great majority of cases were immediately pirated of their catch by great black-backs. In one observation, an adult great black-back was seen to rob a female peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) of a freshly caught gadwall (Anas strepera). In another case, a third-year great black-back was observed fighting an adult female northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) off its kill, although the goshawk attempted to strike the gull before leaving. Due to their method of using intimidation while encountering other water and raptorial birds, the species {{has been referred to}} as a [...] "merciless tyrant". Naturally, these gulls are attracted to the surface activity of large marine animals, from Atlantic bluefin tuna (<b>Thunnus</b> <b>thynnus)</b> to humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), to capture fish driven to the surface by such creatures.|$|E
50|$|On the {{initiative}} of its President, Prince Albert II, the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation and the WWF set up a partnership in January 2008 to take action {{with a view to}} saving the bluefin tuna from ecological extinction.Since 2008, a large number of restaurant owners in the Principality of Monaco have responded to the appeal jointly launched by the Prince Albert II Foundation and the MC2D association to stop serving bluefin tuna, and thus raise awareness of the need to save this symbolic species of the Mediterranean, while there is still time. Consequently, a moratorium has been implemented in cooperation with food retailers and professionals and Monaco has become the first “bluefin tuna free” country. Since then, many other countries have followed suit.Monaco’s government departments, supported by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, subsequently initiated a procedure to add the bluefin tuna to Appendix I of CITES (Convention on the international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora).For many months, the listing, which would have resulted in the ban on international trade of this fish, has been the topic of debate in several countries.On 3 March 2010 during the Doha Conference, the Obama administration announced that it was in favor of adding the bluefin tuna to appendix I of CITES. The European Union officially endorsed this decision on 10 March by announcing that it would vote in favor of this listing.Despite such support, the Doha Conference rejected Monaco's proposal on 18 March. Japan, the main consumer of <b>thunnus</b> <b>thynnus,</b> in addition to the developing countries, was strongly opposed to the ban.However, {{this is the first time}} that a debate on the preservation of an endangered species has made the headlines of the international press.|$|E
