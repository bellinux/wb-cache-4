40|$|This study {{examined}} students' views of collaboration and learning, and investigated how these predict students' online {{participation in a}} computer-supported learning environment. The participants were 521 secondary school students in Hong Kong, {{who took part in}} online collaborative inquiry conducted using Knowledge Forum™. We developed a questionnaire to assess the students' views of their collaboration aligned with the knowledge-building perspective. We also administered the Learning Process Questionnaire to examine their preferred approaches to learning. The students' online participation in Knowledge Forum was examined using the Analytic <b>Toolkit</b> <b>software.</b> Analyses indicated that students who viewed their collaboration as more aligned with collaborative knowledge building were more likely to employ a deep approach to learning. A structural equation model indicated that the students' views of collaboration exerted a direct effect on online participation in Knowledge Forum and mediated the effects of deep approaches on forum participation. Implications of examining students' views of collaboration for productive online participation are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Introduction At SRI we have {{explored}} several VR toolkits, and written our own, {{in order to}} create VR applications for training of airplane marshaling, building walkthroughs, visualization of 3 D cell data, and interactive world modeling. Initially, we used Body Electric, VPL's visual programming language for VR, to create the marshaling trainer and walkthrough. We still use this visual programming language to prototype new ideas because, as with any interpreted language, it is easy to try out new algorithms quickly and see their effect immediately. It is, however, difficult to refine and polish the applications. Because of several of Body Electric's limitations (reliance on the relatively slow Macintosh, the inability to use databases not in its own format, and the inability to change the actual geometry of the databases), for our cell visualization we decided to use different VR <b>toolkit</b> <b>software.</b> At first we worked on writing our own called VESYS, which got far enough along to...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{a series of}} tests carried out on our hybrid HMM/ANN systems which aims at {{combining}} Neural Networks theory and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for speech recognition of a continuous speech French database: BREF- 80. As this database is not manually labelled, we describe a new method based on the temporal alignment of the speech signal on a high quality synthetic speech pattern to generate a first segmentation in order to bootstrap the training procedure. A phone recognition experiment with our baseline system achieved a phone accuracy of about 63 % which is, to our knowledge, the best result reported in the litterature. Preliminary experiments on continuous speech recognition have set a baseline performance for our hybrid HMM/ANN system on BREF using 1 K, 3 K and 13 K word lexicons.
