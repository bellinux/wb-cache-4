500|$|Cresswell drew {{praise from}} manager Billy Davies during 2004–05, [...] "Richard is very capable {{of that and}} it is {{important}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> creating chances for Cressy as we know that he will put the ball {{in the back of the}} net", although he admitted the team were over reliant on Cresswell's goals. He enjoyed his best goal return in 2004–05, top scoring for Preston with 21 goals in 52 appearances. This helped Preston reach the 2005 Championship play-off Final, where they were beaten 1–0 by West Ham United at the Millennium Stadium. Cresswell played poorly in the first half, but had a number of chances on goal during the second half.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only one thing I really feel that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E

500|$|As Netflix {{does not}} reveal {{subscriber}} viewership numbers {{for any of}} their original series, Symphony Technology Group compiled data for the season based on a sample size of 15,000 people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, from September to December 2015, episodes of Jessica Jones averaged 4.8 million viewers during a 35-day viewing cycle. The data was presented by Alan Wurtzel, NBCUniversal president of research and media development, in a presentation aimed to provide [...] "perspective" [...] when stating [...] "digital platforms are hurting the traditional TV business". Netflix CCO Ted Sarandos responded to the data by saying that [...] "the whole methodology and the measurement and the data itself doesn’t reflect any sense of reality of anything <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>keep</b> track of." [...] A further study from Symphony, for the same time period, found Jessica Jones {{to be one of}} the four most watched series in the 18 to 24 demographic, ahead of any broadcast network series. The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the fifth-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 26% of the viewers that the second season of Daredevil received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. Jumpshot, which [...] "analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company’s U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.|$|E
